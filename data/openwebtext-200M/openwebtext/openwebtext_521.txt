Plush toys are wonderful things .
They 're like pets that you do n't have to feed or clean up after , and that you can play catch with without fearing injury to them or yourself .
If you 're a parent , the odds are pretty good your kid(s ) have quite a few of them .
The only problem is that , for GeekParents , the selection of plush toys at most stores is pretty mundane .
There 's only so many stuffed bears , dogs , horses , and such that a geek can take .
Things have improved a bit in the past couple of years with the advent of Webkinz and other web - enabled toys , which are at least mildly geeky , and Uglydolls , which are definitely geekier than your average doll but not quite enough for me , at least .
So , as a service to geeks everywhere , here is a list of the geekiest plush toys available online .
Buy them for your kids , buy them for yourselves , or put them on your winter holiday wish lists for your less geeky relatives to buy for you .
If you know of any I missed , please leave a comment .
1. Cthulhu - H.P. Lovecraft 's Great Old Ones have never been cuddlier .
There are so many plush Cthulhus out now it 's hard to pick just one :
There 's a screaming one , a blue velvet one , a superhero version ( ! ) , a wall trophy , and lots more .
These may not be the best gifts for kids , unless they 're in on the joke , since they are a bit scary ( well , as scary as a plush toy can be ) on their own .
_ _2 . The Vorpal Bunny ( or , the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog ) __-
This one truly holds the possibility of frightening small children , as it looks like a perfectly ordinary stuffed bunny ... until you open its mouth .
If you 've ever seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( and , if you have n't , why on earth have n't you ? ) , you know the scene , and further explanation would be unnecessary .
I will mention , though , that if that version is n't frightening enough for you , there is a version with fake bloodstains all over it .
3. Microbes -
You may have already seen the Giant Plush Microbes , but they 're too cool not to mention .
They are very clever , with shapes derived from the actual shapes of the microbes they represent , and humorously - chosen color schemes ( for instance , I love that the Mad Cow Disease ones are white with black spots ) .
How else could you give someone Herpes and have them think it 's funny ?
4. Internal Human Organs -
There 's something a bit creepy about a gall bladder with a face on it , but the I Heart Guts toys are definitely weird enough to earn a place in any geek 's cubicle .
They'd be perfect for a friend who 's in medical school , or for a kid who 's learning anatomy .
And imagine the fun of saying " Go upstairs to bed , sweetie , and do n't forget your pancreas ! "
5. Subatomic Particles -
Want to teach your kids a bit about nuclear physics ?
Want to explain what the CERN scientists are looking for with the Large Hadron Collider ?
The plush toys from Particle Zoo probably wo n't help much , but they 're still a lot of fun .
I think the quarks are a bit ordinary , but the force carriers and theoreticals ( especially the tachyon ) more than make up for them .
They ( obviously ) do n't look like their real counterparts , but they are weighted according to their counterparts ' mass , so that 's a decent dose of reality .
( More after the jump . )
6. Godzilla -
We have it on good authority that , so long as you do n't have a plush Tokyo in your house , this plush Godzilla is perfectly safe to own .
There 's even a Space Godzilla and a Rodan , as well as quite a few others in the genre .
7. Fuzzy d20s -
What could possibly better advertise your geekiness than hanging a pair of fuzzy d20s from your rear - view mirror ?
Well , OK , you could wear an Imperial
Stormtrooper helmet everywhere you go , but it would be awfully hard to drive like that ( I imagine ) .
8. The Harry Potter Monster Book of Monsters
- Any kid or grownup ( in age if not in spirit ) who likes the third
Harry Potter movie will love this .
Anyone who does n't will probably think it 's pretty funny , anyway .
My kids have n't seen the movie yet
( they 're not quite old enough ) , but I can imagine them running around the house pretending to make the book bite one - another .
9. Star Wars
- OK , the Yoda one is just odd - looking .
But the Chewbacca and Vader ones are cool , and just the idea of a Darth Vader plush toy is so awesomely bizarre it has to be included .
Awww , what a cuddly little dark lord of the Sith !
10 . Gollum / Smeagol - Quite possibly the ugliest plush dolls ever made , which , considering this list starts with Cthulhu , is an accomplishment .
These dolls also talk , which makes them nearly twice as geeky .
These would make an excellent test for geekiness in others :
Put one in your house and show it to people –if they say " Cool ! " they 're geeks ; if they recoil in terror , they 're not .

SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) -- Lesbian activist Del Martin , at the forefront of the battle for same - sex marriage in California , died Wednesday in San Francisco .
She was 87 .
Martin's partner of 55 years , Phyllis Lyon , was by her side at the UCSF hospice , the National Center for Lesbian Rights said .
Martin and Lyon , 84 , tied the knot June 16 in a ceremony officiated by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
" Ever since I met Del 55 years ago , I could never imagine a day would come when she would n't be by my side .
I am so lucky to have known her , loved her and been her partner in all things , " Lyon said .
" I also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married .
" I am devastated , but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed . "
Long before Massachusetts and then California legalized same - sex marriage , Lyon and Martin were integral parts of the early movement for lesbian and gay rights .
They met in 1950 in Seattle , Washington , where they worked as editors of construction trade publications .
They fell in love , moving in together on Valentine 's Day 1953 .
Martin fought to have the American Psychological Society declare that homosexuality is not a mental illnesses and advocated on behalf of battered women .

In 1955 , the couple founded the nation 's first lesbian organization , the Daughters of Bilitis , and launched the first lesbian publication , The Ladder .
In the 1960s , they tried to get California lawmakers to introduce anti-discrimination bills and persuaded some police officers to stop harassing gays and lesbians at bars as part of a group Martin co-founded called the Council on Religion and the Homosexual .
Martin was also a founding member of several other organizations , including the Lesbian Mother 's Union , the San Francisco Women 's Centers and the Bay Area Women 's Coalition .
She and Lyon were co-founders of the first gay political group in the United States , the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club , named for author Gertrude Stein 's long - time partner .
After she and Lyon were the first lesbians to join the National Organization for Women with the couples ' membership rate , Martin was the first open lesbian to be elected to NOW 's board of directors .
From that spot , she was instrumental in guiding the organization to pass a resolution recognizing lesbian issues as feminist issues .
Martin and Lyon were delegates to the White House Conference on Aging in 1991 , named to it by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Nancy Pelosi , both of California .
Kate Kendell , executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , called Martin " a real hero . "
" For all of Del 's life , she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant , " Kendell said .
" Her last act of public activism was her most personal : marrying the love of her life after 55 years .
" In the wake of losing her , we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same - sex couples , thereby providing the dignity and respect that Del and Phyllis ' love deserved . "
In 2003 , lesbian filmmaker Joan E. Biren released " No Secret Anymore : The Times of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon , " a 57 - minute documentary focusing on the couple 's activism and relationship .
That year , the couple spoke to The Noe Valley Voice , a newspaper covering their San Francisco neighborhood , about the film and their drive to advance the rights of lesbians .
" We wanted our full rights and responsibilities , " Martin told the Voice .
Lyon said she and Martin had no particular secret on how to keep a relationship going for decades .
" If we had a secret , we would have written a book and made a million dollars , " Lyon told the Voice .
" We love each other ; we have similar interests .
Our lives were very similar even before we met . "
In 2004 , San Francisco officials allowed gay couples in the city to wed , prompting a flood of applicants to the City Hall clerk 's office .
The officials chose Lyon , then 80 , and Martin , then 83 , to take the first vows .
The state Supreme Court voided those unions .
Lyon and Martin , however , joined more than 20 other couples as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the state 's marriage laws .
On My 15 , the California Supreme Court struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , paving the way for Lyon and Martin and other same - sex couples to marry in the state .
A standing - room only crowd at San Francisco 's City Hall on June 16 saw Lyon and Martin , in a wheelchair , take their vows .
" This is an extraordinary moment in history , " Newsom said .
" I think today , marriage as an institution has been strengthened . "
Del Martin identified her own legacy in 1984 when she said that her most important contribution was " being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men . "
In addition to Lyon , Martin is survived by daughter Kendra Mon , son - in - law Eugene Lane , granddaughter Lorraine Mon , grandson Kevin Mon and sister - in - law Patricia Lyon .

The vaccine against human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer , will be most cost - effective in the U.S. with universal vaccination of 12 - year - old girls and catch - up efforts to vaccinate girls and women ages 13 to 21 , say Harvard researchers .
" We really should be targeting and prioritizing the younger girls , 12 - year - olds , prior to sexual activity , " says Jane J. Kim , PhD , assistant professor of health decision science at the Harvard School of Public Health and lead author of the study .
That , coupled with a temporary catch - up program to vaccinate girls and women ages 13 to 21 , could make it possible to revise current cervical cancer screening so that women could begin screening somewhat later and undergo it a bit less frequently , she tells WebMD .
But an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine , raises questions about the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing cervical cancer .
The study , also published in the New England Journal of Medicine , is one of many investigations undertaken by Kim and her colleagues over the years on prevention of cervical cancer , which struck more than 11,000 women in the U.S. in 2007 and killed 3,600 .
Her report is meant to evaluate cost - effectiveness and guide public health policy .
" We used mathematical models to simulate the natural history of the disease , " Kim says , " then superimposed these strategies , whether they be screening , HPV vaccine , or a combination of both . "
After FDA approved the HPV vaccine Gardasil in 2006 , the CDC recommended routine vaccination of girls ages 11 - 12 and catch - up vaccination of girls and women ages 13 to 26 .
The newspapers are so profoundly overrun with pseudoscience about food that there 's no point in documenting it any longer .
They will continue with their Sisyphean task of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or cure cancer , and I will sit at the sidelines , making that joke over and over again .
This week , however , the Telegraph , which has lost its science editor and its science correspondent in two months , deserves special attention , because two of its food stories went beyond stupid , and managed to give actively harmful information .
We 'll start off with " Red wine could help prevent breast cancer " .
In fact it 's even better than that .
" Laboratory tests have shown that a chemical found in the skin of grapes could halt the development of most cases of the disease . "
The story follows a standard template which they clearly now teach as valid in all journalism schools : a food contains a chemical , the chemical does something in a dish on a lab bench , therefore the food kills cancer in people .
Or rather , red wine contains resveratrol : this chemical has been found to increase the activity of an enzyme called quinone reductase , which converts a derivative of oestrogen back to oestrogen , and that derivative can damage DNA , and damaging DNA causes mutations , and mutations cause cancer , so therefore , in the world of journalists , red wine prevents breast cancer in people .
This is a phenomena we might call " data mist " : where someone gets one piece of research information lodged in their imagination and suddenly , for them , it explains the entirety of medicine .
Back in the real world there is the wine , and a whole human body .
Red wine has a lot of stuff in it , including alcohol which , notably , is broken down into a chemical called acetaldehyde , and that itself causes DNA damage .
Is there reason to think this might cause cancer , or would I be over - extrapolating myself ?
Well .
A huge number of observational studies have now been performed in real living humans , finding that people who drink more have more breast cancer .
They have included careful analyses , in which they try to account perhaps imperfectly for other possible explanations for this relationship .
These studies have even been collected together in a systematic review , and a meta - analysis , where all the figures are run onto one big spreadsheet , and they estimate that overall , half a glass of red wine a day increases your risk of breast cancer by 10 % .
If their figures are correct , alcohol causes about 6 % of all breast cancer in the UK , meaning 2,500 cases a year .
So red wine , despite whatever it says on that press release you are holding in your hand , Kate Devlin , medical correspondent , does not prevent breast cancer .
Meanwhile they had " nutritional therapist Julia Fitzgerald " cheerfully informing Telegraph readers that " during the first four weeks of pregnancy taking a folic acid supplement ( 400 micrograms per day ) can help prevent neural tube defects in the foetus such as spina bifida " .
You will remember that " nutritional therapist " is a term we can all legally use to describe ourselves , alongside " dilettante " " handsome " and " clown " .
Perhaps Fitzgerald 's training in the field of " nutritional therapy " might have caused some confusion here , since folic acid for pregnant mothers is a rarity in their domain , being an intervention with an evidence base .
Sadly for Fitzgerald the evidence is not in her favour .
And as all of the random women in their 30s I have asked today already knew , both Department of Health and NHS guidelines are identical , recommending very clearly that potential mothers should take a 400 - microgram supplement from the time that they start trying for a baby , or from when contraception is stopped , up to and including the 12th week of pregnancy .
Perhaps Fitzgerald knows better .
Perhaps she can also tell you the day you get fertilised .
Perhaps this is the first time a nutritional therapist has ever recommended too few pills .
And perhaps she will want to clarify her advice to 800,000 readers and their families which will increase their risk of delivering a baby with severe and disabling neural tube defects .
I will now go back to ignoring the nutritionists .

ROME ( Reuters Life ! ) - A Roman zoo is feeding its animals a daily treat of frozen fruits to help them cope with the hottest early summer temperatures in 20 years .
Zoo -keepers throw solid blocks of frozen kiwi fruit , melon , grapefruit and apples -- prepared by children taking part in a summer school at the Bioparco zoo -- into the animals ’ enclosures .
For hungrier animals like the Balkan brown bear , a main course of frozen fish follows .
Zoo-keepers told Reuters at feeding time on Monday that iced food not only cools the animals down , but forces some mammals to eat more slowly , aiding digestion .
The zoo said there was no health risk in feeding frozen food to animals .
It ’s just one of the measures taken to help animals like the Japanese snow monkeys , accustomed to temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees Celsius , to adapt to the Mediterranean climate .
Completely redesigned in 1998 , the Bioparco also ensures animals are provided with pools , enclosures , sprinklers and plenty of shade to keep them cool in the summer .
Italy ’s capital has experienced daily temperatures hovering around the mid-thirties Celsius for the past two weeks , the highest late June temperatures for nearly 20 years .
Obama wants to raise deposit insurance
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) on Tuesday proposed that the revivied bailout plan include an increase in federal insurance on deposits from the current $ 100,000 to a beefed - up $ 250,000 .
Obama calls it " a step that would boost small businesses , make our banking system more secure , and help restore public confidence in our financial system .

Here is the text of his statement :
Statement of Senator Obama on Moving Financial Legislation Forward
“ Yesterday , within the course of a few hours , the failure to pass the economic rescue plan in Washington led to the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades . "
“ While I , like others , am outraged that the reign of irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has created the current crisis , I also know that continued inaction in the face of the gathering storm in our financial markets would be catastrophic for our economy and our families . "
“ At this moment , when the jobs , retirement savings , and economic security of all Americans hang in the balance , it is imperative that all of us – Democrats and Republicans alike – come together to meet this crisis . "
“ The bill rejected yesterday was a marked improvement over the original blank check proposed by the Bush Administration .
It included restraints on CEO pay , protections for homeowners , strict oversight as to how the money is spent , and an assurance that taxpayers will recover their money once the economy recovers .
Given the progress we have made , I believe we are unlikely to succeed if we start from scratch or reopen negotiations about the core elements of the agreement .
But in order to pass this plan , we must do more . "
“ One step we could take to potentially broaden support for the legislation and shore up our economy would be to expand federal deposit insurance for families and small businesses across America who have invested their money in our banks . "
“ The majority of American families should rest assured that the deposits they have in our banks are safe .
Thanks to measures put in place during the Great Depression , deposits of up to $ 100,000 are guaranteed by the federal government . "
“ While that guarantee is more than adequate for most families , it is insufficient for many small businesses that maintain bank accounts to meet their payroll , buy their supplies , and invest in expanding and creating jobs .
The current insurance limit of $ 100,000 was set 28 years ago and has not been adjusted for inflation . "
“ That is why today , I am proposing that we also raise the FDIC limit to $ 250,000 as part of the economic rescue package – a step that would boost small businesses , make our banking system more secure , and help restore public confidence in our financial system . "
“ I will be talking to leaders and members of Congress later today to offer this idea and urge them to act without delay to pass a rescue plan , ” said Barack Obama .
EVEN when they tiptoe discreetly through the undergrowth , nature lovers and ecotourists may be having an unexpectedly damaging impact on wildlife .
A study of protected Californian forest has shown that hiking , wildlife - watching and similar low - impact activities are linked to a sharp drop in numbers of carnivores such as bobcats and coyotes .
" We saw dramatic , fivefold reductions in the native species , " says Adina Merenlender of the University of California , Berkeley , who ran the study with Sarah Reed of the San Francisco - based Wilderness Society .
Ecotourism is big business .
In 2004 , it grew three times as fast as the tourist industry as a whole .
One in five tourists now go on eco-holidays .
It has been shown to have an impact on a range of species , from dolphins and dingoes to penguins and polar bears ( New Scientist , 6 March 2004 , p 6 ) .
The dilemma is that revenue from ecotourism provides one of the best incentives for local communities to protect endangered animals instead of hunting them .
Philip Seddon , a wildlife management specialist at the University of Otago in Dunedin , New Zealand , says the finding that such apparently harmless activities may alter the make - up of wildlife communities challenges the main concept of ecotourism - that it minimises impacts and maximises benefits .
Reserve managers may in future have to make more areas off - limits to tourists .
Merenlender and Reed focused their study on 14 protected zones of oak woodland in northern California .
At each site they collected faeces left by the target species along a series of 500 - metre sampling paths .
They then compared the quantity found in areas out of bounds to humans with that found along sampling paths in similar " paired " areas nearby where access was allowed .
When people were banned from an area , native species such as bobcats , coyotes and grey foxes thrived and were typically five times as abundant as in more heavily trafficked areas .
Likewise , faeces of domestic animals , particularly dogs , were only found in the areas visited by humans .
It is well known that human activity can alarm animals , but Merenlender says this is the first time a consistent effect has been demonstrated across entire communities .
" We see it over the whole park , not just a single trail . "
This should not , however , be taken to mean that low - key ecotourism is always harmful , says David Sheppard , head of the programme on protected areas run by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
" It 's hard to make generalisations .
It can depend heavily on species , as some are more affected by recreation than others . "
Large predators might be unusually sensitive to human activity because people hunt them .
" These animals have high intelligence , and those that are cautious survive , " says Paul Eagles , who studies ecotourism at the University of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada , and chairs the tourism task force of the IUCN 's World Commission on Protected Areas .
Even animals that habitually follow trails used by humans are adept at keeping out of sight when people pass .
Merenlender , however , points out that her sampling paths cut across trails and non-trail areas , so the differences could n't be dismissed as animals temporarily ducking out of sight .
" We looked on and off - trail , and found low abundance off - trail too in accessible areas . "
The team , who report their findings in Conservation Letters ( DOI : 10.1111/j.17550263X.2008.00019.x ) , suggest several strategies for reconciling the needs of wildlife and people .
One is to ensure that visitors stick to prescribed trails and do not penetrate deep into protected habitat .
Others include introducing permit systems and restricting access to certain times of the year .
" We 're not in any way advocating that people stop seeing nature , " Merenlender says .
" But we 're trying to heighten the awareness of site managers to these unexpected impacts on wildlife . "
Seddon agrees that the study 's results deserve to be taken seriously .
" We 're faced with decisions about how best to manipulate protected areas , " he says .
" Perhaps we need areas set aside from virtually all human use . "

Some Background
Two - thirds of U.S. corporations paid no federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005 , according to a new report from Congress .
The study by the Government Accountability Office , expected to be released Tuesday , said about 68 percent of foreign companies doing business in the U.S. avoided corporate taxes over the same period .
Collectively , the companies reported trillions of dollars in sales , according to GAO 's estimate .
Er ... wait , was it " modest " or " obviously brilliant " ?
Regardless , I have an idea , everyone !
Stand back , place safety goggles over your eyes , make sure the lead - lined X - ray bib is securely fastened to your chest and that your boots tied up tight .
Now , I may be an old - fashioned ( young ) guy , but I believe that fair is fair .
And our tax code , ladies and gentlemen , is not fair .
What a sweet deal for them !
They get to operate without having a huge tax burden weighing down on them , freeing them to make more investments and take more risks .
Of course , they have a shitload of capital , credit and resources to begin with .
But this is America , goddammit !
We do n't make corporations pay taxes no matter how much they fuck up the environment or make insane profits on the backs of their low - income workers .
But -- and I 'm getting to my ridiculously cool proposal -- I can't help but think that it's not especially fair that multi-billion dollar companies do n't have to pay any taxes ( ZERO fucking taxes ) whereas , I , as a Regular Joe , have to pay about 30 % of my income in taxes every year .
Perhaps I am just a whiner , not fit to lick the boots of a mighty multinational like Wal*mart .
I know , I know .
This is America .
Corporations have more rights and resources than regular citizens .
Yeah , " The Constitution guarantees ... " blah blah blah ...
Obviously the Constitution do n't mean shit .
Money talks and the Constitution was written on hemp paper by a bunch of proto - hippy revolutionaries who wore funny clothes and probably squealed like girls when tickled .
This is America , goddammit !
We drive hummers and invade countries full of smelly brown people who are all determined to kill us ( our Media assures us this ; it must be true ! ) or even just because they looked at us funny .
We do n't have time for " rules " or " equality " or what 's it called .. uh .... libraries ? .. no ... uh , -- " Liberty ! " Yeah , that 's it .
But what I want is not to return our country to the whole Constitution thing .
I 'm not that naive .
However , I do think it would be freakin ' neat if we lived in a country where lawful citizens were counted as 3/5 ths of a corporation .
Currently , we 're about a zillionth of a corporation , so 3/5 ths would be a vast improvement .
My Blindingly - Awesome Proposal
U.S. citizens , when paying their taxes , should be able to write off " overhead " .
Only our " profits " should be taxed .
That means , no taxes should be administered until after the essentials of running a healthy body / mind have been accounted for .
What are the essentials ?
Food , water , shelter and clothing are a good start ( no , a big screen TV is not an " essential " ) .
That means I should be able to deduct all of the money I spend on food , rent / mortgage and clothes ( within reason ) before any other deductions .
A healthy mind is important , too , so education costs , books and maybe even an internet connection should also be deductable .
Also , I have to have certain things in order to do my job -- or even get to it -- like a functioning car , gas , a bunch of hygienic equipment to look / smell nice , a cell phone and a computer .
That 's all overhead ; my paycheck is not " profit . "
It 's revenue .
I have to spend a big chunk of it just to stay alive and another chunk to fit into the corporate world .
These are expenses and they are subtracted from revenue before you end up with profits -- if you have any .
As you probably know , only corporate profits are taxable .
Most overhead costs ( the costs of running a business ) are exempt .
Wikipedia lists examples of overhead expenses as follows :
Overhead expenses include accounting fees , advertising , depreciation , indirect labor , insurance , interest , legal fees , rent , repairs , supplies , taxes , telephone bills , travel and utilities costs .
So I should be able to deduct my high - paid accountants as well .
Then I can make sure , like most corporations , that I pay no income tax .
Alternately , we could just leave gaping loopholes in the tax code so normal people do n't have to hire expensive accountants ( and then deduct the costs of their services ) .
Something like , " if you do n't feel like paying any income tax this year , check this box . "
So you see , my super - cool proposal just brings Joe Sixpack into the same league as the corporations , who already have incredible advantages in the economy because of their size and reach .
Corporate Welfare is Only for Wealthy Corporations
Small businesses generally take it up the rear as well since they can't afford all those slippery accountants .
Or maybe those small businesses just need to take a page from the criminals on Wall Street and learn how to privatize profits while socializing losses .
It does n't seem fair to me that the average guy / gal has to assume the vast majority of the tax burden when most of are making jack diddly squat compared to a major multinational .
Fair is fair .
Progressive income taxation is based on the idea that the rich should pay a greater portion of their income because they can afford it and because they owe it to society ; especially since the rich people / corporations take advantage of the situation and pay their workers a pitance while making them work long hours in often - dangerous conditions .
Meanwhile , the CEO gets his taxes paid for by the corporation via what is known as a " gross -up " .
Think it 's unfair of me to use the corporate tax code instead of the individual one ?
Well , like I said , fair is fair .
Corporations are increasingly using the individual tax code :
An outside tax expert , Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington , said increasing numbers of limited liability corporations and so - called " S " corporations pay taxes under individual tax codes .
" Half of all business income in the United States now ends up going through the individual tax code , " Edwards said .
Turnabout is fair play .
Even though my brilliant tax proposal seems like a total giveaway I could make it a reality .
If I had high - powered corporate lobbyists at my disposal I could enact all sorts of people - friendly laws .
I 'd use my army of ninja - lobbyists to get a 28 - hour work week and every Friday off , along with guaranteed overtime for salaried workers and an Economic Bill of Rights for all .
Instead , the already - rich corporations have the lobbyists and they use them to get ever - greater amounts corporate welfare .
Then they rewrite the laws so that the managers pay a lesser percentage of tax than their secretaries do , as Warren Buffett pointed out :
Speaking at a $ 4,600 - a- seat fundraiser in New York for Senator Hillary Clinton , Mr Buffett , who is worth an estimated $ 52 billion ( £ 26 billion ) , said : “ The 400 of us [ here ] pay a lower part of our income in taxes than our receptionists do , or our cleaning ladies , for that matter .
If you ’re in the luckiest 1 per cent of humanity , you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99 per cent . ”
Mr Buffett said that he was taxed at 17.7 per cent on the $ 46 million he made last year , without trying to avoid paying higher taxes , while his secretary , who earned $ 60,000 , was taxed at 30 per cent .
Notice how he implies he could 've made his effective tax rate much lower if he had bothered .
But he did n't .
Badass .
But most CEOs are not as cool as Warren ... of course , he could probably stand to pay his secretary more than 60 K a year if he 's making 46 million , do n't you think ?
Anyway , the point is :
The system is unfair .
Let 's try to level the playing field a little bit .
My proposal is not to make humans equal to corporations .
That 's crazy .
I just want to make a person worth 3/5 ths of a corporation .
Is that too much to ask ?

A lost Jimi Hendrix album recorded with Stephen Stills from Crosby , Stills and Nash has been uncovered , says the Las Vegas Sun .
The record , which Stills forgot about soon after recording it 30 years ago , is being prepared for release by his bandmate Graham Nash .
Speaking about Stills 's musical prolificacy , Nash said : " He has an enormous history of recording .
In the '70s , he was a recording fool .
He just found a bloody album he made with [ Jimi ] Hendrix . "

We 've got to listen to that ...
I want to listen to every track he ever recorded in case he recorded with Al Jolson . "

Nothing John McCain did dishonestly in his life counts because he was a POW .
So says Sean Hannity after he got caught attacking John Edwards and trying to play the average Amercian guy who just does n't understand how Edwards could have cheated on his wife and then lied about it .
" Why should we trust you ? " SH says .
Colmes attacked Hannity over this as the two argued .
An emailer said they rarely ever talk back to each other since it's not the format of the show .
Colmes smacked Hannity around and asked the same question about John McCain 's first marriage ...
‘ My marriage ended because John McCain did n't want to be 40 , he wanted to be 25 .
You know that happens ... it just does . '
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Hannity : I 'm not getting this .
Explain to me and I 'm wondering if you can't keep the promise to your family , can't keep your promise to your wife , you 're having an affair , you 're lying about the affair repeatedly , why should the American people trust you when you say you 're not going to lie to them ?
Why should we trust you ?
Colmes :
And by the way , that 's a great question Sean asks and so Amanda , if that 's true and you can't trust somebody who had an affair .
How can we trust John McCain to be President of the United States --- he cheated on by his own admission on his first wife , he did n't keep his martial vows , he did n't keep his pledge to his first family ...
Hannity : Thirty years ago after five and a half years of being a POW Colmes : Excuse me Sean .
You 've had your chance to speak , I 'm up .
John McCain cheated on his wife , right .
Amanda ?
So how do we trust John McCain ?
He cheated on his wife , why do you have a double standard and John McCain 's running for President ?
John Edwards is not .
John McCain 's wife was in a car accident .
John McCain 's running for President , what about his affair ?
(H) After five and a half years in a POW camp .
( C ) That has nothing to do with it .
So it 's OK to have an affair on his wife .
How about the good old Keating Five ?
Or Vicky Iseman ?
Does that count .
Mr. Sean ?
UPDATED : Silent Patriot says : Truncated transcript via Newshound , who has a great detailed recap .
Hannity : “ If you ca n’t keep a promise to your family , ca n’t keep a promise to your wife , you ’re having an affair , you ’re lying about the affair repeatedly .
Why should the American people trust you when you say you ’re not gonna lie to them ?
Why should we trust you ? ”
Colmes : “ That ’s a great question Sean asked .
Amanda , if that ’s true , you ca n’t trust somebody who had an affair , how can we trust John McCain to be president of the United States since he cheated , by his own admission , on his first wife ?
He did n’t keep his marital vows .
He did n’t keep his pledge to his first family . ”
Hannity : " He was in a prisoner of war camp !
[ He cheated on his wife ] after five and a half years in a prisoner of war camp !!11 ! " Ouch .
I think FOX should reconsider their decision to attack Edwards over this .
They have their own philanderer they need to help get elected after all .
And really , is there a bigger right - wing hack on the planet than Sean Hannity ?
I 'm not trying to be snarky .
Is n't he the worst out of all of them ?
Heather adds :
They came back for a brief segment after this and Hannity was mocking Edwards and flipping his hair and said that you cannot compare the $ 400 haircut guy to the POW and that McCain said he was a different person after what he went through in Vietnam .
So if life deals you some hard knocks anything is alright in Hannity 's book .
The wingnut mentality is a wonder to behold , no ?
( rough transcript .
Sorry , I did n't have a chance to write up more )
( As a graphic designer with a background in photography , I coordinate the shoots for cover homes . )
Me : “ Just send me the address of the home and I will look it up and work with the photographer on the shoot . ”
Salesperson : “ It ’s a million - dollar home .
Very , very nice .
The listing agent wants to be there ; he wants a nice sunny shot .
It ’s a million - dollar home and I really want to make him happy . ”
Me : “ That ’s great … just send me the address . ”
( I find that the house faces north - northeast , which means the sun will never hit the front of the house directly . )
Me : “ Okay , we ’ve got a problem .
I know the listing agent wants to be at the shoot and he wants a sunny shot , but we ca n’t do that because it faces north .
We ’re going to have to have to do a night shot or an early shot and hope the dawn light hits it . ”
Salesperson : “ But it ’s a million - dollar home . ”
Me : “ I know , it ’s a really nice home .
It ’s vacant , so we ca n’t do an interior .
I ’ll talk to the photographer , but I ’m sure he ’ll agree that a night shot will be our best bet or the home will be backlit and not look good at all . ”
Salesperson : “ This is a million - dollar mansion ! ”
Me : “ I know .
But unless you or the listing agent can move the sun , it will be at night or just after sunrise .
I ’m sure he wants the mansion to look good . ”
( The salesperson calls my boss to undoubtedly tell her I am being impossible , and I should n’t dictate to our customers .
Sadly , my boss could n’t move the sun either , and a very lovely night shot ran on the cover . )
No one likes to wake up to the news that the boss may slash salaries to the minimum wage .
California ’s state workers on Thursday were digesting the news that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger may cut their pay to the federal minimum wage of $ 6.55 an hour until legislators send him a budget he can sign .
For some , that went down about as well as a meal that could be afforded on minimum wage .
“ I ’d probably be out on the streets . . . learning how to eat out of garbage cans , ” said Zola Salena - Hawkins , a legal secretary at the attorney general ’s office at the Ronald Reagan State Office Building in downtown Los Angeles .

Salena - Hawkins said she left the private sector nine years ago for job security and benefits , but with the way things are going , she ’s “ thoroughly disappointed . ”
“ I ’m a Republican .
Ouch ! ” she said .
“ It really hurts to see the way everything is falling apart , especially during a Republican watch . ”
Schwarzenegger was expected to sign the order early next week , affecting 200,000 state workers .
The deadline for passing a 2008 - 09 budget was July 1 , and without one soon , California may be unable to borrow billions of dollars needed to keep the state solvent , officials have warned .
The plan would allow the state to defer paying about $ 1 billion a month , administration officials said .
Workers would be repaid their lost earnings once a budget was in place .
But many workers questioned how they would pay their immediate costs : mortgages , food , gas , child support .

“ I wo n’t be able to survive , ” said Carolina Castillo , a legal secretary .
“ I have three kids , I ’m a single mom . . . .
There ’s just no way . ”
Castillo , 34 , said that if her wages were cut , she might need welfare and would have no choice but to return to the private sector , which she left a year and a half ago for a steadier schedule and more time with her family .
However , some state workers with a knowledge of political history considered the prospect of Schwarzenegger ’s plan with a Zen calm .
Many a July has come and gone without a budget in place but with dramatic predictions of layoffs and pay cuts that never came to pass , they noted .
“ It ’s possible but improbable , ” said Don Williams , a staffer in the Department of Social Services who ruefully called himself “ a veteran of many wars ” during his state service .

Williams said he thought the governor ’s proposal “ was strategically done to get the attention of the Legislature .
It definitely got the attention of the state workers . ”
But he added he was n’t too worried yet .
“ For it to happen , a lot of things will have to transpire . ”
He ’s right .
For starters , State Controller John Chiang has said he would not implement such an order , asserting the state has enough money on hand .
Also , the governor ’s plan , if carried out , probably would be challenged in court by public employee unions .
“ Anything ’s possible the way things are going with the economy , ” said Gary Balekjian , a deputy attorney general , as he crossed the street in front of the Reagan building .
“ The sun could supernova too . ”
Balekjian , who defends the state against employees ’ lawsuits -- and emphasized he was speaking only for himself , not his office -- said such a move would not save the state in the long run .
Balekjian said he is ethically obligated to continue his legal work whether he is paid or not .
But if he were to quit because of a drastic salary cut , he added , the state would have to scramble for new lawyers , possibly delaying court cases that would leave the state vulnerable to costly damage payments to plaintiffs .
“ It ’s like cutting off your nose to spite your face , ” he said .

As drafted , the order also calls for the state to immediately lay off 21,855 part - time workers , stop overtime payments for almost all employees and cease all hiring until a budget is enacted .
“ I ’m kind of worried that one of them might be me , ” said Jason Kwan , a part - time student assistant in litigation support .
Kwan , 24 , is worried that without his job , he wo n’t be able to pay off his student loans at Cal State L.A. or afford law school .
The response from unions to Schwarzenegger ’s plan was immediate and angry .

“ The governor is turning a budget crisis into a catastrophe , ” said Yvonne Walker , president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000 , which represents 95,000 state workers .
“ How can you tell people , ‘ We will just pay you this amount and you can catch up later ? ’
“ We are in the middle of a housing crisis , and people are losing their mortgages , ” she said .
“ Are they going to issue a notice to mortgage companies that employees will just catch up later ? ”
Walker said she believed the governor ’s plan was illegal , and union attorneys are drafting a lawsuit to file if the order is signed .
In the meantime , some state workers had their own suggestions for Schwarzenegger .

“ I think the governor should fund the budget with his own resources until he and the Legislature can get together , ” said Paul Ablon , a state attorney for nearly nine years .
“ And maybe he ’ll appreciate how it is to worry about paying your expenses . ”

Times staff writer Evan Halper contributed to this report .
The California Public Utilities Commission was a busy body Thursday , launching a new long - term energy - efficiency program , approving two biomass projects and voting to oppose Proposition 7 , the hotly contested renewable - energy voter initiative .
Commissioner Dian M. Grueneich , the PUC 's energy - efficiency maven , acknowledged that California has come a long way in saving energy , but it has mostly been through incremental changes to buildings and appliances , along with a shift to compact fluorescent bulbs .
With the pressing need to reduce planet - warming greenhouse gases , more was required .
So Grueneich prodded consumer groups , energy experts and state agencies to come up with an ambitious program to move toward " long - term deeper savings which impact the fundamental ways in which California 's residents and businesses use energy . "
The result is the new Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan for 2009 through 2020 .
You can be sure it is not just about changing your light bulbs .
Under the plan , by 2020 all new residential construction would be " zero net energy , " meaning that the homes ' entire needs would be served by non -grid technology , such as rooftop solar panels or small - scale renewable - energy projects serving more than one home or business .
And all eligible low - income homes would be made energy - efficient .
New efficiency standards would be adopted for ventilation , heating and air conditioning systems .
By 2030 all new commercial buildings would have to be " zero net energy . "
V. John
White , a key player in the state 's energy debates and head of the Sacramento - based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies called the new plan " a very important change in direction . "
And PUC Commissioner John Bohn noted that " squeezing greater efficiency out of our current uses of electrical power is our best and least costly source of additional supplies . "
As for the panel 's vote against Proposition 7 , commissioners deemed the November ballot initiative too rigid and unworkable .
It would " seriously interfere " with renewable - energy projects underway , they said .
Commission President Michael R. Peevey acknowledged that current renewable - energy programs have problems but said they should be fixed with " a finer instrument than the blunt hammer of a ballot initiative . "

CompSci.ca LanSchool threatens compsci.ca with legal actions
The matter seems to have been resolved .
See the followup post here
It appears that Dan , myself , and all of the Computer Science Canada community is being threatened with legal actions , courtesy of LanSchool — a classroom management software , that monitors students ’ activity ( “ now available with USB Limiting and Keystroke Monitoring ” ) .
It seems the cause for concern is this 2 year old review of their software .
Please note that the author of the review and questioned software , Dan , is dyslexic , so excuse the spelling , where applicable .
This page detials a proof of conspect expolite of the lanschool program .
CompSci.ca and Hacker Dan do not support , condone or recomend the use of it in real life ( So do n’t send us e-mails asking how to get it working or how to hack your schools network ) .
Also since this expolit was found and lanschooled was created , lanschool has upgraded there software so it may no longer be expolitable from the attack desrcibled on this page .
The security flaw , revolving around insecure communication channels , has first been diligently reported to the software ’s developer , along with suggestions for a fix .
The response essentially stated that the security should be enforced at the school - student level , citing “ suspension ” .
So after some time , the review ( along with a proof - of - concept application ) has been published online .
It seems that in the last two years LanSchool has released a new version of their software , claimed to have fixed the published security issue , but has now decided to threaten legal actions anyway .
Claims include :
“ unauthorized use of its trade - mark ” — even though they have no registered trademark in Canada .
“ unauthorized use of its logo ” — using their logo to refer to the company should fall under fair use .
“ In other postings you offer detailed advice about how to use “ LanSchooled ” to breach the security inherent in our client ’s software . ” — but earlier in the document they stated “ you identified and made LanSchool aware of a potential security flaw in LanSchool version 6.5 ( which does not exist in the current version 7.1 ) . ” “ you describe our client ’s software as a “ trojan horse type program that is used by many school boards in Ontario to spy on their students as well as controlling one or all computers in a given lab … LanSchool has many flaws in its design , and thus many security holes … . ” " — this would amount to defamation only if the statement was untrue .
Though considering that LanSchool is designed to allow remote access to the system , to monitor and log activity , I feel like that is an accurate description .
Furthermore LanSchool ’s # 1 FAQ question is :
My Anti-Virus software is reporting LanSchool as a virus , what should I do ?
Suggesting that the LanSchool software indeed acts in a manner similar enough to a malicious program , to trigger some Anti-Virus applications .
The flaws in the design were demonstrated by the proof - of - concept application in question , and were true at the time of publication .
“ It is evident that you have intentionally set out on a course to harm our client ’s software and business . ” — absolutely not .
The original review explicitly states that “ This page detials a proof of conspect expolite of the lanschool program .
CompSci.ca and Hacker Dan do not support , condone or recomend the use of it in real life ” .
Once again , the company has been made aware of the issue well before the publication .
The demands include :
Removal of the critical review of their software .
Destruction of author ’s intellectual property , in the form of the proof - of - concept application .
Not making use of any of LanSchool ’s software in the future .
What I find interesting in this legal document , is that it asks :
We must caution you not to destroy any records , electronic or otherwise , including website records and logs , and copies of the software in your possession …
Directly contradicting with their demand to “ destroy under oath all copies , whether in print or electronic , of your “ LanSchooled ” software ” .
I ’m not sure what to think of this .
Since they were aware of the issue for quite some time , I ’m not sure why it took them 2 years to address the review and discussion around it .
I wonder if we are their only legal target , or if this will turn into a full - scale censorship sweep that would name larger companies such as Google , for hosting a YouTube video on disabling their software ( or another , this time with an anti-virus . )
I believe it is within our right to publish critical reviews of software products , and so we plan on getting a lawyer to consult with , in order to defend the author , the community , and the right to critical review in Canada .
In the mean time you could leave us a comment with an advice , or let LanSchool know what you feel regarding this issue .
PayPal donations towards our legal fees will be appreciated .
In an event that LanSchool will not proceed with legal actions further , any unused donations will be donated to EFF.org — “ the leading civil liberties group defending your rights in the digital world . ”
The matter seems to have been resolved .

The explosive power of the world 's most active volcano
A fiery spurt of lava explodes into the air as it reaches the salty waters of the Pacific Ocean from the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii .
It is just one of the awe - inspiring images taken by photographer Brad Lewis , also simply known as the ' Volcano Man ' .
In another he snapped the pulsing Pu'u O'o lava lake , which captured the sense of incredible heat inside the furnace .
The 50 - year - old has put himself into many death defying situations to capture the natural beauty of one of nature 's powerful phenomena .
Molten lava is seen in intricate detail as it gushes into the Pacific Ocean
And while the thought of getting up close to 2200 degrees ( F ) lava is enough to scare most people off the job , this photographer would n't have it any other way .
' I get as close as I can without catching on fire or burning my skin , ' explains the 50 - year - old .
' If I stay upwind , I can get pretty close usually . '
The island of Hawaii is located over a ' hotspot ' located in the middle of the massive Pacific tectonic plate .
It is made up of five volcanoes .
The youngest and most active in the world is Kilauea .
Several hundred thousand cubic meters of lava gush from its vents and tubes almost every day .
The American photographer does most of his work at dawn and dusk because he believes these times provide the best light .
' All the movement and texture can come together .
I always study the situation before I shoot it so I can pre-visualise what I most want , and be in position to get it when the time is right , ' he said .
Mr Lewis ' incredible picture show Pu'u O'o lava lake in 1998
His vivid and detailed work has been of great assistance to the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory and the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , to whom he has donated his images for the past 20 years .
Despite the obvious risks of his job , Mr Lewis insists he always plays it safe .
' My biggest concern is personal safety .
I use a special respirator to protect my lungs from the poisonous fumes I am often exposed to , ' he said .
' I wear protective clothing , but not the silver heat - resistant suits that some volcanologists wear , because I want to know what kind of heat conditions I am in at all times . '
' But even the best equipment has a short life - span on the volcano as caustic fumes fry the electronics of camera gear . '
Lava creates huge clouds of steam and ash as it enters the Pacific Ocean from the Kilauea Volcano
Brad has lived with his wife Annabelle , 50 , and daughter Heather , 13 , on the Big Island of Hawaii for the past 26 years .
' Anytime I am on the volcano , there is more danger than if I stayed at home .
But I never feel that I am taking chances or gambling my safety , ' he said .
' If my little voice inside tells me that I am in danger , I leave .
It 's as simple as that .
' It is great fun being a volcano photographer , but more fun being a father and husband .
I am not going to risk that .'

Our 10 favorite tools Kitchen Essentials
When it comes to matters of the kitchen , most cooks will argue that without their favorite pieces of equipment , it 's difficult to find the motivation to cook .
Sure , purists believe that a sharp chef 's knife is all you really need - and in some cases , that 's true - but half the fun of cooking is in the gadgets .
Last month , The Chronicle Food section started a Kitchen Essentials series to share some of our favorite tips and tricks when making a meal .
We chose 10 techniques in the opening column and online videos ( see the links with this story on sfgate.com / food ) ; today , we continue by revealing 10 of our most beloved kitchen tools .
These are not the bare essentials - those you 'll find in the box at the bottom of this page .
Nor is this a comprehensive list for a fully stocked kitchen .
( Food staffer Tara Duggan wrote an exhaustive guide a few years ago - see the link with this story on sfgate.com / food . )
The tools we came up with for today 's column are those we'd hate to live without .
Many of them are multipurpose ( like the chinois ) ; others are so useful we can't imagine what we did before they were invented .
How , we mused in our brainstorming session , did we ever zest citrus fruits before the Microplane was born ?
However , some of these items are far from new .
The mortar and pestle has been used for centuries .
But we believe it 's unrivaled when concocting a spice paste , dry rub or pesto .
Methods for using many of the utensils and tools are self - explanatory , but some , like the mandoline , can be intimidating .
For a primer on how to work them , check out the accompanying video online .
Without these tools , you still might be able to work your way through a recipe .
But it sure wo n't be as much fun .

Kitchen silpat in San Francisco , Calif. , on Thursday , August 7 , 2008 .
Photo : Liz Hafalia , The Chronicle Photo : Liz Hafalia , The Chronicle Image 1 of / 14 Caption Close Our 10 favorite tools 1 / 14 Back to Gallery
Here are our Top 10 :
1. Chinois
What it is :
This cone - shaped sieve is made of very fine mesh metal with a long handle attached .
Use it for straining soup , stock , custards and any other sauce or liquid to produce a very smooth end product , with no extra solids .
Why we like it :
The shape makes for quick and easy straining , especially if you force the solids through the chinois with the underside of a ladle .
A chinois can also stand in for a sifter , or can be used to dust pastries or cakes with powdered sugar .
Alternatives :
Fine mesh strainer , sifter ( for dry ingredients ) .
2. Digital scale
What it is :
There are several types of scales - spring or balance , for example - but we prefer the digital kind .
It calculates both metric and standard weights , and can be used for measuring any ingredient .
Why we like it : Nothing is more accurate for prepping ingredients for baking , including nuts , chocolate and butter .
Most countertop scales can weigh up to 11 pounds , which is plenty for a home cook .
And , if you 're watching your weight , the scale comes in handy for determining portion sizes .
Alternatives :
There is no good alternative for a scale , but other types include spring , balance or electric .
3. Handheld juicer
What it is : Sometimes called a citrus squeezer or citrus press , this tool quickly and easily juices citrus , without the seeds and pulp .
Shaped like a lever attached by a hinge , these usually come in different sizes and colors to match different citrus fruits .
Why we like it : Having a margarita party ?
No tool is better to have behind the bar for extracting large amounts of citrus juice .
Unlike a reamer , it does n't hurt your wrist , and it takes up very little space in the drawer , as opposed to having an electric version occupying real estate on the counter .
Alternatives : Electric juicer , citrus reamer .
4. Spider
What it is :
This is essentially a hand - held , portable strainer .
Composed of a metal wire basket attached to a long , flat bamboo handle , it can be used to pull blanched vegetables out of boiling water , drain servings of pasta or scoop fried foods out of hot oil .
It can also be used to rinse off ingredients when you do n't want to break out the big strainer .
Why we like it : Using a spider saves time and dirty pots - if you have several foods to cook , you 'll only have to boil water once .
Plus , it 's affordable - you can buy one in Chinatown or an Asian housewares shop for less than $ 5 .
Alternatives : Strainer , slotted spoon .
5. Mortar and pestle
What it is :
This two - piece tool , used for centuries in many cultures , can be made of everything from stone to wood to marble .
The thick bowl is the mortar and the club - shaped handle is the pestle .
Small ones can be used to crush spices or make seasoning rubs , while the larger bowls are perfect for things like pesto , Thai curry pastes and other herb spreads .
Why we like it :
While a food processor or spice grinder can whirr ingredients into a muddled mass , a mortar and pestle maintains the integrity of each ingredient .
For pesto , bruising the basil with the pestle brings out the essence of the leaves .
Also , we use the bowls for serving and presentation .
Alternatives : Food processor , blender or spice grinder .
6 . Offset spatula
What it is : Available in a variety of shapes and sizes , this spatula is unique in that the stiff metal extension bends down from the handle and then straightens out again , creating an angle that keeps your hand out of the way and allows you to lift or turn items easily .
Why we like it :
Whether it 's being used to frost cakes , flip pancakes in a crowded pan or spread batter into a baking dish , few other tools are as useful or versatile as the offset .
Pastry chefs love it , as it allows them to see their work .
And depending on the size , it can be the most delicate way to move or turn food .
Alternatives : Butter knife , regular spatula ( though nothing matches the angle of the offset ) .
7. Silpat
What it is :
Think of this as permanent parchment or waxed paper .
These flexible silicone mats are used to line baking sheets or to create a nonstick surface .
The popular material is heatproof , so the mats can go in the oven again and again .
Why we like it :
The surface makes for simple cleaning , and the mats roll up into almost nothing for easy storage .
The mat can also be used to keep pie or pizza dough from sticking to the counter , and working with sticky ingredients like caramel or taffy is considerably easier on a Silpat .
Alternatives : Parchment paper .
8. Mandoline
What it is : A hand - operated slicing machine , used for cutting even slices or julienne .
Most come with two sets of adjustable hinged legs so it will sit upright , but some , like the Japanese benriner , are flat and can rest atop a bowl .
An adjustable blade allows the user to choose the thickness of the vegetable slice , or switch it to make julienne or crinkle - cut vegetables .
Why we like it :
This is the best tool for precise , uniform slicing .
Potato gratin can be made in a snap , and it 's great when working with large quantities .
A hand guard comes with most mandolines , so you can slice without the fear of losing the skin off your fingers .
Alternatives : Chef 's knife and a steady hand .
9. Microplane
What it is :
Also called a rasp grater , this long and skinny handheld tool can be used to zest citrus , shave Parmesan or any hard grating cheese , or even shave chocolate for a garnish .
Why we like it : Ergonomically speaking , it 's comfortable and easy to use .
There 's no fear of grating your knuckles , and nothing removes citrus zest ( and leaves the unwanted pith behind ) so effectively .
Alternatives :
Box grater , citrus zester ( shave off ribbons of citrus and mince ) , rotary grater for cheese .
10 . Instant - read
thermometer
What it is :
Most chefs carry an instant - read thermometer with them at all times to determine when meat or fish is cooked through .
We use ours often , whether it's to find out if our Thanksgiving turkeys are done , or to test the temperature of chocolate for tempering .
It 's also a good idea to have a candy thermometer , which can be used to regulate the temperature of hot oil .
Why we like it :
Though some cooks rely on intuition or feel to know when a chicken is roasted or a steak is cooked to medium - rare , we need something more accurate for recipe testing .
It takes the guesswork out of the equation , and if properly calibrated , is always on target .
Alternatives : None .

Your kitchen - the bare essentials
If you 're just starting to cook , or stocking a basic kitchen , running out to buy a 40 - pound mortar and pestle may not be your first priority .
But there are a handful of tools that should be in every kitchen , no matter your skill level or passion for cooking .
-- 8 - or 10 - inch chef 's knife -- Paring knife -- Bread knife -- Whisk -- Spoons - wooden and metal , solid and slotted -- Vegetable peeler -- Spatulas - rubber , metal and silicone -- Cutting board -- Tongs -- Measuring spoons -- Measuring cups
This list does n't include baking pans , pots , and bowls , all of which round out the well - stocked kitchen .

Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle .
At the same time , bring a large pot of salted water to a boil .
On a mandoline set to a 3/8 - inch thickness , slice the yellow squash and zucchini into rounds .
Drop into boiling water and blanch for about 2 minutes , until slightly softened .
Lift out with a spider or other handheld strainer , and place into a bowl .
Immediately put the green beans into the same boiling water and cook for 3 minutes , then remove with the spider and add to the bowl .
Add the red onion to the bowl and set aside .
When the potatoes are ready to handle , peel , then slice against the mandoline into 3/8 - inch rounds .
Be very careful , as the potatoes will break easily .
Add to the bowl with the other vegetables very gently .
Toss with the pesto vinaigrette , very gently , until well coated .
Lightly toss in the tomatoes at the last minute , taste for seasoning , and serve immediately .

A number of comments on my last post suggested I work on multi-core parallelism .
There are a number of reasons why I am steering clear of that topic .
First of all , it seems everyone is doing it , and I hate crowds .
Secondly , I was heavily involved in the early days of multithreading and transactions back in the 70’s and 80’s .
Been there , done that , got the Lucite trophy .
More importantly , I believe the whole movement is misguided .
Remember that we already know how to exploit multicore processors : with now - standard multithreading techniques .
Multithreaded programming is notoriously difficult and error - prone , so the challenge is to invent techniques that will make it easier .
But I just do n’t see vast hordes of programmers needing to do multithreaded programming , and I do n’t see large application domains where it is needed .
Internet server apps are architected to scale across a CPU farm far beyond the limits of multicore .
Likewise CGI rendering farms .
Desktop apps do n’t really need more CPU cycles : they just absorb them in lieu of performance tuning .
It is mostly specialized performance - intensive domains that are truly in need of multithreading : like OS kernels and database engines and video codecs .
Such code will continue to be written in C no matter what .
There are only two groups that want multicore .
One is the computer hardware industry , which has become addicted to rapid obsolescence , and whose sales will fall if computers start lasting more than a few years .
The other group is researchers looking for a topic .
Multicore programming is an irresistible bait for researchers : it is a hard puzzle , with quantifiable results , and a shot at changing the world .
Unfortunately it is turning out that there is little quantifiable difference between the plethora of alternatives , leaving it as a matter of subjective judgment , which they hate .
I already see signs that the multicore research frenzy has peaked .
That said , Subtext does suggest a transactional model of computation related to some of the recent research .
But parallelism is just a possible side - benefit .
The point is to allow the programmer to express their intent without having to mentally compile a linear execution schedule .
Performance is not the problem .
Write that on the board 100 times .
Update :
It looks like I really stepped in it this time , so let me clarify my position .
Giving a multicore CPU to a programmer is like giving a drink to an alcoholic .
Saint Knuth taught us that premature optimization is the root of all evil .
I ’m here to tell you that virtually all of programming is premature optimization .
Once , just once , try to write a program without ever thinking about performance .
I know I can’t .
We have this fatal attraction to performance problems : they are just so shiny and clear - cut : a chance to be clever with a well - defined problem .
The other issues we grapple with in programming are so vague and ambiguous and ultimately unknowable .
But those are the essential issues , and thinking about performance is a distraction from them .
Inventing new programming languages and techniques to get better performance on multicore chips goes completely in the wrong direction .
We should be figuring out how we could improve programming given unbounded performance .
Then figure out how to optimize it .
I have come to believe that our programming languages and design patterns are all a giant case of premature optimization .
So maybe we need multicore , and maybe we need to complicate programming as a result , but it is just digging ourselves deeper into the hole we ’re in , and should not be celebrated .
Update : see rebuttal in next post .
-- Iran is making great diplomatic efforts to release crew of its bulk carrier which was hijacked in the Aden Gulf off the coast of Somalia .
Armed pirates on Thursday hijacked an Iranian bulk carrier with 29 crew and a Japanese - operated chemical tanker with 19 crew within an hour in the Gulf of Aden in an unprecedented spate of attacks , Noel Choong , head of the Kuala Lumpur - based International Maritime Bureau 's ( IMB ) Piracy Reporting Centre had earlier said .
According to Choong , the pirates opened fire on the Iranian carrier before boarding it .
"
" We are trying to use diplomatic means to release sailors of the hijacked Iranian ship which was carrying 40,000 tons of iron ore from China to the Netherlands , " " Managing Director of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines ( IRISL ) Mohammad - Hossein Dajmar said Saturday .
The pirates have made no request yet in return for the release of the crew , he noted adding that the Iranian sailors are in good health conditions .
Two German and Malaysian cargo ships were also hijacked in the same area later in the day .
Somalia is the world 's biggest piracy hotspot , with 24 reported attacks in the first half of this year .
There has been a sharp increase in piracy attacks in the region since the start of this year .
The impoverished country has not had a functioning government since 1991 and pirates frequently seize foreign vessels for ransom , making it difficult and expensive to deliver aid to the region .

The problem of truancy has drawn widespread attention this year , prompting some area lawmakers to call for tough measures to keep track of the most habitual offenders and leading school officials to crack down on those who constantly skip class .
In its recently concluded session , the Maryland General Assembly passed a measure that would make it possible to deny driver ’s licenses to students who have too many unexcused absences .
Gov. Martin O’Malley ( D ) is expected to sign it .
During the same session , some lawmakers in Prince George ’s proposed strapping ankle bracelets on students to electronically monitor the whereabouts of those who constantly skip school .
That bill did not advance .
But the county ’s police announced April 11 that they had caught 425 truants in a crackdown that began in February .

Shortly after Tesla held a press conference Wednesday morning touting its $ 250 million planned plant in San Jose , Calif. , Tesla chairman Elon Musk presented his vision of Tesla ’s leadership role in the auto industry at the AlwaysOn GoingGreen conference .
Musk said that Tesla has the ability to accelerate the auto industry ’s progress toward the adoption of electric vehicles by 5 to 10 years .
Lighting even that small fire could be very important if you consider what a decade of delay can do for climate change , he said .
Tesla ’s efforts to spur the auto giants will include a third - generation , low - cost electric vehicle that could possibly be priced as low as $ 20,000 , ( he mentioned $ 30,000 as an option , too ) a price point that is “ super affordable , ” he explained to us in a phone interview .
The company has discussed plans for a third - generation car before , suggesting prices closer to $ 30,000 .
Tesla could produce the low - cost , third - generation electric car in partnership with other major auto makers , Musk said in his speech .
He also noted the company ’s previously announced partnership with Daimler and said that the connection could possibly turn into a larger deal .
Details have n’t been announced about the deal with Daimler , but Musk confirmed with us that Tesla ’s partnership with Daimler wo n’t focus on its Model S. So does that mean a future Daimler / Tesla EV partnership could deliver one of its third - gen lower - cost options ?
We ’re not sure , but it sounds like a possibility .
Musk gave a few details on Tesla ’s second generation Model S sedan , which he said the company will unveil early next year .
Drivers will be able to swap the battery pack out of the Sedan , and in his talk Musk envisioned battery swap stations that could offer the same convenience as visiting a gas station .
He explained to us that it was not that hard to design the battery to be swappable and that it made the car easier to service .
Battery - swapping made us think Tesla might be getting on board with Shai Agassi ’s Better Place , but Musk said that at this point the two startups are focusing on different markets — Better Place currently has deals with Israel and Denmark .
On the topic of electric - vehicle competitor Fisker , Musk had some strong opinions .
He said that the startup had copied a strategy from Tesla , but that it was using the wrong one ( the Fisker - Tesla brawl headed to arbitration in June ) .
We asked him what he thought the market would look like in 2010 , when many of the large auto makers are first launching their electric vehicles , and he said it would be significantly later than that before any serious contenders came onto the market .
Your situation does not determine your outcome .
Your attitude does .
I ’ve been an entrepreneur , successful online marketer and affiliate for almost two - decades .
But make no mistake , I ’ve busted my ass to get here .
So , how does a graduate of the foster care system , with nothing but a GED , go on to create a multi-million dollar business – and become a highly respected marketer and entrepreneur ?
The truth is , I did n’t have a choice .

Memo to : John McCain .
From : Five million thirst - crazed Coloradans .
Subject : Forget about winning our nine electoral votes next November .
We do n’t vote for water rustlers in this state ; we tar and feather them !
Yes , fellow citizens of the state whose official motto is “ Whiskey is for drinking , water is for fighting , ” John McCain has thunk the unthinkable — and proposed renegotiating the 1922 Colorado River Compact .
To quote from Charles Ashby ’s story in the Friday Pueblo Chieftain :
“ The water compact that Colorado and other upper basin states have with California and Arizona should be renegotiated , ” U.S. Sen .
John McCain said Thursday .
“ In a telephone interview with The Pueblo Chieftain , the presumptive GOP candidate for president said the water sharing agreement reached in 1922 between seven Western states does n’t take into account increases in population and changing water needs . ”
You can read the rest of McCain ’s politically suicidal ramblings at www.chieftain.com.
Suffice to say , they are n’t pretty .
As a senator , McCain has long represented a state , Arizona , that would love to steal Colorado ’s water .
But now , he wants our votes .
Apparently , nobody bothered to brief the candidate who Paris Hilton called “ that wrinkly , white - haired guy ” that stealing Colorado ’s water to benefit Arizona , California and Nevada is n’t as popular an idea in Colorado as it is in Arizona , California and Nevada .
Who knew ?
As Ashby notes : “ The Colorado River compact allocates 7.5 million acre-feet of water to California , Nevada and Arizona .
Anything left over is split between Colorado , Utah , New Mexico and Wyoming . ”
None of the latter four upper basin states whose snowmelt feeds the river is ecstatic about giving up our meager share of our birthright to fill those artificial lakes beloved by Las Vegas casinos .
By the time Ashby ’s story finishes rocketing around the Rockies , McCain ’s name will be McMud among the water buffaloes .
The problem , from Colorado ’s perspective , is that in the 76 years since the compact was signed , California , Nevada and Arizona have grown much more rapidly in population — and political power — than the upper basin states .
So when the lower basin states talk about “ renegotiating ” the compact , that ’s their code for a process of give and take — in which Colorado , Utah , New Mexico and Wyoming give and California , Arizona and Nevada take .
Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar , an expert on water law , sprang at McCain ’s blunder like a mongoose throttling a cobra .
The compact would be reopened “ over my dead body , ” the normally mild - mannered Salazar roared .
Even the Sierra Club , rarely a friend to water buffaloes , piled on .
Southwest regional director Rob Smith said , “ Scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 percent reduction of water flow in the Colorado River due to long - term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change in the Southwest .
Instead of threatening a diminishing resource , it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration . ”
Here ’s some free advice , wrinkly guy :
When campaigning in Colorado , you might survive advocating atheism , taking our guns away or outlawing apple pie .
But never , ever , mess with our water .
McCain would have been wiser to heed the warning a visitor got years ago when he arrived in Pueblo to speak to the annual Lincoln Day Dinner .
His hosts cautioned him that water is always a controversial topic in the Arkansas Valley .
The speaker , whose former life in water - rich Iowa left him ill - prepared for the intensity of the wrangles over our liquid gold in semi-arid Colorado , asked , “ What should I know about water ? ”
“ Well , it ’s all right to drink some , ” his host replied .
“ But do n’t talk about it .
And for God ’s sake , do n’t spill any ! ”

I ’ve been an xmonad user since November , and a contrib developer since December .
I love it , and really miss it when I have to use Windows or a friend ’s Linux machine .
I ’ve introduced several classmates to it , and the ones who use Linux regularly use xmonad as well .
One of the best features of xmonad is that the configuration file is a Haskell source file .
This allows for great extensibility , flexibility and control of one ’s setup .
One of the great weaknesses of xmonad is that the configuration file is a Haskell source file .
This means that a user must have a working GHC 6.8 ( does 6.6 still work ? ) installed in order to change their xmonad configuration .
For someone already involved in Haskell , this is not a problem , of course .
For someone looking for a good tiling window manager , GHC is a dependency of the heaviest sort .
It totals some 150 MB of disk on Ubuntu Hardy , for example .
To most people that ’s nothing as far as disk space itself goes ; gigabytes of storage are cheap and plentiful , even on laptops .
Except for the new breed of EEE PCs and similar !
The ritziest models of these have 8GB , most have 4GB .
Now GHC is starting to be actually expensive .
Above and beyond the actual disk space cost is the psychological cost of a big dependency .
It hardly fits the presentation of xmonad as a minimalist window manager to require the installation a complete compiler toolchain .
There are blog posts and mailing list posts about the problem , and a few days ago a user on #xmonad balked at the problem , though the combined weight of Don Stewart , Spencer Janssen and I persuaded him to try it anyway and he seems well pleased with the investment of space .
That last one really drives home the point : GHC is an initial hurdle only ; once a user has discovered how awesome xmonad is , they will gladly sacrifice the space for it .
Strictly speaking , xmonad does n’t require GHC , you can run GHC ’s binaries without the compiler present .
For xmonad , however , this is extremely limiting , as a user cannot even change the mod key without recompiling their xmonad.hs and therefore requiring GHC .
And so we are left with a conundrum .
Certainly we do not wish to sacrifice the flexibility and power of using Haskell as a configuration language .
So the solution , if any , lies in improving the situation for the user who does not have GHC .
Since he current has no options at all , any alternatives are an improvement .
I have three ideas for consideration .
All are discussed in detail below .
An archive of precompiled configuration files alongside the config archive on the wiki .
A web service that could receive an xmonad.hs , compile it , and return the binary for download .
A supplementary plain - text config file , that a precompiled xmonad.hs could parse , generating an XConfig and passing that to the xmonad function .
1. Config Archive
This solution requires the least effort , just a bit of web hosting space .
It ’s also the most limiting , since users ca n’t mix and match , just select from the existing models .
Better than nothing , but not by much .
I do n’t have much more to say about it , I support the below ideas more .
2. Web Service
This solution is the most flexible , allowing users to have their cake and eat it too : the full power of Haskell configurations without the cost of GHC .
This would be the approach I would support , except that there are serious challenges here .
Template Haskell allows arbitrary execution at compile - time , there ’s an infinite loop in the typechecker .
There might be other bugs to allow arbitrary compile - time execution even if we could disable TH .
Finally , we need a box to run this on , and no one volunteered .
3. PlainConfig
This option is actually implemented already , at least in proof - of - concept form .
I wrote XMonad .
Config .
PlainConfig in April to demonstrate that this idea could work , and could really run with a precompiled xmonad.hs and without GHC .
It works , though of course it is far more limiting than a Haskell configuration .
Key bindings are done using EZConfig , and drawing from a list of predefined actions .
Layouts are selected from a predefined list as well .
Workspaces have arbitrary labels , and as many as you like ( though no list comprehensions for the new key bindings ! ) .
Mod and NumLock keys can be set freely , as can the colours , border width , terminal and focus - follows - mouse .
ManageHook s use a parser from Roman Cheplyaka to handle arbitrary resource , className , and title queries , and the two standard actions doFloat and doIgnore .
do Shift was n’t in core when I wrote PlainConfig , but it is very easy to add .
Similarly , it would be easy to add more layouts and keybinding actions , they are just entries in a Data .
Map String Whatever .
The two most common configuration elements that are missing are logHook s for status bars and layoutHook modifiers like avoidStruts .
The latter is straightforward to add ( there are only a few of them , after all ) , and the former is only slightly more difficult , though it does n’t allow a lot of flexibility .
The Kicker
From the relative volume of those three possiblities , it should be fairly clear which I think is the most practical approach to lightweight xmonad configuration .
PlainConfig works , and was designed to be easily extended to add more contrib modules ( ManageDocks , EwmhDesktops , layouts ) , more keybinding actions ( CopyWindow , Prompt ) .
The next key piece of the puzzle is the idea of nightly builds .
It ’s been a long time since the 0.7 release , and contrib has been zipping ahead as ever .
Not everyone wants to install darcs , check out xmonad , and build xmonad from the darcs source just to get at the new modules and changes .
A system of nightly builds would allow these users to stay up - to - date and take advantage of the active development , without needing darcs or indeed , GHC .
It would be straightforward to provide two distinct builds every night .
The first would be xmonad as packaged presently for Debian , Arch et al. , using the stock config and with no xmonad.hs .
Alongside this , however , could be a version which includes the prebuilt xmonad.hs that parses the user ’s xmonad.conf using PlainConfig .
And the Gateway Drug
Inevitably , many PlainConfig users are going to want something it can’t provide , and ca n’t easily be modified to provide .
To avoid making this a dilemma between improved configuration power and having to rewrite their existing config into an xmonad.hs , I plan to write a “ cross - compiler ” from xmonad.conf files to an equivalent xmonad.hs which can be a drop - in replacement .
Concerning Evangelism
During discussion of the web compilation idea on the mailing list , there was a rather emphatic post cursing the drive in others for evangelising open source projects , since it just invites a load of clueless newbies who were “ attracted to the * marketing * instead of the functionality ” .
I certainly try to avoid being a zealot , and readily suggest to users taking exception to fundamental aspects of xmonad that they consider one of the alternative WMs .
On the other hand , more users for xmonad means more potential contributors , more people checking bugs , new sources of ideas ( whether they can code them personally or not ) and more buzz for Haskell .
I consider all of these worthy goals , and so if adding a feature like GHC - less configuration to xmonad makes me an evangelist , I will bear that label gladly .
In the spirit of “ patches welcome ” , I plan to work on the “ cross - compiler ” and nightly builds , both normal and PlainConfig - ready , in the next week .
I will donate my own desktop to the cause as a build box until an alternative can be found .
I hope that once this system is in place , we can manage to put out the word that xmonad does n’t require GHC anymore loudly enough to overcome the inertia .
Perhaps more importantly , to kill the untruth that one must learn Haskell to use xmonad !
There are unfortunately numerous blog posts out there that compare tiling WMs and cite one or both as a disadvantage of xmonad .
The latter is particularly insidious , and though xmonad users have said in many places that this was simply not true , that far more users have zero Haskell knowledge than have some , it persists .
Of course , the reverse rumour , that xmonad has crippled their configuration , that Haskell is n’t a good language for configuration , will need a strong pre-emptive strike .
It needs to be blindingly obvious that both options for configuration are still supported !

Master Foo and the MCSE
Once , a famous Windows system administrator came to Master Foo and asked him for instruction : “ I have heard that you are a powerful Unix wizard .
Let us trade secrets , that we may both gain thereby . ”
Master Foo said : “ It is good that you seek wisdom .
But in the Way of Unix , there are no secrets . ”
The administrator looked puzzled at this .
“ But it is said that you are a great Unix guru who knows all the innermost mysteries .
As do I in Windows ; I am an MCSE , and I have many other certifications of knowledge not common in the world .
I know even the most obscure registry entries by heart .
I can tell you everything about the Windows API , yes , even secrets those of Redmond have half - forgotten .
What is the arcane lore that gives you your power ? ”
Master Foo said : “ I have none .
Nothing is hidden , nothing is revealed . ”
Growing angry , the administrator said “ Very well , if you hold no secrets , then tell me : what do I have to know to become as powerful in the Unix way as you ? ”
Master Foo said : “ A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who , seeking light , hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand . ”
Upon hearing this , the administrator was enlightened .

-- Brad Friedman
As if Sequoia Voting Systems does n't have enough trouble already , the company now needs some $ 2 million dollars in cash ... quickly .
Without it , it is likely to be subsumed by one of its nearest competitors , Hart InterCivic of Austin , TX , as soon as next Tuesday , The BRAD BLOG has learned .
In what could well be a major shift on the American election industry landscape --- and certainly on elections themselves in dozens of states across the country --- voting machine company Hart InterCivic informed the current owners of the beleaguered Sequoia of their intention to acquire ownership of the company in a move which could take effect as early as next week .
The attempted hostile takeover --- which , we 've learned , has been quietly in the works behind the scenes since mid-February --- has set off a building panic among the senior management and owners at Sequoia , whose money woes had already led them to schedule a shut - down of their Oakland headquarters .
That shop is to close within a matter of months , as the operations for the company are to be consolidated at its Denver offices .
The takeover by Hart is made possible in the wake of a deal made by Sequoia 's current owners , SVS Holdings , Inc. , with its former owners , the off - shore consortium Smartmatic .
Smartmatic was forced to give up control of the company after the media and Congress noticed in 2006 that the company had ties to Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez .
The officers and owners of SVS are comprised largely of previous Sequoia officials who took over the company after Smartmatic 's failed attempt to find an outside buyer in 2006 .
The deal resulted in an agreement between SVS and Smartmatic for the latter to hold a $ 2 million note from the purchase .
Smartmatic now appears ready to sell that note to Hart as part of a $ 16 million dollar deal which SVS has a contractual right to match within a 60 - day period , ending on April 15th .
Sequoia is believed by election experts to be this country 's third largest voting machine company , followed by Hart .
The combined operation , should the takeover be completed , could well create a new powerhouse in the industry , displacing # 2 Diebold / Premier , and coming up just behind the country 's currently largest election vendor , ES&S .
Court documents obtained by The BRAD BLOG reveal that Hart notified SVS of its intention to purchase the $ 2 million note held by Smartmatic on February 15th , giving the group of owners and share holders of SVS --- including CEO and President Jack Blaine , and VPs Michelle Shafer and Edwin Smith ( whose names BRAD BLOG readers may recognize ) --- just 60 days to match the offer Hart had given to Smartmatic .
As the deadline nears , Due Dilligence processes have begun , and are near the final phases of completion at Sequoia ... whether company management likes it or not .
Hart 's move has sent Sequoia / SVS executives into a legal and financial tizzy and --- perhaps taking a page from Hillary Clinton 's campaign book --- the company seems to be throwing the legal kitchen sink at both Hart and Smartmatic in an attempt to nullify Hart 's offer .
Court documents reveal arguments that Hart 's is not a " bona fide " offer that SVS is legally required to match .
So far , however , those legal maneuvers , reflected by a dizzying array of motions and cross-motions , suits and counter - suits --- completely unreported by anyone in the media until now --- have all been summarily and soundly rejected by the Delaware magistrate adjudicating the matter .
Every legal effort by Sequoia and SVS to dispatch with the hostile takeover attempt has failed miserably so far , leading Vice Chancellor Stephen P. Lamb of the Court of Chancery in Delaware to even describe one such legal theory of SVS ' as ...( big irony alert ! ) ... a " conspiracy theory " !
But while Sequoia faces a plethora of legal liabilities concerning their oft - failed voting systems , Hart InterCivic faces its own share of challenges with a pending --- and damning --- federal fraud / qui tam suit against the company , as unsealed late last month .
Moreover , Hart 's acquisition plan could face scrutiny from members of Congress and Treasury Department officials , as well as states across the country who thought they had turned over control of their elections to Sequoia , only to soon learn there will be a new owner , not of their choosing , of the secret software and devices which determine the results of their public elections .
While litigation over claims of fraud and failure in both company 's voting systems await , so does at least one major prize to the victor of this grudge match : New York state 's soon - to - be- completed $ 100 million deal with Sequoia ... or maybe now with Hart ...or ... whoever ...
The Stakes ...
The BRAD BLOG has learned that several major Sequoia contracts are near completion in which the money has yet to change hands .
The Due Dilligence items demanded by Hart , as part of the final stages leading to their potential takeover , refer to , among many other things , copies of the full and final contracts struck with the City of San Francisco and the various New York state entities involved in Sequoia 's most lucrative pending deal .
While the contract to sell new voting systems to San Francisco amounted to just over $ 10 million , it is the major New York state deal --- comprised of agreements for Sequoia to supply some $ 100 million worth of systems over two years --- that has both SVS and Hart salivating .
It will likely be payments from those NY contracts --- which Sequoia will be working on cooperatively with yet another competitor , Dominion Voting Systems Corporation of Ontario , Canada --- that will go towards a large part of the total $ 16 million purchase price that Hart promises to pay to Smartmatic over the next five years in their proposed deal to take over the note from Smartmatic .
The proposed deal , detailed in Hart 's February 15th " Letter of Intent , " is referenced in the court documents we reviewed on the case .
" In addition to providing non-cash consideration , " the Lamb 's recent findings detail , " Hart has agreed to pay Smartmatic $ 7 million on closing , as well as 40 % of the net income of the combined Hart / Sequoia company for the next 5 years , with a promise to pay at least $ 9 million in those 5 years .
Thus ,
Hart promises to pay at least $ 16 million , and possibly more , " to Smartmatic .
The news will likely be of particular interest to SF , NY and a host of jurisdictions around the country who have recently chosen to do business with Sequoia , rather than Hart --- a company which , among other problems , now has a serious federal whistleblower suit hanging over their head , alleging all manner of false claims and other criminal behavior --- but who now may be forced to deal with a new corporate entity whether they originally agreed to that or not .
That risk is one that may not have been foreseen by many states and counties when they chose to outsource and privatize their voting systems , or when they chose , for whatever reason , to go with the Sequoia company , instead of Hart .
In truth , is there anything at all that would keep a corporation such as Halliburton from making a similar move to takeover control of a voting company and , with it , direct control of American elections ?
A recent hostile takeover attempt , by defense contractor United Technology , Inc. ( UTI ) , in their effort to gain control of Diebold , Inc. , the nation 's current # 2 voting machine company , kicked off a media flurry of concern , and sent a chill down the spine of many Election Integrity advocates who follow such developments in the industry .
So far , Diebold has resisted the takeover attempt , but there seems little in the way of such corporate wheeling and dealing changing the hands of those who have unique access to every aspect of the inner- workings of our public democracy from county to county , state to state and coast to coast .
It 's little wonder then that all four of the corporate entities involved in the pending Hart / Smartmatic / Sequoia / SVS deal have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the matter out of the public limelight during the two months of squabbling , negotiation , and legal maneuvering since Hart 's initial " Letter of Intent " was delivered on February 15th .
Hopefully the light now shed by The BRAD BLOG 's currently - exclusive coverage of this matter will wake up a few more entities --- state and county jurisdictions , elected officials , and other media outlets --- to what may be going on here , the dangers we 've left ourselves open to , and the direct effect it all may have on American democracy .
The Court Case(s ) ...
The motions and counter - motions filed by SVS and Sequoia , against Hart and Smartmatic seem to illustrate the same legal expertise ( or lack thereof ) which Sequoia has attempted to leverage recently in places like New Jersey , where their AVC Advantage touch - screens failed to boot up during the state 's recent Super Tuesday Primary .
To make matters far worse , after the election , it was discovered that the machines had misreported vote totals .
In their effort to quell the damage caused by the failing machines in NY 's neighboring NJ , Sequoia has recently embarked on a number of embarrassing legal and public relations efforts to avoid scrutiny of the same failed NJ systems , even as they are currently set for use in several counties in next week 's important Pennsylvania primary election .
Following discovery of the NJ tabulation errors , election officials in the state requested an independent study of the systems be carried out by two Princeton computer scientists .
In response , Edwin Smith , Sequoia 's VP of Compliance , Quality and Certification --- who is an SVS shareholder , as well as former operations manager for Hart InterCivic --- emailed threats of legal action to two Princeton computer science professors , warning them not to independently examine the Advantage voting machines , despite a request to do so by NJ election officials .
Instead , Sequoia 's VP of Communications & External Affairs , Michelle Shafer ( herself , an SVS share holder ) announced the company had commissioned an " independent review of its voting equipment used in New Jersey . "
The announcement stated the review would be carried about by a company named " Kwaidan Consulting , " who The BRAD BLOG then discovered to be a " blonde nymphomaniac " - seeking technician from Sugarland , TX who had ( unsuccessfully ) attempted to conceal his questionable babe - hounding past once we began making inquiries .
The BRAD BLOG has since learned that Gibbons had been contracted by Sequoia for several months for other work for the company .
Since we broke our story on Gibbons , he has been removed from the project .
( We may have additional information on Gibbons in a later article . )
A judge in NJ has recently ordered the failed voting machines from six counties be subpoenaed and submitted for mandatory testing .
Following that court order , Sequoia yesterday filed an 82 - page legal motion [ PDF ] attempting to quash the subpoenas .
Rutgers University attorney , Penny Venetis , representing Election Integrity advocates in the NJ court case , has argued in response that Sequoia is not a party to her client 's case against the state , and therefore , as a third - party , has no standing to object to the judge 's order .
While we await the NJ court 's response to Sequoia 's latest legal attempts to keep the officials who run the elections in the state from examining the malfunctioning machines they purchased from Sequoia , the company can only hope their legal response brings more success than the SVS / Sequoia attorneys have so far had in the Delaware courtroom where the Hart takeover is being adjudicated .
Vice Chancellor Lamb , of Delaware 's Court of Chancery , seemed decidedly unimpressed with each and every legal argument SVS / Sequoia has so far attempted to use in trying to block the impending sale to Hart , according to documents obtained by The BRAD BLOG .
In addition to describing one of SVS / Sequoia 's legal arguments --- ironically enough to those who have covered the Election Integrity fight in America over the years --- as a " conspiracy theory " , Lamb , in his opinion dated April 4 , 2008 , variously slammed SVS / Sequoia 's arguments , writing that he would " not play referee to the parties ' contract negotiations " ; that " The court wholly disagrees with SVS " ; finding that " SVS fails to raise issues of material fact " ; that their " allegations ... are insufficient as a matter of law " ; that " SVS has utterly failed to allege facts supporting this truly odd claim " which was found to be " baseless " ; while other SVS claims were similarly described by the Vice Chancellor as " completely frivolous , " and " too outlandish to survive summary judgment . "
Lamb's April 4 , 2008 opinion letter on behalf of the court , denying every legal challenge by SVS / Sequoia can be downloaded here [ PDF ] .
Sequoia 's legal track record in other matters around the country have often shown to be similarly outlandish , frivolous and baseless , and the pickle the company now finds themselves in , while desperately scrambling to find the $ 2 million needed to save themselves , might well have been averted had many of the legal arguments they 're using to try and stop the sale to Hart , actually been included in their initial deal with Smartmatic .
That deal , poorly structured as it apparently was , seems to have left the owners of SVS completely open to this impending takeover .
The CFIUS Review ...
Hart 's attempt to takeover Sequoia includes a deal with Smartmatic , who remains in the e-voting business , in which Hart has promised to avoid direct competition with Smartmatic in certain international regions , according to court documents review by The BRAD BLOG .
" Hart promises not to compete with Smartmatic in Latin America , the Philippines , and Belgium , " Vice Chancellor Lamb writes in describing the Hart / Smartmatic agreement , in his latest letter of opinion for the court .
" In return , Smartmatic promises to grant Hart a license to use its intellectual property found in Sequoia 's machines . "
SVS has challenged that particular aspect of the agreement between Hart and Smartmatic on the basis that it would violate previous agreements Smartmatic had made with the U.S. Treasury Department 's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) , charged with overseeing foreign investment of key national security infrastructure , such as our election systems .
In 2006 , Sequoia and their parent company Smartmatic made headlines when it was noticed that the latter was comprised of a series of shadowy foreign companies and owners , which may be been controlled , in part , by interests tied in with Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez .
Chavez ' government had enlisted Smartmatic to run their elections in 2004 in partnership with a Venezuelan software firm in which the Venezuelan government had a 28 % ownership stake .
CFIUS failed to review the takeover of Sequoia by Smartmatic initially , raising the eyebrows and ire of some on both the political right and left in this country .
The matter caught the notice of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight , which , after learning of the Sequoia / Smartmatic controversy , launched into a series of regular reports --- easily the most coverage of anyone within the broadcast media --- concerning problems , worries and failures in electronic voting machines , and about all of the American voting machine companies who make them .
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) called for a CFIUS review of Smartmatic 's takeover of Sequoia , citing " serious national security concerns about the integrity of elections . "
The media attention succeeded in gaining notice of CFIUS .
But rather than face a review by the federal commission , Smartmatic sold Sequoia to the group of Sequoia executives who incorporated as " SVS Holdings , Inc. " on September 13 , 2007 .
The contractual agreement between the team of top management includes a provision to " maintain and perpetuate control of the Corporation among themselves . "
Smartmatic held the $ 2 million note for the purchase by SVS Holdings , and it is that note which is now at stake as Smartmatic verges on selling it to Hart and , with it , the full control of Sequoia to a direct competitor .
SVS contends , according to the legal documents , that the foreign non-compete agreement between Hart and Smartmatic demonstrates " ' indirect control ' by Smartmatic over Sequoia , in violation of agreements with the government . "
SVS argues that the deal would be in violation of the Smartmatic agreement with CFIUS , struck after the company claimed to have sold off controlling interest to SVS in November of 2007 .
The real control of Sequoia , however , could come into question again if CFIUS were to review the newly pending deal , and the way in which it seems Smartmatic has interpreted their right to offer away Sequoia 's " intellectual property " , even while striking a deal with an American company ( Austin - based Hart ) to avoid overseas competition .
Though the claim is included in legal documents , as one of SVS ' efforts to put a stop to the attempted takeover , Lamb struck down the motion SVS attempted to cite as an example of " tortious interference " in their business by Hart and / or Smartmatic .
Lamb found that Smartmatic and Hart were welcome to structure their deal anyway they wished , and that any agreements that Smartmatic held with CFIUS were by and large outside the scope of the claims that SVS was making against either of the two parties .
Indeed , if the terms of the Hart / Smartmatic deal are found to raise new CFIUS questions , those matters would ( theoretically ) be handled through the federal government oversight process .
Maloney , who was instrumental in passing new CFIUS reforms after the Smartmatic / Sequoia issue came to light , tells
The BRAD BLOG , after we requested comment on these new revelations , that she is " confident the strengthened [ CFIUS ] review process will bring to light any potential national security concerns with this case and any others . "
Hart spokesperson Peter Lichtenheld responded to our request for comment on several items related to this story by emailing that he " cannot comment on any of this at this time . "
Sequoia spokesperson and stock holder , Michelle Shafer , who , like Ed Smith , also worked at Hart herself for nearly a decade before joining Sequoia , also currently serves as Chairperson of the Election Technology Council ( ETC ) , an election industry trade group formed by a consortium of major e-voting vendors under the under the umbrella of the Information Technology Association of America ( ITAA ) .
Shafer , so far , has not respond to our request for comment on a number of issues raised in this report .

CORRECTION :
The originally published version of the article above had identified former Asst. Defense Sec. Lawrence J. Korb as one of the shareholders of SVS .
In fact , the former Reagan Administration official is not the same Lawrence W. Korb who holds stock in SVS .
We 've removed the short paragraph mentioning Korb , which had also referenced SVS shareholder Waldeep Singh , who was correctly identified as an official in the administration of former CA Sec. of State Bill Jones .

While somewhat bothered by the summer heat , Manuel Uribe appeared to enjoy Sunday 's outing .
Enlarge By Monica Rueda , AP Manuel Uribe , better known as " Meme " , left home Sunday with the help of a trailer holding his specially designed bed .
MONTERREY , Mexico ( AP ) 
A 700 - pound man once considered the world 's most obese person left his home for the first time in five months Sunday with the aid of a forklift and a platform truck .
Manuel Uribe traveled to the shore of a lake in northern Mexico without ever leaving his specially designed bed .
A forklift hoisted the bed onto the truck , which then hauled him to the lake , where he snacked on fish and vegetables and joked with a local boat operator .
Looking at the boatman 's small craft , Uribe joked , " Too bad I ca n't get on it — it would sink . "
Once considered the world 's fattest man when his weight hit over half a ton , more than two years of steady dieting had helped Uribe drop to about 700 pounds as of June — 550 pounds less than his former Guinness record weight of 1,235 pounds .
He did not say what his current weight is .
While somewhat bothered by the summer heat , Uribe appeared to enjoy Sunday 's outing .
He is still unable to walk , and his last planned outing in March was aborted after the platform carrying his bed got stuck under an overpass .
His last successful trip outside his home was in March 2007 , when six people pushed Uribe 's wheel - equipped iron bed out to the street as a mariachi band played and a crowd gathered to greet him .
Before that , he had n't left his home in five years .

There is a great deal more to fireworks than beautiful aerial patterns that light the skies on Independence Day .
Those vivid displays of patriotic pyrotechnic wizardry are made up of carefully calculated chemical formulas that can be less than wholesome when absorbed at close range or as leftover precipitate matter in soil , air and water .
Just in time for this week ’s annual celebratory sound - and - light shows , a report in a scholarly chemical journal tells of developments by researchers to make fireworks environmentally friendly .
Think green to add to the perennial red , white and blue colors expected to dominate the scene .
The challenge for scientists - even explosives chemists such as Darren Naud and Michael Hiskey , who have worked at the government ’s laboratory in Los Alamos , N.M. - has been to create fireworks that are relatively smoke - free as well as free of potassium perchlorate , an oxidant .
Perchlorate , mixed with charcoal and sulfur fuel , is responsible for speeding up the fuel - burning process and achieving the fiery effects that awe a crowd .
Unfortunately , reports Bethany Halford in Chemical and Engineering News , studies have linked perchlorate to thyroid damage .
Additionally , pyrotechnics often include other potentially toxic color - producing heavy metals such as barium and copper .
“ At one time , mercury and lead compounds were used as colorants , but they were phased out long ago , ” she writes .
Pyrotechnics also play a role in military operations , a fact that has led the Department of Defense ’s Strategic Environmental Research & Development Program and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program to “ sponsor an extensive series of efforts to make pyrotechnic materials friendlier on the environment , ” she writes .
Mr. Hiskey , who spent 16 years at Los Alamos making what he calls “ new energetic materials for the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense , ” is well - versed in both the colorant and the propellant side of pyrotechnics .
Red color results from the use of the chemical element strontium , blue from copper , gold from sodium , orange from calcium and green from barium , he says .
“ Blue is tricky because , while most pyrotechnic flames have a tendency to be hot , copper does not emit well in a hot flame and also is not very strong , ” he says .
Eliminating excess smoke as well as perchlorate was key to improving traditional fireworks , says Mr. Hiskey , who partners with Mr. Naud in a pyrotechnics production company called DMD Systems ( www.angel firepyro.com ) based in Ojo Caliente , N.M. Distribution is done through Lemaitre Special Effects in London , Ontario .
DMD Systems produces what it calls “ theatrical pyro stuff , ” for stage shows , rock bands and circuses .
Most recently it sold Disney 400 of its 300 - foot comets for a Wrestlemania show in Orlando , Fla .
The breakthrough , according Mr. Naud , was substituting a material called nitrocellulose that burns with very little smoke and “ no fallout or residual combustion byproducts that are nasty . ”
“ We solved both problems at once , ” Mr. Hiskey explains .
“ Nictrocellulose has its own oxygen , so it does n’t require a lot of additional oxidants , and it burns very cleanly . ”
The challenge in the future is to be able to mass - produce these perchlorate - free low - smoke pyrotechnics for use outdoors at a price that can compete with the popular and inexpensive Chinese imports .
At present , a fireworks display using DMD products costs twice as much as the more conventional show .
Mr. Hiskey is optimistic , noting that shipping costs and safety matters have led to a decrease in the availability of low - cost China products .
“ Shipping companies wo n’t take them out of China because of their bad reputation , ” he says .
“ China has had some bad accidents in transportation .
Fireworks are shipped in a container that becomes a giant bomb . ”
On a local note , John Conkling , an adjunct professor of chemistry at Washington College in Chestertown , Md. , and author of “ Chemistry of Pyrotechnics : Basic Principles and Theory , ” is conducting a four - day seminar on pyrotechnics on the campus beginning July 28 meant to appeal to anyone interested in energetic materials .
Now in its 25th year , the program is the only academic course of its kind in the country , he says .

Two French exchange students found dead after a fire in south - east London were the victims of a ' ' frenzied , horrible and horrific attack ' ' having been bound and stabbed repeatedly in the head , neck and torso before the house was set alight .
Laurent Bonomo , of Velaux , and Gabriel Ferez , of Prouzel , both 23 , were found lying in the living area of the ground - floor bedsit .
Bonomo had been stabbed 196 times with up to 100 injuries inflicted after he was already dead , police said .
Ferez had 47 wounds .
Detective Chief Inspector Mick Duthie , of the Metropolitan police , today described their injuries as the worst he had seen in his policing career .
" These were two young French students who were visitors to our country and had been in London for only a matter of weeks .
They were talented students working on a dream project .
" The level of violence used on these two victims was excessive - it was horrendous .
The extent of the injuries are horrific .
Everyone working on this case , including myself , has been deeply shocked by what we have seen .
I have never seen injuries like this throughout my career . ''
The pair arrived in London in May to study bioengineering and DNA at Imperial College under an exchange programme with the Polytech Clermont - Ferrand in central France .
Their three - month placement had been due to finish at the end of this month .
Detectives said they believed a burglary at the rented flat six days earlier , in which a laptop was stolen , could be linked to the case .
Police were called to the fire in Sterling Gardens , a residential cul de sac in New Cross , at about 10 pm on Sunday .
The fire started with an explosion , police said ; the property was severely damaged and there was a smell of flammable liquid .
It was extinguished quickly but the men were dead before it took hold .
A white male was seen running from the block shortly after the explosion .
No weapon has been recovered , and forensic examinations at the scene are said to be '' extremely complex ' ' .
Duthie said : " I do not know why these boys were killed or who killed them .
I do believe , however , that whoever is responsible must have been bloodstained when they left .
" I would not say this was a professional attack .
I would say it was a frenzied , horrible , horrific attack .
" I imagine it would take some considerable amount of time to inflict the nature of the injuries . "
Bonomo had spoken to his girlfriend in the early hours of Sunday morning .
He and Ferez were thought to have been playing computer games together when attacked .
Police said there was no evidence of forced entry and keys may have been used , allowing an attacker to surprise them .
A neighbour , Christina Ramires , 32 , from Brazil , said she arrived home five minutes after the bang .
She said a Spanish friend , also a neighbour , told her she saw two men banging on the window of the flat prior to a " very strong sound " that she took for an explosion .
Ramires said that when she arrived she could see through the open door of the flat , which was blackened and greasy .
It had also been broken into three or four months ago , before the students moved in , she said .
Another neighbour , who did not want to be named , was told by police after the burglary six days ago that one of the students had been in the shower and disturbed the intruder , who ran off .
Duthie said it may have been a case of mistaken identity .
" We cannot find anything in these two young men 's background to suggest they were involved in any criminality , that they had done anything wrong .
They were here as students . "
A college spokesman said Bonomo had been studying a parasite that can spread from cats to human foetuses .
Ferez 's research was on using bacteria to create ethanol for use as fuel .
Nicky Crowhurst , 25 , a student who shared a laboratory with Ferez in the biochemistry building , said he was a " really nice guy ... it 's a huge shock .
I can't believe it .
Him and his mate were always in the lab .
They had only been here a little while .
He was a quiet guy but really friendly . "
Professor Steve Matthews , who worked closely with Bonomo , said he was an intelligent young man with a bright future .
" They were both very likeable chaps .
Laurent was particularly mature and well - rounded .
He was a keen tennis fan and looking forward to following the French players at Wimbledon .
" We are all stunned and shocked , to say the least .
Our thoughts are with their families and Laurent 's girlfriend . "
Sir Roy Anderson , the Imperial College rector , said the thoughts of the community were with the men 's families .
" Laurent and Gabriel had bright futures ahead of them and it is dreadful that their lives should end so soon , " he said .
Members of the victims ' families travelled from France to identify their sons ' bodies this morning .
Duthie appealed for anyone who knew the men at Imperial College or saw anything strange in New Cross on Sunday night to come forward .
" I need to build up a picture of these two young men .
What were they doing in the hours leading up to the murder ? ''
" I also appeal to those people who worked with and knew Laurent and Gabriel at Imperial College .
What were they like ?
Where did they go ?
Who did they meet ?
Where did they socialise ?
This attacker was horrific .
I ask everybody - please rack your brains . ''
Those data points were cross-referenced with the votes cast for Mr. Obama in various polling precincts .
The results showed a correlation between magazine sales and the vote share obtained by Mr. Obama , and extrapolated an effect of 1,015,559 votes .

“ We think people take political information from all sorts of sources in their daily life , ” Mr. Moore said in an e-mail message , “ and for some people Oprah is clearly one of them . ”
In their as - yet - unpublished research paper on the topic , the economists trace celebrity endorsements back to the 1920 campaign of Warren Harding ( who had Al Jolson , Lillian Russell and Douglas Fairbanks in his corner ) , and call Ms. Winfrey “ a celebrity of nearly unparalleled influence . ”
The economists did not , however , look at how Ms. Winfrey ’s endorsement of Mr. Obama may have affected her own popularity .
A number of people  women in particular  were angry that Ms. Winfrey threw her first - ever political endorsement to a man rather than his female opponent .
The research did not try to measure the influence of other stars ’ endorsements ; for instance , no similar measures were available for Obama supporters like the actress Jessica Alba or Pete Wentz of the band Fall Out Boy .
“ If a celebrity endorsement is ever going to have an empirically identifiable audience , then it is likely to be hers , ” the researchers said of Ms. Winfrey .
Sorry , Chuck Norris .
The GOP has no plans to follow the time - honored method of dealing with pesky third - party candidates by knocking Bob Barr off state ballots .
What about Bob ?
GOP mum on Barr
If Republicans are worried about the third - party presidential candidacy of former GOP Rep .
Bob Barr and the possibility that he could win enough votes to affect the outcome in several states , they are n’t showing it .
At present there are no plans to follow the time - honored method of dealing with pesky third - party candidates by seeking to knock Barr off various state ballots .
Indeed , when asked for comment about the Barr campaign , John McCain ’s campaign flat out declined to offer one .
Underscoring that indifferent approach , the Republican National Committee offered this response when asked about the former conservative congressman from Georgia .

“ We ’re confident that McCain ’s record of putting the country before politics will appeal to voters of all walks of life , ” said RNC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson .
“ Right now , we ’re focused on John McCain ’s message . ”
The GOP strategy toward the Libertarian Party nominee presents a stark contrast to 2004 , when Democrats aggressively challenged left - leaning independent candidate Ralph Nader ’s ballot petitions in order to remove him from the ballot in places where he might siphon critical votes from nominee John Kerry .
Back then , Democrats were intent on avoiding a repeat of the 2000 presidential election , when Nader , running that year as the Green Party nominee , was widely believed to have cost Al Gore the presidency by winning three percent of the nationwide vote .
Democrats were n’t successful in torpedoing Nader ’s bid in all of the 18 states where they challenged his candidate petitions in 2004 , but they managed to knock him off the ballot in some key states , including Pennsylvania , where Kerry ultimately won a narrow 51 percent to 48 percent win over President Bush .
At the moment , however , there is little indication that Republicans will pursue a similar tactic against Barr , even in the states where a strong Barr showing seems most likely to hurt McCain .
“ At this point we have n’t looked into it , ” said Scott Darnell , a spokesman for the Republican Party in New Mexico , a battleground state decided by just 6,000 votes in 2004 .
“ We ’re very confident that Sen. McCain is going to do well in New Mexico regardless of who is on the ballot . ”
In New Hampshire , where less than 9,300 votes decided the state in 2004 , the state Republican Party expressed skepticism that Barr would even make the ballot .
“ I ’m not aware of any Barr activists or supporters in the state of New Hampshire , ” said Fergus Cullen , chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party .
“ I have n’t heard reports of anyone gathering signatures . ”
As third parties go , the Libertarian Party has done a solid job of getting its presidential candidate on the ballot nationwide in recent years .
The Libertarian nominee has appeared on the ballot in 48 of the 50 states since 1988 , and the party has qualified for ballot lines in 31 states this year — including Georgia , where Barr was elected to four terms from a suburban Atlanta House seat .
The Barr campaign has met filing deadlines in every state so far and again expects to be on the ballot in at least 48 states .
The only states where the party anticipates trouble are Oklahoma and West Virginia , and Barr will likely sue for access in Oklahoma , according to Richard Winger , a ballot access expert who is advising the Barr campaign .
Winger says that Republicans have never pushed minor party presidential candidates off the ballot in the past and he is hopeful that tradition will continue .
“ The Republican party never has gone to court to keep any presidential candidate off the ballot , ” he noted .
Still , that could change this year if Barr gathers steam .
In Alaska , a state with a strong libertarian streak , state GOP Chairman Randy Ruedrich said he has n’t seen any indications of support for Barr and does n’t consider him to be a threat .
But Ruedrich did n’t rule out challenging Barr ’s candidate petitions at a later date — a position also taken by New Hampshire ’s Cullen .
“ Anything is possible but at this time we have not pursued any actions , ” Ruedrich said .
Nick Ayers , a former campaign manager for Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue who currently serves as executive director of the Republican Governors Association , also dismissed Barr as a potential threat , but noted that it made sense to investigate the legitimacy of Barr ’s ballot signatures wherever possible .
“ I think it ’s the right thing for the party to do to clarify it anyway , ” Ayers said .
If McCain ’s campaign , or anyone acting on his behalf , does challenge Barr ’s ballot access , Barr ’s campaign believes they would have a powerful argument that the Republican would be acting hypocritically and they are optimistic he will not do so for that reason .
“ I remember when McCain was locked out of the New York ballot in the 2000 primary , ” said Russell Verney , Barr ’s campaign manager .
“ He eventually sued the state and said the people deserved a choice .
I do n’t think he ’ll go back on his word and will tell his activists to refrain from denying people a choice . ”
The first alpha release of Amarok 2 was made available for download last week .
The popular open - source music player is undergoing a significant transformation and receiving a highly anticipated update for KDE 4 .
We have followed its development since the technical preview release in January .
We tested Amarok 2 alpha 1 in Mandriva 2009 alpha 2 with KDE 4.1 RC1 ( yes , I spent yet another weekend testing unreleased software ) .
Although we encountered some bugs , this release is stable enough for regular use .
Like its predecessor , Amarok 2 delivers practically every conceivable feature that can be stuffed into a music player .
It handles playlists , podcasts , library management , Internet radio , multiple music stores , and interfacing with portable audio player devices .
Amarok 2 has impressively tight integration with several Internet music services right out of the box , including Jamendo and Magnatune .
The Internet music service layer is extremely modular and is designed so that additional services can be added in the future .
It also has support for remote music storage through MP3tunes .
Users can search , browse , and interact with songs from remote services just like they can with songs that are part of their own collection .
Songs from Magnatune , for instance , can be added to regular playlists .
Mixed playlist with album view mode
The most visible change in Amarok is its new user interface .
The playlist pane 's new album view displays the album title and cover art above each set of songs from an album .
This looks good and saves some screen space in playlists where songs are sequentially grouped by album , but it gets a bit visually distracting in highly mixed playlists .
A toggle button below the playlist pane makes it easy to disable the album view when it is not wanted .
The alternative is a simple list view that displays each track in a single row .
The other major change in Amarok 's user interface is the addition of the context view , which leverages KDE 's Plasma system .
Plasma is a programmable widget layer that enables developers to create small , visually rich programs that plug into various application data sources .
In Amarok 2 , the context view is a Plasma container in which the user can embed interactive plasmoids that integrate with Amarok 's functionality and display various kinds of information .
A handful of experimental plasmoids are included in alpha 1 that demonstrates some of its capabilities .
For instance , the Current Track Info plasmoid displays information about the song that is currently playing .
There is also a plasmoid that displays information from Last.fm , and one that will automatically display the Wikipedia page about the group that performed the currently playing song .
There are also a few plasmoids that are only partially implemented , including one that will eventually show song lyrics and one that could be used to display video .
The plasmoids included with the program are , however , only the beginning .
The developers hope that a diverse ecosystem of third - party Amarok plasmoids will be developed by the user community after the program is released .
Plasma support could facilitate rapid development of unique customizations and will also make it easy to integrate web content into the Amarok user interface .
Amarok 2 with several Plasmoids
Although Amarok 's plasma support has a lot of potential , there are still some weaknesses in the underlying implementation .
The existing plasmoids do not handle resizing or reflow very well yet .
The font rendering in the Current Track Info plasmoid is pretty bad , and all of the plasmoids flash when the track changes .
The greatest strength of Amarok 2 is its capacity for third - party expansion .
Like many other parts of the Linux desktop stack , Amarok gives users a lot of flexibility and room for customization .
In addition to the built - in Plasma engine , Amarok 2 also has extensive scripting capabilities which are currently being revamped by student Peter Zhou as a Google Summer of Code project .
The final version of Amarok 2 will offer full support for interacting with the program 's internals through Qtscript , a lightweight scripting language that is syntactically similar to JavaScript .
On Linux , users will also be able to script Amarok externally with the scripting language of their choice through a D - Bus interface .
Users will be able to install and update scripts from remote sources using KDE's Get Hot New Stuff framework .
The scripting API already enables some really impressive things .
For instance , developers can use scripting to add support for whole new remote audio services .
A particularly cool example of this is a Ruby script that adds public domain audiobook provider Librivox to Amarok 's Internet music source lineup .
Librivox integration with a Ruby script
Another really trippy feature that is being implemented by student Daniel Jones as a Summer of Code project is support for biased shuffling .
This project , which builds on existing capabilities in the previous version of Amarok , will allow users to specify a set of basic parameters that can be used to generate a semi-random playlist .
Despite some of the bugs and the weaknesses of the Plasma interface , Amarok 2 is shaping up very well and is quite strong for an alpha release .
It remains true to the vision that shaped its predecessor and delivers a feature - packed audio player that is aimed squarely at the power user .
It rises above the iTunes mimicry that has become common among open source audio players and gives its users a truly unique experience .

Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center , which occurred at 8:46 AM on 9/11 , Michael Hess , New York City ’s corporation counsel , and Barry Jennings , the deputy director of the Emergency Services Department of the New York City Housing Authority , headed to the Office of Emergency Management ’s Emergency Operating Center , which was on the 23rd floor of WTC 7 , where they assumed that Mayor Rudy Giuliani would be .
But when Hess and Jennings arrived , the place was empty .
Jennings then telephoned someone to ask what they should do and was told that they should leave immediately .
Finding that the elevators would not work , they started down the stairs .
When they reached the sixth floor , however , there was a powerful explosion beneath them , which , Jennings told the makers of Loose Change Final Cut , 1 caused the landing on which they were standing to give way .
Making their way back up to the eighth floor , they were able to break a window and call for help .
Hess later reported : “ [ W ]e were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke , thick smoke , all around us , for about an hour and a half [ before ] the New York Fire Department . . . came and got us out . ”
2
Hess made this statement while being interviewed by Frank Ucciardo of UPN 9 News “ on Broadway about a block from City Hall , ” almost a half mile from WTC 7 .
This interview began before noon , most likely at 11:34 .
The conclusion that it began at 11:34 is based on evidence derived from a DVD containing UPN 9 programs from that morning , in which the Hess interview begins at the 57 - minute mark .
According to a note on the DVD itself , its video began at 10:37 AM , which would mean that the Hess interview began at 11:34 .
It is possible , however , that the video might have actually started at 11:00 :
At the 111 - minute mark , the UPN 9 program switched to live coverage by CNN of a Taliban news conference , and the only reference we have been able to find to this coverage indicates that it began at 12:51.3
This would mean that the video began at 11:00 and the Hess interview , therefore , at 11:57 .
Nevertheless , whether the earlier or the later starting time is correct , UPN 9 News began interviewing Michael Hess before noon .
However , NIST — the National Institute of Standards and Technology — which was tasked with providing the official explanation of the collapse of the Twin Towers and WTC 7 , claimed that the two men were rescued at “ 12:10 to 12:15 PM . ” 4
Why might NIST have made this claim ?
The reason becomes evident in another NIST document ’s statement about Hess and Jennings , which begins :
“ With the collapse of the two towers , a New York City employee and a WTC 7 building staff person became trapped inside of WTC 7 .
The two had gone to the OEM center on the 23rd floor and found no one there .
As they went to get into an elevator to go downstairs the lights inside of WTC 7 flickered as WTC 2 collapsed .
At this point , the elevator they were attempting to catch no longer worked , so they started down the staircase . ”
5
According to NIST , therefore , Hess and Jennings , upon finding the OEM center vacated , started downstairs just after 9:59 , when the second tower collapsed .
It was this collapse , NIST suggested , that was responsible for the elevator ’s failure to work .
As we saw earlier , however , Jennings said that they had arrived at the OEM center shortly after the strike on the North Tower , hence around 9:00 AM .
He added , in fact , that he had to have been on the 23rd floor “ when the second plane hit ” ( which was at 9:03 ) .
6
Besides contradicting Jennings ’ testimony on that point , the NIST account went on to say :
“ When they got to the 6th floor , WTC 1 [ the North Tower ] collapsed , the lights went out in the staircase , the sprinklers came on briefly , and the staircase filled with smoke and debris .
The two men went back to the 8th floor broke out a window and called for help . ”
7
According to NIST , therefore , what Hess and Jennings took to be an explosion in WTC 7 was really just an effect of the collapse of the North Tower .
That collapse occurred at 10:28 .
Accordingly , if the two men were then trapped for about 90 minutes before they were rescued , this rescue must have occurred at about noon — hence NIST ’s claim that they were rescued at “ 12:10 to 12:15 PM . ”
NIST ’s timeline is clearly implausible .
Claiming that Hess and Jennings started down the stairs after the collapse of the South Tower caused the elevator to fail , NIST implies that it took them 29 minutes — from 9:59 to 10:28 — to descend from the 23rd floor to the 6th floor .
NIST ’s timeline is also directly contradicted by the testimony of Jennings , who said : “ After getting to the 8th floor everything was dark . . . .
[ B ] oth buildings were still standing .
Because I looked . . . one way , looked the other way .
. . .
[ B ] oth buildings were still standing . ”
8
The strongest evidence against NIST ’s timeline , however , is Hess ’s interview with UPN 9 News .
Defenders of the official account , according to which there were no explosions in WTC 7 , might challenge the truth of Jennings ’s testimony .
But if Hess was giving an interview almost a half mile away before noon , then NIST ’s timeline , according to which the two men were not rescued until after noon , is objectively disproved .
This is the case whether we accept the 11:34 or the 11:57 starting time for this interview .
Given the fact that the interview occurred almost a half mile from the WTC , it would probably have taken
Hess at least a half hour to get there after he was rescued ( he surely would have talked to firefighters and other officials about the ordeal before taking off ) .
So if the interview began at 11:34 , he and Jennings would have been rescued before 11:05 .
If the interview began at 11:57 , they would have been rescued before 11:30 .
In either case , NIST ’s explanation for the event that Hess and Jennings took to be a massive explosion in WTC 7 itself is disproved .
If the two men were rescued before 11:05 after having been trapped , as Hess said , for about 90 minutes , the event must have occurred before 9:35 .
Even if they were not rescued until closer to 11:30 , the event must have occurred at least by 10:00 .
In either case , the event could not have been the collapse of the North Tower , which did not occur until 10:28 .
That said , I endorse the earlier times — 11:34 for the beginning of the Hess interview , 11:05 or earlier for the rescue , and 9:35 or earlier for the explosion — for three reasons .
First , the note on the DVD says that the video started at 11:34 .
Second , the account by Hess and Jennings suggests that they would have reached the 6th floor , where the landing was knocked out from under them , at about 9:15 .
Third , whereas the later times would suggest that this event occurred around 10:00 , Jennings stated , as we saw , that after the explosion occurred and he and Hess made it back up to the 8th floor , the South Tower , which collapsed at 9:59 , was still standing .
As I pointed out in The New Pearl Harbor Revisited , a BBC special on WTC 7 that aired July 6 , 2008 ( “ The Conspiracy Files : 9/11 –The Third Tower ” ) , distorted Jennings ’ testimony .
Although he evidently told the BBC interviewer the same story he had earlier told to the makers of Loose Change Final Cut , the BBC placed his testimony within the time - framework suggested by NIST .
So , after playing footage in which Jennings described a massive explosion in WTC 7 ( which was probably at about 9:15 ) , the BBC says : “ At 10:28 , the North Tower collapses . . . .
Tower 7 takes a direct hit .
. . .
Early evidence of explosives were just debris from a falling skyscraper . ”
9
However , Jennings will apparently not be available to correct the record .
Jennings , 53 years old , evidently died in August 2008 , reportedly only a few days before NIST issued its report on WTC 7.10
In any case , UPN 9’s interview of Michael Hess is now publicly available , thanks to Dylan Avery , who made a copy of it available , and Fred Burks , who posted it at The Transformation Team ( click here ) .
NOTES
1 This interview was not included in Loose Change Final Cut at Jennings ’ request , after he had , he said , received threats to his job .
But after Jennings participated in a BBC documentary about WTC 7 ( “ The Conspiracy Files : 9/11 –The Third Tower ” ) , Dylan Avery , who had conducted the interview , put it on the Internet : “ Barry Jennings Uncut , ” Loose Change 911 , July 9 , 2008 ( http://www.loosechange911.com/blog/?p=105).
The term “ uncut ” in that title alludes to the fact that extracts from this interview had already been posted on the Internet .
The interview is also included in a video , Fabled Enemies , produced by Jason Bermas , another member of the Loose Change team .

Mexican archaeologists have discovered a maze of stone temples in underground caves , some submerged in water and containing human bones .
Clad in scuba gear and edging through narrow tunnels , researchers found the stone ruins of 11 sacred temples at the site on the Yucatan peninsula .
Archaeologists say the Maya believed the underground complex of water - filled caves leading into dry chambers , including an underground road stretching about 330 feet , was the path to a mythical underworld known as Xibalba .
According to the Popol Vuh , an ancient Maya scripture , the route was full of obstacles , including rivers filled with scorpions and houses shrouded in darkness or swarming with shrieking bats , said Guillermo de Anda , one of the lead investigators at the site .
The souls of the dead were said to have followed a mythical dog who could see at night , he said Thursday .

“ It is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls , ” De Anda said .
Different Maya groups who inhabited what is now southern Mexico and northern Guatemala and Belize had their own entrances to the underworld that archaeologists have discovered at other sites , almost always in cave systems buried deep in the jungle .
Excavations at the Yucatan site over the last five months revealed stone carvings and pottery left for the dead .
Scientists found one 1,900 - year - old ceramic vase , but most of the artifacts date between AD 700 and 850 .
“ These sacred tunnels and caves were natural temples and annexes to temples on the surface , ” De Anda said .
How To Qualify For Online Pay Day Loans ( Even Without A Job )

Click here to find out how you can get a pay day loan with only a debit card .
Understand the Terms of the Loan
Where many people get confused with the loan is with the terms .
The terms of a loan tell you the amount of interest you ’ll pay , the fees associated with the loan , and when the loan is repaid .
Some pay day lenders will add on terms of the loan in the fine print .
They may mention what happens if you do n’t pay your loan on time , and what happens if you do n’t pay the loan in full .
Lenders often add extra fees on top of the money you borrowed .
If you do n’t understand the terms of the loan , you could find yourself in a situation where you end up paying $ 1500 for a $ 500 loan .

Chatting with Luis Lavena ( Ruby on Windows ) 2008 July 02 , 14:16 h
This time I interviewed Luis Lavena .
If you ’re a Ruby developer working on Windows , you owe him a lot !
After all he is the maintainer of One - Click Ruby Installer , the main Windows Ruby distribution .
It is a lot of work to maintain such a distro and Luis explains all the hoops necessary to achieve this .
The main message : we need more collaborators !
Anyone can rant , but there are a few that actually step down from the pedestal and get their hands dirty .
AkitaOnRails : Ok .
So , let ’s start .
First of all thank you for your time .
This is very funny because we are like 5 hours apart .
You ’re in Paris right now , but I understand you were in Argentina .
Can you tell us what you are doing now ?
Luis Lavena : Yeah , funny indeed .
Right now I ’m Technical director of an interactive and design agency with offices in NY and Paris .
My job is to bridge the design field with the technology one , mostly on web based application development .
I ’m from Argentina , live there , family and friends .
Now moved a few months to boost some developments and get first steps of the new organization in place .
I ’m from a small province named Tucuman , northwest area of Argentina ( 1200 kms from Buenos Aires to be exact )
AkitaOnRails : Awesome , have you ever been in Brazil ?
Do you have contact with other Latin America Railers ?
Luis Lavena : Even though Brazil is so close from Argentina I had never been there , which is bad .
I have several friends that lived there over the years .
I keep in touch with several Rubists and Railers of Latin America , but most with the ones in Argentina due to several meetings we had during the years RubyArg mailing list has been working .
AkitaOnRails : I am very interested in understanding how the Railers are organizing themselves in Argentina as we , in Brazil , are a growing community as well .
Do you see new programmers going straight to Rails or is it the usual move from Java / others to Rails ?
Are companies adopting it , or Rails ( and Ruby in general ) still has a long way to go there as well ?
Luis Lavena :
Well , there is a huge number of developers that came from Java and dotNET stuff ( mostly Java ) and they are playing with Rails , there is also lot of developers that do Ruby for administrative stuff or even creating games with it .
Companies that develops software still need to adopt Ruby / Rails for their business , the biggest problem with that is the lack of support shaped as companies like Sun or some consulting services for Java .
( or even Microsoft ) .
AkitaOnRails : Going back to the past , how did you start in programming in general ?
Did you study computer science , or were you dragged in there in some other way ?
And , finally , how did you stumble upon Ruby and Rails ?
Luis Lavena :
It ’s funny , I started programming back in 1989 , playing with sprites and GOTO ’s with BASIC on a Z80 computer .
I officially did n’t finish my degree on CS , since job and fun stuff distracted me away from it .
I firstly meet Ruby back in 2001 , loved its syntax , enjoyed it ’s verbosity but it was not mature enough for my needs , at least not in Windows .
Even though I was using Python for so many years , I internally used Ruby to manage several stuff , from simple scripts to later rake tasks that helped us build our tools .
With Rails it was kind of different , since we started to look for alternatives to Zope and we bet on Rails at that time ( 0.10 or 0.12 at that time , if memory plays nice with me ) .
I can say I do n’t regret the bet on Rails at that time .
AkitaOnRails :
It is very interesting to see professionals like you moving out from your zone of comfort toward something ‘ unknown ’ as Ruby and Rails .
Most programmers are very defensive and even aggressive on trying to find justifications for not using neither .
Did you feel like that back then ?
What drove you towards Ruby ?
Luis Lavena :
Well , I ’m used to change languages to fit my needs .
Keep in consideration that our first choice was pre-J2EE era or dotNET stuff , we analyzed which would provide us better solutions in the long run and we decided to avoid them .
Java stuff sounded at that time , and until today , expensive for business .
Argentina is not a country where you will find customers with huge budgets to invoice them the cost of using tools designed for other markets .
Banks and such can pay the luxury of have everything running with J2EE , but that does n’t work when you try to go smaller and agile .
( mostly based on experiences with the market flow in Argentina ) .
AkitaOnRails :
It is even more daunting considering that you decided that you wanted Ruby on Windows , you probably did n’t find anything reasonable and decided to tackle the problem yourself .
Is that how it happened ?
Luis Lavena : I ’ve been forced to use Windows for many years , mostly related to hardware development in the video broadcast field .
Moreover , I ’m a BSD user and Linux one , even played some years with Macs and lately with OSX .
So that restriction forced me to build most of my tools around that limitation .
Ruby allowed me to enjoy that limitation by been expressive , which made me more productive in that field .
Ruby is not capable to handle my main requirements for video processing , but it still powers 70 % of my environment , along with Open Source Software and Freeware .
I ’ve been using Ruby for so long , that I thought the community , now that it ’s growing , would maybe value the experience and the willing to help in this particular scenario .
So instead of keep scratching my itch in the shadow , I decided to contribute back and help others that search for the same stuff .
So you can say I ’m trying to balance my karma .
AkitaOnRails : Americans probably do n’t understand this but in emerging countries such as Brazil , people do n’t actually have much choice , most are not educated enough ( cof english cof ) and so they find lots of barriers .
The last resort for everybody is Windows .
I think it is the same thing in Argentina .
Railers here do n’t simply migrate to Macs or Linux , I would say that at least 90 % of all developers are locked in to Windows for one reason or another .
Is it the same in Argentina , I presume ?
Luis Lavena :
Even though I do n’t like it , I must agree .
Thankfully the Universities started to change that some years ago , giving talks and been more open to Linux community , which grew a lot .
Still , there are plenty of users and developer that are locked in to some corporate / mid-size environments or they require to run Windows for some proprietary hardware or such .
So , we ( as the community ) ca n’t get to those developers without being more open minded or provide tools that ease the path between their current environment and alternative tools .
AkitaOnRails :
But for some reason there seems to be near to zero interest from the community on supporting Ruby on Windows .
I mean , there are people like you , some RubyGem developers that go through all the trouble of making available a binary for win32 , but it is not enough it seems .
How did the One - Click Ruby Installer began , did you create it or you inherited it ?
Luis Lavena : Yeah , I agree with you , but I cannot blame them , after all , everybody just scratch it ’s own itch ;-)
I ’ve inherited One - Click Installer from Curt Hibbs , who also inherited from Andy Hunt and other contributors .
The truth is that for many years I ’ve been using my own version of Ruby , compiled in - house , so we had control over it .
We did n’t patch it in any way , we like to have the whole process documented and automated , so we can take a look to the specific components updated that introduced conflicts .
One - Click Installer , on the other hand , relies on some builds made by the current ruby - core developers and maintainers , which make the process of finding the proper dependencies a bit hard .
That build also imposed other problems , but that will require more time to explain
AkitaOnRails : Haha , I want to dive in to the more technical stuff so people can better understand the current situation on Windows .
How different is Ruby on Windows compared to Ruby on Linux , for instance ?
The most obvious thing is that any Gem with C Extensions without proper binaries for Windows will fail .
Trying to execute shell commands will fail and RubyInline as well .
What else ?
Luis Lavena :
Hehe , that ’s just the tip of the iceberg , let me show you one example .
Let ’s say that you have a package ABC that was build for your current distribution of Linux .
That specific version of Linux links to a common runtime that handles the basic commands like file handling , console , etc .
That is often called CRT ( C Runtime ) and on Linux , glibc .
So , your distro of Linux is linked to this glibc version A.B.C .
If your distribution upgrades glibc version ( like from 2.2 to 2.5 ) then you ’re forced to :
upgrade all your installed packages , or build everything from scratch .
I ’ve even heard of some of these upgrades go so bad that users are forced to start from scratch .
Windows , on the other hand , cannot break 2 billion applications just because of a change of CRT , so they keep old versions and maintain compatibility in the MSVCRT.dll file ( where the base version is 6.0 ) .
A plus for Windows is that you can have several CRT co-existing in your OS , the bad thing is that you cannot safely link to one CRT and use components that link to another version without worrying about segfaults and such stuff .
I tried to condense this information in a post some time ago .
So you can see , the lack of development tools is not the worst problem dealing with Windows development .
AkitaOnRails : Interesting .
And another thing is the Visual Studio compiler vs MinGW .
Can you give us a glimpse on why you chose MinGW ?
Is it just because VS is commercial and developers would have to pay ?
Luis Lavena : Visual Studio is great , but only when you can pay for it .
The free versions lack some stuff that is very useful , like Profile - Guided Optimization ( PGO ) which is being used to build Windows binaries of Python , as an example .
The thing with VS , even the free versions , is that you ’re not allowed to distribute them , I think it is even illegal to link to the download URL / page of it .
So even for our automated sandbox project , Visual Studio would be required to be manually downloaded , installed and configured .
Thankfully in the latest versions you do n’t need to install Platform SDK kit , which was 1GB .
VS versions link only to the latest version of MSVCRT , which then force us to relink every library that ruby depends on with it ( and Ruby source code depends on lots of externals ) .
Also , Ruby does n’t use the safe CRT version of string copy functions , so you need to use a compiler flags just to avoid them …
So after weeks of hard work getting it built with VC8 and every dependency , you end with something that performs almost the same , since there is no performance gain ( but now you have less hair ) .
MinGW , on the other hand , was closer to a Linux environment , so most of the tools worked out of the box .
The good part was that we did n’t require to build all the dependencies with it , since by default everything links with MSVCRT ( the default CRT on Windows ) .
MinGW also provides some cross-compilation tools that lets you build , using Linux environment , share libraries ( dll ) and executables for Windows .
I can consider that a plus , dunno what others think about it
AkitaOnRails :
Wow , this is really overwhelming and I recommend anyone interested in the details to take a look at your blog .
But all that said , you now have everything in place , a proper process and such , I assume .
If I am a Windows C developer and I want to contribute , where should I go first , I mean , so I can know what tools to use , how to build stuff and so on ?
Luis Lavena :
That ’s the good part !
Gordon Thiesfeld and I have been working on two packages for new One - Click Installer : Runtime and Developer Kit .
Runtime ships the minimum Ruby + RubyGems so you get started , and it can also be used as modules for other installations .
The DevKit provides the MinGW environment so you create Ruby extensions or even install the ones that are not pre-built for Windows but they are easy to get it .
This DevKit will not only let you get easily working with Ruby on Windows ( and have access to some great and cool Rubygems ) but also lets you contribute back to Ruby project .
How ?
Easily , the Ruby Installer project ( on Github ) is self - hosted .
What does it mean ?
It is possible for you to replicate our development environment anywhere , hack your changes or even debug Ruby ’s own C code and contribute back to the community .
We have been doing that for several months , and it ’s working , how cool is that ?
AkitaOnRails :
That sounds awesome , I did n’t know that , and I bet lots of developers did n’t also .
So I hope C developers reading this can get up to speed with this now .
Another detail : RubyGems .
How difficult it is to port a Gem with C Extensions to provide a Windows binary when you install it ?
Luis Lavena :
Oh , that requires that some developers do n’t fall into platform specific tricks to make their tools work .
One example , that is also a bad practice , is to use hardcoded paths …
Another one is to rely on the existence of some external tools , which sometimes are not available or developers / users did n’t install it .
And I ’m not talking about Linux - Windows platform issues , even between Linux distros that is a problem .
AkitaOnRails :
So it is pretty much dependent on the quality of the original Gem , right ?
The cleaner the code the easier to port it , of course .
But does your DevKit provide some shortcuts to achieve that ?
And what about RubyInline , does it simply break down ?
Luis Lavena : Yeah , I ’ve learned over the years that you should n’t assume anything about the environment your application is supposed to run , in that way , you avoid those mistakes .
Thankfully RubyInline is playing nice with Ruby Installer ( One - Click Installer that uses MinGW ) for a few versions back ( Thanks goes to Ryan Davis to include those patches ) .
The current , VC6 build of One - Click Installer is not safe , since you need VS6 to work , which is no longer available .
I ’ve heard of users enjoying Sequel , Ambition and ImageScience on Windows thanks to those patches .
AkitaOnRails : Correct me if I am wrong , but is n’t it a way to embed C code snippets mixed in Ruby code ?
This means it will natively compile this snippet to run ?
How does it achieve this in a Windows environment that does n’t have compilers by default ?
Luis Lavena :
We managed to sneak some patches to Hoe and RubyInline that “ bundles ” the pre-built extensions into the gems , so users do n’t need a compiler in those cases .
Anyway , right now using VC6 build of Ruby requires man power to maintain those gems and keep up with new releases , which takes time .
Up until now I was the only man in the show ( since we own some VC6 licenses ) .
Building everything for everyone is a burden I ’m looking forward to drop into DevKit .
AkitaOnRails :
Are you the ones maintaining the Windows versions of Gems or each Gem developer takes care of his own project ?
Is there a central repository for Windows - ready Gems ?
Is the DevKit already available , by the way ?
Luis Lavena :
For some projects
I ’m the only one maintaining gems for Windows , for others I only had contributed patches and other users manage the builds .
There is no central repository for Windows gems since I want RubyForge to be the central one .
In any case , I ’m pushing MinGW specific ones based on github forks here :
By Oana Lungescu
BBC European affairs correspondent , Brussels
The EU has urged Bulgaria to do more to tackle violent crime The European Commission is planning to block almost $ 1bn in funds for Bulgaria as a penalty for failing to tackle corruption and organised crime .
A report seen by the BBC warns that millions ' worth of aid could be lost unless the authorities act decisively .
Bulgaria 's chances of joining the Schengen area are also at risk .
The commission 's nine - page report , due to be published next week , is possibly the most scathing ever written by the EU executive about a member state .
It concludes that Bulgaria " has to make the commitment to cleanse its administration and ensure that the generous support it receives from the EU actually reaches its citizens and is not siphoned off by corrupt officials , operating together with organised crime " .
Bulgaria and its neighbour Romania are subject to special monitoring because they did not fully comply with EU standards when they joined the bloc .
Lack of will
The EU has already frozen hundreds of millions ' worth of aid destined for Bulgaria 's roads and agriculture .
Now it is planning to withdraw the right of two agencies to handle EU funds worth almost $ 1bn ( 610 million euros ) .
As former members of the anti-terrorist unit , Mr Galev and Mr Hristov look more like boxers than your average businessmen
Under pressure over crime
How corruption threatens Bulgaria EU officials welcome recent changes , including the appointment of a respected diplomat , Meglena Plugchieva , as a deputy prime minister in charge of overseeing EU funds .
But the report suggests there is little political will elsewhere to clean up things .
" Despite the Commission 's repeated requests for improvement of the management and control systems , within reasonable deadlines , the Bulgarian authorities ... have not fully explained or clarified the situation surrounding the irregularities and have not taken all necessary steps to correct them , " it says .
The draft report goes on to say , " high level corruption and organised crime exacerbates these problems of general weakness in administrative and judicial capacity ...
Urgent action is needed because deadlines for contracting some of the funds are approaching after which the funds will be lost to Bulgaria " .
Almost $ 400 m ( 250 million euros ) could be lost unless things improve by November .
Bulgaria , the EU 's poorest country , stands to receive $ 17bn in EU funds until 2011 , and this is a serious warning that future funding is in jeopardy .
Mafia killings
Costly projects to upgrade border controls are also under suspicion of fraud , raising fears about Bulgaria 's chances of joining the Schengen border - free area any time soon .
Romania was marking time , while Bulgaria had gone backwards
EU official Earlier this week , Bulgarian newspapers published leaks of another report by the EU 's anti-fraud office into suspected irregularities in the spending of some $ 50 m of farm funding .
The document alleges there is a political umbrella protecting corruption , saying there are " powerful forces in the Bulgarian government and / or other state institutions " who are not interested in punishing the corruption .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev dismissed the allegations .
But earlier this year , the powerful interior minister was forced to step down after revelations he had secretly met two alleged crime bosses and some of his officials were leaking confidential information to mafia suspects .
With a general election scheduled next year , the European Commission 's report will only add to the troubles of Mr Stanishev 's beleaguered government .
Pressure is mounting on Sergei Stanishev 's administration
The opposition is preparing to table a motion of no confidence the day after the document is adopted is in Brussels .
The European Commission will also raise concerns about the persistent failure to solve any of the 150 mafia killings recorded in Bulgaria since the fall of communism .
In a separate report , Romania is also expected to face strong criticism , especially over the parliament 's delay of corruption inquiries involving a former prime minister and other top officials , but the European Commission will stop short of sanctions .
One EU official said that " Romania was marking time , while Bulgaria had gone backwards " .
Diplomats say the strong language of the draft report may be watered down by Wednesday , when the 27 European Commissioners , including those from Bulgaria and Romania , are set to adopt it .
But the general feeling is that something must be done , and seen to be done , to maintain the credibility of the EU with its taxpayers .
Both countries will continue to be watched very closely and officials say the measures planned against Bulgaria should serve as a warning to others , both inside the EU and those hoping to join it .

“ Every day , my children ask , ‘ Who is my father ? ’
They do not like having a mother who is in this business . ”
“ Once , I tried to open a bank account with my son , ” Rani said .
“ We went to fill in the form , and the manager asked , ‘ Father ’s name ? ’
After that , my son was angry .
He said I should not have brought him into the world like this . ”
“ We are sorry we have to do this work .
But what is the alternative ? ”
“ Who will give us jobs ?
We are all illiterate . ”
“ And the future , ” Kaveri said .
“ What have we to look forward to ? ”
“ When we are not beautiful , when our bodies become ugly , then we will be all alone . ”
“ If we live long enough to be old and to be ugly , ” Kaveri said .
“ So many are dying . ”
“ One of our community died last week .
Two others last month . ”
“ In my village , four younger girls have died , ” Kaveri said .
“ My own brother has the disease .
He used to be a truck driver , and knew all the girls along the roads .
Now he just lies at home drinking , saying , ‘ What difference does it make ?
I will die anyway . ’ ”
She turned to face me .
“ He drinks anything he can get , ” she said .
“ If someone told him his own urine had alcohol in it , he would drink that , too . ”
She laughed , but harshly .
“ If I were to sit under a tree and tell you the sadness we have to suffer , the leaves of that tree would fall like tears .
My brother is totally bedridden now .
He has fevers and diarrhea . ”
She paused .
“ He used to be such a handsome man , with a fine face and large eyes .
Now those eyes are closed , and his face is covered with boils and lesions . ”
“ Yellamma never wanted it to be like this , ” Rani said .
“ The goddess is sitting silently , ” Kaveri said .
“ We do n’t know what feelings she has about us .
Who really knows what she is thinking ? ”
“ No , ” Rani said , firmly shaking her head .
“ The goddess looks after us .
When we are in distress , she comes to us .
Sometimes in our dreams .
Sometimes in the form of one of her children . ”
“ It is not the goddess ’s doing . ”
“ The world has made it like this . ”
“ The world , and the disease . ”
“ The goddess dries our tears , ” Rani said .
“ If you come to her with a pure heart , she will take away your sadness and your sorrows .
What more can she do ? ”
We had come to Saundatti , in the southern Indian state of Karnataka , to see the goddess Yellamma — Rani Bai , Kaveri , and I .
( The names of the two women have been changed . )
We had driven over that morning from the town of Belgaum , through the rolling green plains of cotton country .
The women , who had been dedicated to Yellamma when they were children , normally took the old slow bus to visit her temple , so they had jumped at the chance to make the journey in the comfort of a taxi .
It was hot and muggy , not long after the end of the rains , and the sky was bright and cloudless .
The road led through long avenues of ancient banyan trees , each with an intricate lattice of aerial roots .
As we neared Saundatti , however , the green tunnel came to an end , and the fields on either side gave way to drier , poorer country .
Trees , cane breaks , and cotton fields were replaced by strips of sunflowers .
Goats picked through dusty stubble .
Women in ragged clothing sold onions laid out on palm - weave mats set along the side of the road .
After some time , a long red stone ridge appeared out of the heat haze .
The ridge resolved itself into the great hogback of Saundatti , and at the top , rising from near - vertical cliffs , was the silhouette of the temple of Yellamma .
Below , and to one side , stretched a lake of almost unearthly blue .
It was here , according to legend , that the story had begun .
Yellamma was the wife of the powerful rishi Jamadagni .
The couple and their four sons lived in a simple wooden hermitage by the lake .
Here the sage punished his body and performed great feats of austerity .
After the birth of his fourth child , these included a vow of chastity .
Every day , Yellamma served her husband , and fetched water from the river for her husband ’s rituals .
She used a pot made of sand , and carried it home in the coils of a live snake .
One day , as Yellamma was fetching water , she saw a heavenly being , a gandharva , making love to his consort by the banks of the river .
It was many years since Yellamma had enjoyed the pleasures of love , and the sight attracted her .
Watching from behind a rock , and hearing the lovers ’ cries of pleasure , she found herself longing to take the place of the beloved .
This sudden rush of desire destroyed her composure .
When she crept away to get water for her husband , she found , to her horror , that she could no longer create a pot from sand , and that her yogic powers of concentration had vanished .
When she returned home without the water , Jamadagni guessed what had happened , and in his rage he cursed his wife .
According to Rani and Kaveri , within seconds Yellamma had become sickly and ugly , covered with boils and festering sores .
She was turned out of her home , cursed to wander the roads of the Deccan , begging for alms .
Jamadagni belongs to that class of irascible holy men who fill Sanskrit literature with their fiery and unforgiving anger .
In contrast , the goddess Yellamma , like Sita in the Ramayana , is a victim , suspected of infidelities she never committed , rejected by all .
Though the story is full of sadness and injustice , devadasis — as those who have been dedicated , or “ married , ” to a god or a goddess are known — believe that the tale shows how the goddess is uniquely sympathetic to their fate .
After all , their lives often resemble hers : they are cursed for crimes of love outside the bonds of marriage , rejected by their children , condemned like Yellamma to live on the roads , begging for favors , disfigured by sadness , and without the protection of a husband .
I got a glimpse of the tensions in the devadasi ’s life when we arrived in Saundatti .
We had gone to a tea shop near the lake , at my suggestion .
Devadasis are a common sight in Saundatti , where they often beg in the bazaars on Yellamma ’s holy days of Tuesday and Friday .
But they do n’t usually brave the tea shops on the main street .
Long before the glasses of hot sweet chai arrived , the farmers at the other tables had started pointing at Rani Bai , and gossiping .
They had come from their villages to sell cotton at the market , and , having got a good price , were now in a boisterous mood .
Although Kaveri and Rani Bai had the red tikka of a married woman on their foreheads , Rani Bai ’s muttu — the necklace of red and white beads that a devadasi wears — and her jewelry , her painted face , and her overly dressy silk sari had given her away .
Kaveri had once been beautiful , but the difficulties of her life , and the suffering she had endured , had aged her prematurely , and she no longer attracted attention .
Rani Bai was different .
She was in her late thirties , at least ten years younger than Kaveri , and was still , undeniably , lovely .
She was tall and long - limbed , and had a large mouth , full lips , a firm brown body , and a lively manner .
She did not keep her gaze down , as Hindu women generally do in the villages ; instead , she spoke in a loud voice , and every time she gesticulated about something — and her hands were constantly dancing about as she talked — her bracelets rattled .
She wore a bright - lavender silk sari , and had rings sparkling on each of her toes and up the curve of each ear .
The farmers sat there as we sipped our tea , looking at her greedily .
Before long , they were noisily speculating about the relationship she might have with me , the firangi , and her cost , what she would and would not do , and wondering where she worked and whether she gave discounts .
Rani had been telling me in the car about the privileges of being a devadasi , about the way people respected her , how she was regarded as auspicious and was called even to upper - caste weddings to give her blessings .
So when we finally fled the chai shop , to a chorus of laughter and bawdy remarks , her mood changed .
As we sat under a banyan tree beside the lake at the edge of the town , she became melancholy , and she told me how she had come to this life .
Wayne Pickering ( AKA , Brian McConnell ) , head of the Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco formed to honor George W. Bush -- which , at the risk of boasting , SFist was the first to tell you about back in March -- just contacted SFist to let us know that commission 's ordinance initiative to changing the name of the Oceanside Wastewater Treatment Facility to the " George W Bush Sewage Plant " will , in fact , be on the November ballot .
More details to come .
Stay tuned .
Pickering was worried yesterday that they might not qualify since there was a spot check of 500 of their signatures .
But that 's normal since the process works like this : the power that be test 500 random signatures against the voter files .
Based on said raw count , if no more than 143 of the 500 signatures ( 28 % ) are thrown out , you automatically qualify for the ballot .
And : ta-da !
Also , according to Wayne , " we turned in 11,999 signatures , of which 11,041 were counted in the official raw count .
We need 7,168 signatures from SF voters to qualify , so we went in with over 50 % more than we needed . "
Congrats , craz poop plant renaming people !

Robert Novak , the conservative columnist who learned recently that he has a brain tumor , says his condition is “ dire ” and he has retired , his home newspaper , the Chicago Sun -Times , reported on Monday .
Mr. Novak , 77 , announced on July 28 that the tumor had been diagnosed the day before , and he released a statement saying that he had suspended his writing and television appearances , but hoped to return to them .
He was admitted to Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston , after feeling ill while he and his wife , Geraldine , were visiting their daughter in Massachusetts .
At the time , his assistant told the Sun - Times that he would undergo a biopsy in the next few days in an attempt to determine the severity of his condition .
Mr. Novak ’s syndicated political column is one of the most influential and widely read in the country , he produces a subscription newsletter , the Evans - Novak Political Report , and he appeared regularly for two decades on CNN and , more recently , on the Fox News Channel .
He had written his column since 1963 , first with Rowland Evans , who retired in 1993 and died in 2001 , and then alone .
In recent years , Mr. Novak was best known as the journalist who identified Valerie Plame as a CIA operative .
A federal investigation into the source of that information followed , which led to the conviction I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , chief of staff to Vice President Cheney , on obstruction and perjury charges .
President Bush commuted Mr. Libby ’s sentence .
On July 23 , while driving in Washington , D.C. , Mr. Novak struck an elderly pedestrian , and later said he did not realize the accident had happened .
It is not clear whether the incident was connected to his brain tumor .

Planets and Fire by Moonlight
Credit & Copyright : Dmitrii Zagorodnov
Explanation : On July 5th , wandering planets , bright stars , and a young crescent Moon graced western skies after sunset .
Arrayed along the solar system 's ecliptic plane , the three celestial beacons forming this skyscape 's eye - catching line - up with the Moon are Saturn ( upper left ) , then Mars , and finally Regulus , alpha star of the constellation Leo .
Of course planet Earth itself lies in the foreground , a scene dominated by the city lights of Santa Barbara , California .
The smoky haze hanging over the city is from threatening wild fires still burning along the hill at the right .
On Thursday evening , Saturn and Mars can be seen in a much closer pairing or conjunction , separated by only about 3/ 4 degree on the sky .

The MDC has been warned against declaring itself the winner Zimbabwe 's government and electoral chiefs have warned the main opposition MDC it should not declare an early victory in the presidential poll .
The MDC , which has repeatedly expressed fears of rigging , has started to quote unofficial returns , saying it has 67 % of the vote so far and " has won " .
The information minister accused the MDC of " speculation and lies " .
An African poll observer said most votes had been counted , and delays in releasing results were causing anxiety .
Incumbent President Robert Mugabe was facing a challenge from the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai and the independent Simba Makoni .
House of Assembly , Senate and local elections were held on the same day .
Officials say the final results may not be known for a few days .
Commission 's plea
The secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , Tendai Biti , says the party has returns from one - third of polling stations .
He [ Mugabe ] is going to get the shock of his life because they are not voting for him .
Mugabe will be out by Monday night
Bomba Zimbo , Harare
Delay adds to fraud fears Zimbabwe votes :
At a glance Election day :
In quotes Mr Biti says they show a 67 % vote for the MDC in the presidential vote , with the party also winning most parliamentary seats in Harare and Bulawayo .
Mr Biti said the MDC was also ahead in some rural areas , including Mr Mugabe 's home province of Mashonaland West .
" We have won this election , " said Mr Biti .
" This trend is irreversible . "
BBC Southern Africa correspondent Peter Biles says the MDC 's claims are based on partial , unofficial results .
ZIMBABWE POLLS - KEY FACTS
Some 5.9 m eligible voters
They elect president , parliament and local government Nearly 9,000 polling stations
Winner needs more than 50 % to avoid presidential run-off
In pictures : Zimbabwe votes Q&A : Zimbabwe elections
The more slowly - counted votes from the rural areas , where President Mugabe has always had majority support , may decide the final outcome .
Mr Biti also questioned why it was taking so long for the results to be announced , as returns have been posted outside polling stations .
BBC contributors say opposition activists have been celebrating in the towns of Bulawayo , Mutare and Masvingo .
A spokesman for Mr Makoni told the BBC News website that the MDC had " swept the board " in the parliamentary election , with several ministers losing their seats .
But Zimbabwe 's chief elections officer expressed concern " that some stakeholders have gone on to announce purported results ... when in fact the results are being verified and collated " .
The MDC says the commission was appointed by Mr Mugabe and is not to be trusted .
Results have been posted outside polling stations
Counting the votes Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said : " Biti and the MDC are famous for speculation and lies peddling in the country and causing unnecessary havoc here . "
The state - run Sunday Mail quoted the ministry 's secretary , George Charamba , as saying that if Mr Tsvangirai declared himself president " it is called a coup d'etat and we all know how coups are handled " .
Mr Biti said the MDC was just " protecting its vote " and would not make the " mistake " of the 2002 and 2005 elections when it did not claim victory .
Rigging fears A British Foreign Office minister , Mark Malloch - Brown , said it was " quite likely " that President Robert Mugabe had lost the election in Zimbabwe , despite " massive pre-election day cheating " .
A candidate needs more than 50 % in the presidential vote to avoid a run-off in three weeks ' time .
Across the country on Saturday , there were reports of voters not being allowed to cast ballots - either because their names were not on the voters ' roll or because they were trying to vote in the wrong ward .
The opposition feared many voters would be intimidated and stay at home .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The elections will no doubt be free and fair .
The allegations being peddled are unfounded Sosten Musiniwa , Harare After voting in Harare , Mr Mugabe , in power since 1980 and seeking a sixth term , dismissed opposition concerns , saying : " We do n't rig elections .
I cannot sleep with my conscience if I have rigged . "
The MDC says it is fighting to save Zimbabwe 's economy .
The country has the world 's highest inflation rate , at more than 100,000 % , and just one adult in five is believed to have a regular job .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday that " the Mugabe regime " was " a disgrace to the people of Zimbabwe and ... to the continent of Africa as whole " .
The chiefs of Zimbabwe 's police , army , prison service and intelligence services warned on Friday that violence after the polls would not be tolerated .

What are these ?
By focusing on centrist and more liberal evangelicals , who have been pushing the movement to broaden its agenda beyond traditional social issues , Mr. Obama is hoping to chip away at a margin that has favored Republicans .
His campaign selected Ohio to announce the plan , a state where Mr. Bush engaged in a sprawling voter turnout effort among evangelicals .
Mr. Obama ’s proposal was met with praise from leaders like the Rev. Jim Wallis , a prominent spokesman for more liberal evangelicals .
Mr. Wallis applauded the fact that Mr. Obama , as a Democrat , was willing to talk about his Christian faith and “ wants a faith - based program that ’s even better than the Bush program . ”
Several former Bush administration officials who had a hand in shaping the current policy , including John J. DiIulio Jr. , director of Mr. Bush ’s Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives in 2001 , also applauded Mr. Obama ’s proposal .
Though the program is widely associated with Mr. Bush , similar ideas have been supported by Democrats .
“ His plan reminds me of much that was best in both then - Vice President Al Gore ’s and then - Texas Gov. George W. Bush ’s respective first speeches on the subject in 1999 , ” Mr. DiIulio said .
But the Rev. Barry W. Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , criticized Mr. Obama ’s support of a program that Mr. Lynn said had undermined civil liberties and civil rights .
“ I am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the Bush administration , ” Mr. Lynn said .
“ It ought to be shut down , not continued . ”
In one example of how he would use the approach to carry out a policy goal , Mr. Obama proposed $ 500 million per year to provide summer education for one million poor children , with a goal of closing the achievement gaps between wealthy students and poorer ones .
The campaign did not provide a cost proposal for the full program , but said the educational piece could be financed by reducing the growth in the federal travel budget and streamlining the management of surplus government property .
If elected , Mr. Obama said , he would call for a pre-inauguration review of all executive orders pertaining to the religion - based program , particularly those dealing with hiring .
The program would “ be central to our White House mission , ” he said , and would consider elevating the director of his Council for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to a cabinet - level post .
One problem that comes up time and again with multi- threaded code is how to transfer data from one thread to another .
For example , one common way to parallelize a serial algorithm is to split it into independent chunks and make a pipeline — each stage in the pipeline can be run on a separate thread , and each stage adds the data to the input queue for the next stage when it 's done .
For this to work properly , the input queue needs to be written so that data can safely be added by one thread and removed by another thread without corrupting the data structure .
Basic Thread Safety with a Mutex
The simplest way of doing this is just to put wrap a non -thread - safe queue , and protect it with a mutex ( the examples use the types and functions from the upcoming 1.35 release of Boost ) :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { private : std::queue < Data > the_queue ; mutable boost : : mutex the_mutex ; public : void push ( const Data& data ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; the_queue.push ( data ) ; } bool empty ( ) const { boost ::mutex ::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; return the_queue.empty ( ) ; } Data& front ( ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; return the_queue.front ( ) ; } Data const& front ( ) const { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; return the_queue.front ( ) ; } void pop ( ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; the_queue.pop ( ) ; } } ;
This design is subject to race conditions between calls to empty , front and pop if there is more than one thread removing items from the queue , but in a single - consumer system ( as being discussed here ) , this is not a problem .
There is , however , a downside to such a simple implementation : if your pipeline stages are running on separate threads , they likely have nothing to do if the queue is empty , so they end up with a wait loop :
while ( some_queue.empty ( ) ) { boost :: this_thread::sleep(boost::posix_time::milliseconds ( 50 ) ) ; }
Though the sleep avoids the high CPU consumption of a direct busy wait , there are still some obvious downsides to this formulation .
Firstly , the thread has to wake every 50 ms or so ( or whatever the sleep period is ) in order to lock the mutex , check the queue , and unlock the mutex , forcing a context switch .
Secondly , the sleep period imposes a limit on how fast the thread can respond to data being added to the queue — if the data is added just before the call to sleep , the thread will wait at least 50 ms before checking for data .
On average , the thread will only respond to data after about half the sleep time ( 25 ms here ) .
Waiting with a Condition Variable
As an alternative to continuously polling the state of the queue , the sleep in the wait loop can be replaced with a condition variable wait .
If the condition variable is notified in push when data is added to an empty queue , then the waiting thread will wake .
This requires access to the mutex used to protect the queue , so needs to be implemented as a member function of concurrent_queue :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { private : boost::condition_variable the_condition_variable ; public : void wait_for_data ( ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; while ( the_queue.empty ( ) ) { the_condition_variable.wait( lock ) ; } } void push ( Data const& data ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; bool const was_empty=the_queue.empty ( ) ; the_queue.push( data ) ; if ( was_empty ) { the_condition_variable.notify_one ( ) ; } } // rest as before } ;
There are three important things to note here .
Firstly , the lock variable is passed as a parameter to wait — this allows the condition variable implementation to atomically unlock the mutex and add the thread to the wait queue , so that another thread can update the protected data whilst the first thread waits .
Secondly , the condition variable wait is still inside a while loop — condition variables can be subject to spurious wake - ups , so it is important to check the actual condition being waited for when the call to wait returns .
Be careful when you notify
Thirdly , the call to notify_one comes after the data is pushed on the internal queue .
This avoids the waiting thread being notified if the call to the_queue .
push throws an exception .
As written , the call to notify_one is still within the protected region , which is potentially sub-optimal : the waiting thread might wake up immediately it is notified , and before the mutex is unlocked , in which case it will have to block when the mutex is reacquired on the exit from wait .
By rewriting the function so that the notification comes after the mutex is unlocked , the waiting thread will be able to acquire the mutex without blocking :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { public : void push ( Data const& data ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; bool const was_empty=the_queue.empty ( ) ; the_queue.push(data ) ; lock.unlock ( ) ; // unlock the mutex if ( was_empty ) { the_condition_variable.notify_one ( ) ; } } // rest as before } ;
Reducing the locking overhead
Though the use of a condition variable has improved the pushing and waiting side of the interface , the interface for the consumer thread still has to perform excessive locking : wait_for_data , front and pop all lock the mutex , yet they will be called in quick succession by the consumer thread .
By changing the consumer interface to a single wait_and_pop function , the extra lock / unlock calls can be avoided :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { public : void wait_and_pop ( Data& popped_value ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; while ( the_queue.empty ( ) ) { the_condition_variable.wait( lock ) ; } popped_value=the_queue.front ( ) ; the_queue.pop ( ) ; } // rest as before } ;
Using a reference parameter to receive the result is used to transfer ownership out of the queue in order to avoid the exception safety issues of returning data by - value : if the copy constructor of a by - value return throws , then the data has been removed from the queue , but is lost , whereas with this approach , the potentially problematic copy is performed prior to modifying the queue ( see Herb Sutter 's Guru Of The Week # 8 for a discussion of the issues ) .
This does , of course , require that an instance Data can be created by the calling code in order to receive the result , which is not always the case .
In those cases , it might be worth using something like boost : : optional to avoid this requirement .
Handling multiple consumers
As well as removing the locking overhead , the combined wait_and_pop function has another benefit — it automatically allows for multiple consumers .
Whereas the fine - grained nature of the separate functions makes them subject to race conditions without external locking ( one reason why the authors of the SGI STL advocate against making things like std :: vector thread - safe — you need external locking to do many common operations , which makes the internal locking just a waste of resources ) , the combined function safely handles concurrent calls .
If multiple threads are popping entries from a full queue , then they just get serialized inside wait_and_pop , and everything works fine .
If the queue is empty , then each thread in turn will block waiting on the condition variable .
When a new entry is added to the queue , one of the threads will wake and take the value , whilst the others keep blocking .
If more than one thread wakes ( e.g. with a spurious wake - up ) , or a new thread calls wait_and_pop concurrently , the while loop ensures that only one thread will do the pop , and the others will wait .
Update :
As commenter David notes below , using multiple consumers does have one problem : if there are several threads waiting when data is added , only one is woken .
Though this is exactly what you want if only one item is pushed onto the queue , if multiple items are pushed then it would be desirable if more than one thread could wake .
There are two solutions to this : use notify_all ( ) instead of notify_one ( ) when waking threads , or to call notify_one ( ) whenever any data is added to the queue , even if the queue is not currently empty .
If all threads are notified then the extra threads will see it as a spurious wake and resume waiting if there is n't enough data for them .
If we notify with every push ( ) then only the right number of threads are woken .
This is my preferred option : condition variable notify calls are pretty light - weight when there are no threads waiting .
The revised code looks like this :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { public : void push ( Data const& data ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; the_queue.push(data ) ; lock.unlock ( ) ; the_condition_variable.notify_one ( ) ; } // rest as before } ;
There is one benefit that the separate functions give over the combined one — the ability to check for an empty queue , and do something else if the queue is empty .
empty itself still works in the presence of multiple consumers , but the value that it returns is transitory — there is no guarantee that it will still apply by the time a thread calls wait_and_pop , whether it was true or false .
For this reason it is worth adding an additional function : try_pop , which returns true if there was a value to retrieve ( in which case it retrieves it ) , or false to indicate that the queue was empty .
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { public : bool try_pop ( Data& popped_value ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; if ( the_queue.empty ( ) ) { return false ; } popped_value=the_queue.front ( ) ; the_queue.pop ( ) ; return true ; } // rest as before } ;
By removing the separate front and pop functions , our simple naive implementation has now become a usable multiple producer , multiple consumer concurrent queue .
The Final Code
Here is the final code for a simple thread - safe multiple producer , multiple consumer queue :
template < typename Data > class concurrent_queue { private : std::queue < Data > the_queue ; mutable boost : : mutex the_mutex ; boost : : condition_variable the_condition_variable ; public : void push ( Data const& data ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; the_queue.push(data ) ; lock.unlock ( ) ; the_condition_variable.notify_one( ) ; } bool empty ( ) const { boost ::mutex ::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; return the_queue.empty ( ) ; } bool try_pop ( Data& popped_value ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; if ( the_queue.empty ( ) ) { return false ; } popped_value=the_queue.front ( ) ; the_queue.pop ( ) ; return true ; } void wait_and_pop ( Data& popped_value ) { boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( the_mutex ) ; while ( the_queue.empty ( ) ) { the_condition_variable.wait( lock ) ; } popped_value=the_queue.front ( ) ; the_queue.pop ( ) ; } } ;

A leading advisor to the U.S. military , the Rand Corporation , just released a new study called " How Terrorist Groups End : Lessons for Countering al Qa'ida " .
The report confirms what we have been saying for years : the war on terror is a hoax which is actually weakening national security ( see this , this and this ) .
As today 's press release about the study states :
" Terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals , not holy warriors , and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism . "
Can we drop the " war on terror " charade now ?
She and ADA Robin Godfrey got a cup of water from McDonald 's and were about to offer it to the little gray tabby when it abruptly dashed into Broad Street traffic and cuddled up with the front tire of a car that was stopped for a red light .

USA taxpayer dollars are funding activities that result in Iranians being killed and wounded and Iranian property destroyed -- acts of war .
By : Stephen Fox , Managing Editor Santa Fe Sun
End
-- from : http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/stephenfox/gG5kGvThe war between the United States and Iran is on .
American taxpayer dollars are being used , with the permission of Congress , to fund activities that result in Iranians being killed and wounded , and Iranian property destroyed .
This wanton violation of a nation 's sovereignty would not be tolerated if the tables were turned and Americans were being subjected to Iranian - funded covert actions that took the lives of Americans , on American soil , and destroyed American property and livelihood .
Many Americans remain unaware of what is transpiring abroad in their name .
Many of those who are cognizant of these activities are supportive of them , an outgrowth of misguided sentiment which holds Iran accountable for a list of grievances used by the U.S. government to justify the ongoing global war on terror .
Iran , we are told , is not just a nation pursuing nuclear weapons , but is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world today .
Much of the information behind this is being promulgated by Israel , which has a vested interest in seeing Iran neutralized as a potential threat .
But Israel is joined by another source , even more puzzling in terms of its broad - based acceptance in the world of American journalism : the Mujahadeen-e Khalk , or MEK , an Iranian opposition group sworn to overthrow the theocracy in Tehran .
The CIA today provides material support to the actions of the MEK inside Iran .
The recent spate of explosions in Iran , including a particularly devastating " accident " involving a military convoy transporting ammunition in downtown Tehran , appears to be linked to an MEK operation ; its agents working inside munitions manufacturing plants deliberately are committing acts of sabotage which lead to such explosions .
If CIA money and planning support are behind these actions , the agency 's backing constitutes nothing less than an act of war on the part of the United States against Iran .
The MEK traces its roots back to the CIA - orchestrated overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeg .
Formed among students and intellectuals , the MEK emerged in the 1960s as a serious threat to the reign of Reza Shah Pahlevi .
Facing brutal repression from the Shah 's secret police , the SAVAK , the MEK became expert at blending into Iranian society , forming a cellular organizational structure which made it virtually impossible to eradicate .
The MEK membership also became adept at gaining access to positions of sensitivity and authority .
When the Shah was overthrown in 1978 , the MEK played a major role and for a while worked hand in glove with the Islamic Revolution in crafting a post - Shah Iran .
In 1979 the MEK had a central role in orchestrating the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , and holding 55 Americans hostage for 444 days .
However , relations between the MEK and the Islamic regime in Tehran soured , and after the MEK staged a bloody coup attempt in 1981 , all ties were severed and the two sides engaged in a violent civil war .
Revolutionary Guard members who were active at that time have acknowledged how difficult it was to fight the MEK .
In the end , massive acts of arbitrary arrest , torture and executions were required to break the back of mainstream MEK activity in Iran , although even the Revolutionary Guard today admits the MEK remains active and is virtually impossible to completely eradicate .
It is this stubborn ability to survive and operate inside Iran , at a time when no other intelligence service can establish and maintain a meaningful agent network there , which makes the MEK such an asset to nations such as the United States and Israel .
The MEK is able to provide some useful intelligence ; however , its overall value as an intelligence resource is negatively impacted by the fact that it is the sole source of human intelligence in Iran .
As such , the group has taken to exaggerating and fabricating reports to serve its own political agenda .
In this way , there is little to differentiate the MEK from another Middle Eastern expatriate opposition group , the Iraqi National Congress , or INC , which infamously supplied inaccurate intelligence to the United States and other governments and helped influence the U.S. decision to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein .
Today , the MEK sees itself in a similar role , providing sole - sourced intelligence to the United States and Israel in an effort to facilitate American military operations against Iran and , eventually , to overthrow the Islamic regime in Tehran .
The current situation concerning the MEK would be laughable if it were not for the violent reality of that organization 's activities .
Upon its arrival in Iraq in 1986 , the group was placed under the control of Saddam Hussein 's Mukhabarat , or intelligence service .
The MEK was a heavily militarized organization and in 1988 participated in division - size military operations against Iran .
The organization represents no state and can be found on the U.S. State Department 's list of terrorist organizations , yet since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the MEK has been under the protection of the U.S. military .
Its fighters are even given " protected status " under the Geneva Conventions .
The MEK says its members in Iraq are refugees , not terrorists .
And yet one would be hard - pressed to find why the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees should confer refugee status on an active paramilitary organization that uses " refugee camps " inside Iraq as its bases .

To remedy all of this is to prevent war with Iran .
Truly , we must work to create a New Era of International Peace in Obama 's Administration , hopefully with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson as the next USA Secretary of State .
In the meantime , we must bring this premonition of war with Iran to a close , through our Congress , especially with a spotlight on these matters by Senator Obama , in his campaign , along with other realms vital to Americans , like Consumer Protection and a New United States Food and Drug Administration # # # Art Gallery , but primary purpose here is our consumer protection efforts , above all , getting aspartame banned and seeing a new Era of INternational Peace during Obama 's Presidency
A study by the boutique consultancy Voke finds corporate software development in a state of dysfunction marked by budget woes , protracted project lengths and dissatisfied end users .
But at the same time , enterprises are placing higher value on business analysts , who serve as an intermediary between line - of - business employees and development teams , gathering project requirements and acting as " the keeper of a consistent and agreed - upon vision of the applications being developed , " the report states .
Voke surveyed more than 125 people in business analyst roles , with about half working for companies with 5,000 or more employees .
Fifty percent of respondents said a typical project cost between US $ 1 million and $ 5 million , and 7 percent pegged it at more than $ 20 million .
As for labor , some 63 percent said it took less than 200 " person - months " to finish a project , while 38 percent said it took at least 2,000 .
Meanwhile , more than one - third of projects are abandoned after being implemented , and only 37 percent of finished projects met users ' needs .
" Everything we have been conditioned to believe indicates that project time is shrinking .
And while I believe this is true in highly optimized and mature organizations , I do think in - house development is fraught with problems , delays , and indecision , " Voke analyst Theresa Lanowitz said in an e-mail .
That could change as companies begin placing more emphasis on the role of business analysts .
About one - third of respondents said their company planned to hire more .
But the study also found that 45 percent of existing business analysts had previously worked in development and testing , with only 15 percent coming from the line of business .
As they add more analysts , companies should try to be more diverse in their choices , Lanowitz said .
Companies are also investigating the use of dedicated requirements gathering tools , the study found .
Right now , they are predominantly using Microsoft Word , " which results in large documents that are not easily reviewed , shared or amended , " and therefore contribute to failed projects , according to the study .

As Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has clinched the Democratic nomination , it seems that Black conservatives have even weighed in .
There are even Asian Republicans , Latino Republicans , and so forth .
Armstrong Williams , a black conservative radio host , is one such black Republican .
For all his life , Williams had never voted for a Democratic candidate .
However , Williams said that it could change with Obama as the presumed Democratic nominee .
It is obvious that black Democrats will be voting for Obama .
Obama seems to have created internal sparks within the group of black Republicans .
To them , this is the true battle of ethnicity and ideology .
“ That would mean that Williams may not necessarily vote for McCain .
It makes one curious to what most black Republicans are thinking in regards to the current state of the US Presidential Elections .
McCain is at risk of losing valuable voting blocs of the party .
Also , McCain has yet to receive the endorsement from the conservative bloc of the GOP .
He said that he would need support form that bloc .
But , not many are keen on McCain as their nominee .
The ball seems to in Obama ’s court at the moment .
Things can change , though .
Williams explains that his fellow constituents in private say that it will be difficult to vote against Obama in November .
This could also give a signal as to why McCain plans to attend the NAACP ’s annual convention in July .
Still , McCain has the difficult task of reaching out to black voters .
Former GOP Congressman from Oklahoma , J.C. Watts , says that he might vote for Obama .
Watts still stresses that he is still a Republican .
Though he does not agree with Democrats with the issues , Watts says that they at least reach out .
Watts said that he expects Obama to tackle the issues such as poverty and urban policy .
He said this is something that the GOP tends to act indifferently upon .
Watts said : “ Republicans often seem indifferent to those things . ”
But , this has been pretty interesting amongst black Republicans .
Perhaps like all other voting blocs , Obama might end up splitting that one apart .
Interestingly enough , there is a chance that black Republicans could possibly end up voting for presumed Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama of Illinois rather than presumed GOP nominee Senator John McCain of Arizona .
Black conservatives tend to vote Republican during elections .

I do n’t necessarily like his policies ; I do n’t like much that he advocates , but for the first time in my life , history thrusts me to really seriously think about it , ” Williams explains .
He adds : “ I can honestly say I have no idea who I ’m going to pull that for in November .
And to me , that ’s incredible .

Every gym has its share of grunters , groaners , heavy sweaters and hygiene queens .
And then there are the aerobics assailants .
Really loud grunting and groaning can be disturbing to other people at the gym .
" I take a cardio class at my gym and the other day a first - timer came in and stood about six inches in front of me , " says Olivia Giovetti , 22 , a Los Angeles administrative assistant .
" I asked her to move forward , but she just ignored me .
And when the workout started , she was all over me . "
Frustrated , Giovetti left .
The following week , she secured a spot on the opposite side of the room , hoping to avoid the onslaught of arms and legs .
It did n't help .
" She made a beeline right for me , " says Giovetti .
" She was grapevining into me , elbowing me .
At one point she just flat - out pushed me .
I 'm like , ' What 's going on ?
I 'm just trying to work out here ! ' "
Sticking to a workout schedule is never easy , but it 's harder still when you 're bombarded with bad gym behavior .
A quick look at user comments about health clubs on Yelp.com , a consumer - review Web site , reveals spats over sweaty equipment , personal space and wayward disinfectant .
Watch how to stay germ - free at gym »
Then there 's the New York lawsuit involving a screaming spin class participant who was forcibly upended on his stationary bike by a classmate fed up with his loud grunts and shouts of " You go , girl ! "
In June , jurors acquitted the defendant , stockbroker Christopher Carter , of assault charges in that incident .
Squabbling over space
Most bad behavior involves minor stuff like sweaty equipment or lecherous stares , says Jared Williams , 25 , a Seattle health club receptionist .
But he 's also seen full - blown wars , including a shouting match between two members over a weight machine .
" They were chest to chest yelling at each other , " says Williams .
" And by the time I finally got over there to break it up , they were wrestling .
We eventually had to escort [ one ] guy out of the gym and cancel his membership . "
Michael Feigin , host of the New York radio show " Fitness Guru " and founder of Half Moon Pilates , says territorial fights are the most common problem he 's witnessed in his 20 years in the business .
" People get very caught up in territorial disputes , " he says .
" If somebody takes ' their ' bike or ' their ' space , they 'll go off the charts in terms of their anger .
In the first studio I opened , I had a bylaw in the brochure that said no one space belonged to any one individual .
I put it on paper because that 's always such a huge dispute . "
Keep it down !
Personal space is just the tip of the iceberg .
Other irritants include oppressive body odor , excessive locker - room nudity , cardio caterwauling and those who serenade fellow exercisers with off - key howls .
" You 'll get people singing at the top of their lungs while they 're running on the treadmill , " says Feigin .
" They do n't do it consciously ; they 're just caught up in the energy .
But it 's a problem when it crosses the line and impinges on other people . "
Cindy Lauren , a 53 - year - old medical nonprofit director from Santa Monica , California , has a noise nightmare at her gym .
The former competitive bodybuilder says one member sounds like she 's having sex every time she lifts weights .
" You can hear her everywhere , " she says .
" She 'll have these little 5 - pound weights and she 'll be going ' Aaah , aaaaah , aaaaaaah ! ' like she 's having an orgasm .
The other members ' eye - rolling and face - making almost make it worth it , but it 's really irritating . "
Managing the jerks
What 's the best way to avoid an all - out gym war ?
Williams says to let management handle disagreements , especially those with the potential to turn ugly .
" You have people who are full of testosterone or are taking supplements and already hyped up when they come in to work out , " he says .
" When that mixes with an aggressive personality , you 've got somebody who can easily get into an altercation .
So if there 's a problem , it 's best to bring it to the attention of the people who work there .
It 's part of their job to deal with this stuff ; do n't try to tackle it yourself . "
But not all gyms will step in , says Giovetti , whose complaint about the aerobics assailant was met with indifference .
" I talked to gym management and they told me there was nothing they could do , " she says .
Code of conduct
Many clubs take great pains to keep the peace , offering towels , spray disinfectant , and signage reminding members to clean up after themselves and limit their use of cardio machines during busy times .
Club One Fitness Center in San Francisco even posts notices about behavior in the locker room .
" We try to promote a code of etiquette , " says 28 - year - old manager Karim Rahman .
" We have signs asking people to limit their cell phone use and not use their camera phones in the locker room -- just basic things to respect people 's privacy . "
But gyms are only partly responsible for a member 's happiness , says Pauline Wallin , a clinical psychologist from Camp Hill , Pennsylvania , and author of " Taming Your Inner Brat : A Guide for Transforming Self - Defeating Behavior . "
" There will always be people who are jerks -- people who take their workout way too seriously and feel entitled to do whatever they want , whenever they want because they 've paid their $ 29 a month , " she says .
" It 's up to you whether you let it bother you or not .
You can choose to join the jerk group , or to remain independent and happy . "
Want to avoid being a gym jerk or keep your sanity when others act up ?
Some simple rules :
• If your gym has a code of conduct , read and abide by it .
If you 've been breaking rules -- screaming , cussing , forgetting to clean up , cutting in -- apologize and move on .
People are usually forgiving if you own up to bad behavior .
If you see people breaking the rules but are leery of confronting them , tell management so they can do the heavy lifting .
• Always disinfect your equipment , and aim the spray carefully to avoid hitting your neighbor .
If someone else fails to do this , do n't assume they 're inconsiderate ; they may have forgotten .
• If someone 's making too much noise ( grunting , screaming , singing ) , politely ask them to keep it down .
If they refuse , take it to management or move to another part of the gym .
• Remember that you 're sharing space with hundreds of others .
You may have a favorite bench or treadmill , but it 's not yours .
Let someone share the machine with you by taking turns during your circuit of exercises and be conscious of time limits some gyms set on the use of equipment during peak hours .

St. Paul , MN – Advocates for Minnesota teens say they 're concerned about a rule change being considered by the White House that they 're convinced would limit access to birth control , at least for some .
Brigid Riley , executive director of the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting says it would make contraceptives less readily available to low - income and uninsured women .
" The Bush Administration is trying to put through a new regulation that would redefine when conception occurs and , through that , make illegal many types of birth control that Minnesotans are using . "
As Riley explains it , the proposal suggests a new , broader definition of " abortion " that would include the use of birth control pills .
She believes that if the regulation is adopted , it will have long - term consequences , particularly for those who rely on federal health programs .
" The birth control pill , the IUD and emergency contraception might all become unavailable – illegal – as a result , because of the change in definition of when pregnancy begins .
It would redefine a pregnancy to begin at conception .
With decreased access to contraception and emergency contraception , we would see increased numbers of unplanned pregnancies . "
Under the proposal , hospitals , researchers and medical schools would have to provide written certification of compliance with the rule as a funding requirement for any program run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
The Bush Administration says the new requirement is designed to make sure health care providers can't discriminate against their employees who object to abortion for religious or moral reasons .

IN my years as a cosmetic surgeon I have found that people will go to great lengths to achieve a certain ideal of beauty or masculinity .
I travel about once a month throughout the United States or overseas for meetings or to lecture .
I enjoy people and generally find myself chatting with seatmates .
But once a seatmate finds out what I do for a living , I have had some strange encounters .
In a medical office setting , there are specific protocols that are followed .
We do n’t talk about patients in the hallways , and everything is designed to keep a person ’s reason for a visit private .
But on a plane all bets are off .
Modesty takes a leap out the window .
And no one really cares about privacy .
Not only will very attractive people tell me every single thing they do n’t like about their looks , sometimes they will try to show me those body parts that for modesty ’s sake  and airline rules  really should remain within the confines of clothing .

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
It never came up in the GOP primaries .
The mainstream media wo n't dare mention it .
Even John McCain 's most liberal opponents wo n't go there .
But leave it to equal opportunity offenders brothers Evan and Gregg Spiridellis and their animation team at JibJab to introduce into the 2008 presidential campaign the allegations that John McCain cooperated with the enemy when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Not that most people will notice it .
The reference comes about one minute into the group 's latest campaign video , " Time for Some Campaignin ' , " when the McCain character sings that he " spent years in a rat hole in North Vietnam " over animated graphics showing him swinging in a bird cage --- a reference to the fact that McCain 's accusers refer to him as " Songbird . "
A charge as heinous as collaborating with the enemy may sound like liberal revenge for the Swiftboating of John Kerry by Republicans in 2004 , but the allegations against McCain come from conservatives , notably including former Rep. Bob Dornan of California and former Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire , both of whom are Republicans .
Here are the slides of my ZendCon talk about Lesser Known Security Problems in PHP Applications .
( PDF ) Lesser Known Security Problems in PHP Applications
ExxonMobil ( NYSE : XOM ) released earnings last week that turned some heads .
Thanks to record high prices for natural gas and oil , the integrated energy giant made $ 11.7 billion in the quarter -- the most profitable quarter for any public company ever .
And that angered some people .
Presidential candidate Barack Obama called Exxon 's money - making abilities " outrageous " over the weekend , as did Senator Joe Lieberman on Meet the Press .
And Obama proposed a $ 1,000 energy rebate for working couples that would be funded by " a windfall profits penalty on oil selling at or over $ 80 per barrel . "
Is such a move anti-capitalist , or necessary to return sanity to the market ?
Tim Hanson : Overlooked in the attack on Exxon 's record earnings is the fact that the company 's stock actually dropped on the report since it fell short of analyst expectations .
Further , the company 's net margin in the quarter was just 8.5 % , which ranks the company in just the 69th percentile in that category among all public companies .
That 's good , but not great , and certainly not worthy of a company deserving a " profit penalty . "
The fact is that oil exploration and production is a capital intensive and cyclical industry .
Thanks to sustained high prices in recent years , E&P companies have been able to search for and find reserves in places that were once uneconomical , such as the very deep water .
In 2006 , for example , Chevron ( NYSE : CVX ) , Devon Energy ( NYSE : DVN ) , and Statoil announced that they had drilled a successful test well called Jack 2 in the Gulf of Mexico through 7,000 feet of water and another 20,000 feet of earth .
It was hailed at the time as the largest U.S. oil find in 40 years .
Yet progress on the Jack project has been slow - going as a result of a lack of supply of deepwater rigs and , I would guess , uncertainty about the economics of extracting oil from such deepwater given the threat of an $ 80 per barrel price cap .
While the current energy crisis is painful , the solution is not price caps or profit penalties .
Rather , if we give entrepreneurs the opportunity to make money by finding creative ways to extract oil from exotic places or invent viable long - lasting batteries for electric cars , they will tap the capital markets and get after a solution .
In the meantime , as consumers , we need to adapt .
Joe Magyer : We Americans are a funny bunch .
Coca - Cola sells us sugar - water that rots our guts and fattens our children -- earning a near - 20 % rip in the process -- and we praise it as an American icon .
Exxon risks billions annually in the quest to provide us with essential hydrocarbons , facing down wily dictators and geological challenges worthy of a History Channel special in the process .
Its reward ?
Thin margins and being lambasted as the epitome of greed and corporate irresponsibility .
The biggest irony in this whole traveshamockery is that we 're all stakeholders in the success of Exxon and its Big Oil peers .
People tend to forget ( or ignore ) that Exxon , ConocoPhillips ( NYSE : COP ) , and friends are publicly traded companies .
That 's right : Exxon is n't a clandestine organization owned by a small group of Texans who boast world - class ivory collections .
If you 're invested in an index fund or part of a defined - benefit pension plan , you own ExxonMobil .
And your stake in Big Oil 's success does n't stop with your Exxon shares .
Did you enjoy your economic stimulus check ?
According to The Wall Street Journal , Exxon alone paid nearly $ 65 billion in U.S. taxes between 2003 and 2007 .
For perspective , that dwarfs the total tax bills paid by both Wal - Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) and General Electric .
Finally , chew on this :
You think gas prices are expensive now ?
Slap an arbitrary , reactionary windfall tax on oil at above $ 80 a barrel , and you 'll find out what real gas pains feel like .
Brian Richards :
This idea is a little bit like the McGriddle -- while I like the concept of bacon and eggs sandwiched between syrup - infused pancakes , the reality disappoints .
After all , the theory behind taxing the greedy oil barons and rewarding Joe Consumer sounds good -- who does n't like a good Robin Hood story ? -- but it 's a bit outdated .
For the record , I do n't think this will ever go through , even though the idea plays well to some voters .
For one ( and as both Tim and Joe point out ) , the entire basis for this tax is mistaken -- it looks at profits , rather than profit margins .
Exxon 's margins are almost half those of McDonald 's ( NYSE : MCD ) , for example .
( By the way , this windfall tax issue is n't unique to America -- BP ( NYSE : BP ) is facing the same issue . )
From gold to fertilizer , commodity prices have been on an absolute tear over the past year .
But with the costs of filling up a gas tank , heating your home , or racing your cigarette boat at very high levels , the tax issue is ( unsurprisingly ) being arbitrarily applied to one particular commodity -- oil .
As Warren Buffett recently said on CNBC , " I do n't think that picking anybody that 's had a commodity that 's increased in price a lot and saying that there 's a special tax because of that makes any sense . "
In other words :
Why not coal or steel or copper or the farmers benefiting from soaring food prices ?
Because even though they may do business in an identical fashion , and even though they may sell products that we need just as much as oil , and even though they may have better profit margins , they do n't have the gaudy , headline - inducing profits of an Exxon .
Finally , the U.S. tried a windfall profits tax in the 1980s , and it did n't work out so well .
Complying with the tax code was a burden for both the company and the IRS , and one study found that the tax back then had the effect of " increasing American dependence on foreign oil sources by 8 % to 16 % " because it decreased domestic production .
That 's one thing we definitely do not want .

Scott McClellan , the most significant defector from behind the Iron Curtain of the War Party ’s domain , does n’t think we were lied into war .
According to him , it was all due to the “ partisan ” attitudes that dominate Washington discourse on every issue .
As he puts it , “ the permanent campaign ” atmosphere made them do it : “ I do n’t think that this was some deliberate , conscious effort to mislead the American people . ”
In an interview with Keith Olbermann the other night , he disdained the very idea as a “ conspiracy theory . ”
McClellan seems to believe that the need to bias intelligence is inherent in the American political system , the inevitable consequence of the Washington ethos as defined by the struggle between the two major parties .
He denies any “ criminal intent ” in the actions of the administration and its flunkies , and he trivializes the matter by referring to “ people sitting around a table ” making plans to dupe Congress and the American people .
The evidence , however , points in the other direction , as “ Phase Two ” of the long - awaited and deliberately - delayed report of the Senate Intelligence Committee makes clear [ .pdf ] .
In spite of Keith ’s effusive reference to McClellan as “ the Rosetta Stone ” for helping us understand what we ’ve endured during the past eight years , the former White House spokesman seems incapable of deciphering what he saw and participated in , as the first section of the “ Phase Two ” Senate report shows .
All the prewar “ talking points ” of the administration , and the flimsy - to - nonexistent “ evidence ” used to back them up , are here debunked , and the pattern of deceit is all too clear .
However , it is the second section of the report  which deals with the activities of the Office of Special Plans and other parallel intelligence - gathering operations set up by the neocons  that suggests something more sinister than extreme partisanship is motivating the actors in this drama of deception .
In 2001 , as the wheels that would eventually drive us to war with Iraq began to turn , the groundwork was being laid for the inevitable denouement of that historic error : the present looming conflict with Iran .
Leafing through the story of the secret Rome meetings conducted by Michael Ledeen and Manucher Ghorbanifar  set up by a “ foreign intelligence service , ” as the report avers  this section of the Senate report reads like a spy thriller set in the future , a future in which we are about to go to war with Iran .
Neocon warlord Ledeen is n’t just one of the War Party ’s most tireless polemicists .
The fun part about being a foreign agent disguised as a “ commentator ” is that you get to rail away at the Bushies for not being enthusiastic enough about the Grand Plan of “ liberating ” the Middle East , demanding “ faster , please ! ”
Yet Ledeen is n’t just one of those armchair types who merely pontificates from his pundit ’s perch : this student of Italian fascism is a man - of - action , too .
Indeed , that ’s a considerable understatement .
He and Ghorbanifar are longtime partners in crime , having been the two biggest spiders at the center of the Iran - Contra web , in which Ledeen and Ghorbanifar deployed their contacts in Israel  and within the Iranian government  to broker the mid-1980s arms - for - hostages deal .
As the Senate report reveals , Ledeen and Ghorbanifar , together with a group centered around the Office of Special Plans  and including a former Pentagon official convicted of engaging in espionage on behalf of Israel  met with a group of Iranians and officials of a certain “ foreign intelligence service ” that is never named .
The purpose of the meeting : regime change in Iran .
The Office of Special Plans was one of several neocon-created “ parallel institutions ” designed to circumvent the ordinary vetting process for intelligence gathered by U.S. agencies .
Two analysts from the neocons ’
DoD policy shop , Harold Rhode and Larry Franklin , were assigned to the Rome meetings .
Franklin was once Douglas Feith ‘s top Iran analyst .
His career ended in 2005 when he was convicted of stealing U.S. state secrets on behalf of Israel .
Rhode , an expert on the Middle East , speaks a good number of languages , including Farsi , Turkish , and Hebrew , and was the key organizer for and advocate of the Iraqi National Congress in the U.S.
He was described by one CIA hand as “ living out of [ Ahmed ] Chalabi ’s office ” during his time in Iraq .
Indeed , Rhode served as Chalabi ’s American agent , rallying support for the American Enterprise Institute ’s Che Guevara when Chalabi ’s offices were raided by U.S. forces .
It later came out that Chalabi was doing just what Franklin was doing  stealing U.S. secrets on behalf of a foreign power .
In a UPI piece by Richard Sale , a “ former senior intelligence official ” who served in the Coalition Provisional Authority is quoted as saying that “ ‘ Rhode was observed by CIA operatives as being constantly on his cell phone to Israel , ’ and that the information that the intelligence officials overheard him passing to Israel was ‘ mind - boggling . ' ”
As for Franklin , his activities on behalf of the Israeli intelligence services , acting through the American - Israel Political Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , have been covered extensively in this space .
Together with Ledeen  founding president of JINSA  and Ghorbanifar , whose extensive and long - standing links to the Israelis are common knowledge , the provenance of this whole Rome operation seems beyond dispute .
The Senate report informs us that the Rome meetings were coordinated and facilitated by this mysterious , unnamed “ foreign intelligence ” entity , and then mentions the presence of at least one official of SISMI , a personal friend of Ledeen ’s , but the report ’s language is ambiguous  although it is n’t hard to figure out that the Italian connection is just a diversion .
So here we have American officials , without the full knowledge or consent of their superiors , including the president , traveling around on the taxpayers ’ dime , in concert with and apparently under the direction of the Israeli government , plotting regime change in Iran , and rehearsing all the talking points that we hear today from the Pentagon and the White House .
At one point , we are told , Ghorbanifar wrote down his plan for regime change on a napkin in a bar , telling Franklin he would need at least $ 5 million to start initial “ disruptions ” in and around Tehran , but that the bill would get higher as the “ revolution ” progressed .
The idea was to set up Ghorbanifar as the sponsor of an Iranian version of the Iraqi National Congress , a network that would disseminate intelligence on Tehran ’s inner workings as well as work to overthrow the regime .
As in the case of Chalabi , who bilked the U.S. out of millions , cash considerations figured prominently in the schemes of the Rome cabal .
At one point , the report informs us :
“ The proposed funding for and foreign involvement in Mr. Ghorbanifar ’s plan for regime change were never fully understood .
A synopsis of the Rome discussions averred that Ledeen and Ghorbanifar advised Mr. Franklin and Mr. Rhode that the [ foreign government support ] for this information collection opportunity and financing by [ foreign ] corporate enterprises midway through the interviews .
The costs would be in the millions . ”
The bill would be picked up by this not - so - mysterious “ foreign government ” generously supplemented by a “ multi-million dollar business deal that the foreign government arranged for the two Iranian interlocutors ”  and , of course , by the U.S. taxpayers .
Here is the quintessential neocon recipe for regime change , involving a lot of cash floating in a thick soup of ideology , with a bold flavor of espionage pervading the dish .
It ’s interesting that a lot of the most incriminating material was gleaned from interviews with Franklin , no doubt pried out of him with the charges of espionage hanging over him .
He was sentenced to a mere 12 years in prison and a hefty fine for delivering sensitive materials stolen from his Pentagon office to Israeli embassy officials .
Using AIPAC as the go - between , the Israelis ripped off intelligence about terrorist activities in Central Asia and U.S. operations in Iraq , and when Franklin was caught , he spilled the beans but good in a frantic effort to avoid spending the rest of his life in the big house .
Perhaps the release of the Senate report  and the starring role played in its narrative by Franklin , the convicted spy  will bring renewed attention to the case against Franklin ’s handlers , former AIPAC bigshot Steve Rosen , and the group ’s point man on Iran , Keith Weissman .
For years , the Justice Department has been trying to prosecute Rosen and Weissman without releasing vital U.S. secrets and compromising our national security .
The defense  the best money can buy  has engaged in a strategy of “ graymail ” from the beginning and stymied what are probably not the Justice Department ’s best efforts .
The chief prosecutor in the case recently announced he was leaving for greener pastures , and there has been a lot of political resistance to this case for all the usual reasons , and then some .
“ Oh , everyone does it , ” is the standard defense .
That ’s what Washington is all about : trading information .
Baloney .
These two were caught red - handed receiving vital U.S. secrets from Franklin and passing them on to their Israeli handlers in what was a classic spying operation .
That ’s not “ trading information , ” it ’s espionage .
It ’s embarrassing to have to point this out , but in the present atmosphere , in which any indication that Israel might be undermining the interests of its major benefactor is dismissed as evidence of resurgent anti-Semitism , the plain truth needs to be stated in unequivocal terms .
For years , I ’ve been saying that the only way to understand the Iraq war  a war that hurt , rather than advanced , American interests  is to see it as a successful covert action carried out by the Israelis and their American collaborators .
The “ Clean Break ” scenario , launched by American “ advisers ” to then - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , laid it all out in 1996 .
That was the theory , the practice of which is revealed in second section of the Senate intelligence report .
It ’s no accident that two individuals involved in creating that seminal blueprint for the “ transformation ” of the Middle East , Doug Feith and David Wurmser , are intimately connected with the activities examined in the Senate report .
The entire report is a goldmine of information that gives us a fascinating overview of the lies that lured us into war .
And lies they were , whatever McClellan may say or believe .
This is another mark of Empire : when the superpower , as the Old Right polemicist Garet Garrett pointed out more than half a century ago , is taken hostage by its own satellites .
A globe - spanning Empire becomes , in effect , “ a prisoner of history , ” driven by foreign lobbyists and their domestic constituencies , and is no longer cognizant of distinctly American interests .
Yes , we are prisoners of history .
Our invasion of Iraq has led directly to a looming confrontation with Iran , just as the war - planners knew it would .
What the second portion of the Senate report shows , however , is that we are also prisoners of the Israel lobby , which is inexorably pushing us into war with Iran .
That lobby exercises enormous power in Washington and beyond , effectively policing not only the media but the government for the least sign of “ anti- Israel ” ( i.e. , pro-American ) activity , relentless in pursuit of its goals  and its enemies .
Yet there is growing resistance to the Lobby ’s hegemony , especially within intelligence , counter - intelligence , and law enforcement circles .
They , after all , are expected to put up with Israeli shenanigans conducted on American soil and stand by while the White House and the Pentagon let our alleged best friends get away with the crown jewels , the family silver , and the quarters in the cookie jar to boot .
Now the Senate report has blown away much of their cover ; that and the recent exposure of Ben Ami Kadish , an Israeli spy handled by the same spook who directed Jonathan Pollard , constitute a double body - blow to Israel ’s fifth column in America  which is , today , just another name for the War Party and its top leadership .
As Ledeen might put it : “ Faster , please ! “

What a carry on doctor !
A newly qualified GP reveals what really happens behind surgery walls
By DR JONATHAN GOLDBERG
( Jonathan Goldberg is a pseudonym )
The work of a modern GP involves more than mere medicine and demands careful negotiation through a veritable minefield of pushy drug reps , bolshy patients , and fellow practitioners out to make a quick buck .
Here , JONATHAN GOLDBERG , who has been practising as a doctor for two years , reveals what really goes on in a GP 's surgery .
It makes for hilarious , but also sometimes unsettling , reading .
Annie is nine years old and about 13st .
She waddles into my room and then Mum waddles in after her .
My room suddenly feels very small .
' It 's her ankles , doctor .
They hurt when she runs at school .
She needs a note to say that she can sit out games . '
' Did you fall over or twist your ankle , Janine ? '
I ask .
Janine looks at the floor and then shakes her head .
' How long have they been sore ? '
Eyes still to the floor , though this time I get a shrug .
' Let 's have a look then . '
I give her my best ' smiley doctor ' face and prod and poke at her ankles .
Being a new qualified GP is n't all fun and games as one doctor reveals
My examination is a bit of a show ; one look at Janine walking into my room revealed it was n't her ankles that were the problem .
But still , I try to make my prodding and poking look like it has purpose : I want Janine and her mum to think I am taking them seriously .
' Right , well , I can't find any swelling or tenderness in those ankles , and she 's walking OK . '
This was the make - or - break moment - how was I going to put this tactfully ?
I was standing at the top of the diving board : I could just write the note , prescribe some paracetamol and climb quietly down the ladder . . . but as a doctor , it 's my duty to say something .
Right , here goes .
' Some children find that .
. . erm.. . that being a bit . . . erm ( say it , just say it ! ) overweight can make their joints hurt sometimes . '
I did it , I jumped !
Janine 's mum's face suddenly looks like a pitbull slowly chewing a wasp .
' It 's got nothing to do with her weight , ' she says .
' Janine 's cousin is as skinny as a rake and she has problems with her ankles , too .
It 's hereditary . '
Mum stares hard at me .
I blink first .
' She can still do swimming , ' I shout encouragingly as they waddle away , sick note and paracetamol prescription tucked into Mum 's handbag .
I picture Janine sitting in the changing rooms , munching on some crisps , while the rest of her class run around outside .
Beneath the many layers of abdominal fat , her pancreas is slowly preparing itself for a lifetime of insulin resistance and the debilitating symptoms of diabetes that will occur as a result .
Meanwhile , her joints will be straining under her excess weight and she 'll develop early onset arthritis .
Would a few well - placed words of advice really have breached deeply entrenched lifestyle and diet habits ?
' Hold on , kids , no more soft drinks and Turkey Twizzlers .
Dr Goldberg thinks we are overweight and thank goodness he pointed it out or we'd never have noticed .
He 's given me a wonderful recipe for an organic celery and sunflower seed bake and we 're swimming the Channel at the weekend . '
Lucy , the practice manager , pops her head around the door : ' I 've put you down for a visit to see Mrs Tucker .
She 's had a funny turn and fallen over .
Perhaps - you could diagnose her as having had a stroke ? '
It is January and our surgery targets are due in April .
None of our patients has had a stroke in the past nine months .
This should , of course , be a cause for celebration , but Lucy was not happy .
If no one has a stroke before April , we 'll miss out on our ' stroke target ' .
The Government tells us that if a patient has a stroke , we need to refer them to the stroke specialist and then we 'll get five points .
But if no one has a stroke , we miss out on the points and the money that comes with them .
This money has already been earmarked for a skiing holiday for the partner of the surgery and a nice little Easter bonus for the practice manager .
In the world of general practice , points really do mean prizes .
The role of a modern doctor involves more than just medicine
Mrs Tucker is 96 and lives in a nursing home .
She is severely demented and does n't know her own name .
In her confusion , she wanders around the nursing home and frequently falls .
She had fallen over again today and could well have had a mini-stroke .
She could just as easily have tripped .
She is fine now and common sense tells me that this lady would not benefit from a load of tests and new medications that , in the long run , would probably make her only more confused and more likely to fall over .
I can't help but feel that financial incentives to follow certain guidelines are tempting us to make clinical decisions that make us money rather than benefit the patient .
I do n't diagnose stroke .
Another day , another dilemma .
I 'd been asked to go on a home visit to see a patient I 'd never met .
Mr Tipton was in his 50s and complaining of a viral infection .
As I skimmed through his notes , one item stood out .
In between entries for a slightly high blood pressure reading and a chesty cough , one read ' six years ' imprisonment for child sex offences ' .
Mr Tipton was a paedophile and had only recently been released .
He lives in a 17 - storey tower block as grey and intimidating on the inside as it is on the outside .
After several minutes of knocking on the door , Mr Tipton answers .
Walking unsteadily with the aid of a Zimmer frame , he led me into the flat .
It was like nothing I had ever seen , with beer cans and cigarette butts in their hundreds , and a brown , sticky floor .
I try desperately to manoeuvre myself down the corridor without touching anything .
I don some gloves and half - heartedly prod his belly .
I make a few token comments about letting viruses take their course and then I flee .
When I call social services , I make it very clear I did n't think any more medical input was needed .
I could have done more both as a tor and as a human .
But as I red the squalor that was Mr Tips life , I had just two thoughts .
The first was : ' Serves you right , you filthyy paedo , ' closely followed by : ' How quickly can I get out of here and dump this problem on someone else ? '
The Hippocratic Oath tells us that it not our place to judge patients , but to treat each one as we would any other .
I agree with this in principle , but offering compassion to a paedophile covered in his own mess is n't easy .
We 're all influenced by appearances , of course .
Take drug companies , for example .
They are very good at overcharging us for medicine .
Millions of pounds are wasted by the NHS because doctors prescribe expensive drugs when they could choose a much cheaper version of the same thing .
Hoodwinking
How do the pharmaceutical companies hoodwink us into doing that ?
Young and attractive drug reps buy us lunch or even take us out for dinner at posh restaurants , then feed us biased information on why we should use their more expensive medicine and give us free pens sporting their brand .
In the U.S. , pharmaceutical companies employ former American football players and cheerleaders to do this .
Like everyone else , doctors are suckers for a pretty face .
The attractive female reps are sent to sell their products to the predominantly male surgical consultants , while the pretty - boy male reps sell to the more female - dominated obstetric and paediatric departments .
Fortunately , in this country our retired sports stars tend to fall ungracefully into alcoholism and gambling addiction rather than trying to sell us over - priced medicines .
At one dispensing practice I worked for , I was shocked when the partners passed round a list of the medications that we were ' encouraged ' to prescribe .
One of these was the antidepressant Seroxat , which has recently had a huge amount of justifiably bad press .
The manufacturer was accused of hiding evidence that its use has been linked with higher suicide rates in young people .
Despite this , the partners were encouraging us to prescribe it over safer , cheaper and equally effective anti-depressant alternatives .
When I questioned this , I was told the dispensary ( i.e. the partners ) , make only a penny on every prescription of Prozac they dispense , but £ 1 profit on every Seroxat prescription .
As well as constant pressure from drug reps , GPs also face resistance from patients when trying to change medication .
Whenever I can , I try to switch my patients from the more expensive medicines to cheaper equivalents .
One elderly lady once stormed into my surgery furious that I had changed her medicine :
' You told me that the new medicine was the same as the old one ! '
' Yes , that 's right , Mrs Goodson - same medicine , different name . '
' Well , I know that 's nonsense because when I try to flush these tablets down the toilet , they do n't float like the old ones did !'
A good doctor
So what makes a good doctor ?
At my medical school interview , the panel yawned as I spouted some naive nonsense about being caring and good at working in a team .
During my training year after medical school , I saw a middle - aged woman with stomach pains .
I referred her urgently to the hospital because I thought she might have stomach cancer .
She was seen within a week and turned out to have bad indigestion .
The consultant sent me a snotty letter suggesting I 'd made an inappropriate ( and expensive ) referral , causing unnecessary anxiety to the patient .
The patient and her husband , however , think I am a saint ( ' That wonderful Dr Goldberg arranged for me to be seen so quickly ' ) .
Most of us have an idea when we 're being good or bad doctors .
On a Friday afternoon , when I 'm drained and focused on the weekend , I 'm a rubbish doctor .
I prescribe antibiotics for colds .
I sign inappropriate sick certificates and dish out sleeping pills as if they were sweets .
I 'll usually give my patients anything they want if it helps me get to home on time .
As GPs , we are supposed to be the ' gatekeepers of the NHS ' , but it is much easier to leave the gate permanently ajar rather than carefully defend the NHS waiting lists by fending off the worried well .
I 'm very popular with my patients on a Friday afternoon because they are getting what they want , but I 'm certainly not practising good medicine .
But good medicine can come in many forms - and not all of them in a foil - backed pill packet .
Sometimes , kindness is the best doctor .
Like parents , doctors are not supposed to have favourites , but I am rather fond of Mrs Peacock .
She is well into her 80s and her memory has been deteriorating over the past few years .
Most weeks she develops a medical problem and calls up the surgery , requesting me to visit .
When I arrive , the problem has been resolved or at least forgotten , and I end up changing the fuse on the washing machine or helping her to find her address book which we eventually locate in the fridge .
Social support
I imagine the grumbling taxpayer would n't be too pleased to know that having forked out more than £ 250,000 to put me through my medical school training , they are now paying my wages of £ 70 an hour for me to try ineptly to recall which coloured wire is earth in Mrs Peacock 's ageing plug .
What she needs a bit of social support - much more than she needs a doctor - so when I return to the surgery I spend 30 minutes trying to get through to social services on the phone .
When I finally do , I am told that due to her dementia , Mrs Peacock needs a psychiatric assessment before they can offer any assistance .
The psychiatrist is off sick with depression and the waiting list to see the stand - in psychiatrist is three months .
I 'm also reminded that she 'll need to have had a long list of expensive tests to exclude a medical cause for her memory loss .
Three months and many normal test results later , Mrs Peacock forgot to go to her appointment and had to return to the back of the queue .
Through no fault of her own , Mrs Peacock has cost the NHS a small fortune .
Her heart scan , blood tests and hospital appointments all cost money and we GPs do n't come cheap , either .
She does have mild dementia but , more importantly , she is lonely .
She needs someone to pop in for a cup of tea from time to time and remind her to feed her long - suffering cat .
Meanwhile , I 'll continue to visit and provide practical support .
I guess this is what is called Vocation .
- Taliban win over locals at the gates of Kabul
- Thatcher dementia fight revealed
Meat Industry Calls Tory Labelling Plan ' Dangerous '
The Taliban are winning the hearts of the Afghan people back ... you have to wonder exactly who it is that Canadian soldiers are dying for ?
Margaret
Thatcher 's daughter has revealed that her mother is battling dementia ... ( I think I will just bite my tongue on this one ! )
Conservative ideology could be dangerous to your families health !
Harper inisist that he wants to help companies " take the lead in fulfilling their responsibility for consumer protection , " ... meanwhile ...
Canadians die !
Michael CHABON , the author of novels such as the exuberant , Pulitzer - winning “ The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay ” and “ The Yiddish Policemen ’s Union , ” an alternate - universe story that recently won the Nebula Award , has long harbored a passion : to make the literary world safe for genre fiction , and to expand the notion of what a serious work of fiction can be .
“ Entertainment has a bad name , ” begins the opening essay of his new collection “ Maps and Legends , ” called “ Trickster in a Suit of Lights . ”
“ Serious people learn to mistrust and even revile it .
The word wears spandex , pasties , a leisure suit studded with blinking lights . ”
We spoke to Chabon , 45 , from his home in Berkeley about his crusade to save comics , science fiction , fantasy , horror and detective fiction from condescension .
Let ’s start with some of the pulp or genre writers who have spoken to you over the years and perhaps inspired your own books .
There are so many .
Raymond Chandler , Ross Macdonald , Ross Thomas , Ursula K. Le Guin , Frank Herbert , Michael Moorcock , Ray Bradbury , Jack Kirby , Steve Gerber , Alan Moore .
And there are a whole list of borderland writers -- John Crowley , Jorge Luis Borges , Stephen Millhauser , Thomas Pynchon -- writers who can dwell between worlds .

Where did this bias against work created for a popular audience come from ?
In all fairness , it came from the fact that the vast preponderance of art created for a mass audience is crap .
It ’s impossible to ignore that .
But the vast preponderance of work written as literary art is high - toned crap .
The proportion may settle down in the neighborhood of 90/10 -- Sturgeon ’s Law said that 90 % of everything is crud .
Let ’s talk about this in a specific instance -- Cormac McCarthy ’s novel “ The Road ” and its reception .
I thought it was an excellent novel .
The least interesting thing to me as a reader was that it was science fiction .
It presented a very pure example of post - apocalyptic literature , pared down to the essentials of a post - apocalyptic vision .
But it ’s nothing that anybody reading science fiction over the last 60 or 70 years has n’t seen done many , many times before -- maybe not by writers of McCarthy ’s caliber .
Advertisement
In terms of the vision it was presenting , it was notable only for the intense , McCarthy severity .
In fact , I responded to it much more as a work of horror fiction .
But the response you saw out there generally was the sort of oh - my - God is n’t this incredible , Cormac McCarthy has written a science fiction novel !
Sometimes a little bit of a panic sets in , where critics are n’t sure what to do about it or say about it .
And when this happens , when a writer of unassailable literary reputation , like McCarthy , does produce a work of genre fiction , under his own name , unlike say John Banville , the critical machine prints out and issues a pass to a writer : “ This is n’t science fiction , because it was written by Cormac McCarthy . ”
Or , “ We think all science fiction is bad , unless it ’s written by a Margaret Atwood or Cormac McCarthy . ”
In some ways the book may be closer to a work of prophecy , biblical prophecy , than anything else , and that ’s what we ’re responding to .
Advertisement
Ultimately with any great work of art , whether it was written by a Ray Bradbury or a Philip K. Dick or Cormac McCarthy , it ’s really the intensity with which it ’s been imagined and been brought into language .
The conventional argument is that the literary writer ’s work is well imagined , well written , and the genre author ca n’t write .
Every so often a writer hacks and crawls out of the brambles of genre .
Somebody like Philip K . Dick clearly began in the pulps , writing mass commercial fiction .
Almost by dint of the passion of his fans , and the intensity of his vision , and all of that stuff , eventually he ends up getting canonized in Library of America .
But those are much more the exceptions .
Dick made that transition in a big way .
He had intelligence , vision and so on -- without ever becoming what you ’d traditionally call a good writer .
Advertisement
He wrote much too quickly , there ’s no doubt about that .
The pressure to write quickly is not good for any writer , no matter how gifted and intelligent , and it was n’t good for him .
I wonder if Philip Pullman ’s tendency to fall between categories with the “ His Dark Materials ” books -- they ’re kind of kids books , kind of for adults , kind of fantasy , kind of literary -- made it hard for the movie of “ The Golden Compass ” to find an audience .
Maybe , but maybe it ’s that the movie was n’t that great .
To me that ’s what makes a writer interesting :
When a writer is sort of like a ball bearing caught between the magnetic fields , all positioned just right so the ball bearing floats in the air , wobbling because it ’s in this highly excited position , barely holding its place .
You see that in Pullman at his best .
Pullman sort of , in a sense , may come back to the idea of pressure to publish frequently .
He ’s written other good books , for young readers , but he was on a more traditional publishing schedule , turning out books very regularly , in series .
Advertisement
But then he hit “ The Golden Compass ” and he slowed down and took his time .
Not to say that great works of literature have n’t been written in very brief periods of time .
Sometimes the words come tumbling out in this white heat of composition .
It ’s not a reliable indicator , but sometimes it ’s what separates a routine or genre writer from one we see as “ a true artist . ”
I wonder if national origins have a role in this .
This country was founded by Puritans , who considered any kind of aesthetic pleasure to be idolatry .
While Britain evolved out of a tradition of myths and legends and folk tales , which you can see in Tolkien and elsewhere .
They may be less eager to make those kinds of distinctions and keep them rigid .
When I look at the British pop charts , for example , I ’m always surprised at the British Top 40 and what a strange mixture of incredibly refined and edgy kinds of taste are represented there alongside pap and stuff that you would never see here .
It ’s mixed together in this wonderful jumble that seems a lot less stratified .
Some of that same sensibility might be reflected in literature as well .
Advertisement
It ’s certainly true in other countries .
It ’s not an accident that we had the auteur theory developing in France :
Those critics were watching Hitchcock films and John Ford films and Howard Hawks films and westerns and crime films and decided that they were clearly great works of art .
H.P. Lovecraft too was acclaimed as a great American writer in France much sooner than here .
When the Library of America included Lovecraft , there were a lot of people here who were smirking about it .
It seems like behind your essays is this larger argument about childhood , which you seem to think our culture has misunderstood in some ways .
Childhood is a subject I talk about a lot .
I have n’t thought it through to know how much it has to do with what I ’m saying about fiction and the short story .
But there is unquestionably a connection for me between the maps I encountered as a young reader -- the endpaper maps -- and the maps I created for himself , both literally drew myself , of imaginary lands I was trying to bring into existence , and the internal maps I was creating of the world that I lived in , the world that I played in -- the neighborhood .
. . .
Where the mean dogs were , where the mean dads were , where the bad kids hung out .
All of that was intimately connected in my mind with what I was reading .
I do n’t think there ’s any question that kids are n’t sent out to play with the same kind of freedom anymore , at least not where I live .
I would say , “ Bye , Mom , ” and I ’d be gone all day long .
It felt like such a porous boundary , between my physical world , in which I enacted my imaginary games , and the world I was reading about in the books I loved .
They fed each other .
What happens when you take out one huge part of that -- what happens to kids ’ imaginations ?
Advertisement
And when you talk about crossing boundaries , seamlessly flipping from the imaginary to the real and back again , that ’s what I ’m looking at with the writers I love .
In some ways the traditional highbrow argument can seem rather silly : “ If we do n’t privilege and protect certain kind of work , it ’ll all be ‘ American Idol ’ all the time . ”
That the forces of commercial culture will swamp all the good stuff .
Unquestionably -- it ’s not just futile , it ’s ultimately destructive to try to fence things in that way .
Robert Frost said , “ Something there is that does not love a wall . ”

With all the hype about the biggest football transaction of the year that never materialized , and United 's Champion 's League title , many people have put Lionel Messi on a second level and Cristiano Ronaldo on the throne by himself .
True , Ronaldo won both the European Cup and the Premier League title convincingly while Barcelona ended the year with only disappointment , but that does n't change the fact that Messi is just a better player than Ronaldo .
Here are five convincing reasons why :
1 ) Messi is and has always been more of a team player than the Portuguese star .
Ronaldo has received heat about his selfish play and while it is true that Diego Maradona called Messi a bit selfish in the last few weeks , the Argentinian does not reach the ridiculous levels Ronaldo can sometimes achieve .
2 ) Age at this point in the two superstars ' careers is a very underrated factor .
Messi is two years younger than Ronaldo .
Usually this is not a considerable difference , but compare Ronaldo from two years ago to today , and you will definitely see a difference .
Additionally , the maturity level of a 21 - year - old player to a 23 - year - old is significant .
For proof of this look at Ronaldinho , who did n't really reach his peak until he was about 25 .
3 ) To most fans the integrity of the game is a big topic .
Diving always takes away from the honesty and beauty of football , and unfortunately , Cristiano Ronaldo has perfected the art of diving as much as Olympic gold medalist Matthew Mitcham .
Messi , on the other hand , is a warrior .
His small frame seems easy to take down .
However , it appears like he always runs between someone 's legs or stays on his knees to keep a play going instead of splashing onto what some dream to be a huge green swimming pool .
Another point for the Argentine .
4 ) Success with the national team is always key , especially when one speaks of Argentina or Portugal , and this is where Messi has the largest advantage .
At only 21 , the South American prodigy has won an U - 20 World Cup , an Olympic gold medal , and has reached a Copa America final .
Ronaldo , at 23 , has been to one Euro final as the host , and that was four years ago , when Figo was still king in Portugal .
It just always seems like Ronaldo ends up owing Portuguese fans a little more , while Messi , at his very young age , has given them plenty to gloat about .
5 ) Attitude is the single most important attribute in sports .
Messi has it all .
The way he takes punishment and keeps going and his never - say - die mentality are admirable .
You will never see Lionel Messi on the ground unless really injured , or with his head down before the end of a game , or even jogging if there is any remote chance of getting to a ball that 's seemingly unreachable .
Now take a look at Ronaldo .
While his talent and potential are unreal , we see images too often of him crying , arguing , or just throwing tantrums that take away from his abilities and his team 's chemistry .
Diving and attitude go hand in hand , which is why it is normal to see Ronaldo on the floor for several minutes , and almost impossible to see Messi in the same situation .
All in all , I think Messi deserves to be put at a higher level than Ronaldo .
He 's just a better player .

Kernel wireless maintainer John Linville outlined the past , present , and future of the Linux wireless stack on the first day of this year 's Ottawa Linux Symposium .
In his presentation , he ranged from early efforts , which were " a sore spot for Linux " to the future where it is likely that Linux will have support for some features before " that other OS " .
Along the way , he looked at various issues that wireless support in Linux faces , including vendor participation , suspend and resume , and regulatory issues .
Linville has been the maintainer Linux wireless for two and a half years since being recruited into the job by David Miller and Jeff Garzik .
When he took over , wireless support was in disarray , as there were competing stacks to support different hardware .
Users were faced with lots of pain in getting things working when " they just want their hardware to work " said Linville .
Since that time , things have greatly changed .
The original wireless hardware was what is called " Full MAC hardware " , where the implementation of the wireless protocols was handled by the hardware , generally in firmware .
The drivers made these devices appear to be regular wired ethernet devices , though they did require some special configuration for SSID and the like .
Because the hardware would enforce various regulatory requirements , vendors would generally work with the community in order to support the hardware .
All of that changed with the advent of " Soft MAC hardware " — which Linville likened to winmodems — where the CPU implements most of the protocol .
It is a cheaper solution for vendors , but it requires an 802.11 stack for the kernel .
The ieee80211 drivers came along to support the Intel Centrino wireless hardware , but they only supported those few devices .
Johannes Berg added the ieee80211 softmac driver that added some additional hardware support , but it was a kludgy solution .
Since then , Linville said , folks have realized that it was " sort of a mistake to go down that road " .
Enter the Devicescape stack .
It was a feature rich 802.11 stack for Linux that was popular with developers .
After some locking and SMP problems were resolved , it was merged into 2.6.22 as the mac80211 driver .
Once that happened , wireless drivers started using it , to the point where Linville showed a chart of the current drivers , almost all of which use mac80211 .
" It 's been a boon to us to pick up the mac80211 code . "
One notable driver that does not support mac80211 is the libertas driver for the OLPC .
Unlike most other current devices , it is a Full MAC device with special requirements .
It has support for power saving modes that do not yet exist in mac80211 .
Because it is a mesh - networking device that still participates in forwarding network traffic when the system is powered down , it has needs that are not yet supported .
Drivers in progress was the next topic Linville addressed .
Several of these are in need of developers to work on them , specifically for the Airgo chipset and Atmel USB chipset .
The TI chipset drivers have had some questions raised about the reverse engineering process and may require a legal vetting similar to what the SFLC did for ath5 k .
Marvell is sponsoring development of a mac80211 based driver for its hardware .
This driver may also support 802.11n which allows for greater range and higher speeds than current - generation 802.11 .
Using data from LWN , Linville looked at the activity level of the wireless development in Linux .
He was amazed to note " how much of the 2.6.26 kernel came through this laptop " .
Using his Signed - off - by as a proxy for wireless LAN commits , he noted 4.3 - 5.6 % of the kernel commits in the last three releases ( .24 through . 26 ) were for wireless .
In each kernel , wireless was either the fourth or fifth highest number of commits .
The compat - wireless - 2.6 project is aimed at supporting newer hardware in older kernels .
Because folks are wary of running kernel.org kernels or their distribution supports an older kernel — but they want to run with the latest hardware — the project backports wireless drivers to kernels as old as 2.6.21 .
It is a set of scripts and patches that build against the user 's kernel .
Unfortunately , the project may not last much longer as the multiqueue changes that have been merged for 2.6.27 may change the drivers enough that they will be infeasible to backport .
At the top of the list for new features is removal of the wireless extensions in favor of the new cfg80211 mechanism .
According to Linville , " nobody likes wireless extensions , and nobody likes the existing tools " .
The wireless extensions have vague semantics , can have problems with race conditions , and because they are implemented by ioctl ( ) calls , they encourage duplication of code in multiple drivers .
cfg80211 will bring a much cleaner API along with fixing some existing bugs like the 31 character limit for SSIDs .
Access point ( AP ) mode is another feature that is coming .
Typically , APs use similar or identical hardware to that in wireless MACs .
For Soft MAC hardware , all that is needed is support on the CPU side for AP mode , which is coming for mac80211 .
Mesh networking , which has been popularized by the OLPC project , is also coming to mac80211 .
Cozybit has provided an implementation which will allow Linux to have a feature unavailable for Windows .
Areas that are needed , but are not yet being worked on was next on Linville 's agenda .
Suspend and resume support is " flawed for mac80211 due to connection management issues " .
Because mac80211 is unaware of suspend and resume , drivers must work around it by de-registering and re-registering with it , which can be slow .
Adding support for suspend and resume is on the list , as is supporting power saving modes .
Linville went on to discuss three big issues that are largely outside of the control of the wireless hackers : firmware licensing , vendor participation , and regulatory concerns .
Because drivers for Windows come with the firmware in the driver , many hardware vendors do not license the firmware blob separately .
This means that it is unclear what can be done with those blobs .
Certain vendors — Intel and Ralink were specifically called out — provide liberal licenses for their firmware .
Users are encouraged to " vote with your dollars " by purchasing devices that either do not require firmware or that have a clear , free software friendly license .
Another consideration when deciding which vendors to support is whether they are engaged with the community .
For the most part , all vendors but Broadcom are working with the wireless hackers by providing documentation and / or source code .
Some are even providing dedicated developers to work on Linux drivers —
Intel was the first , but both Atheros ( which just released a driver for its ath9k hardware ) and Marvell have also begun doing that .
Government regulations about what can and cannot be done in the unlicensed frequencies used by wireless are a concern that is frequently cited by vendors when refusing to work with the community .
Unfortunately , their concerns are not completely without merit as hardware vendors are expected to ensure compliance with the regulations .
" Non -compliance could be a huge loss " for those companies .
As Linville points out , though , most vendors find a way to support Linux drivers .
In answer to a question , Linville said that most WiMAX and 3G wireless devices are Full MAC designs , so there should be little or no regulatory concern , which , in turn , means that Linux support should not be much of a problem — at least until Soft MAC devices come along .
Overall , Linux wireless has come a long way , but there is lots still to do .
One gets the sense that the wireless team is up to the task .
Blood tests have revealed that Mr Wright has abnormally high levels of the female hormone oestrogen .
But doctors who have examined him say they have never seen such a case – and do not know what to do to reverse the process .
Confessions of a Gear Head

I love cars , but I also love it when the market weeds out the lousy carmakers .
Being a libertarian , I ’m often accused of being pro-business , which is absurd .
I ’m a believer in free markets , and an essential tenet of free - market thinking is that businesses must be free to fail if they are insufficiently responsive to the needs of the consumer .
I love it when lousy businesses fail .
Unfortunately , politicians from both parties often try to use taxpayer subsidies and government - enforced protections to help out their favorite businesses or to keep them from falling into the " wrong " hands .
For instance , Missouri ’s Democratic senator and Republican governor both recently tried , unsuccessfully , to use their influence to stop the sale of St. Louis - based Anheuser - Busch to Belgian - based booze giant InBev .
Anyone who has ever tasted the flavorless pale - yellow concoctions sold by the company known for its Clydesdale horses would be shocked that anyone would want to buy the firm responsible for them , rather than tar - and - feather those who ran it .
I ’m interested in beer , but passionate about automobiles .
Yet even when it comes to cars , I would in no way want the government to interfere in the market process .
Instead of worrying about the ongoing plight of the Big Three American automobile manufacturers , I celebrate it .
Companies that have operated more like regulated utilities than entrepreneurial organizations deserve to have tough times .
Companies that prefer bean - counters to creative managers and that mortgage their future to give in to absurd union demands deserve to lose market share and to face sinking stock values .
Companies that care about other things more than they care about the consumer deserve to fail .
Good riddance to them .
Better companies will rise up to fill the void , even if they are based in India or China .
" Who shot General Motors ? " asked author Roger Lowenstein in a July 10 column in The New York Times .
His answer : " The immediate cause of GM ’s distress , of course , is the surging price of oil , which has put a chill on the sale of gas - guzzling sport utility vehicles and trucks .
The company ’s failure to invest early enough in hybrids is another culprit .
Years of poor car design is another .
But none of GM ’s management miscues was so damaging to its long - term fate as the rich pensions and health care that robbed General Motors of its financial flexibility and , ultimately , of its cash . "
Toyota , which will soon be the world ’s largest auto company , is concerned that U.S. government officials will bail out the ailing Michigan - based corporate giant .
Toyota officials say they wish GM the best because of the need for competition , but it ’s easy to understand the Japanese company ’s real fear : political meddling that will hamper better - quality overseas makers and politicians who will exploit nationalism with some absurd " Buy American " campaign .
But political meddling will only reward those companies that have made the worst decisions .
Why should the government punish those companies that have done the best to serve the auto - buying public ?
GM , Ford and Chrysler all deserve their current fate .
Ford officials recently announced that they would start designing more fuel - efficient cars .
" What we really need to do is tell people that we ’re back in the car business , " said Ford ’s president of the America ’s Mark Fields , according to an Associated Press article last week .
Yet I recall Ford ’s smugness when it was raking in huge profits from its mega-SUVs and full - size pick - up trucks and ignoring the automobile side of the business .
I ’ve got nothing against big trucks , but I have everything against foolish corporate officials who are incapable of anticipating market changes .
Somehow , Toyota and Honda managed to bring out new lines of smaller cars as gas prices headed north of $ 4 a gallon .
But do n’t worry , Ford — which is now losing money , and might soon face Chapter 11 — will start coming up with new cars we might someday want to buy !
But it takes quite a while to bring new products to market .
Chrysler , by the way , is n’t in any better shape — which will not surprise anyone who has recently looked at the firm ’s ungainly offerings .
As the blog , The Truth About Cars , explained , Chrysler ’s plan is to " become a distributor of cars made by others .
Someone .
Anyone . "
That may not be a bad idea , given that GM has been introducing some critically acclaimed new models that are basically European Opels or Australian Holdens .
If you ca n’t come up with a good design in Detroit , you might as well go elsewhere .
But corporate innovators tend to do better over time than followers .
Part of the problem , in my view , is that U.S. automakers cannot improve their situation overnight because it takes a long time to create a good reputation for long - term quality and reliability .
Even if , say , the latest Pontiac model is better than a comparable Honda , a buyer still might go with the Honda given that brand ’s exceedingly high resale values , which are a reflection of Honda ’s reputation for building cars that rack up 300,000 miles .
In fact , part of the domestic automakers ’ current financial gloom is directly the result of their inattention to long - term resale issues .
Last month , Ford wrote off more than $ 2 billion in losses because the residual values of its returned leased vehicles are so much lower than predicted .
With leasing , a buyer pays the difference between the selling price and the residual value ( the estimate of what it will be worth when the lease is up ) plus some financing and other costs .
Domestic manufacturers generally have worse lease deals than imports because of lower residuals / resale values ( that means you have to pay a higher amount between the sale price and the residual ) , but they have been hammered in recent months because the big SUVs and trucks they have so long relied upon are now virtually worthless as buyers turn them in at lease end .
It just keeps getting worse for the Big Three .
But , again , this is good news for consumers .
First , when the manufacturers can’t get rid of their cars , buyers can negotiate better deals .
Just as the subprime housing mess is a blessing for home buyers ( it ’s only a crisis for sellers and the banks that stupidly handed out loans to the credit - unworthy ) , the falling value of domestic vehicles is good news for anyone who still wants that Expedition or Tahoe .
Second , there ’s nothing like failure to force companies to change their ways and make products that respond to the fickle consumer .
If the domestic manufacturers were government agencies or regulated monopolies they would behave as such agencies .
They would continue to provide less - than - desirable products , offer shoddy service and increase their prices whenever they overspent their budgets .
Governments and government - enforced monopolies can do that because consumers have no options .
GM has tried to act like a government , but it ca n’t ignore that the day of reckoning is coming .
The key to capitalism is competition and the potential for failure .
That ’s why most carmakers keep offering more features and better products each model year .
If they do n’t , they will lose out to other makers .
If they do n’t fear failure , then they wo n’t desperately seek to win over the buyer .
In some ways capitalism is an anti-business philosophy , because there ’s nothing businesses hate more than fierce competition and the threat of bankruptcy .

An FDA advisory panel has recommended that warning labels for the flu drug Tamiflu be amended to emphasize that the reported side effects might also occur in flu patients who are not taking the drug .
After reports of nearly 600 psychiatric side effects since the drug 's introduction in 1999 , the FDA asked an advisory panel to review whether the warning label on Tamiflu should be strengthened .
The use of Tamiflu has been heaviest in Japan , where there have been reports of at least 14 deaths due to neuropsychiatric symptoms among flu patients taking the drug .
According to the FDA , five children under the age of 17 died after " falling from windows or balconies or running into traffic .
" There have been a total of 25 deaths linked to Tamiflu , three of them in the United States .
Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , is an anti-viral medication that can be used to treat or prevent influenza .
When used as a treatment , it reduces the duration of flu symptoms by approximately one day .
South Korea has issued a warning against prescribing Tamiflu to teenagers , while in Japan the warning includes children as young as 10 .
But while the FDA panel recommended that the warning label on Tamiflu be strengthened to note that psychiatric episodes linked to the drug 's use have resulted in serious injury or death , it also voted 8 - 6 to note that such reactions may be due solely to the influenza virus .
"
It is still difficult to determine if these events are due to drug , disease , or both , " said FDA safety reviewer Adrienne Rothstein .
According to dissenting FDA panel member Michael E. Fant , the very fact that the drug 's psychiatric side effects have been under discussion for more than two years is worrisome .
" That in and of itself says we have enough concern that it warrants conveying those concerns to the public , " Fant said .
The great thing about Gustave Verbeek ’s comic strips is that when you reach the end of a page , you can invert it to see the story continue .
He created 64 such comics for the New York Herald between 1903 and 1905 .
Rove admits it was a " political " pick -- so what happened to " America First ? "
1 . Our country needs change .
Dent has had it his way in Washington for four years and four out of five times Charles W. Dent with George W. Bush .
2 . Folks want to bring that change home .
Dent attacks
Sam ’s work to help clean up Lehigh Valley communities as “ money wasted ” while his only two legislative accomplishments in four years are renaming post - offices .
3. Pennsylvania has suffered 1400 casualties in Iraq .
Dent went to Washington , knowing there were no WMD ’s and still votes to use trillions of dollars in Iraq .
4 . When our troops are gone , Dent votes to tax military families , and when they come home , he says NO to their healthcare and job training .
5 . Wages are falling and the wealth gap is growing while Dent makes three times the income of the average Lehigh Valley voter .
Then he votes NO for fully raising the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for equal work .
6. 212,000 Pennsylvania kids are uninsured as Dent accepts taxpayer - funded healthcare .
Then he votes NO for expanding it for kids and military reservists .
7. Companies like Mack Trucks cut jobs in the Lehigh Valley and their mega millionaire CEO ’s still cut checks to Dent for thousands of dollars .
Then he votes NO to stopping CAFTA deals that trade Pennsylvania jobs for corporate profits and NO to the Employee Free Choice
Act to give workers a fair shake .
8. Special interests are trying to take over Washington , and Dent accepts more than $ 90,000 from lobbyists .
Then he refuses to give it back .
9 . Gas prices are soaring and so are Dent ’s campaign contributions from Big Oil .
Dent accepts more than $ 75,000 from Big Oil and gives Big Oil $ 14 billion in tax breaks instead of investing in renewable energy , says NO to renewable energy , and says NO to efficiency and conservation .
10 . Prescription drug costs are skyrocketing while Dent accepts tens of thousands of dollars from Big Pharma .
And he votes NO for negotiating drug prices for Medicare patients and NO to allowing seniors to import FDA approved prescriptions from Canada .
In an attempt to get out ahead of the new / CBS polling information that shows that McCain 's " Palin bounce " has gone flat , Republican Party strategist Karl Rove admitted last night that the subsiding excitement over the largely unqualified Alaskan is to be expected and that she was just a " political pick .
" Rove then slyly tries equating Obama 's careful selection of a knowledgeable , tested , and experienced statesman , Joe Biden , with McCain 's irresponsible and cynical choice of a superficially attractive and totally diversionary Wasilla hockey mom and moose hunter .
Even with that stretch , Rove had to admit Palin " is not the most qualified candidate . "
Rove is reflecting , for his own reasons , of course , what a lot of Republicans are saying privately , that Palin is spectacularly unqualified for serious office .
This morning Nebraska Republican Senator Chuck Hagel went public with his dismay at the choice .
" She does n't have any foreign policy credentials .
You get a passport for the first time in your life last year ?
I mean , I do n't know what you can say .
You can't say anything ...
I think they ought to be just honest about it and stop the nonsense about , ' I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something about Russia , ' " he said .
" That kind of thing is insulting to the American people .
" While we 're on the topic of Rove , I wish I could ask him what his strategy is about keeping all his candidates from debating their Democratic challengers .
We went over a few of the cowardly Republicans -- particularly shakin ' - in - his - boots Randy Kuhl , Randy Forbes and Gordon Smith -- on Sunday .
Yesterday we saw several other Republicans slink away from challenges .
All three of the Miami - Dade right - wing Republicans , the Diaz - Balart brothers ( aka - Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum ) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen refused to commit to debates .
Ros-Lehtinen , in fact , who is running scared now that she sees her shallow support evaporating , " said she has no time for a debate any time between now and the election .
" Meanwhile , up in Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley , Charlie Dent 's floundering re-election campaign is besieged from all sides .
Still recovering from the firing of a GOP operative and former Dent staffer for viciously racist and misogynistic rantings -- which Dent has refused to disavow --
Dent stumbled badly by voting against this week 's Comprehensive Energy Bill just as the huge so - called " donations " ( $ 75,831 ) he was taking from Big Oil were exposed .
Instead of defending his record or debating Democrat Sam Bennett , Dent has decided to lie on hiding out in Washington and conducting a Rovian smear campaign against his opponent .
Bennett keeps accepting debate invitations from media outlets and area colleges , all of which Dent turns down .
Bennett 's campaign has rubbed his nose in his own dirt by putting out a list of the top ten reasons
Dent dodges debates :
Labels : Annette Taddeo , Charlie Dent , debates , Karl Rove , McCain 's cynicism , McCain 's judgment , Ros-Lehtinen , Sam Bennett , Sarah Palin
We were lost in Boston 's South End , looking for Thayer Street .
Street signs are optional around Boston , and the locals did n't know either the street or our precise destination ...
something called Gallery XIV .
That was the site of a gathering to which we had been enticed by an email with the subject line , " WHAT SHOULD OBAMA'S PLATFORM BE ON THE INTERNET & DEMOCRACY -- JOIN THE DISCUSSION JULY 28 , 7PM " .
Fittingly , we got our best directional clues from Geeks Unknown , via Google Maps ( hosted on a large sum of Linux servers somewhere in The Cloud ) -- over a cell phone .
Those vectored us down Harrison Street , where we walked until we found a sure sign that we had arrived : a wall of posters bearing the unmistakable faces of Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama -- merged into one .
Turns out Gallery XIV was featuring Abraham Obama : , described as " mash - up esthetics at the intersection of art , technology and politics " .
The surreal quality of the setting was matched by the discussion itself , which went exactly as advertised , but was also compromised by three followers of Lyndon LaRouche , all determined to route conversation toward their own emphatic and unbending views -- mostly on issues far afield of " internet and democracy " .
From what I gathered , LaRouche himself hates the Net , and so did these guys .
But they did provide a revealing contrast between the relatively open stances of the Obama campaign and the doctrinal absolutism of those who download their opinions from what you might call a closed source .
At the end we were pointed to a clipboard with a sign - up sheet and a polite request to become more involved ; but there was nothing high - pressure or cookie - cutter about the meeting itself .
Was that typical ?
Hard to say .
But you can pick up a lot of clues just by comparing the Obama and McCain websites and how you can interact with them .
Back in June I began to do just that , as an assignment to write a long piece for the November issue of Linux Journal , which will hit the newsstands in late October , just before the election .
The assignment began on June 3 , when I got this email from my friend Jim :

The ad recruited " exceptionally talented web developers who want to play a key role in a historic political campaign and help elect Barack Obama as the next President of the United States . "
Recruits would " Introduce cutting - edge social networking and online organizing to the democratic process by empowering everyday people to participate on my .
BarackObama " .
For this they required " A deep understanding of LAMP development processes and best practices " , " Experience scaling large LAMP application " , " Experience building complex applications using PHP and MySQL " with " deep knowledge of MySQL performance and query optimization " and " Advanced or expert CSS , Javascript , and AJAX skills " and " At least 5 years of professional web development experience " .
The ad was hardly necessary .
The Obama campaign has been in a buyer 's market for good geeks since the beginning .
And the company doing the buying was Blue State Digital , which is about as hot as a politically oriented tech company can get .
Thanks to Blue State Digital ( aka BSD , not to be confused with the operating system ) , the Obama campaign is one of the most well - oiled yet thoroughly decentralized campaigns ever run .
Though centrally hosted , the campaign is " social " ( in the literal and technical senses ) to a near - absolute degree .
More than any political following in history , Barack Obama 's has become the electrical electorate , the connected constituency .
Plenty of credit goes to the candidate and strategists at his Chicago headquarters , of course , but BSD is the outfit that put the rubber on the road , and there 's a lot of it .
The results so far are astonishing .
By the end of July the Obama campaign had raised more than $ 390 million dollars , most of it from more than a million online donors .
At the current rate he might pass half a $ billion by election day .
BSD at last count tallied more than 75,000 campaign events and 2 million phone calls from individual volunteers .
Each of those volunteers has his or her own website at my .
barackobama.com , better known to both BSD and the faithful as MyBO , or " mybo " .
The pages are uncomplicated and fast , yet packed with tools for user involvement .
The term " grass roots action " is woefully insufficient to describe what MyBO enables .
Instead it provides the boards , nails , hammers , saws and electric tools required for citizens to frame up whole new structures for both electoral politics and the governance that follows .
For an old hippie like me , who grew up in the Sixties , and who remembers the edge - of - war conflicts that tore up the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago , this kind of political action -- positive , engaged and constructive -- is something of a dream come true .
I 'm reminded of Skoop Nisker 's famous imperative : " If you do n't like the news , go out and make some of your own " .
Open source in a nutshell .
Not surprisingly , open source and free software are essential enablers of MyBO .
According to Jascha Franklin - Hodge , co-founder and CTO of BSD , " We wanted to make it easy to create an event , schedule it , make it searchable , handle RSVPs , and for people to do their own fund - raising . "
For that they make heavy use of RSS , of mashable APIs ( especially Google 's and Yahoo 's ones for mapping and geocoding .
More :
The stack is LAMP : Linux , Apache , MySQL , PHP .
On the back end we use lots of open source libraries and tool kits .
We use YUI , and Ext , which are javascript UI libraries .
One of our developers is the creator of the Horde project , which is a big open source PHP framework .
We do n't like to re-invent wheels .
So , for example , we do n't write our own database connection library .
We 're using ADOdb , which is one of the more popular ones for PHP , and python as well .
We use PEAR , which is PHP 's library of tools and utilities .
We use PEAR modules for everything from sending email to doing caching ...
We use things like memcached .
We use open source monitoring tools .
We use RSS all over the place : events , blogs ... we use it to link parts of our own system internally , say to share information between two different client systems , or between two parts of our system .
Wherever possible we try to build those interface points around accepted standards for interchange .
If they need to be opened up , or if the client wants direct access to them , we say " go ahead and use whatever RSS library you have " .
When I go to my MyBO web page and look for events within 25 miles of my zipcode near Cambridge , 93 come up .
Here are a few I 'll copy and paste :

Each event gets its own symbol on a Google map .
You can do your own mashing via RSS , ICAL or KML files .
The dashboard also features ways you can create messages , groups , blog posts and much more .
I just counted a total of eighteen different ways an individual can engage with the campaign .
When I go to the McCain campaign website and look for events within the same 25 miles , 29 come up .
Most all are appeals to join phone banks ; although , as with Obama , many are convention - watching parties .
( To be fair I tried the same on McCain 's home turf in Phoenix , with similar results . )
With McCain 's campaign there is no equivalent of MyBO .
You can join the campaign and become a contributor , of course .
I signed up with both sites , so I get emails from both candidates and their campaigns .
( FWIW , I 'm a registered Independent . )
But the Obama campaign is far more engaged and personal .
True , the McCain campaign does feature some pretty well - crafted and even funny Web - only ads on its website .
But it ai n't the same .
According to a recent NPR story , Michael Powell , the former FCC chairman and a close advisor to the McCain campaign , " ... hopes ( McCain will ) create momentum in all branches of government to foster ' a range of e-government initiatives . '
That would include making more government services available online and hiring people with substantial tech experience to ' populate throughout the government . ' "
Thing is , Obama 's already doing that .
The man has means for e-governance already in place .

Bamberg is an outstandingly beautiful city and also home of the Rauchbier ( literally " smoke beer " ) , and so the visit here was one of the high points on our trip .
It turns out that Bamberg has no less than nine breweries , so sampling all the Bamberg beers actually requires quite a bit of work .
All of the breweries have their own taverns or biergartens serving the beer , and two also combine the tavern with an inn where you can stay at a very reasonable price .
Neue Residenz City hall
What makes the city so beautiful is not just the rich assortment of historic buildings , and the absence of modern eyesores , but also the location on the Regnitz river ( and the Rhein - Main - Donau canal ) underneath the Michaelsberg .
The city is well worth a visit even if you do n't care for beer at all .
We bicycled into the city along the canal , which took us almost straight to the Fässla brewery inn .
The inn is old - fashioned and charming , and the rooms are basic , but quite cheap .
On the opposite side of the street is the Spezial brewery inn ( closed at the time ) .
The Fässla tavern turned out to have people drinking from it opened in the early morning ( well , at least at 10 in the morning , when we got up ) until it closes .
You 'd have a hard time selling beer at 10 on a Thursday in Norway , but apparently not in Germany .
Street scene Fässla
One nice thing about Bamberg is that it 's quite small ( 70,000 inhabitants , according to Lonely Planet ) , so you can easily walk everywhere , which is what we did .
Our first stop , unless you count the sightseeing en route , was the Schlenkerla tavern , which is right in the historic centre of town .
Schlenkerla is the best - known of the Bamberg breweries , and their Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier is widely distributed ( 466 ratings on RateBeer ) .
The tavern is a beautiful 16th - century building with an alarmingly sagging façade .
Very nice inside , and reasonably quiet despite there being quite a few people in there .
The tavern has many rooms , and it seems they open as many as they need for their guests at any given time .
We tried the food , which was excellent , and of course the beer .
The brewery makes only five beers , and two of these are seasonals , so they only had the Märzen Rauchbier ( the best - known one ) , a Rauchweizen , and a pale Rauchbier .
We tried both the Märzen and the Rauchweizen .
This was before I started writing down formal ratings , which is unfortunate , since my memory of the taste is completely wiped now .
( The tasting notes are from a later tasting . )
4 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 8/10 5/5 7/10 4/5 16/20
Medium finely laced head topping a dark wine - red clear body .
Aroma is mostly smoke , like smoked sausage minus the sausage .
Some malts as well .
Taste is sweet malts quickly overpowered by the smokiness , the fading into a smoky smooth bitterness .
Aroma is smokier than the taste .
Taste settles in the mouth as you drink .
A very interesting beer , and I quite enjoyed it , but one is perhaps enough for one session .
( 0.5l bottle . )
Rauchbier is brewed in the same way as other bottom - fermented beers ( like pilsener ) ; the difference lies in the malts that are used .
When brewing beer one does n't simply use grain , since grain consists mostly of starch , which the yeast can't eat .
The solution is to make malts from it , which is done by starting the growing process in the grain ( which turns the starch into sugar , which the yeast can eat ) , and then stopping it by drying the grain .
It 's the drying that is the key here ; one of the ancient drying methods was to use an open fire , which naturally subjects the malt to smoke , which flavors the malt .
The rauchbier brewers do this on purpose , which is what gives the beer the intense , smoky taste .
Usually breweries get their malts from separate maltings , but the Bamberg rauchbier brewers produce their own malts in order to smoke them .
I think most people who are not used to beers with a lot of flavour probably will find the rauchbier somewhat challenging .
People in Bamberg say you have to drink five liters before you start to enjoy it ; whether this is true I can't say .
I enjoyed my first pint ( in Oslo , a couple of years ago ) , and my girlfriend considered tasting from my glass more than sufficient exposure to rauchbier .
The Schlenkerla tavern also serves local Franconian dishes , which are excellent .
They also sell bottles in the tavern , so you can take some with you .
We did n't do this , since there 's more than enough beer to taste everywhere in Germany .
Anyway , we walked through town and found the Spezial bierkeller up on the hill with a lovely view of Bamberg .
It may sound strange that a cellar has a nice view , and we said as much to the waitress .
She laughed and told us that they served the beer on top of the cellar , not in it .
So the bierkeller is actually a biergarten , with the cellar underneath it , and this is the usual arrangement , at least in Bamberg .
In fact , they told us the cellar was huge , stretching under the entire biergarten plus the adjoining meadow .
Spezial is the other Bamberg brewery which makes rauchbier , and their range is very similar to that of Schlenkerla .
Again , without tasting notes I can't say much about their beers , unfortunately .
View from the Spezial Spezial beer
There turns out to be another huge bierkeller , called Wilde Rose Keller , with gravelled grounds , a stage , and simple snacks , just above the Spezial , where we had a very nice kellerbier from the house brewery .
This brewery seems to have no distribution outside the tavern , as there are only 1 to 4 ratings for each of their beers on RateBeer .
Below these two , on the same hill , is the Mahrs Bräu tavern , which is a collection of old wooden buildings , one of which serves as the tavern , with a nice and very quiet restaurant .
The food was OK , and I seem to recall the beer being quite good .
This brewery is listed with 15 beers on RateBeer , but the tavern only had two .
Not sure why , but in most of the taverns you could n't get the full range from each brewery .
Some beers would be seasonals ( bocks , only available in late winter ) , some would be sold out , and some they would just not serve , for reasons never explained .
Back in town we stopped by the Klosterbräu tavern , which was a sagging , half - timbered building .
This seemed less touristy than the others , and more like a local .
We tried their schwarzbier ( boring , as I recall , but RB - ers seem to like it ) and the weissbier .
This was more than enough beer drinking for one day , so we stopped after this , and went back to the Fässla brewery to sleep .
At this point we 'd tried five of the nine breweries , and we knew where the sixth was , but were clueless about where the remaining three might be .
Lonely Planet does not even mention them , and neither does Michael Jackson 's pocket guide .
Next morning we walked around a lot , but completely failed to find them , and in the end resorted to the tourist information .
They told us that there were three out in Wunderburg , which is a part of Bamberg near the Fässla , further along the canal .
In the evening we went to Wunderburg and found Keesmann , which was very local , and also turned out to be an inn .
Very nice , but only two beers : a pilsener and a lager .
The lager was quite dark and very good ; lots of taste .
The other brewery tavern turned out to be Mahrs , which we 'd already visited on the hill , but here they had a much wider selection .
The last brewery out there is the Maisel ( not to be confused with the Maisel of Bayreuth ) , which we never got to , since it got too late , and they closed .
On the second day the city was getting ready for the annual Sandkerwa festival , and rapidly filling up with tourists , so we decided to get out .
The following day we got up early and biked out of Bamberg to the northeast , through " the Franconian Switzerland " towards Kulmbach .
On the way we passed through a small town called Memmelsdorf just outside Bamberg , which turned out to have four breweries .
We stopped at the Drei Kronen brewery inn , which looked very pleasant , and bought a bottle of unfiltered rauchbier , which we took with us for lunch .
Just after Memmelsdorf we came to Scheßlitz , which had three or four breweries .
After that we passed into " the Franconian Switzerland " , about which more later .
More internet research here at home reveals that the last brewery is Greifenklau , which is also up on the hill with the Spezial keller somewhere .
Also , since August 2004 there is a tenth brewery : the Ambräusianum , near the Schlenkerla , which has three beers ( no rauchbier ) .
The Franconia Beer Guide has all the details , plus some bits we did n't find .
Another excellent guide is Ron Pattinson 's Bamberg Guide .
Overall , the conclusion is that Bamberg is very much worth a visit , both for the normal tourist attractions , and for the beer .
However , the beer can be difficult to find if you really want to try all of it .
( This strikes me as more than a little strange , since Bamberg is famous for its breweries , and this is one thing tourists come there for .
Why force the tourists to sit in internet cafés searching for the beers ? )
I recommend using the internet to do research before you go .
( There was only one internet café in Bamberg when we were there , and it had only a kind of kiosk with an absolutely horrible keyboard . )
Also , do n't just go to Bamberg ; make sure you get to look at the small towns around it , too .
Memmelsdorf and Scheßlitz stand out , but I 'm sure there 's more to be found .
And if you really want to be thorough you 'll definitely need more than two days .
Some great news from Durban University of Technology in South Africa , their newly built Indlebe Radio Telescope detected its first signal late last month .
“ On the evening of 28th July 2008 , at 21h14 local time the Indlebe Radio Telescope , situated on the Steve Biko campus of the Durban University of Technology ( DUT ) , successfully detected its first radio source from beyond the solar system .
A strong source was detected from Sagittarius A , the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy , approximately 30 thousand light years away , ” says the statement by Stuart MacPherson .
This will be an invaluable resource for students and research projects ; a great achievement .
Although this should be the focus of attention , it looks like social bookmarking may have struck again .
The DUT announcement was picked up by Digg and the Internet population drew their own conclusions .
Interestingly , the Russian mainstream media was listening and interpreted the Internet buzz as proof that an alien radio signal had been detected in the centre of our galaxy …
Firstly , turning back the calendar a week or so to my Phoenix “ undisclosed discovery ” article on August 2nd , an amazing example of “ Internet Chinese Whispers ” was spawned from a seemingly innocent report about an Aviation Week article , and now it seems it ’s started again , only this time in Russia …
The Russian news report in question states that an alien signal has been detected in Sagittarius A , the centre of our galaxy , some 30,000 light years away :
Scientists in South Africa have detected radio signals from beyond the solar system for the first time – prompting a wave of excitement over who , or what , might have sent it .
The signal is the most significant of its kind since radio telescopes started operating in the 1960s .
– Leader from the Russia Today article .
OK , lets find the origin of this story .
Very easy , right near the top of the “ popular ” list on Digg .
So what is this Digg story relating to ?
A researcher / lecturer at Durban University of Technology in South Africa is proudly announcing the completion of the university Indlebe Radio Telescope with accompanying images of the first radio observations .
I ’ve noticed that Stuart MacPherson has updated the press release ( probably in response to the misinterpretation that this is an announcement of a SETI - like discovery of an alien radio transmission ) , and said the following statement :
It should be noted that this is not an intelligent source , i.e. it is not a source that could be considered as having been transmitted by alien intelligence .
Furthermore , it is certainly not a new discovery .
The electromagnetic radiation emanating from Sagittarius A is well documented and an entirely natural phenomenon .
A similar signal , although of a much larger magnitude , would be received by simply pointing the telescope at the Sun. – Stuart MacPherson , DUT .
Indeed , their new radio telescope has been set up to detect a highly observable radio emission from neutral hydrogen atoms .
The emission can be found all over the observable Universe , specifically in our own galaxy where there are a lot of hydrogen burning stars and interstellar hydrogen gas .
In the case of the DUT Indlebe Radio Telescope , it has been set up to detect a very specific hydrogen line at a frequency of 1420 MHz , and its first result is an observation of a well - known 1420 MHz emission region in the constellation of Sagittarius .
There are three components to the radio emissions in Sagittarius A ; Sgr. A East , Sgr. A West and Sgr. A*. Sgr. A East is a supernova remnant , Sgr. A West is a spiral structure of gas and dust feeding into Sgr.
A * which is an intense radio source possibly generated by a supermassive black hole hiding in the centre of the Milky Way .
This is the reason why Sagittarius A is the focus for Indlebe , it is a great , known , natural source of radio emissions for a brand new radio telescope to focus on and carry out calibration tasks .
The Russia Today website appears to read something different into MacPherson ’s statement : “ We had made significant changes to the receiver to increase its sensitivity , ” he said .
“ When we went in that morning to check the data , we found that it had detected a source .
It ’s unbelievable .
It ’s definitely a great relief for us because now we know that the radio telescope works . ”
Well , yes , I ’m sure he is relieved the telescope worked , but this is not in reference to a recent alien radio signal discovery .
I wonder how many other news sources have picked up on this .
I ’m not sure how popular Russia Today is , and it is hard to tell whether they are reporting on “ actual news ” or whether they are being light - hearted , but I ’m sure it has caused a stir for all the wrong reasons …
Thought of the day : News outlets should not use social bookmarking rumours when interpreting scientific results , it will only lead to false reporting and bad journalism !

A group of hackers who perpetrated numerous credit card and personal identification thefts are being charged with numerous crimes ranging from conspiracy , computer intrusion , fraud , and identity theft .
Altogether , this constitutes the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice .
Eleven perpetrators from around the world are being charged with the theft and illegal sales of credit card numbers and personal information stolen from retail stores like TJ Maxx , Office Max , Boston Market , Barnes & Noble , Sports , Authority , Forever 21 , DSW , and more .
After obtaining the data , the perpetrators stored it in an encrypted format ( a step that others could learn from ) on servers in Eastern Europe and the US , then sold the data to customers in those countries .
Credit card numbers were typically imprinted onto blank cards , then used to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars from ATMs .
One perpetrator , Albert Gonzalez , had previously been arrested by the Secret Service in 2003 for access device fraud .
Gonzalez was acting as a confidential informant for the agency during the course of this most recent investigation , but was found out to be criminally involved with another case of stealing credit card data from the Dave & Buster 's chain .
Because of this , he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all charges .
Courts in various cities will hear the charges brought against this retail hacking ring .
For example , a San Diego indictment against Hung - Ming Chiu and Zhi Zhi Wang , both of the People 's Republic of China , and a person known only by the online nickname " Delpiero " ( a real name and origin are unknown ) charges the three with conspiracy to possess unauthorized access devices , trafficking in unauthorized access devices , trafficking in counterfeit access devices , possession of unauthorized access devices , aggravated identity theft , and aiding and abetting .
With the help of Sergey Pavolvich , of Belarus , and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak of Ukraine , these eight perpetrators are charged with operating an international stolen credit and debit card distribution ring , and selling these cards for personal gain .
As an example , the indictment cites Yastremskly alone as receiving over $ 11 million from these activities .
Suvorov and Yastremskiy were charged in May with accompanying Gonzalez when hacking the Dave & Buster 's chain .
" So far as we know , this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country , " said Attorney General Mukasey in the DoJ press release .
" It highlights the efforts of the Justice Department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that , with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world , we can identify , charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers . "
It also highlights the risk to consumers when retailers are lax with data they collect on consumers in the ordinary course of business .

It only takes a moment
It 's all too easy to get caught up in the routine .
We count down the hours instead of enjoy our time and we long for something more , but in the end we are left with the mundane , boring , everyday activities that make up our lives .
Once in a while , something special happens .
A fleeting glance , an accidental touch , a returned smile : these moments show us a glimpse of something different , something more .
We think about them and what they could mean for us , the path not taken and the life not lived .
But what if you could make those moments happen yourself ?
Feel the butterflies , experience the desire , and know what it is not to just live but to really come alive ?

Aug. 6 , 2008  --
China 's last minute decision to deny a politically active 2006 Olympic gold medalist a visa to attend the Beijing Games is not unique .
Chinese authorities have also denied a bronze medalist , a respected New York - based journalist and a Danish sculptor entry to China in recent months -- a sign that Beijing is still cracking down on freedom of expression in the lead up to the Games .
The visa denials highlight how Chinese authorities are worried that human rights activists will bring international attention to politically sensitive topics -- such as press freedom , the Tian An'Men crackdown , and China 's problematic role in Africa -- during the Olympics , according to China experts .
" By denying visas and entrance into China , the government is choosing to lose face in a small way , " said Sharon Hom , director of the New York - based non-profit organization , Human Rights in China .
" If these people do protest and garner international attention , [ China ] would lose face in a big way .
There 's a lot of anxiety about that . "
Gold medalist speed skater Joey Cheek , recipient of the DHL Olympic Spirit award , the 2006 National Sportsmanship Award , and the inaugural Heisman Humanitarian Award , got word Tuesday night that his visa was revoked less than 24 hours before his scheduled departure for a two week stay in China .
Though the Chinese official delivering the denial told Cheek he was " not required to give a reason , " the rationale was clear enough to Cheek .
He is president and co-founder of Team Darfur , a group of Olympic athletes who have been raising awareness about the humanitarian crisis in the region .
Among the group 's targets : countries , like China , which have invested heavily in Sudan , whose president was recently charged with war crimes for the killings in Darfur .
" The denial of my visa is part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur , " said Cheek , whose group does not -- like some -- call for a boycott of the Olympics .
Cheek is not the first member of Team Darfur denied entrance to the Olympics .
Kendra Zanotto , 26 , won a bronze medal for synchronized swimming in 2004 and hoped to cover that event as a reporter for the Olympic News Service .
But when Zanotto , who was raised in Los Gatos , Calif. , went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco in July , officials denied her application .
Though Chinese authorities would not tell her why her visa was denied , the firm handling her job told her the government was uncomfortable about her affiliation with Team Darfur .
" I was shocked when I was seen as something offensive for the Games , " said Zanotto .
Zanotto said she had not planned to make any kind of a political statement in Beijing .
" I could understand if [ the Chinese government ] is scared about terrorism or violence , but if that 's their reasoning for seeing me as threat , that 's ridiculous , " she said .
Though 72 members of the group are expected to compete in this year 's Games , Martha Bixby , director of the group , said that four athletes competing in Beijing who are part of Team Darfur were pressured by the Chinese Embassies in their respective countries to withdraw from Team Darfur .
They were told they would otherwise be closely watched and dubbed as " troublemakers " in Beijing , she said .
Bixby declined to release the names of the four athletes in order to protect their privacy .
Such actions appear to be against the rules .
An official at the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad ( BOCOG ) in Beijing said that accredited athletes should have no problem coming to China if they are affiliated with Team Darfur , but would not comment specific cases .
Calls to the Consulate in San Francisco where Zanotto's visa application was denied were not answered .
It was n't just newcomers who faced trouble .
Bob Dietz , Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists has been traveling back and forth to China on journalist and tourist visas for years .
Married to a Chinese - American woman , Dietz has many in - laws in China , and he has lived on and off in the mainland and Hong Kong since 1995 .
But when he put in an application to visit China during the Olympics , authorities turned him down .
" I 'm just worried I 'll never get to see my nieces and nephews again , " he said .
" Things should have gotten looser in China , not more restrictive with the Games .
Something has gone wrong – I hope it 's just a temporary setback for the country . "
One other journalist at CPJ who did not want to be identified was also denied a visa .
Though Dietz and Zanotto never made it to China , well - known Danish artist Jens Galschiot flew to Hong Kong , for which no visa is required , in April but authorities turned him back , because , authorities said , his presence was not " conductive of the public good . "
A letter later sent to Galschiot by the director of Hong Kong immigration explained that all visitors are subject to immigration examination .
It added that officers at the airport " acted properly and in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong . "
The real reason , Galschiot said , seemed clear enough .
One of his works was the " Pillar of Shame , " a sculpture commemorating the 1989 Tian An'Men crackdown by Beijing on students demonstrating for democracy , which was erected just before Hong Kong was handed over to China by the British in 1997 .
And Galschiot , who had been invited to Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Association for Supporting Democracy in China , had flown to Hong Kong from London to repaint the statue in orange on the campus of Hong Kong University .
Albert Ho , a Hong Kong legislator and pro-democracy campaigner , said in a video posted on Galschiot 's website that he was outraged at Galschiot 's denial of entry .
" This is obviously a denial of freedom of expression , " said Ho .
" He is our guest .
We invited him .
This is also a denial of our freedom as well . "
Galschiot , who said his work represents repression around the world , saw his denial of entry as a way for the democracy movement to gain more attention .
" This enables the democracy movement to gain support and media exposure for their activities in Hong Kong , " Galschiot said in the video in Danish with English subtitles .
Calls to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for this story were not answered .
Hom , of Human Rights in China , said that Galschiot 's case highlights Beijing 's increasing influence on Hong Kong , even though under China 's " one country , two systems " policy , Hong Kong remains a capitalist economy and retains its political autonomy , and its people enjoy freedoms not found in the rest of China .

A Kyoto University professor has found a way to create huge quantities of protective avian influenza ( bird flu ) antibodies using nature 's largest egg , that of the ostrich .
Bird flu may be a new and frightening disease to us , but our feathered friends themselves have been dealing with it for untold millennia .
Over time , they 've built up natural antibodies to the influenza virus , which they store in their eggs to protect the developing chicks .
Prof. Yasuhiro Tsukamoto of Japan's Kyoto Prefectural University began investigating ostrich eggs because the 300 lb. flightless birds are notably resistant to viral infections – not to mention , their eggs are the largest on earth .
Using a technique invented and refined at the university , Tsukamoto has been able to ramp up the ostrich 's natural production of avian flu antibodies to the point where 80,000 surgical masks can be treated .
Plans are afoot to begin offering the treated masks for sale in autumn of 2008 .
The new antibody production technique shows promise in other areas as well , according to Prof. Tsukamoto .
For example , ostriches ( which can live up to 40 years ) can be induced to create antibodies against human influenza viruses .
As well , the huge size of an individual ostrich egg means that as many as 20,000 people can be treated with test drugs created with antibodies sourced from a single egg !

Preparing the Battlefield

Â Â Â The Bush Administration steps up its secret moves against Iran .
Late last year , Congress agreed to a request from President Bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations against Iran , according to current and former military , intelligence , and congressional sources .
These operations , for which the President sought up to four hundred million dollars , were described in a Presidential Finding signed by Bush , and are designed to destabilize the country ’s religious leadership .
The covert activities involve support of the minority Ahwazi Arab and Baluchi groups and other dissident organizations .
They also include gathering intelligence about Iran ’s suspected nuclear - weapons program .
Clandestine operations against Iran are not new .
United States Special Operations Forces have been conducting cross - border operations from southern Iraq , with Presidential authorization , since last year .
These have included seizing members of Al Quds , the commando arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , and taking them to Iraq for interrogation , and the pursuit of “ high - value targets ”  in the President ’s war on terror , who may be captured or killed .
But the scale and the scope of the operations in Iran , which involve the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , have now been significantly expanded , according to the current and former officials .
Many of these activities are not specified in the new Finding , and some congressional leaders have had serious questions about their nature .
Under federal law , a Presidential Finding , which is highly classified , must be issued when a covert intelligence operation gets under way and , at a minimum , must be made known to Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and the Senate and to the ranking members of their respective intelligence committees – the so - called Gang of Eight .
Money for the operation can then be reprogrammed from previous appropriations , as needed , by the relevant congressional committees , which also can be briefed .
“ The Finding was focused on undermining Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change , ”  a person familiar with its contents said , and involved “ working with opposition groups and passing money . ” 
The Finding provided for a whole new range of activities in southern Iran and in the areas , in the east , where Baluchi political opposition is strong , he said .
Although some legislators were troubled by aspects of the Finding , and “ there was a significant amount of high - level discussion ”  about it , according to the source familiar with it , the funding for the escalation was approved .
In other words , some members of the Democratic leadership – Congress has been under Democratic control since the 2006 elections – were willing , in secret , to go along with the Administration in expanding covert activities directed at Iran , while the Party ’s presumptive candidate for President , Barack Obama , has said that he favors direct talks and diplomacy .
The request for funding came in the same period in which the Administration was coming to terms with a National Intelligence Estimate , released in December , that concluded that Iran had halted its work on nuclear weapons in 2003 .
The Administration downplayed the significance of the N.I.E. , and , while saying that it was committed to diplomacy , continued to emphasize that urgent action was essential to counter the Iranian nuclear threat .
President Bush questioned the N.I.E. ’s conclusions , and senior national - security officials , including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , made similar statements .
( So did Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee . )
Meanwhile , the Administration also revived charges that the Iranian leadership has been involved in the killing of American soldiers in Iraq : both directly , by dispatching commando units into Iraq , and indirectly , by supplying materials used for roadside bombs and other lethal goods .
( There have been questions about the accuracy of the claims ; the Times , among others , has reported that “ significant uncertainties remain about the extent of that involvement . ” )
Military and civilian leaders in the Pentagon share the White House ’s concern about Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , but there is disagreement about whether a military strike is the right solution .
Some Pentagon officials believe , as they have let Congress and the media know , that bombing Iran is not a viable response to the nuclear - proliferation issue , and that more diplomacy is necessary .
A Democratic senator told me that , late last year , in an off - the - record lunch meeting , Secretary of Defense Gates met with the Democratic caucus in the Senate .
( Such meetings are held regularly . )
Gates warned of the consequences if the Bush Administration staged a preÃ«mptive strike on Iran , saying , as the senator recalled , “ We ’ll create generations of jihadists , and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in America . ” 
Gates ’ comments stunned the Democrats at the lunch , and another senator asked whether Gates was speaking for Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney .
Gates ’ answer , the senator told me , was “ Let ’s just say that I ’m here speaking for myself . ” 
( A spokesman for Gates confirmed that he discussed the consequences of a strike at the meeting , but would not address what he said , other than to dispute the senator ’s characterization . )
The Joint Chiefs of Staff , whose chairman is Admiral Mike Mullen , were “ pushing back very hard ”  against White House pressure to undertake a military strike against Iran , the person familiar with the Finding told me .
Similarly , a Pentagon consultant who is involved in the war on terror said that “ at least ten senior flag and general officers , including combatant commanders ”  – the four - star officers who direct military operations around the world – “ have weighed in on that issue . ” 
The most outspoken of those officers is Admiral William Fallon , who until recently was the head of U.S. Central Command , and thus in charge of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In March , Fallon resigned under pressure , after giving a series of interviews stating his reservations about an armed attack on Iran .
For example , late last year he told the Financial Times that the “ real objective ”  of U.S. policy was to change the Iranians ’ behavior , and that “ attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice . ” 
Admiral Fallon acknowledged , when I spoke to him in June , that he had heard that there were people in the White House who were upset by his public statements .
“ Too many people believe you have to be either for or against the Iranians , ”  he told me .
“ Let ’s get serious .
Eighty million people live there , and everyone ’s an individual .
The idea that they ’re only one way or another is nonsense . ” 
When it came to the Iraq war , Fallon said , “ Did I bitch about some of the things that were being proposed ?
You bet .
Some of them were very stupid . ” 
The Democratic leadership ’s agreement to commit hundreds of millions of dollars for more secret operations in Iran was remarkable , given the general concerns of officials like Gates , Fallon , and many others .
“ The oversight process has not kept pace – it ’s been co-opted ”  by the Administration , the person familiar with the contents of the Finding said .
“ The process is broken , and this is dangerous stuff we ’re authorizing . ” 
Senior Democrats in Congress told me that they had concerns about the possibility that their understanding of what the new operations entail differs from the White House’s .
One issue has to do with a reference in the Finding , the person familiar with it recalled , to potential defensive lethal action by U.S. operatives in Iran .
( In early May , the journalist Andrew Cockburn published elements of the Finding in Counterpunch , a newsletter and online magazine . )
The language was inserted into the Finding at the urging of the C.I.A. , a former senior intelligence official said .
The covert operations set forth in the Finding essentially run parallel to those of a secret military task force , now operating in Iran , that is under the control of JSOC .
Under the Bush Administration ’s interpretation of the law , clandestine military activities , unlike covert C.I.A. operations , do not need to be depicted in a Finding , because the President has a constitutional right to command combat forces in the field without congressional interference .
But the borders between operations are not always clear : in Iran , C.I.A. agents and regional assets have the language skills and the local knowledge to make contacts for the JSOC operatives , and have been working with them to direct personnel , matÃ©riel , and money into Iran from an obscure base in western Afghanistan .
As a result , Congress has been given only a partial view of how the money it authorized may be used .
One of JSOC ’s task - force missions , the pursuit of “ high - value targets , ”  was not directly addressed in the Finding .
There is a growing realization among some legislators that the Bush Administration , in recent years , has conflated what is an intelligence operation and what is a military one in order to avoid fully informing Congress about what it is doing .
“ This is a big deal , ”  the person familiar with the Finding said .
“ The C.I.A. needed the Finding to do its traditional stuff , but the Finding does not apply to JSOC .
The President signed an Executive Order after September 11th giving the Pentagon license to do things that it had never been able to do before without notifying Congress .
The claim was that the military was “ ˜preparing the battle space , ’ and by using that term they were able to circumvent congressional oversight .
Everything is justified in terms of fighting the global war on terror . ” 
He added , “ The Administration has been fuzzing the lines ; there used to be a shade of gray ”  – between operations that had to be briefed to the senior congressional leadership and those which did not – “ but now it ’s a shade of mush . ” 
“ The agency says we ’re not going to get in the position of helping to kill people without a Finding , ”  the former senior intelligence official told me .
He was referring to the legal threat confronting some agency operatives for their involvement in the rendition and alleged torture of suspects in the war on terror .
“ This drove the military people up the wall , ”  he said .
As far as the C.I.A. was concerned , the former senior intelligence official said , “ the over - all authorization includes killing , but it ’s not as though that ’s what they ’re setting out to do .
It ’s about gathering information , enlisting support . ” 
The Finding sent to Congress was a compromise , providing legal cover for the C.I.A. while referring to the use of lethal force in ambiguous terms .
The defensive - lethal language led some Democrats , according to congressional sources familiar with their views , to call in the director of the C.I.A. , Air Force General Michael V. Hayden , for a special briefing .
Hayden reassured the legislators that the language did nothing more than provide authority for Special Forces operatives on the ground in Iran to shoot their way out if they faced capture or harm .
The legislators were far from convinced .
One congressman subsequently wrote a personal letter to President Bush insisting that “ no lethal action , period ”  had been authorized within Iran ’s borders .
As of June , he had received no answer .
Members of Congress have expressed skepticism in the past about the information provided by the White House .
On March 15 , 2005 , David Obey , then the ranking Democrat on the Republican - led House Appropriations Committee , announced that he was putting aside an amendment that he had intended to offer that day , and that would have cut off all funding for national - intelligence programs unless the President agreed to keep Congress fully informed about clandestine military activities undertaken in the war on terror .
He had changed his mind , he said , because the White House promised better coÃ¶peration .
“ The Executive Branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do , ”  he said in a floor speech at the time .
“ We are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with American values and will not get the country in trouble . ” 
Obey declined to comment on the specifics of the operations in Iran , but he did tell me that the White House reneged on its promise to consult more fully with Congress .
He said , “ I suspect there ’s something going on , but I do n’t know what to believe .
Cheney has always wanted to go after Iran , and if he had more time he ’d find a way to do it .
We still do n’t get enough information from the agencies , and I have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge . ” 
None of the four Democrats in the Gang of Eight – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Intelligence Committee chairman John D. Rockefeller IV , and House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes – would comment on the Finding , with some noting that it was highly classified .
An aide to one member of the Democratic leadership responded , on his behalf , by pointing to the limitations of the Gang of Eight process .
The notification of a Finding , the aide said , “ is just that – notification , and not a sign - off on activities .
Proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee . ” 
However , Congress does have the means to challenge the White House once it has been sent a Finding .
It has the power to withhold funding for any government operation .
The members of the House and Senate Democratic leadership who have access to the Finding can also , if they choose to do so , and if they have shared concerns , come up with ways to exert their influence on Administration policy .
( A spokesman for the C.I.A. said , “ As a rule , we do n’t comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings . ” 
The White House also declined to comment . )
A member of the House Appropriations Committee acknowledged that , even with a Democratic victory in November , “ it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control . ” 
He went on , “ We control the money and they ca n’t do anything without the money .
Money is what it ’s all about .
But I ’m very leery of this Administration . ” 
He added , “ This Administration has been so secretive . ” 
One irony of Admiral Fallon ’s departure is that he was , in many areas , in agreement with President Bush on the threat posed by Iran .
They had a good working relationship , Fallon told me , and , when he ran CENTCOM , were in regular communication .
On March 4th , a week before his resignation , Fallon testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee , saying that he was “ encouraged ”  about the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Regarding the role played by Iran ’s leaders , he said , “ They ’ve been absolutely unhelpful , very damaging , and I absolutely do n’t condone any of their activities .
And I have yet to see anything since I ’ve been in this job in the way of a public action by Iran that ’s been at all helpful in this region . ” 
Fallon made it clear in our conversations that he considered it inappropriate to comment publicly about the President , the Vice - President , or Special Operations .
But he said he had heard that people in the White House had been “ struggling ”  with his views on Iran .
“ When I arrived at CENTCOM , the Iranians were funding every entity inside Iraq .
It was in their interest to get us out , and so they decided to kill as many Americans as they could .
And why not ?
They did n’t know who ’d come out ahead , but they wanted us out .
I decided that I could n’t resolve the situation in Iraq without the neighborhood .
To get this problem in Iraq solved , we had to somehow involve Iran and Syria .
I had to work the neighborhood . ” 
Fallon told me that his focus had been not on the Iranian nuclear issue , or on regime change there , but on “ putting out the fires in Iraq . ” 
There were constant discussions in Washington and in the field about how to engage Iran and , on the subject of the bombing option , Fallon said , he believed that “ it would happen only if the Iranians did something stupid . ” 
Fallon ’s early retirement , however , appears to have been provoked not only by his negative comments about bombing Iran but also by his strong belief in the chain of command and his insistence on being informed about Special Operations in his area of responsibility .
One of Fallon ’s defenders is retired Marine General John J. ( Jack ) Sheehan , whose last assignment was as commander - in - chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command , where Fallon was a deputy .
Last year , Sheehan rejected a White House offer to become the President ’s “ czar ”  for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ One of the reasons the White House selected Fallon for CENTCOM was that he ’s known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the Pacific , ”  Sheehan told me .
( Fallon served as commander - in - chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific from 2005 to 2007 . )
“ He was charged with coming up with an over - all coherent strategy for Iran , Iraq , and Afghanistan , and , by law , the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his A.O. ”  – area of operations .
“ That was not happening , ”  Sheehan said .
“ When Fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility , a small group in the White House leadership shut him out . ” 
The law cited by Sheehan is the 1986 Defense Reorganization Act , known as Goldwater - Nichols , which defined the chain of command : from the President to the Secretary of Defense , through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and on to the various combatant commanders , who were put in charge of all aspects of military operations , including joint training and logistics .
That authority , the act stated , was not to be shared with other echelons of command .
But the Bush Administration , as part of its global war on terror , instituted new policies that undercut regional commanders - in - chief ; for example , it gave Special Operations teams , at military commands around the world , the highest priority in terms of securing support and equipment .
The degradation of the traditional chain of command in the past few years has been a point of tension between the White House and the uniformed military .
“ The coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations , ”  Sheehan said .
“ If you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander , by default you ca n’t have a coherent military strategy .
You end up with a disaster , like the reconstruction efforts in Iraq . ” 
Admiral Fallon , who is known as Fox , was aware that he would face special difficulties as the first Navy officer to lead CENTCOM , which had always been headed by a ground commander , one of his military colleagues told me .
He was also aware that the Special Operations community would be a concern .
“ Fox said that there ’s a lot of strange stuff going on in Special Ops , and I told him he had to figure out what they were really doing , ”  Fallon ’s colleague said .
“ The Special Ops guys eventually figured out they needed Fox , and so they began to talk to him .
Fox would have won his fight with Special Ops but for Cheney . ” 
The Pentagon consultant said , “ Fallon went down because , in his own way , he was trying to prevent a war with Iran , and you have to admire him for that . ” 
In recent months , according to the Iranian media , there has been a surge in violence in Iran ; it is impossible at this early stage , however , to credit JSOC or C.I.A. activities , or to assess their impact on the Iranian leadership .
The Iranian press reports are being carefully monitored by retired Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner , who has taught strategy at the National War College and now conducts war games centered on Iran for the federal government , think tanks , and universities .
The Iranian press “ is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country , ”  Gardiner said .
It is , he said , “ a controlled press , which makes it more important that it publishes these things .
We begin to see inside the government . ” 
He added , “ Hardly a day goes by now we do n’t see a clash somewhere .
There were three or four incidents over a recent weekend , and the Iranians are even naming the Revolutionary Guard officers who have been killed . ” 
Earlier this year , a militant Ahwazi group claimed to have assassinated a Revolutionary Guard colonel , and the Iranian government acknowledged that an explosion in a cultural center in Shiraz , in the southern part of the country , which killed at least twelve people and injured more than two hundred , had been a terrorist act and not , as it earlier insisted , an accident .
It could not be learned whether there has been American involvement in any specific incident in Iran , but , according to Gardiner , the Iranians have begun publicly blaming the U.S. , Great Britain , and , more recently , the C.I.A. for some incidents .
The agency was involved in a coup in Iran in 1953 , and its support for the unpopular regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi – who was overthrown in 1979 – was condemned for years by the ruling mullahs in Tehran , to great effect .
“ This is the ultimate for the Iranians – to blame the C.I.A. , ”  Gardiner said .
“ This is new , and it ’s an escalation – a ratcheting up of tensions .
It rallies support for the regime and shows the people that there is a continuing threat from the “ ˜ Great Satan . ’ “ 
In Gardiner ’s view , the violence , rather than weakening Iran ’s religious government , may generate support for it .
Many of the activities may be being carried out by dissidents in Iran , and not by Americans in the field .
One problem with “ passing money ”  ( to use the term of the person familiar with the Finding ) in a covert setting is that it is hard to control where the money goes and whom it benefits .
Nonetheless , the former senior intelligence official said , “ We ’ve got exposure , because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear .
The Iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the Americans .
How many times have we tried this without asking the right questions ?
Is the risk worth it ? ” 
One possible consequence of these operations would be a violent Iranian crackdown on one of the dissident groups , which could give the Bush Administration a reason to intervene .
A strategy of using ethnic minorities to undermine Iran is flawed , according to Vali Nasr , who teaches international politics at Tufts University and is also a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ Just because Lebanon , Iraq , and Pakistan have ethnic problems , it does not mean that Iran is suffering from the same issue , ”  Nasr told me .
“ Iran is an old country – like France and Germany – and its citizens are just as nationalistic .
The U.S. is overestimating ethnic tension in Iran . ” 
The minority groups that the U.S. is reaching out to are either well integrated or small and marginal , without much influence on the government or much ability to present a political challenge , Nasr said .
“ You can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman , but working with the minorities will backfire , and alienate the majority of the population . ” 
The Administration may have been willing to rely on dissident organizations in Iran even when there was reason to believe that the groups had operated against American interests in the past .
The use of Baluchi elements , for example , is problematic , Robert Baer , a former C.I.A. clandestine officer who worked for nearly two decades in South Asia and the Middle East , told me .
“ The Baluchis are Sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in Tehran , but you can also describe them as Al Qaeda , ”  Baer told me .
“ These are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers – in this case , it ’s Shiite Iranians .
The irony is that we ’re once again working with Sunni fundamentalists , just as we did in Afghanistan in the nineteen - eighties . ” 
Ramzi Yousef , who was convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who is considered one of the leading planners of the September 11th attacks , are Baluchi Sunni fundamentalists .
One of the most active and violent anti-regime groups in Iran today is the Jundallah , also known as the Iranian People ’s Resistance Movement , which describes itself as a resistance force fighting for the rights of Sunnis in Iran .
“ This is a vicious Salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the Taliban and Pakistani extremists , ”  Nasr told me .
“ They are suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture . ” 
The Jundallah took responsibility for the bombing of a busload of Revolutionary Guard soldiers in February , 2007 .
At least eleven Guard members were killed .
According to Baer and to press reports , the Jundallah is among the groups in Iran that are benefiting from U.S. support .
The C.I.A. and Special Operations communities also have long - standing ties to two other dissident groups in Iran : the Mujahideen - e - Khalq , known in the West as the M.E.K. , and a Kurdish separatist group , the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan , or PJAK .
The M.E.K. has been on the State Department ’s terrorist list for more than a decade , yet in recent years the group has received arms and intelligence , directly or indirectly , from the United States .
Some of the newly authorized covert funds , the Pentagon consultant told me , may well end up in M.E.K. coffers .
“ The new task force will work with the M.E.K .
The Administration is desperate for results . ” 
He added , “ The M.E.K. has no C.P.A. auditing the books , and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years .
If people only knew what the M.E.K. is getting , and how much is going to its bank accounts – and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the Administration intends . ” 
The Kurdish party , PJAK , which has also been reported to be covertly supported by the United States , has been operating against Iran from bases in northern Iraq for at least three years .
( Iran , like Iraq and Turkey , has a Kurdish minority , and PJAK and other groups have sought self - rule in territory that is now part of each of those countries . )
In recent weeks , according to Sam Gardiner , the military strategist , there has been a marked increase in the number of PJAK armed engagements with Iranians and terrorist attacks on Iranian targets .
In early June , the news agency Fars reported that a dozen PJAK members and four Iranian border guards were killed in a clash near the Iraq border ; a similar attack in May killed three Revolutionary Guards and nine PJAK fighters .
PJAK has also subjected Turkey , a member of NATO , to repeated terrorist attacks , and reports of American support for the group have been a source of friction between the two governments .
Gardiner also mentioned a trip that the Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , made to Tehran in June .
After his return , Maliki announced that his government would ban any contact between foreigners and the M.E.K. – a slap at the U.S. ’s dealings with the group .
Maliki declared that Iraq was not willing to be a staging ground for covert operations against other countries .
This was a sign , Gardiner said , of “ Maliki ’s increasingly choosing the interests of Iraq over the interests of the United States . ” 
In terms of U.S. allegations of Iranian involvement in the killing of American soldiers , he said , “ Maliki was unwilling to play the blame - Iran game . ” 
Gardiner added that Pakistan had just agreed to turn over a Jundallah leader to the Iranian government .
America ’s covert operations , he said , “ seem to be harming relations with the governments of both Iraq and Pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between Tehran and Baghdad . ” 
The White House ’s reliance on questionable operatives , and on plans involving possible lethal action inside Iran , has created anger as well as anxiety within the Special Operations and intelligence communities .
JSOC ’s operations in Iran are believed to be modeled on a program that has , with some success , used surrogates to target the Taliban leadership in the tribal territories of Waziristan , along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
But the situations in Waziristan and Iran are not comparable .
In Waziristan , “ the program works because it ’s small and smart guys are running it , ”  the former senior intelligence official told me .
“ It ’s being executed by professionals .
The N.S.A. , the C.I.A. , and the D.I.A. ”  – the Defense Intelligence Agency – “ are right in there with the Special Forces and Pakistani intelligence , and they ’re dealing with serious bad guys . ” 
He added , “ We have to be really careful in calling in the missiles .
We have to hit certain houses at certain times .
The people on the ground are watching through binoculars a few hundred yards away and calling specific locations , in latitude and longitude .
We keep the Predator loitering until the targets go into a house , and we have to make sure our guys are far enough away so they do n’t get hit . ” 
One of the most prominent victims of the program , the former official said , was Abu Laith al - Libi , a senior Taliban commander , who was killed on January 31st , reportedly in a missile strike that also killed eleven other people .
A dispatch published on March 26th by the Washington Post reported on the increasing number of successful strikes against Taliban and other insurgent units in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
A follow - up article noted that , in response , the Taliban had killed “ dozens of people ”  suspected of providing information to the United States and its allies on the whereabouts of Taliban leaders .
Many of the victims were thought to be American spies , and their executions – a beheading , in one case – were videotaped and distributed by DVD as a warning to others .
It is not simple to replicate the program in Iran .
“ Everybody ’s arguing about the high - value - target list , ”  the former senior intelligence official said .
“ The Special Ops guys are pissed off because Cheney ’s office set up priorities for categories of targets , and now he ’s getting impatient and applying pressure for results .
But it takes a long time to get the right guys in place . ” 
The Pentagon consultant told me , “ We ’ve had wonderful results in the Horn of Africa with the use of surrogates and false flags – basic counterintelligence and counter - insurgency tactics .
And we ’re beginning to tie them in knots in Afghanistan .
But the White House is going to kill the program if they use it to go after Iran .
It ’s one thing to engage in selective strikes and assassinations in Waziristan and another in Iran .
The White House believes that one size fits all , but the legal issues surrounding extrajudicial killings in Waziristan are less of a problem because Al Qaeda and the Taliban cross the border into Afghanistan and back again , often with U.S. and NATO forces in hot pursuit .
The situation is not nearly as clear in the Iranian case .
All the considerations – judicial , strategic , and political – are different in Iran . ” 
He added , “ There is huge opposition inside the intelligence community to the idea of waging a covert war inside Iran , and using Baluchis and Ahwazis as surrogates .
The leaders of our Special Operations community all have remarkable physical courage , but they are less likely to voice their opposition to policy .
Iran is not Waziristan . ” 
A Gallup poll taken last November , before the N.I.E. was made public , found that seventy - three per cent of those surveyed thought that the United States should use economic action and diplomacy to stop Iran ’s nuclear program , while only eighteen per cent favored direct military action .
Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to endorse a military strike .
Weariness with the war in Iraq has undoubtedly affected the public ’s tolerance for an attack on Iran .
This mood could change quickly , however .
The potential for escalation became clear in early January , when five Iranian patrol boats , believed to be under the command of the Revolutionary Guard , made a series of aggressive moves toward three Navy warships sailing through the Strait of Hormuz .
Initial reports of the incident made public by the Pentagon press office said that the Iranians had transmitted threats , over ship - to - ship radio , to “ explode ”  the American ships .
At a White House news conference , the President , on the day he left for an eight - day trip to the Middle East , called the incident “ provocative ”  and “ dangerous , ”  and there was , very briefly , a sense of crisis and of outrage at Iran .
“ TWO MINUTES FROM WAR ”  was the headline in one British newspaper .
The crisis was quickly defused by Vice - Admiral Kevin Cosgriff , the commander of U.S. naval forces in the region .
No warning shots were fired , the Admiral told the Pentagon press corps on January 7th , via teleconference from his headquarters , in Bahrain .
“ Yes , it ’s more serious than we have seen , but , to put it in context , we do interact with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and their Navy regularly , ”  Cosgriff said .
“ I did n’t get the sense from the reports I was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats . ” 
Admiral Cosgriff ’s caution was well founded : within a week , the Pentagon acknowledged that it could not positively identify the Iranian boats as the source of the ominous radio transmission , and press reports suggested that it had instead come from a prankster long known for sending fake messages in the region .
Nonetheless , Cosgriff ’s demeanor angered Cheney , according to the former senior intelligence official .
But a lesson was learned in the incident :
The public had supported the idea of retaliation , and was even asking why the U.S. did n’t do more .
The former official said that , a few weeks later , a meeting took place in the Vice - President ’s office .
“ The subject was how to create a casus belli between Tehran and Washington , ”  he said .
In June , President Bush went on a farewell tour of Europe .
He had tea with Queen Elizabeth II and dinner with Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni , the President and First Lady of France .
The serious business was conducted out of sight , and involved a series of meetings on a new diplomatic effort to persuade the Iranians to halt their uranium - enrichment program .
( Iran argues that its enrichment program is for civilian purposes and is legal under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . )
Secretary of State Rice had been involved with developing a new package of incentives .
But the Administration ’s essential negotiating position seemed unchanged : talks could not take place until Iran halted the program .
The Iranians have repeatedly and categorically rejected that precondition , leaving the diplomatic situation in a stalemate ; they have not yet formally responded to the new incentives .
The continuing impasse alarms many observers .
Joschka Fischer , the former German Foreign Minister , recently wrote in a syndicated column that it may not “ be possible to freeze the Iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed .
Should this newest attempt fail , things will soon get serious .
Deadly serious . ” 
When I spoke to him last week , Fischer , who has extensive contacts in the diplomatic community , said that the latest European approach includes a new element : the willingness of the U.S. and the Europeans to accept something less than a complete cessation of enrichment as an intermediate step .
“ The proposal says that the Iranians must stop manufacturing new centrifuges and the other side will stop all further sanction activities in the U.N. Security Council , ”  Fischer said , although Iran would still have to freeze its enrichment activities when formal negotiations begin .
“ This could be acceptable to the Iranians – if they have good will . ” 
The big question , Fischer added , is in Washington .
“ I think the Americans are deeply divided on the issue of what to do about Iran , ”  he said .
“ Some officials are concerned about the fallout from a military attack and others think an attack is unavoidable .
I know the Europeans , but I have no idea where the Americans will end up on this issue . ” 
There is another complication : American Presidential politics .
Barack Obama has said that , if elected , he would begin talks with Iran with no “ self - defeating ”  preconditions ( although only after diplomatic groundwork had been laid ) .
That position has been vigorously criticized by John McCain .
The Washington Post recently quoted Randy Scheunemann , the McCain campaign ’s national - security director , as stating that McCain supports the White House ’s position , and that the program be suspended before talks begin .
What Obama is proposing , Scheunemann said , “ is unilateral cowboy summitry . ” 
Scheunemann , who is known as a neoconservative , is also the McCain campaign ’s most important channel of communication with the White House .
He is a friend of David Addington , Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff .
I have heard differing accounts of Scheunemann ’s influence with McCain ; though some close to the McCain campaign talk about him as a possible national - security adviser , others say he is someone who is n’t taken seriously while “ telling Cheney and others what they want to hear , ”  as a senior McCain adviser put it .
It is not known whether McCain , who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , has been formally briefed on the operations in Iran .
At the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , in June , Obama repeated his plea for “ tough and principled diplomacy . ” 
But he also said , along with McCain , that he would keep the threat of military action against Iran on the table .
Will Bunch :
There 's been a huge debate within the newspaper world -- and beyond -- about a fiery DVD targeting Islamic extremism called " Obsession " that over the last couple of weeks has been packaged in newspaper ads and distributed to hundreds of thousands of readers , especially in swing states .
( The Philadelphia Inquirer was one of those papers . )
Proponents say it's an honest portrayal of anti-American jihadism , while critics said the video would stir up hatred toward decent God-fearing Muslims , not just those involved in or supporting terrorism .
Some wonder if it's all just a big ploy to help John McCain and the GOP , who want to focus the campaign on the threat of Islamic extremists . [..]
There 's no more key battleground state in America than Ohio -- and sure enough thousands were delivered there on Monday in a number of newspapers , including the Dayton Daily News , which is in a hotly contested corner of the Buckeye State .
Four days later , this happened as Muslims in Dayton attempted to worship :
DAYTON - Baboucarr
Njie was preparing for his prayer session Friday night , Sept. 26 , when he heard children in the Islamic Society of Greater Dayton coughing .
Soon , Njie himself was overcome with fits of coughing and , like the rest of those in the building , headed for the doors .
" I would stay outside for a minute , then go back in , there were a lot of kids , " Njie said .
" My throat is still itchy , I need to get some milk . "
Njie was one of several affected when a suspected chemical irritant was sprayed into the mosque at 26 Josie St. , bringing Dayton police , fire and hazardous material personnel to the building at 9:48 p.m.
Someone " sprayed an irritant into the mosque , " Dayton fire District Chief Vince Wiley said , noting that fire investigators believe it was a hand - held spray can .
Many in Dayton are wondering if the mass distribution of " Obsession " has anything to do with this .
It 's unclear whether or not this was in the works before or after the attack on the mosque , but religious leaders were meeting in Dayton yesterday to talk about the DVD :
The 12 - year - old girl outside Limerick District Court yesterday .
The picture has been altered to protect her identity
Clare hurler and Limerick - based garda Tony Carmody pursued the stolen van through the streets of Limerick city after receiving a report of dangerous driving
A 12 - YEAR - OLD schoolgirl has been charged with dangerously driving a Hiace van , brazenly speeding past one of the country 's main garda stations , before ramming a patrol car .
The child , who is barely four feet tall , was alleged to have been involved in the dangerous driving incident in Limerick city , shortly after 3 am on Monday morning .
Renowned Clare hurler and Limerick - based garda , Tony Carmody , was involved in a chase through the city 's streets and into the surrounding estates .
A dangerous driving report was made to gardai by a passing motorist on the Dock Road , which is one of the city 's busiest thoroughfares .
With gardai in pursuit , complete with flashing lights and sirens blaring , a late night journey across Limerick city ensued .
From Henry Street , the stolen van journeyed onto O'Connell Street and up Mallow Street , towards the city 's bus and railway station on Parnell Street .
Braking
The van driver broke several red lights and was swerving all over the roads .
It continued through traffic lights without braking for " stop signs " onto Wickham Street , John Square , before ending up in Garryowen , on the city 's southside .
As gardai attempted to block the van , its driver rammed one of the patrol cars , before fleeing from the scene to a nearby house .
The blonde - haired child appeared in Limerick juvenile court yesterday afternoon and could barely be seen by the rest of the court when Judge Tom O'Donnell asked her to sit down .
Her mother was also present .
She was charged with five charges of dangerous driving , one count of criminal damage to a squad car and further charges of driving without a licence and no insurance by Garda Tony Carmody of Henry Street garda station .
She also faces two public order charges from Garda Ann Harrington and her colleague Paula Cregan , relating to an allegation which is alleged to have occurred last July .
The judge ordered that she obey a curfew between 8 pm and 8 am and stay at an address given .
She was also ordered to stay out of certain areas of the city .
The accused girl was granted bail on a bond of € 100 .
Judge O'Donnell asked the probation services to investigate the matter and prepare a probation report .
He adjourned the case until on September 30 .
It 's time to dig up an old favourite this week : red - light jumping .
I 've been thinking about the ethics of red - light jumping a little more than usual recently .
As it happens , I 've been interested in getting involved in politics , and wondered what I would do if I ever happened to become an elected official .
As became clear when David Cameron was caught riding the wrong way down a one - way street , politicians appear incredibly hypocritical if they go around breaking the law while preaching to everyone else at the same time .
To my mind , politicians should surely be the example that everyone else should follow , not people who believe that their privileged situation leaves them with a right to flout the law .
The problem is that when it comes to the laws that ban cyclists from jumping red lights , I fundamentally disagree with them .
As I 've written before , it 's often safer for a cyclist to get ahead of the traffic by jumping a light , and as long as it's always done with care – giving way to any traffic ( cars or pedestrians ) that have the right of way – it should n't be dangerous .
It 's certainly much safer than one of the legal courses of action , which is to hop off your bike and run with it across a busy junction .
Incidentally , this is what I do whenever I end up in front of a police car at traffic lights .
Rather than risking a ticket , I risk my life , by throwing my bike over my shoulder and making a run for it .
I hope the irony is not lost on the officers looking on .

Pedestrians can ( and do ) cross busy road junctions how they like , yet when it comes to bicycles , the law says you must stop at a red light , even though bikers can get across much faster and much more safely .
It 's entirely inconsistent .
One thing I certainly would do if I ever became a politician is to work towards changing the road laws so that they are safer and more flexible for bikes .
Letting cyclists turn left at red traffic lights , or jump lights when they 're coming along the top - side of a T - junction , would be easy measures to make the roads safer and more convenient for cyclists .
Encouragingly , organisations such as Cycling England – which recently received a windfall from the Government to improve facilities for cycling around the country – are already working hard to come up with ways of making city roads more bike - friendly .
But that does n't solve the problem of what to do in the meantime .
Sadly , until the law 's been changed , I think that politicians should be expected to stop at red lights – however ludicrous I might think the law is .
But for me , it 'll be a hard habit to break .
I signed up for updates from Nine Inch Nails ( NIN ) a while back because they were giving away one of their albums ( Ghosts I of Ghosts I - IV , I believe ) and I just got an email from Trent today .
I find it funny to see Trent using " pwn3d " in an email . :)
I think I will skip the date with Jeordie White whether or not condoms are supplied - thanks anyways !
Message from Trent :
Hello everyone .
I 'd like to thank everyone for a very successful year so far in the world of Nine Inch Nails .
I 'm enjoying my couple of weeks off between legs of our Lights In The Sky tour and got to thinking ... " would n't it be fun to send out a survey to everyone that 's shown interest in NIN ? "
Well , that 's not exactly how it went , but regardless - here it is .
As we 've moved from the familiar world of record labels and BS into the unknown world of doing everything yourself , we 've realized it would benefit us and our ability to interact with you if we knew more about what you want , what you like , what you look like naked , etc .
I know it 's a pain in the ass but we 'd truly appreciate it if you 'd take a minute and help us out .
As an incentive , everyone who completes the survey will be able to download a video of live performance from this most recent tour ( and I know what 's going through your little minds right now : " I 'll just grab this off a torrent site and not have to fill out the survey !!! " and guess what ?
You will be able to do just that and BEAT THE SYSTEM !!!!
NIN=pwn3d !!! )
BUT
What if we were to select some of those that DO complete the survey and provide them with something really cool ?
I 'm not saying we 'll ever get around to it , but if we did maybe something like signed stuff , flying someone to a show somewhere in the world , a magic amulet that makes you invisible , a date with Jeordie White ( condoms supplied of course ) , you know - something cool .
See , you 'd miss that opportunity AND be a cheater .
Do the right thing - help us out .
You 'll feel better .
Thank you and I 've had too much caffeine this morning ,
Trent

My friend Jon linked me this cool video for a game that 's coming out called Portal .
It is a first person shooter puzzle game , and it looks really interesting .
Check it out , yo !
Something is going to break , and soon .
Banks are insolvent and failing by the hundreds if not thousands .
Hedge funds are on the edge of oblivion .
Only a tiny percentage of toxic waste losses in real estate and other asset classes of collateral , which will eventually amount to over $ 1.4 trillion in the US alone , has to date been recognized by the lying bankster fraudsters .
Bonds are producing negative rates of return even based on ludicrously understated official rates of inflation ( until this month , when we finally got some data bordering on the truth ) .
Credit markets are frozen , and few can get financing at favorable rates .
Banks wo n't even lend to one another because they do not trust each other 's financial statements , which are all bogus .
Our financial system is unregulated , opaque and rife with fraud as our Treasury Secretary suggests we hand the reins over to the Fed , the very organization which is the driving force behind our myriad of woes .
The fractional reserve multiplier is not working and bank 's have had to resort to the commodity markets to make profits , thus driving up food and oil prices and the cost of raw materials .
Food riots are breaking out due to the ethanol scam .
Consumers are tapped out , are in debt up to their eyeballs , are being laid off by the hundreds of thousands , are being pounded by hyperinflation and crazy gas prices and are defaulting on consumer debts across the board at ever - increasing rates .
Civil unrest and the potential for revolution are everywhere .
A quadrillion dollar caldera of notional principal for credit default and interest rate swaps bubbles , smolders and churns , waiting to erupt into a world - economy - killing cataclysm .
Fannie and Freddie are imploding , and gargantuan government bailouts to save these owners or insurers of over half the mortgages in the US will drive us to higher rates of inflation and levels of direct taxation that are simply unheard of .
These higher levels of inflation and taxation are not as far out in the future as most would think .
That is because Paulson and Bernanke , who are oblivious to moral hazards because they are sociopaths , are now trying to dump what will be trillions in losses caused by endless banking scams on an ignorant and unsuspecting citizenry .
Rising interest rates due to increased risk and hyperinflation are just around the corner , and double digit interest rates will lock up the real estate markets in a cryogenic state as occurred in the early 1980s .
We have gone from being the largest creditor nation in the world to the largest debtor nation in a matter of a few decades as our manufacturing industry and economy have been gutted by free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing and both legal and illegal immigration .
Bubble after asset bubble have been created and destroyed by a malevolent
Fed trying to push us toward a one world government , economy and religion as powered by megalomaniacal , satanic trillionaires who have destroyed our middle class , our Constitution and our moral standards in order to drive us into their version of the ideal Platonic society where we all get to become their feudal indentured servants and slaves .
Our trade and budget deficits continue to mount with profligate spending on endless wars for profit and pork - loaded legislation .
Our nation is bankrupt .
Our gold reserves have been stolen , swapped , leased or otherwise compromised .
Our Congress , our Executive Branch , or military and our covert agencies are loaded with traitors and perverts who are driving us into a police state complete with a Gestapo and an SS .
We torture , maim and kill for fun and profits .
We make the Roman Empire at its most decadent look like Shangri - La .
Entire article ... Freddie Mac new Issue quickly approved by SEC , New offerings to absorb big losses , Gold escapes general pounding in the market , home builders sentiment index is at record low , depression is a real threat still After the markets closed on Friday , the announcement came that Freddie Mac plans to sell $ 5.5 billion dollars worth of new common and / or preferred shares to private investors , when its current market cap is only 6 billion .
Of course , they had to register the new issue with the SEC and get its approval in order to do this , and on Friday , they filed with the SEC , which quickly approved the new issuance .
This was no surprise of course because the SEC and Freddie are run by the same kind of people .
Freddie recently got caught up on their SEC filings after years of what really amounted to total noncompliance due to what you might call some " major accounting issues " even though technically they were granted an exemption from filing because of their GSE status .
So , even before the Treasury injects equity into Freddie by purchasing new issues of its shares with monetized treasury bonds created out of thin air , and / or before Freddie borrows from the Fed on treasury collateral which consists of those same ethereally created treasuries , the elitists plan to draw in new sucker - dupes so that both the current shareholders and new shareholders alike can get blasted with a huge dilution of their stock value .
We ask who the suicidal maniacs are who would venture to buy these new issues ?
First , note how the timing of this announcement , which came after markets closed on Friday as just noted above , was the same time frame used for the news about the IndyMac Bank closure .
This kind of timing manipulation is used by the elitists whenever they wish to prevent market panic , allow a cooling off period before markets reopen and / or keep as many people from seeing or hearing the announcement as possible as they get underway with their weekends .
You can bet your sweet bippy that if precious metals have any bad news , if that were even possible at this point , it would make front page news on Monday just before markets opened .
So much for a free press .
Instead we get the inane , people 's bane , fane - stream media .
If Thomas Jefferson were alive today he would be absolutely disgusted at the goings on in our government and in our press right now .
In fact , he would most likely call for a revolution !
Ron Paul is our Thomas Jefferson , and the elitists are quaking in fear at the revolution in thinking which Dr. No has bravely engendered with his presidential campaign .
Next , note how much US government and Freddie officials obviously believe Freddie to be undercapitalized after claiming outright only days ago that both Freddie and Fannie were and are adequately capitalized .
Among those claiming adequate capitalization before this announcement was none other than our beloved Treasury Secretary , Hanky Panky Paulson , on loan from Goldman Sachs , and Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut , elitist bootlicker and Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
From their mouths to God 's ears .
These reprobates give serpents a bad name .
If they had been with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden , who knows what perverse lies they might have sold to our progenitors ?
You think we have problems now ?
We would probably have the Adam and Eve First National Bank .
Can you just imagine ?
These two pieces of work are truly unbelievable .
Buck - Busting Ben and Cheney the Wienie round out the new Rat Pack of liars and scalawags .
Then look at what will happen to the price of Freddie 's shares .
The Freddie share price closed way down at $ 5.26 on Tuesday based on all the scary bailout news , but ended the week with a price of $ 9.18 when new sucker - dupes jumped in based on government and fane - stream media hype about a potential bottom in the real estate markets and the patently false and misleading earnings reports of Wells Fargo and Citigroup which left investors with the impression that Freddie and Fannie might not be in as much trouble as everyone thought .
Short - covering was another major factor which accounted for the higher share price .
The potential for the new proposed Freddie issue was enhanced by the increased stock price because the higher price allowed more capital to be raised using fewer shares , but the new shareholders and old shareholders alike could find themselves owning stock worth substantially less because of the resulting dilution and mounting overall losses from a tanking real estate market , which Freddie admits !
Can you believe it ?
All those new shareholders could end up with an instant haircut !
And that does not even take into account the potential for the purchase of new Freddie shares by the Treasury in a bailout situation , which is inevitable !
Sometimes we wonder if we are still conscious or whether we have been hooked up to the Goldilocks Matrix pod where everything turns out juuust riiight .
As the Mogambo Guru might say : " Hahaha ! Morons !
Hahaha ! "
Somehow , with over a trillion dollars of mystery off - balance - sheet toxic waste assets , Citigroup coughs up only $ 2.5 billion in losses for the second quarter .
Can we suggest that we are more than a little skeptical of this figure ?
Enough said .
The same pathological lies will also be spewed forth for all the other banking fraudsters this quarter .
After all , we have incumbents that have to be reelected to keep the Illuminist scam wagon rolling down the road .
We recoil in disgust at such unmitigated arrogance in financial reporting .
Can you imagine the potential liability of the CPA 's involved in this mess ?
How do these people sleep at night ?
They probably sleep just fine , because they are all sociopaths , or they would n't be working for these elitist institutions .
Gold has been implacable this week .
The cartel 's best efforts have yielded little more than a brief tamping down of gold below 1,000 .
Despite the best efforts of the Illuminati , gold is still trading over $ 950 and silver is still over $ 18 .
Despite an $ 18 dollar per barrel takedown of oil from peak to trough this week , the largest such decline ever , and phony dollar rallies galore , gold is still more than $ 100 per ounce over its recent lows .
The resource stocks have been pounded mercilessly with naked shorting , yet are still maintaining the same levels as two weeks ago on July 3 .
Lease rates are negative or near zero for both gold and silver , but no one wants to lease gold or silver for subsequent sale due to the potential to get vaporized if any untoward event occurs , such as more bank failures or the outbreak of a war or conflict .
The naked shorts of the SLV shares and illegal rationing of Silver Eagles by the US Mint are barely keeping silver from exploding to new highs .
This resiliency in the precious metals has many facets and reasons for support .
The CPI and PPI are at 26 and 27 - year highs .
The Fed pumps $ 500 billion monthly into the banking system just to keep it from freezing up .
M3 rages at 17 % to 18 % , thus locking in years of hyperinflation no matter what the Fed does .
The Fed has no credible way of cutting rates or even threatening to cut them as the ECB hikes to levels that are more than double the Fed funds rate .
The dollar is quickly reaching new all - time lows against the euro and has recently scraped up against its all - time lows this past week on the USDX .
It is headed for 67 to 68 .
This presents the potential for establishing a dollar carry trade , which would take the dollar quickly to new lows .
All major stock market exchanges around the globe are in Bear Market Territory , having plunged to 20 % or more from their most recent highs .
Various Arab nations are threatening to break dollar pegs .
Wars and threats of wars abound everywhere in Georgia , Kosovo , Iraq , Iran , Syria , Lebanon and North Korea .
Inflation is raging worldwide , which means that populations across the globe are quite literally being taxed to death by their governments .
This just simply cannot continue .
Something is going to break , and soon .
Banks are insolvent and failing by the hundreds if not thousands .
Hedge funds are on the edge of oblivion .
Only a tiny percentage of toxic waste losses in real estate and other asset classes of collateral , which will eventually amount to over $ 1.4 trillion in the US alone , has to date been recognized by the lying bankster fraudsters .

We make the Roman Empire at its most decadent look like Shangri - La .
The greatest depression of all time looms at our doorsteps .
The barbarians are at the gates , but no one notices or cares .
It is nothing short of surreal .
Those without gold or silver will make great sport for the barbarians , who also happen to like the " barbaric relic " known as gold , because they are more intelligent than the average US citizen .
Large specs have become wise to the manipulations of the PPT in suppression of precious metals and maintain protective derivatives against such manipulations .
The next wedding and jewelry seasons in India , the Orient and the Middle East are upon us .
Open interest for August gold on the COMEX has gone up over 100,000 contracts in the past month , and there are already 112,500 contracts of open interest for December futures as everyone tools up for a big fall rally .
The number of contracts of open interest on Goldman 's COMEX gold shorts are at record lows .
We still have two weeks before August contracts get rolled over at the end of July , and then all hell will break loose .
So take your positions now in gold and silver , or turn green with envy as the rest of us make magnificent profits .
It may be now or never .
After the elections , there will be a no-holds - barred unraveling of the system , assuming we even have elections , and there is no telling how fast and how high gold and silver could rocket .
If you stay on the sidelines , you could miss the whole thing .
If you were wondering about the stock rallies , do n't .
The yen went wimpy right on cue to support stock markets just as oil was taken down in record fashion to further support stock markets and to suppress precious metals .
Since Wednesday , the carry traders have gotten back into it with a reduction of the value of the yen by two yen per dollar and by three and one half yen per euro .
Add in the Fed 's out - of - control repo pool for funding , the PPT 's usual manipulative efforts and the pathological lies shown in banks ' financial statements , the drop in oil to support the dollar , and the rally mystery is solved .
Elementary , my dear Watson .
Note that this was options expiration week , so most of the rally was powered by a short - covering rally ignited by the PPT to drain value from protective derivatives carried by large specs to protect themselves from the PPT .
Fortunately for us , most of the specs probably got out when the Dow hit 10,800 .
Specs should short oil over 140 and a Dow over 12,000 .
Note that dollars chased from bonds , treasuries and money markets back into foreign stocks usually causes the dollar to weaken .
Since this did not happen , it is a clear sign of intervention by the PPT , which will soon subside since they simply cannot keep this pace up for very long in such a gargantuan forex market .
Gold and silver are headed much higher , and will now regroup for the final assault on $ 1,000 for gold and $ 21 for silver that will take us to new heights and more unexplored territory .
The home builders ' sentiment index fell two points in July to record - low 16 , with all three components of the survey also dropping to historic lows , the National Association of Home Builders reported Wednesday .
At 16 , the NAHB / Wells Fargo housing market index shows that only one - in - six home builders has a positive view of the market .
New subdivisions have become ghost towns , with current sales dropping off and with the traffic of prospective buyers drying up in recent months .
Few builders anticipate any improvement in sales in the next six months .
MUNICH , Germany ( Reuters ) - German doctors have succeeded in transplanting two complete arms onto a 54 - year old man in what their hospital said was the world ’s first operation of this kind .
During 15 hours of surgery , a team of 40 medics attached the arms to a farmer who lost both his arms in an accident six years ago .
The patient was well , the hospital said on Friday .
“ Before the operation , we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact he ’d have somebody else ’s hands , ” said Edgar Biemer from the hospital in the southern city of Munich , where the operation took place last week .
“ When he woke up he looked at his hands and ( went ) : ‘ Very good ’ , ” Biemer , one of the doctors in charge of the operation , told Reuters television .
Biemer said that so far , only transplants of lower arms had taken place .
One of the main difficulties for full - arm transplants was finding donors .
“ Already , the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining , ” he said .
“ ( On top of that ) , it is more acceptable for people to have a relative ’s kidneys taken out , than for them to have an entire leg , hand or their face cut off . ”
In 2005 , French doctors performed the world ’s first partial face transplant on a 38 - year old woman , who had her nose , cheeks , mouth , lips and chin replaced by donor tissue after they were torn off by her dog .
Noel Gallagher , the lead guitarist for Oasis
Noel Gallagher , the Oasis lead guitarist , semi- frontman and overall douche - bag , paid Zane Lowe a visit the other day , at the latter ’s BBC Radio 1 show which he moderates .
There , Noel talked about Jay - Z ’s response to the Glastonbury scandel , as he listened to the Oasis dis song Jockin ’ Jay - Z for the first time , ’ stupid informed journalists who ask him about his latest album being leaked and also rudely jokingly encourages people to rip off other ’s people music , as long as it ’s not Oasis of course .
Honestly , I was very surprised to hear Noel reaction to P2P networks that leak out thousands of albums yearly , as he was quite positive about it , more or less , approving the practice .
Heck , I thought he was gonna call P2P ‘ eviiiil ’ like the rest of them do .
Truth be it , P2P does n’t hurt artists as much as they think , actually it helps them a lot , because they promote their stuff extensively ; the small bands , at least , would stand no chance of getting measly successful if it were n’t for the interwebs .
Bands like Radiohead , Nine Inch Nails , Saul Williams ,
The Charlants and many other have understood this long time ago and have adapted to the modern , digital age , by giving away albums and enforcing a pay - what - you - will program .
I actually wrote a column way back about Oasis giving away their upcoming album , “ Dig Out Your Soul , ” for free , but my hunch proved wrong .
Anyway , back to the Noel BBC show , because he has something really fun to share with us .
Whilst discussing the forthcoming Oasis album , Gallagher notes that a reporter from a UK national newspaper called him , explaining that the tracks had already been leaked onto the Internet :
“ I had a guy from a national newspaper track me down and say ‘ Have you got any comment to make ?
All of your new album has come up on the Internet ! ’ and I was going , ‘ It ’s impossible , it ’s ludicrous ’ , because only four or five people had copies .
So I said ‘ Read out the song titles that are up on the Internet ’ and he read out the track - listing from the last album !
So I was like , ‘ That ’s on the Internet is it ?
It ’s also in HMV – in the ‘ O ’ section ….. you idiot . ”
Are n’t we confident , Noel ?
Albeit the report was indeed an idiot .
However , what if the new album were indeed to be leaked ?
“ No , it ’s one of those things , ” he told Zane .
“ If it ’s out there and you can get it , you know , go ahead .
I ’m certainly not going to get into Lars Ulrich mode about this . ”
When asked by Zane whether he condones in downloading stuff from time to time , Noel sincerely responded that “ It ’s well documented , I do n’t even have a computer and I do n’t get involved in that type of gear , ” he said .
Where you get your pr0n then ?
Still , what does Noel Gallagher think of piracy in general ?
“ If people are willing to have faceless CDs like that in their collection , good for them .
It would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock - star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids have n’t got that much money to pay for an album , so if they can find it for free , go ahead !
But do n’t do it on Oasis records though – because that ’s against the law . ”
Yes , Noel , very inspiring .
Still , I do n’t think kids will pay too much attention to your words and I sure as heck doubt your new album will be spared of any such activities either .
The new Oasis album , “ Dig Out Your Soul “ , is out on October 6th 2008 , so kids please do the right think and buy it .
After all , Noel ’s only ” down to his last £ 4 million . ”

The Internet , and especially blogs , are quickly becoming recognized as a great source of debate and opinion on controversial topics .
Stories that begin in the mainstream media often spill over to blogs for discussion , and more and more often now , people form their own opinions after reading both sides of issues on blogs .
A perfect example of this is the debate over Comcast ’s traffic shaping to suppress P2P applications .
Comcast ultimately stopped the practice and was fined by the FCC , but during the runup to the FCC hearings , many blogs , including this one , offered opinions on whether or not Comcast ’s practices were against net neutrality or constituted normal traffic management .
I have written in this space previously that , in my opinion , what Comcast was doing was necessary as day to day management of their network .
What if it came out later that Comcast was paying me to write this on this blog ?
( they did n’t . )
Would n’t that make you mad ?
I know that it would make me mad if I found that such a biased piece was written on one of my favorite blogs .
But this is just what has been happening on other blogs and online newpapers , including The Harvard Crimson .
In this article here , author Mel King writes that FCC has been putting on a “ dog and pony show ” regarding Comcast ’s traffic management .
Now he has been outed by CNET ’s Declan McCullagh as a staunch supporter of net neutrality , and an opponent of federal legislation that would benefit Broadband Providers .
So why the opposing opinion piece for the Crimson ?
According to McCullagh , its because he is a member of LawMediaGroup , a DC lobbying and public affairs firm that specializes in turning controversial issues into campaigns for corporate interests .
And Comcast hired LMG to campaign against the net neutrality message in the courts of public opinion .
According to LMG ’s website , this is how they do it :
Most public affairs firms are “ stovepipes ” which specialize in discrete issues such as traditional lobbying , media buys , or often merely purchasing grassroots relationships with the clients ’ funds .
By contrast , LMG uses a “ political campaign model ” that integrates expertise in the subject matter , message development , aggressive , research - driven paid and earned media , on - the - ground coalition building , preparation of analytical and other policy papers , and a host of next - generation services such as viral and online campaigns .
Our goal is to dominate the media environment on behalf of the client . “
In order to be a blogger for one of these types of media lobbying firms , you have to keep it a secret , but the job could be lucrative .
Again , according to McCullagh , op - ed pieces on blogs or newspapers can earn about $ 750 bucks per article .
Not bad work if you can get it , I guess .
But I did n’t know integrity had such a low price tag .

The " Dig It " exhibit at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of natural History in Washington .
The exhibit explores the mysterious and complex world of soil .
WASHINGTON  Dishing the dirt has a long history in Washington , but the Smithsonian Institution is taking it to new depths .
The National Museum of Natural History opens a new exhibit on Saturday — " Dig It " — exploring the mysterious and complex world of soil .
" We want people to walk away understanding that soils are living , living breathing bodies , " said exhibit curator Patrick Megonigal , a soil ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater , Maryland .
SMITHSONIAN : ' Dig it !
The Secrets of Soil ' " One of the most important messages for me is that people get beyond thinking of soil as something in their garden , but think of it as the foundation of all the Earth 's ecosystems , " as important as air and water , he said .
There 's no mudslinging in this exhibit ; it stresses that most life on the planet depends on soil one way or another , yet it 's a subject with many secrets yet to be spaded up .
While the biggest environmental problem right now is climate change , " just over the horizon is learning how to make agriculture sustainable , " said David Montgomery , a soil geomorphologist at the University of Washington .
" We face some very basic choices over the next 50 years and one of those is to reinvest in our soils , " Montgomery said in a telephone interview .
In many areas , he explained , soil is being eroded faster than it is being replaced .
" We usually take it for granted , it 's just dirt , after all . "
But , he added : " Soil is one of the basic bits of the foundation of life .
Soils are created , destroyed and transformed .
They can be used up just like any other resource , " Montgomery said .
The chemical and physical properties of soil help clean and purify rainwater that passes through , added Diana Wall , a soil ecologist at Colorado State University .
American researchers recognize 12 orders of soil , Megonigal explained , ranging from frozen tundra to deserts to volcanic .
Look for more detail and the orders can be divided into 70,000 soil series .
" The variability is just numbing , " he said .
Soil can even bring on nostalgia — Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer spoke longingly at an exhibit preview of missing the smell of the rich , deep soil of his native North Dakota .
Air and water get more attention , said Rep. Jim Costa , D - Calif. , but the necessities of life are like a recipe , you need all the ingredients , air , water and soil .
After families come through this exhibit , added Rep. Tom Latham , R - Iowa , " the kids will look at mud a whole lot different . "
Visitors can , at least figuratively , get down and dirty at such displays as : • " At Home in the World of Soils , " a gallery where people can learn about the connections between soil and culture .
It includes a scale model of a suburban house lot that highlights soils in and around our homes .
•
A video features soils as the " secret ingredients " in thousands of everyday items including medicine , food , fiber , paint , cosmetics , and pottery .
• An " Underneath it All " gallery includes a topographic model to illustrate the role of soils in residential , urban and agricultural areas .
•
Touchable soil samples provide close - up looks of two different urban soils found in Washington , D.C. •
The global view is emphasized in " The Big Picture , " including a world map and computer interactive stations that highlight global connections to soils .
• " Get Soil Savvy ! " explores the importance of soils in land management and conservation .
•
A detective - story video on decomposition in which soil scientists investigate a grisly pumpkin murder .
• " Chef 's Challenge " — a la Iron Chef — where soil chefs create very different soils from the same ingredients .
The exhibit will remain at the museum until Jan. 3 , 2010 and then will go on tour to other museums around the country .
Supporting development of the exhibit were the Soil Science Society of America and the Nutrients for Life Foundation .

Exercise may be tough at first - but is worth the effort Women who want to lose weight - and keep it off - need to be exercising for almost an hour , five days a week , according to US experts .
The University of Pittsburgh study found the 55 - minute regime was the minimum needed to maintain a 10 % drop in weight .
Only a quarter of the 200 women in the study managed to lose this amount .
A UK expert said it was clear that regular moderate exercise was the way to lose weight , and keep it off .
Thirty minutes a day is good for general health , but if you want to lose weight , you need to be doing more , and if you want to sustain weight loss , you need to be doing even more than that
Professor Paul Gately
Leeds Metropolitan University Approximately two - thirds of adults in the UK are overweight or obese , with some estimates suggesting this could rise to nine in ten by 2050 .
Research points to a combination of exercise and calorie control as having the best chance of success in weight loss - although the majority of people who attempt these diets fail to keep the weight off .
The latest research , published in the Archives of Internal Medicine journal , confirms that plenty of exercise is a key ingredient of success .
The Pittsburgh researchers looked at a group of overweight and obese women over a four year period .
They were all told to eat between 1,200 and 1,500 calories a day , and split into four different exercise programmes , varying the intensity and amount of exercise carried out .
After six months , women in all four groups had lost up to 10 % of their body weight - but most could not keep this going .
The women who did maintain the 10 % loss were those who reported doing more exercise , on average 275 minutes per week .
Hour target
In the UK , everyone is encouraged to manage at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week , but scientists say that people wanting to maintain weight loss need much more .
Professor Paul Gately , a specialist in exercise and obesity , from Leeds Metropolitan University , said : " This study is excellent - it 's the best evidence that this higher level of exercise is needed .
" Thirty minutes a day is good for general health , but if you want to lose weight , you need to be doing more , and if you want to sustain weight loss , you need to be doing even more than that .
" In this country , between an hour and 90 minutes of exercise a day is the recommended level for maintaining weight loss . "
He said that " moderate " exercise covered anything that made you slightly breathless , from brisk walking to gardening .
Some US researchers have been looking at novel ways to increase the level of activity among those with " couch potato " lifestyles .
Dr James Levine is helping develop the " Walkstation " , a computer terminal with a treadmill instead of a chair .
Writing in the same journal , he said : " Sitting at one 's desk uses barely any more calories than staying in bed , but walking at 1 mph while working increases caloric expenditure by approximately 125 calories an hour . "

Predicting climate change depends on many factors not properly included in current forecasting models , such as how the major polar ice caps will move in the event of melting around their edges .
This in turn requires greater understanding of the processes at work when ice is under stress , influencing how it flows and moves .
The immediate objective is to model the flow of ice sheets and glaciers more accurately , leading in turn to better future predictions of global ice cover for use in climate modeling and forecasting .
Progress and future research objectives in the field were discussed at a recent workshop organized by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) , bringing together glaciologists , geologists , and experts in the processes of cracking under stress in other crystalline materials , notably metals and rocks .
The essential problem is that processes at different scales starting from the molecular and going up to whole ice sheets need to be integrated in order to develop models capable of accurate predictions .
While the processes at the molecular level inside individual ice crystals are quite well understood , too little attention has been paid to the properties of ice at the scale of each grain , comprising organized groups of crystals .
All crystalline solids , including metals , are comprised of grains , which are about 1 to 3 cms across in the case of ice .
The grain is fundamental for ice movement , because of the strong mechanical anisotropy ( irregularity ) of individual ice grains .
" These processes are much less understood , and one could say they are more ' messy ' , " said Paul Bons , who co-chaired the ESF workshop .
" The challenge ahead is to convert the insight gained on the effects of grain - scale processes into improved rheological models . "
Rheology is the study of how materials such as ice or rock flow when forces are applied to them .
As Bons noted , such knowledge of grain - level interactions is needed not just to construct better models of ice caps , but also for understanding processes inside the earth 's mantle , which could help predict earthquakes and volcanoes .
" The interesting thing here is actually the similarity between all these compounds , not the differences , " said Bons , himself a geologist .
" Essentially the same processes occur in ice , minerals and metals . "
The differences lie just in the balance between these processes , with interactions between crystals within grains being more significant in ice than metals or rocks .
But as was noted by Sergio Faria , another co-chair , it is important to resolve these issues , since current models can be highly inaccurate in predicting ice flows , as has been found by analysing ice cores drilled into glaciers .
" The microstructures observed in ice core samples indicate the deformation mechanisms active in an ice sheet , " said Faria .
" Depending upon the sort of active mechanisms , the flow of an ice sheet may vary by orders of magnitude .
Therefore a precise understanding of ice microstructures - and consequently of active deformation mechanisms - is essential to reduce the current uncertainty in ice sheet flow models . "
As a result of recent findings , the current approach to ice flow analysis , the so - called 3 - layer model , will have to be revised , according to Sepp Kipfstuhl , the ESF conference 's third co-convenor .
" It was interesting to see at the workshop that the study of microstructures challenges standard models for polar ice , especially the classical 3 - layer model and the standard flow law of ice .
This is an ' inconvenient truth ' that complicates large - scale ice flow models , and hence impacts on climate modeling , " said Kipfstuhl . "
As in all branches of science , this inconvenient truth must be faced head on in order to solve the problem of accurate ice flow prediction , which has become all the more pressing in the light of current concerned over the impact of climate change .
###
The workshop Modelling And Interpretation Of Ice Microstructures was held April 2008 in Göttingen , Germany .
Each year , ESF supports approximately 50 Exploratory Workshops across all scientific domains .
These small , interactive group sessions are aimed at opening up new directions in research to explore new fields with a potential impact on developments in science .
Barack Obama likes to talk about “ Obamacans ” -- Republicans who he says approach him at political events and quietly pledge their support for his presidential candidacy .
On Tuesday , he snagged two more Republicans , but these were high - profile politicians willing to speak out on his behalf .
The first was former U.S. Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa , who endorsed him during a conference call with reporters .
Leach said he was concerned about the “ current philosophy of government ” and worried that John McCain would be “ more of the same . ”

“ I ’m convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world , ” he said .
During the call , Leach twice suggested that Obama choose Sen. Chuck Hagel as his running mate .
If Hagel , a Nebraska Republican and longtime friend of McCain ’s , were to join an Obama ticket , he would be the biggest - name Obamacan in the country .
Another “ Republican for Obama ” who emerged Tuesday was Jim Whitaker , mayor of the Fairbanks North Star Borough in Alaska .
Whitaker told the Daily News - Miner that he likes Obama ’s energy policy and believes the Democrat has the stronger “ intellectual capacity ” of the two candidates .

Whitaker , an Alaska legislator from 1999 to 2003 , supported McCain in the 2000 Republican primary .

This month , red meat once again made headline news after a new study reported that eating cured meats such as bacon , sausages and luncheon meats , increased the risk of developing a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
The research , published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , set out to see whether frequently eating cured meats increased the risk of COPD and impaired lung function .
The study included more than 7,000 adults over the age of 45 .
The researchers divided the participants into groups depending on their consumption of cured meat .
There were five groups :
Those who did n’t eat cured meats
Those who ate 1 - 2 servings a month
Those who ate 3 - 4 servings per month
Those who ate 5 - 13 servings per month
Those who ate more than 14 servings per month .
Compared to those subjects who ate no cured meats , those eating 14 or more servings a month were found to be almost twice as likely to develop COPD .
However , those people who ate the most cured meats were also more likely to smoke and to have lower intakes of fruit , veg , fish , vitamin and mineral supplements , vitamin C and beta - carotene .
The researchers suggest that nitrites added to cured meats as preservatives , antimicrobial agents or colour fixatives might be responsible for damaging the lungs .
WLR says :
This is an interesting study but it should be interpreted with caution .
It ’s worth pointing out that COPD is typically a disease associated with smoking and this study found that those people who ate the most cured meats were also more likely to smoke .
This makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions .
As is often the case in research , it ’s incredibly difficult to isolate one particular aspect of a person ’s diet and claim that it is responsible for causing a particular disease .
High consumers of cured meat were also more likely to have lower intakes of fruit and veg .
This may also affect the conclusions as fruit and veg tend to help protect against COPD .
The British Nutrition Foundation sums up the findings of this study extremely well .
It says ,
“ This large prospective study does seem to suggest an association between a very high cured meat consumption ( more than 14 times per month ) and an increase in the risk of COPD , but there is little previous research supporting this .
Most evidence suggests that high intakes of fruit and veg are protective .
Despite attempts to control for other dietary differences , those consuming such high intakes of processed meat are likely to have many different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from those who do n’t eat it at all .
There is no evidence that a moderate consumption of cured meat is detrimental in relation to COPD and no evidence to suggest that red meat in general is a problem . ”
Bottom line : small to moderate amounts of cured meat such as bacon as part of a balanced , healthy diet are unlikely to cause health problems .
When it comes to keeping your lungs healthy , avoiding smoking and eating five fruit and veg every day are two of the best things you can do .
For a healthy heart and to lose weight , remove any visible fat from any meat , including bacon , opt for lower - fat sausages and grill rather than fry products .
[ Suggested listening while reading this post : Quality Control – Jurassic 5 ]
Prior to moving to London to join Last . fm I worked on credit card software for a leading international bank .
When it comes to dealing with people ’s money there is n’t much room for mistakes and buggy code can have major consequences .
For these reasons there were a number of processes and systems in place to reduce the likelihood of software errors .
Despite what some of our more critical users may think , we do actually have a number of similar systems ( and some novel additions ) in place at Last.fm .
We use software like Cacti , Ganglia , Nagios and JMX to monitor many aspects of our running infrastructure and the results are made available in a number of ways – from coloured graphs to arcanely - formatted log files .
So much information is churned out that one could easily spend all day just looking at all the output until one ’s mind buckled under the data overload .
For this reason we selectively take the most vital data ( things like database load , web request times , uptime status of core machines ) and display these on eye - catching displays in our operations room .
The setup shown above is great for being able to look up and get a quick feel for the current state of our systems .
Blinking red and graphs with huge spikes are rarely a good thing .
In addition to these displays we also have a number of alerts ( e- mail , sms , irccat ) that get triggered if things go wrong while we are away from the screens ( yes , it does happen ) .
There is nothing quite like the joy of being woken up in the early hours of the morning with a barrage of text messages containing the details of each and every machine that has unexpectedly crashed .
While all of this is very useful for keeping an eye on the code while it is running , it ’s also good to be able to put the code through some checks and balances before we unleash it on the wider world .
One means to this end is the venerable Hudson – a continuous integration engine that constantly builds our software , checks it for style and common coding errors , then instruments and tests it and reports on any violations that maybe have been introduced since the last time it ran .
We have over 30 internal projects that use Hudson and a few thousand tests which run over the code .
Hudson comes with a web interface and can be configured to send email when people “ break the build ” ( e.g. by making a change that causes a test to fail ) .
We decided that this was n’t nearly humiliating enough and followed this suggestion ( our setup pictured below ) to introduce a more public form of punishment .
These 3 bears sit in a prominent position and watch our developer ’s every move .
When things are good we have a green bear gently glowing and purring , when changes are being processed a yellow bear joins the party , and if the build gets broken the growling evil red bear makes an appearance .
The developer who broke things usually goes a similar shade of red while frantically trying to fix whatever was broken while the others chortle in the background .
Amid all this hi-tech digital trickery , it is sometimes nice to be able to cast one ’s mind back to the simpler analogue age and the measuring devices of the past .
For example , we hooked up an analogue meter like those used in many industries for decades , fed it some different input and ended up with a literal desktop dashboard that measures average website response time .
It is strangely mesmerising to see this meter rev up and down as website demand changes over the day ( or we manage to overload our data centre ’s power supply and a significant portion of our web farm gets to take an unexpected break from service ) .
On the whole we have a great variety of options for keeping our eyes on the quality prize , thanks in no small measure to the efforts of the open source software community who crafted all the software I have mentioned .
Of course the biggest challenge to ensuring quality is still the human component – getting people to actually use these tools and instilling the desire and motivation to make software as bug - free as possible .
If any of you out there use similar tools that you are passionate about let us know .
I ’d also love to hear if anyone has any other amusing or original systems to keep quality control fun and fresh .
For me , I ’ve got a glowing green bear to keep company … .

According to the Earth Impact Database , a resource maintained by the Geological Survey of Canada and University of New Brunswick , only 173 such impact craters have been discovered in the world .
The find will likely deliver a lifetime of peer group kudos to Dr Hickman , a government geologist with the Geological Survey of Western Australia .
" I was n't looking for it , " Dr Hickman recalled in a telephone interview .
" I was high up in Google Earth [ the free program that enables users to scour the Earth using stitched together aerial and satellite images ] when I spotted this little circular structure which struck me as odd . "
Dr Hickman , who heads his organisation 's Pilbara Craton Mapping Project , says he made the discovery last July while he was looking for possible sites of channel iron deposits - highly sought after alluvial deposits from which the ore can be extracted very cheaply .
Although the crater is situated about 1000 kilometres north - east of Perth and more than 300 kilometres south - east of Port Headland , it is only 35 kilometres north of the mining town of Newman in an area that has been previously surveyed .
Dr Hickman referred his find to Dr Andrew Glikson , an impact crater expert who is a visiting fellow at the Australian National University 's Research School of Earth Sciences .
Dr Glikson , who has been studying impact craters since 1968 , visited the site in August and corroborated Dr Hickman 's hypothesis .
" It 's a little beauty , " he said in a telephone interview .
" It 's an absolute gem in terms of youth and preservation . "
He said the only other explanation for the formation - which is about the same size as the Melbourne Cricket Ground - is a volcanic eruption .
But the lack of young volcanic material in area surrounding the crater rules this theory out .
" No other process could have created this type of crater , " said Dr Glikson , who estimates the meteorite was between 10 to 15 metres in diameter when it slammed into the Earth .
The two geologists - together with a third scientist - have written and submitted a paper on the discovery to the Australian Journal of Earth Sciences , where it will be subjected to peer review .
The next step in the process of formal identification involves returning to the site and trying to find shards of meteorite that have been left behind , or examples of terrestrial rocks that have been fused together with extraterrestrial matter as a result of the violent impact .
Dr Hickman , who hopes to visit the site for the first time in May , says the site is about half a day 's drive north from the town of Newman following the privately - owned rail line to Port Headland , which is famous for its mile - long trains .
He said it was Dr Glikson 's decision to name his find the Hickman Crater .
" I 'm not that conceited , " he said modestly .
Dr Glikson , who also has another crater in Western Australia named after him , says he could n't explain why the crater had n't been found before .
" This one stands out like a sore thumb on Google Earth , " he said .
The crater site can be seen on Google Maps ( see embedded map , above right ) and on Google Earth ( requires download ) .
Some 40,000 years ago , Cro-Magnons -- the first people who had a skeleton that looked anatomically modern -- entered Europe , coming from Africa .
A group of geneticists , coordinated by Guido Barbujani and David Caramelli of the Universities of Ferrara and Florence , shows that a Cro-Magnoid individual who lived in Southern Italy 28,000 years ago was a modern European , genetically as well as anatomically .
The Cro-Magnoid people long coexisted in Europe with other humans , the Neandertals , whose anatomy and DNA were clearly different from ours .
However , obtaining a reliable sequence of Cro-Magnoid DNA was technically challenging .
" The risk in the study of ancient individuals is to attribute to the fossil specimen the DNA left there by archaeologists or biologists who manipulated it , " Barbujani says .
" To avoid that , we followed all phases of the retrieval of the fossil bones and typed the DNA sequences of all people who had any contacts with them . "
The researchers wrote in the newly published paper : " The Paglicci 23 individual carried a mtDNA sequence that is still common in Europe , and which radically differs from those of the almost contemporary Neandertals , demonstrating a genealogical continuity across 28,000 years , from Cro-Magnoid to modern Europeans . "
The results demonstrate for the first time that the anatomical differences between Neandertals and Cro-Magnoids were associated with clear genetic differences .
The Neandertal people , who lived in Europe for nearly 300,000 years , are not the ancestors of modern Europeans .

If you ’ve come anywhere near a TV tuned into a cable news channel in the past 24 hours you , no doubt , have seen John McCain ’s latest ad attacking Barack Obama for being a celebrity .
In case you missed it the first 36,574 times CNN , MSNBC or FOX News aired it , here it is :
I must admit I ’m a bit confused by this .
Never , in my life have I seen a candidate attack his opponent for being too popular .
And not only did they attack him for being too popular , but they took it a step farther and went out of their way to exaggerate just how popular he actually is : " he ’s the biggest celebrity in the world . " ?
Really ?
I was going to move forward from this point in the article and question whether or not Obama really was the biggest celebrity in the world , but I can not compete with the entertainment that McCain Campaign Manager , Rick Davis provided journalists on a conference call yesterday morning .
So here are a few excerpts from that conference call via Chuck Todd 's First Read :
When asked what makes Obama a celebrity and not McCain , Davis said that he'd " love to think that John McCain was a big international celebrity , but he 's not . "
So , now , once again I am confused .
Is this ad supposed to be an anti-Obama ad ?
Well , of course it is , the sinister voice tells us so .
It just seems odd to begin an attack ad by starting it out with an admission that the other candidate is something ( an international celebrity ) that your candidate would like to be , but is n’t .
But it gets better .
Davis is not done talking up the opposition :
" One of the points that should be clear here today is that the Obama campaign does a wonderful job of presenting their candidate in the most popular light that they can get , and I think they do a very good job at it , " Davis said .
" They have more fans around the world than Britney Spears does .
I make that bold , blatant statement . "
Wow .
Rick , are you in the right business ?
Are you just making a statement of fact that your opponent is doing a fantastic job or are you confused as to what the role of a campaign staff should be ?
What light do you like to present your candidate in ?
But no time to linger on that , there ’s more :
McCain is more of a " global leader than a global celebrity , " Davis added , saying that when other nations want to speak about the issues they turn to McCain .
But , as Jonathan Martin points out , McCain ’s " got a lengthy IMDB entry and had memorable walk - on's in both ‘ 24 ’ and ‘ Wedding Crashers , ’ the latter of which prompted a memorable Drudge headline .
McCain has also been applauded for his several appearances on Saturday Night Live and he has set records for his number of appearances on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
Does n’t seem like McCain is the type of guy who has actively avoided the label of celebrity .
But moving on :
Why compare Obama with Spears and Hilton ?
" What we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world , and I would say from our estimations Britney and Paris came in second and third , " Davis said .
" So from our perspective we have in this ad the three biggest celebrities in the world .
But the McCain campaign did n't say where they got their celebrity rankings , and according to CelebrityPopularity.com , Obama is unranked .
For the record , Britney Spears is No. 5 on the CelebrityPopularity list , Paris Hilton is No. 10 and apparently No. 1 is Eminem , followed by Mariah Carey and 50 Cent .
( Another list found Obama No. 81 .
Miley Cyrus and Angelina Jolie were 1 and 2 in that one . )
I am the last person to claim to know anything about the world of celebrities , but I can't imagine that John McCain 's staff has a much better grasp on it than I do , and the following excerpt seems to prove my point :
When asked if Obama was " frivolous " and " irresponsible , " as is the perception with Spears and Hilton , Davis said , " Yeah " and " I think that 's what we 've been saying all along .... Apples to apples . "
I know I already said " wow " in this piece , but WOW !
Apples to Apples !?!
Barack Obama is apples to apples with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ?
I ’m no expert on celebrities , but have either Britney Spears or Paris Hilton ever done this :
I have a hunch they have n’t .
The notion that Barack Obama is somehow on par with Spears or Hilton in any way , shape or form is absolutely insane .
To be fair , however , Rick Davis did eventually provide an answer as to what this ad was about :
" Will people think of this as negative advertising ?
It 's the most entertaining thing I 've seen on TV in a while .
I mean I do n't -- I would n't anticipate anything about this being negative .
I mean the point is this is the event he put on . "
Well , good job Rick. 19 seconds of a 30 - second ad spent on making the point " this is the event he put on . "
Thanks for clearing that up .
If this is your idea of a good , or even decent presidential campaign ad Mr. Davis , and if these are the messages you 're trying to send to the American public , and if this is the level of complete and utter ineptness we can come to expect from you and your campaign , we 're in for a boring election year .
Astrophysicist Yousaf
Butt spent years working on NASA projects like the Chandra X - Ray Observatory while art the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
But he was never convinced by the space agency ’s explanation for why a dying satellite had to be shot out of orbit .
Publicly , NASA and the military insisted that the satellite ’s payload of hydrazine rocket fuel was a significant risk to public health .
Butt was n’t so sure .
So he filed a Freedom of Information Act request , to force the space agency to disclose the documents related to its shootdown rationale .
The other day , Butt got back a key study , examining whether that hydrazine tank might survive reentry into Earth ’s atmosphere .
The primary question :
How will heat ( either from the Sun , or from reentry ) transfer into the hydrazine tank ’s titanium coating ?
Two models were considered and analyzed , the paper notes .
But only the more dire case — more likely to lead to the tank ’s survival — gets any play in the study , Butt notes in a new Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists article .
[ And ] even with this oversimplification that biases toward tank survival , the study ’s authors still find that four out of the titanium tank ’s five concentric finite - element nodes would melt off since the reentry temperature exceeds titanium ’s melting point .
Thus , even as modeled , out of an initial 3.56 millimeters tank thickness , only 0.7 millimeters remains , making it highly unlikely that the tank would survive the high g- forces and dynamic pressure of reentry .
Our pal Jeffrey Lewis finds this to be one of several " disconcerting " points in the study .
So is the fact that " the hydrazine tank
[ ultimately ] exploded and burned for tens of seconds unexpectedly .
Such things do not inspire confidence in NASA ’s model . "
Veteran satellite - watcher Peter J. Brown is similarly dubious .
And he notes that health warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the satellite ’s reentry " relied heavily on DoD [ Department of Defense ] projections . "
Still , officials did n’t argued at the time of the shootdown that the hydrazine risk was high .
They insisted ( and continue to insist ) that the chance of fatalities was just large enough ( more than 1 in 10,000 ) that the space and defense agencies were duty - bound to act .
Is that central assertion true ?
This new paper , unearthed by Butt , does n’t definitevly answer that , as far as I can tell .
So the debate goes on .
Richard Reynolds hates to see weed - filled , disused spots of land – whether they ’re traffic medians , sidewalk parkways or vacant lots .
Richard , the founder of GuerrillaGardening.org , sees potential in each of those barren , nearly lifeless plots of land : potential for beauty , food , medicine and community pride .
As part of the guerilla gardening movement , Richard and other activists seek to take back those forgotten areas and turn them into lush gardens , regardless of who actually owns them .
Also called “ pirate gardening ” , guerilla gardening is all about improving public spaces and making sure that potential garden spaces do n’t go to waste .
Though it ’s technically illegal – akin to squatting in an abandoned building – most of the time , guerilla gardeners do n’t meet much resistance from landowners .
It ’s easy to see why .
Unless the property owner has an immediate plan for the site , they often do n’t mind seeing it beautified , so long as the gardeners are n’t profiting from it .
And guerilla gardening is n’t about profit .
Most food that is planted gets eaten by the people who tend the gardens , and given freely to the community .
All the same , guerrilla gardeners often work early in the morning or late at night , dodging the authorities whenever possible , who occasionally stop by to ask questions .
Many guerrilla gardeners have been threatened with arrest , though there do n’t seem to be many cases of that actually happening .
In Britain , digging up land you do n’t own is classified as ˜criminal damage ” , so guerrilla gardeners there have to be a bit more careful .
There are the occasional landowners who do n’t take kindly to the planting , and serve cease - and - desist letters or simply rototill the entire plot .
In public spaces , the law is n’t clearly defined – most cities and parks and recreation officials are n’t sure whether they would have recourse against citizens who planted gardens on public land .
Often , they leave well enough alone – guerrilla gardeners save them money by tending spaces their staff does n’t have time for .
The biggest problem guerrilla gardeners face is irrigation .
For many gardeners , finding a source of fresh water on the property is first priority ; water use usually only amounts to $ 1 or $ 2 over the course of a month , so landowners often do n’t notice it on their bill .
Others bring watering cans or try to set up the gardens so they catch rainfall more efficiently .
Drought - tolerant native or succulent gardens are also common .
Guerrilla gardening is n’t always about well - tended gardens full of food , herbs and medicinal plants .
Some forms of it , like seed bombing , are used to surreptitiously improve areas that guerrilla gardeners can’t get to places like vacant lots secured with locked chain - link fences , or steep banks .
Seed bombs are little balls made up of clay , compost and seeds that are thrown onto disused areas .
They break apart over time , and eventually , flowers and foliage sprout where before was nothing but dirt and weeds .
In Cuba , guerrilla gardening has grown into a countrywide tradition .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 , the country experienced an economic crisis that led to food shortages .
As a result , Cubans began growing food wherever they could , and what developed was a culture of organic urban agriculture .
Today , up to 70 % of Cuba ’s fresh produce is grown in these urban gardens .
As the world ’s urban centers become even more densely developed and populated , and land for urban farming grows ever more scarce , guerrilla gardening continues to rise in popularity .
The website GuerrillaGardening.org provides information on getting started and a means to connect with the guerrilla gardening community and join in on ˜troop digs ”
A cold wind is blowing across the landscape of privacy .
The twin imperatives of technological advancement and coun­terterrorism have led to dramatic and possibly irreversible changes in what people can expect to remain of private life .
Nearly 10 years ago Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems famously pronounced the death of privacy .
“ Get over it , ” he said .
Some people , primarily those younger than about 25 , claim to have done just that , embracing its antithesis , total public disclosure .
And of course in many cases — determining the whereabouts of a terrorist or the carrier of a disease — public interest has an overwhelming claim on information that is usually private .
Late last night Deadspin received an email with the subject " Former USC Song Girl Sarah Carmona " which , even though harmless enough , can only mean something salacious would be attached .
True to form , the accompanying emailer described the pictures yanked from Ms. Carmona 's Facebook page which include her " about so suck on a penis beer bong " and in numerous drunken make - out sessions with various other cheerleader - type women during a USC Song Girl Reunion weekend held at La Jolla over July 4th .
The pictures were sent to us and Busted Coverage who plopped said penis bong photo( NSFW , kind of ) right on its front page early this morning .

Granted , Carmona is a " former " Song Girl so she 's not going to lose her pom-poms over these photos as many cheerleader / dance girl types seem to do after similarly provocative drunk photos get pushed out there .
But it 's an alarming trend .
Asylum magazine did a bang - up photo montage of this phenomenon already .

2008 : Kings ' Dancers get torched by Fox News :
Thanks to photos of various members of the Sacramento Kings dance team throwing back champagne , showing off their g- strings , and , well , pretending they have giant candy cane shlongs , Fox News picked up the story and moral outrage rippled through the Kings ' camp for a few days .
Naturally , Ufford gets blamed .
Of course there are plenty of others that have made the rounds , but not been given the national mainstream exposure or created national controversies like the unlucky Blue Bomber gals .
It 's gotten to the point where most of these cheerleaders seemingly do n't even care about this stuff getting out there .
Hell , sometimes it results in a movie deal .
The lines between public and private photos have severely been blurred , obviously , but you have to wonder if most of the cheerleaders are just dim - witted morons who are still confused as to how to keep photos of themselves in their underwear from public viewing or this is actually the desired effect .
Right now , I 'm convinced it 's the latter .
The roar of the bear is shaking the London stock market once again .
The FTSE 100 Index of leading shares fell as low as 5,358 yesterday morning , taking the total loss since last June 's peak of 6,732 to a shade over 20 per cent – the technical definition of a bear market .
Although the blue - chip index recovered later in the day , City analysts believe the respite is almost certain to be temporary , with no prospect of interest rate cuts to boost the economy while domestic inflation fears remain and global commodity prices continue to soar .
The bear has not been sighted in Britain since 2002 , although the US moved into bear market territory some weeks ago .
Our jury of economists , fund managers and stockbrokers is almost unananimous : he 's back and he 's only just beginning to sharpen his claws .

The situation is liable to get worse for the broad economy in 2008 .
The full - year estimates of GDP growth imply a significant slowdown in the second half of the year .
The declines will be driven by a slowdown of spending in the consumer sector , which makes up 70 per cent of GDP in the UK .
Food and fuel costs and mortgage payments are rising while house prises are falling .
This will probably lead to people increasingly looking to save and trying to de-lever their housing debt .
Discretionary spending stocks have suffered , while traditionally defensive ones are up .
It is nice to see the market working as it should .
On the plus side , we think inflation fears are overdone , as there has not been much of a rise where it matters – wages .
Wage growth is slowing , which should help , and means the Bank of England might not lift interest rates .
Jean - Michel Six , Chief economist , Standard and Poor's
It is challenging to detect bright spots in the current market .
We are in the eye of the storm and the summer will only be tougher .
There was hope that the Bear Stearns rescue would signal that the worst of the credit crunch was behind us , but we are only beginning to see it move into the real economy .
The second half of the year will probably be much gloomier than the first .
It looks as if consumers are being overwhelmed by falling markets , rising costs and stagnating incomes .
This will last at least until the start of 2009 as the risk of a consumer - led recession remains very much present in the UK , driven by the housing market downturn .
One light at the end of the tunnel – although it is very long tunnel – is the possibility that oil prices might ease in the fourth quarter , especially if the dollar strengthens .
While there are structural reasons that it is so expensive , cyclical factors could see it drop $ 20 a barrel .
Philip Shaw , Chief economist , Investec
There are likely to be further falls before the end of the year .
The market is taking far too bullish a view on domestic cyclical stocks like general and food retailers , and the leisure sector – basically , all those dependent on consumer spending .
Resource stocks are also looking well overvalued .
Whether we are in a technical bear market or not , the falls we have seen this year are still worryingly large .
The UK economy is pretty close to recession , and there is a 50:50 chance of it hitting a technical recession by the end of the year .
So far , the market has n't been factoring in that possibility , but if it does happen there will be further falls to come .
Ian Stewart , Director , Deloitte
What is clearly happening is that problems in the banking sector are being increasingly transmitted to companies because the supply of credit is tighter and interest rates are higher .
Banks are searching for liquidity and looking to offload their debts .
That has translated into a hit on the corporate sector , especially the consumer - facing groups .
The wider economy is slowing , while inflation is rising and the potential for higher interest rates is real .
The brief rally in May has now played out .
Historically , asset bubbles take a long time to deflate , they do n't actually burst overnight .
Judging by that , the signs are n't great .

Fundamentally , I am quite negative on the economy and the direction of the stock market .
Although there will be some bounces along the way , there wo n't be the return of a bull market any time soon .
The key is to enter back into the market when sentiment becomes depressed ; it appears there could be some lift in the near future .
I can see a near - term bounce as company directors have increased share - buying .
It is quite a good indicator .
As the fears of rising inflation have grown , the market became more complacent about the downside risks of growth .
Now investors are starting to address those risks .
Still , this is not a good situation .
Growth is slowing , inflation is rising and profit expectations are falling , which will have an adverse effect on the stock markets .
However , the real global risks are coming next year .
Analysts ' estimates for 2009 appear too high , because Asia and the emerging markets will begin to slow more rapidly , having a knock - on effect in Europe .
Roger Bootle , Chief economist , Capital Economics
I suspect the market will remain rather weak and will get worse towards the end of the year .
The market has n't yet factored in the seriousness of the situation it faces , with weakness in the retailers , banks and housebuilders .
It will remain subdued for a year or two .
Next year will be the worst , but there should be the start of a slow recovery by 2010 .
Howard Archer , Chief economist , Global Insight
We are cutting our growth forecasts further , and we now have the British economy on a " stagnant " rating .
Consumer spending is slowing .
In the first quarter of the year the numbers were resilient and then there was a rise in May , which was a surprise .
There is likely to be a correction in June , as consumers reign in their spending this year .
It also looks as if many companies are cutting back on their investment plans .
This is not surprising as credit conditions tighten and the outlook weakens .
There were hopes that the weakening pound might help make exports more competitive but , at the same time , demand from the key markets in the US and the eurozone is falling .
It is hard to see where growth is going to come from .
Times staff writer Edward Silver posts this detailed look at Sen. Barack Obama 's proposals on energy -- and which companies could benefit most from the candidate 's blueprint if he wins the White House .
For Barack Obama , climate change is change we can believe in .
Speakers at the Democrats ’ convention this week , by and large , have taken as dim a view of fossil fuels as the Iraq war .
If you were quaffing your brew at each mention of " alternative energy " from the podium , you ’d have a lot of recycling to do by now .
The green theme climaxes tonight , with environmental hero Al Gore setting the stage for the candidate ’s address .
Since he launched his campaign , Obama has offered remarkably detailed proposals and demonstrated fluency in the language of energy and carbon .
He promises a broad agenda aimed at growing sustainable industries quickly .
That means jobs , profits and a balm for the planet , but it ’s a riddle when , or if , that growth would offset the financial costs of change .
If he takes the helm , Obama ’s blueprint may be welcomed by an admiring Congress .
Then comes the hard part : implementing it .
Like rival John McCain , Obama proposes a market in permits to emit greenhouse gases , commonly termed " cap and trade . "
His approach is stricter , however , and his final goal -- an 80 % reduction from 1990 levels by 2050 -- more ambitious .
Even though emissions limits are defined by the government , cap and trade is widely seen as a fair , market - driven way to , in Obama ’s words , make " dirty energy expensive . "
Coal generates half the country ’s electricity , but with carbon costs imposed , new plants wo n't be built .
Under Obama , investors may shun coal producers that only sell domestically while favoring those that feed booming demand overseas , such as Peabody Energy Corp .
Meanwhile , firms that crack the engineering challenge of burying coal emissions underground would get more than a few contracts .
Assuming that a Congress renews key tax incentives , utilities would hurry to add renewables to their mix , playing into the hands of wind energy specialists such as Vestas and solar companies like Energy Conversion Devices Inc. , Sunpower Corp. and private BrightSource Energy .
Obama is not a friend of nuclear power but urges the industry to solve its chronic waste storage and other problems .
With coal in the doghouse , though , the pressure to go nuclear would build .
That ’s where natural gas comes in .
In his energy factsheet , Obama makes special mention of the cleaner - burning fossil fuel , the No. 2 source of U.S. electricity .
He promotes drilling in the Barnett shale in Texas , among other places .
After all , the Illinois senator does n’t see renewables contributing more than 10 % of our power supply by 2012 , and even that may be a reach .
If natgas is a fossil fuel even Democrats can love , politics may favor such players as Chesapeake Energy Corp. , Devon Energy Corp. and T. Boone Pickens ’ Clean Energy Fuels Corp. . . .
Almost everything about the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative ( CNCI ) , established by National Security Presidential Directive 54 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 , is classified .
But following a classified March 2008 hearing on the subject , Senators Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee teased out a few unclassified details about the effort .
“ The response ( pdf ) includes information on the National Cyber Security Center , how privacy will be protected under the CNCI , how success of the initiative will be measured , and how the Department views the private sector ’s role in the initiative , ” the Senators noted in a news release .
“ The Department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the National Cyber Security Division ( NCSD ) .
The senators have asked DHS explain their reasons for the redactions . ”

Woodward 's ' secret history ' of Bush admin. to debut Sept. 8 Associated Press

NEW YORK -
The suspense did n't quite compare to the identity of " Deep Throat , " but we now know the name of Bob Woodward 's fourth investigative work on the Bush administration , just three weeks before the book 's release .
" The War Within : A Secret White House History 2006 - 2008 " will be published Sept. 8 by Simon & Schuster with an announced first printing of 900,000 copies .
Simon & Schuster is keeping the book under strict embargo  although such embargoes are often broken  and had even held back the title .
" There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers , " Woodward 's longtime editor , Alice Mayhew , said Tuesday in a statement .
" This is the declassification of what went on in secret , behind the scenes . "
According to Simon & Schuster , Woodward 's book " takes readers deep inside the White House , the Pentagon , the State Department , the intelligence agencies and the U.S. military headquarters in Iraq .
" Based on extensive interviews with participants , contemporaneous notes and secret documents , the book traces the internal debates , tensions and critical turning points in the Iraq War during an extraordinary two - year period . "
The Washington Post , where Woodward currently serves as an associate editor , will run excerpts on Sept. 7 . That night , Woodward will be interviewed on CBS television 's " 60 Minutes . "
Woodward 's three previous works on the Bush years have been No. 1 best sellers on The New York Times hardcover nonfiction list and their tone , like the president 's approval ratings , has evolved from the essentially positive take of the first book , " Bush at War , " to the far more critical " State of Denial , " which came out in 2006 .
Woodward 's literary representative , Washington attorney Robert Barnett , declined comment when asked whether President Bush , who spoke with Woodward for the first two volumes , had been interviewed for the current book .
According to Barnett , Woodward only finished " The War Within " three weeks ago .
Woodward is also known for his Pulitzer Prize - winning reporting with fellow Washington Post writer Carl Bernstein .
In the 1970s , they collaborated on the groundbreaking stories of the Watergate scandal that helped bring down President Nixon and on two best sellers about the Nixon administration , " All the President 's Men " and " The Final Days . "

While cable news dutifully devotes nonstop coverage to the latest random criminal cases --- kidnappings , shootouts , murderous love triangles , car chases --- it 's telling when a supposed break in one of the biggest manhunts in FBI history , for a terrorist who murdered and poisoned multiple American citizens with anthrax , takes a back seat to nearly every other story .
That is , if it 's mentioned at all .
Even as details , leaks , and a burgeoning list of questions bubbled to the surface last week , demanding serious scrutiny , the big three broadcast networks were equally blasé .
Some nights skipping mention of the unfolding story altogether , as did last Tuesday 's editions of CBS Evening News and ABC World News ( though both that evening reported the eminently newsworthy story of a thrill - seeking English couple who married while being strapped outside separate airplanes ) .
On the same night , Brian Williams afforded 39 precious seconds to the anthrax investigation on NBC Nightly News .
In covering one of the most historic criminal investigations in our nation 's history , the worst bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil , the overall tenor and quality of network reporting ( as well as much of the work in mainstream print media ) has been nothing short of disgraceful .
What America saw , instead , was a dearth of circumspection and a paucity of competent investigative work that mirrors the most feckless moments of the last eight years ...
This coverage , delivered in an Orwellian bubble world where our brazenly criminal administration still earns the benefit of the doubt , is all the more indefensible when you factor in the reality this is a Bush administration investigation , one which had already dragged on for almost seven years , during which time the government was forced to cough up nearly $ 6 million to settle with a previously wrongly accused man whose reputation and personal life it had destroyed .
As the story unraveled , coverage almost invariably not only failed to address questions that would be obvious to fictional adolescent sleuths Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys but also showcased a breathless zeal to help the Department of Justice prosecute Ivins through unfiltered and uncorroborated leaks --- from accusations of " therapist " Jean Duley ( Ivins was a homicidal killer who threatened her life and planned to kill all of his colleagues in a final " blaze of glory " ) , a woman known to have a fairly lengthy police record ( news that failed to reach national mainstream outlets until the day the FBI / DOJ publicly aired their case , before disappearing again ; plus , to my knowledge , Duley 's police record has yet to receive network airtime ) , whose depth of experience appeared at least suspect ( she was still attending Hood College as of last year and , while various media reports called her a " psychiatrist , " " psychologist , " or " social worker , " it turns out Duley is actually an " addictions counselor " ) whose affidavit , including the misspelling " theripist " and manic , haphazard penmanship , appears as if it were written by either a second grader or an unstable adult ( investigative journalist Larisa Alexandrovna has more on Duley ) ; to a leak last Monday courtesy of the Associated Press --- quickly largely debunked by an update of the same article and then further dispelled by a New York Times piece Tuesday --- which claimed , around the time of the anthrax attacks , Ivins had been visiting and harassing members of a Princeton University sorority located near one of the mailboxes used to send the envelopes ; to another leak portraying him as both a porn - obsessed sicko because he received adult videos to a P.O. box and a raging alcoholic who , nonetheless , managed to retain his security clearance to work with some of the most lethal substances on the planet .
While ABC World News ignored the case on Tuesday 's August 5 broadcast , its previous night 's coverage proved no report might be preferable to a poor one .
A segment called " A Closer Look " ( video of this segment online included the headline " Closing the Anthrax Case " ) focused on the break in the anthrax investigation .
It 's a piece of journalism that might be described as anti-investigative work .
As the online headline suggested --- with exception to a one - sentence quote from New Jersey Representative Rush Holt ( " After seven years of blind alleys and false accusations , we have to ask , well , has the FBI once again let their zeal replace evidence " ) --- this " closer look " was nothing more than a stenographic replay of the FBI 's storyline , including those damning quotes from Ms. Duley , a present wrapped in a bow to the FBI , the Department of Justice and the Bush administration .
But a grave disservice to journalism , victims of the anthrax attacks , the American people , and , quite possibly , the Ivins family .
There was nothing remotely closer about this look .
Then there 's those 39 seconds NBC Nightly News dedicated to the Ivins case the following evening .
Another example of a report imparting more heat than light , complete with an exclusive leak to NBC News from the Justice Department , seamlessly delivered by Brian Williams :
BRIAN WILLIAMS : Federal officials are telling our justice correspondent , Pete Williams , they will reveal a possible motive tomorrow as to why they believe Dr. Bruce Ivins , the former Ft. Detrick bioweapons expert , sent the anthrax letters , including the one here to NBC .
They say he felt badly stung by the criticism that the anthrax vaccine he helped develop for the armed forces back in the first Gulf War could 've contributed to what 's now know as Gulf War Syndrome .
He may have sent the deadly letters , they believe , to generate renewed interest in anthrax as a threat which would cause demand for an approved vaccine , one that he later , by the way , worked on .
Neither Brian Williams nor his justice correspondent posed any questions regarding this fresh allegation .
Failing to demand evidence supporting this new leak or to question its legitimacy before passing it on to millions of viewers and the rest of the media , the dynamic Williams duo acted not as responsible journalists who either considered or cared that government officials might be using them --- something any competent and ethical journalist must be on guard against in such situations --- but as willing mouthpieces , blithely abdicating their role as members of the Fourth Estate , no more circumspect than White House spokespeople .
Even New York Times journalist Scott Shane , one of the more reliable reporters covering this case , had an odd appearance when he visited PBS ' NewsHour on Monday 's August 4 broadcast .
·( Yet it was arguably as much or more the fault of NewsHour senior correspondent Margaret Warner . )
Earlier in the day , Shane published a Times article with the headline " Anthrax Evidence Is Said to Be Circumstantial " ( later edited online to " Anthrax Evidence Called Mostly Circumstantial " ) , in which he reported in the opening paragraph " a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on Sunday " that " evidence amassed by F.B.I. investigators against Dr. Bruce E. Ivins .... was largely circumstantial . "
But somehow in a lengthy discussion with Shane , neither he nor Warner raised this highly relevant point , each with ample opportunity to do so .
While possible , it seems unlikely on the same day Shane writes a major article around this finding --- the case being brought against Ivins will be predominantly circumstantial --- that it would later , on the very same day , completely slip his mind .
What 's more , as regular newscast segments go , Warner conducted a pretty extensive interview .
So even if , for the sake of argument , Warner failed to do her homework prior to the interview and missed Shane 's article ( more believable ) , one would still expect Shane to point out the case 's top - heavy circumstantial nature , if not immediately , then at some time during the discussion .
Did NewsHour censor Shane ?
Did they agree beforehand not to mention that , by Sunday August 3 , the case against Ivins was already believed --- by a very credible source close to the investigation --- to be built upon " largely " or " mostly " circumstantial evidence ?
It 's certainly a curious omission , one that , intentionally or not , helped to buy the government more time to leak negative information about Ivins before playing its hand on Wednesday .
As it turned out , when the Justice Department held its big press conference two days later , it confirmed Shane 's Monday scoop had been correct .
If anything , the report 's characterization of the evidence seeming " mostly " or " largely " circumstantial turned out to be generous .
The case against Ivins appears , thus far , completely circumstantial : they could n't tie him directly to the anthrax envelopes , prove he made the trip to Princeton around the time the envelopes were mailed , detect the type of anthrax mailed on his body or in his home or car , present any eyewitness accounts putting Ivins in his lab on those nights in late September and early October , or confirm many other colleagues had n't used the same flask that federal prosecutors call " effectively the murder weapon . "
Following this far from airtight presentation , journalism professor and author Ted Gup wrote in the Washington Post :
Such evidence , even when seemingly overwhelming and conclusive , is the very sort of circumstantial argument that pegged Richard Jewell as the Atlanta bomber , that linked Oregon attorney Brandon Mayfield to the Madrid bombings , that fingered Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee as a spy , and that cast biodefense expert Steven Hatfill as the original anthrax suspect .
In each of those investigations , the news media were largely complicit , conveying incriminating details of the government 's case as if they were the gospel .
And yet , in each of those cases , the government was wrong --- shaking public confidence even as it eroded individual civil liberties , produced groundless prosecutions and diverted precious time and resources in pursuit of bogus cases .
[...]
In June , the government agreed to a settlement with Hatfill valued at $ 5.8 million .
Neither it nor the press , which was only too eager to link arms with the Justice Department in carrying the stories that stripped Hatfill of everything he had , has offered an apology or conceded wrongdoing .
Against this background , who could be blamed for imagining that an innocent Ivins was hounded to his death ?
Can we discount the accounts that suggest the government repeatedly harassed Ivins 's family , offering his son a reward and sports car if he would turn his father in ?
Gup went on to say :
To their credit , in reporting the Ivins 's case , the media now appear somewhat chastened and more inquisitive than inquisitorial .
It may well be that , absent a trial , it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against Ivins .
Perhaps they can restore a measure of credibility to their profession and to the government .
Hopefully he was not holding his breath .
If you turned on CNN and MSNBC the day after Wednesday 's FBI / DOJ presentation , you would 've found no mention of the Ivins case .
Paris Hilton 's scantily clad political spoof ?
Yes .
A child kidnapping ring ?
You bet .
Bret Favre 's trade to the NY Jets ?
Touchdown .
Questions about a case involving the worst bioterrorism attack in U.S. history ?
Nothing .
On the same Thursday afternoon , a look at their websites found the Ivins case only made MSNBC's " Other Top Stories , " coming in fourth behind --- you guessed it --- Bret Favre 's trade to the NY Jets .
Of CNN 's 18 top stories , the Ivins case was absent --- of course , Favre 's trade is there , as is " Did Caylee 's mom pose as mystery sitter ? " ;
" Owners cuddle , dress pets ... then fry them " ; " Paris did ad in 4 takes --- from memory ! " ; " McCain , Obama agree on ' Dark Knight ' " ; and " Lawyer : Morgan Freeman , wife divorcing . "
And while ABC , CBS and NBC national nightly newscasts covered the DOJ 's case against Ivins on Wednesday , they hardly appeared " chastened " or felt compelled to " restore a measure of credibility to their profession . "
In the CBS Evening News report , introduced with a graphic of a Justice Department file opened to an illustrated report titled " Anthrax Case CLOSED , " anchor Katie Couric and justice correspondent Bob Orr repeated the pattern of laying out the government 's case with little or no questioning of the quality of evidence provided .
Orr framed his segment , saying , " Newly released FBI evidence makes a strong circumstantial case that bioweapons researcher Ivins was a delusional sociopath who had the opportunity , motive and means to be the 2001 anthrax killer . "
Interspersed with U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor 's comments from the press conference , Orr 's performance is closer to a co-prosecutor on the DOJ 's behalf than as a journalist assessing the strengths or weaknesses of the evidence , including the flask on which the alleged matching anthrax spores were found :
" The most damning evidence , " asserted Orr , " a flask of anthrax spores recovered in 2004 from Ivins ' personal workspace at Ft. Detrick , the Army weapons lab where he worked . "
Yet he failed to mention the gaping hole in this " most damning evidence " : it was already known by then that many of Ivins ' colleagues also had access to the same flask .
Moreover , on the day of the FBI / DOJ 's press conference , Paul Kemp , Ivins ' attorney , told the media that the number of people with access to it was far greater than previously reported --- not 10 or 20 or 30 people but hundreds .
The government soon admitted , by its own count , that more than 100 people could 've used the flask .
Orr similarly treated other weak strands of the DOJ 's circumstantial evidence , including the alleged " striking " likeness between the threatening letter sent with the anthrax envelopes and the email Ivins wrote to a friend .
Orr called Ivins ' email " chilling . "
But Ivins ' words are n't chilling .
Nearly everyone in the Bush administration and in the GOP - led Congress , as well as many in the media , often made similar post - 9/11 comments .
Rather , it 's what Ivins believed Osama Bin Laden might do ( " ... Bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas ... " based on what Bin Laden had said ( " ...he [ Bin Laden ] just decreed death to all Jews and all Americans " ) that might instill fear .
Without further proof , it 's a specious piece of semantic contortion and misappropriation that crumbles under scrutiny .
Moreover ,
Orr omitted the obvious :
Where 's the handwriting analysis ?
And if one was performed , why are n't the results being presented to us ?
After Orr 's de facto co-prosecution , he ended his report with what should 've been his lede :
ORR : While the FBI believes it's now solved the case , the evidence does not directly connect Ivins to the anthrax letters and does not directly tie him to the New Jersey postbox where they were sent out .
But with the suspect now dead , the government will never have to prove that case in court .
Which is exactly why Ted Gup noted in his WaPo op - ed , " It may well be that , absent a trial , it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against Ivins . "
Imagine how Professor Gup would grade Orr , Couric and CBS for this report .
NBC Nightly News justice correspondent Pete Williams ' framed his report somewhat more responsibly , noting upfront , " But this is a circumstantial case with no absolute proof that he did it . "
Yet he prefaced this comment with an FBI assertion that , according to the evidence presented , is false on its face : " Amy , the FBI says it can trace the anthrax used in the attacks directly to Dr. Ivins and it says he repeatedly tried to mislead investigators . "
Whether or not he misled investigators ( unproven as well in the evidence proffered ) , again , the flask sitting in Ivins ' workspace in a shared lab three years later , to which so many colleagues had access --- including former employees , like Philip Zack , who were no longer employed at Ft. Detrick when they frequented the lab and worked on unsanctioned , unknown projects --- does not " directly " link Ivins to the anthrax used in the attacks .
Like CBS '
Orr , Justice Correspondent Williams then proceeded to state the other main points of the Justice Department 's case without question .
Inclusion of a statement from Ivins ' lawyer was the only substantive difference in this report : " Tonight , a lawyer for Dr. Ivins says the FBI never found anthrax in his house or in his car or anything else directly linking him to the mailings . "
But Pete Williams , presumably an expert in covering federal criminal cases , offered no educated assessments of his own on the government 's evidence .
As with Orr , Williams did little more than parrot the FBI / DOJ presentation , in a segment edited in such a way that only added coherence and credibility to the government 's case .
Similar to Orr as well ( and Couric 's " Anthrax Case CLOSED " opening graphic ) he also punctuated his report with an air of futility and premature closure : " And without a trial , we 'll never hear what Dr. Ivins would 've said in his own defense . "
Essentially identical to Orr's and Williams ' reports was justice correspondent Pierre Thomas ' segment on the FBI / DOJ 's presentation for ABC World News , another reiteration of the evidence edited in a such a way as to lend more heft and seamlessness to the government 's case while omitting obvious disconnects and holes .
To its credit , however ( if we were grading on effort and not execution ) , World News then followed this segment with another titled " Anthrax Investigation Debunked , " in which Gibson spoke with legal correspondent Jan Crawford - Greenberg :
CHARLES GIBSON : Well , with Ivins ' death , this case will actually never go into a court of law .
But would all that evidence have stood up in court ?
Our legal correspondent , Jan Crawford Greenburg , is joining us from Washington .
And Jan , I know you 've seen the evidence .
I want to read you part of a statement that came from lawyers today .
They said what the FBI presented with that evidence was all heaps of innuendo , contorted to create the illusion of guilt .
How conclusive was it ?
JAN CRAWFORD - GREENBERG :
Well , Charlie , certainly , there was enough evidence to get an indictment from a grand jury , as Pierre just reported .
You know , we saw that he had control over that [ sic ] anthrax spores , had been linked to a flask in his lab through all of that scientific - that new scientific testing .
That we saw his behavior growing increasingly erratic .
And of course , he even tried to mislead investigators to say another researcher had control over that anthrax .
But this was not an open or shut case by any means .
Defense lawyers would have had a lot work with .
For example , there was no DNA , actual DNA , linking Ivins to the anthrax on those letters , his own DNA on those letters .
You know and then even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask , the anthrax spores that were in that flask , Charlie , a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it .
Yet , once again , there 's no direct evidence Ivins " had control " over those specific anthrax spores or that he solely " had been linked " to that flask in his lab .
Quite the opposite .
In fact , Crawford - Greenberg went on to contradict the strength of this evidence and her own act of inflating its worth by subsequently noting " even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask , the anthrax spores that were in that flask , Charlie , a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it . "
Gibson then posed a question that can't be asked too much , but his legal correspondent 's response could 've come straight from the FBI or DOJ :
CHARLES GIBSON : So it might have been a dicey case for the FBI and for prosecutors in court .
But whether or not he could have been convicted , this was obviously a rather quirky fellow .
What was he doing dealing with deadly toxins ?
JAN CRAWFORD - GREENBERG :
Well , Charlie , this was someone who had worked in this lab nearly 30 years .
He was highly respected , highly regarded by his colleagues .
It was only in the later years that his behavior became more erratic .
Now we saw some congressmen today calling for more screenings of scientists who handle these dangerous drugs , but there 's no indication that that would have picked up any of his erratic behavior at all .
With so much of the government 's circumstantial evidence resting on Ivins ' alleged ever - deteriorating mental state , purportedly going back at least as far as July 2000 and maybe even to his undergraduate college days , it 's hard to believe his colleagues and supervisors ( not to mention to his friends and family ) would 've remained so oblivious or unconcerned about such a chronic basket case , specifically one whose job entails handling substances that could potentially unlock a genocidal Pandora 's Box .
Moreover , according to the case against him , " his behavior became more erratic " seven years before they revoked his security clearance .
Maybe World News deserves some credit for actually attempting to give this evidence " a closer look " this time .
Or maybe it intended to only appear as if it were doing so .
Regardless , Crawford - Greenberg 's responses did more to muddle the government 's evidence against Ivins than it did to present viewers with a clear and candid legal assessment .
Compare Gibson and Crawford - Greenberg 's discussion to MSNBC's Countdown segment aired on the same night , in which investigative journalist Gerald Posner , speaking with host Keith Olbermann , exposed many aspects of the government 's case without mincing words or glossing over its discrepancies and disconnects .
OLBERMANN :
The flask of anthrax with identical spores , ostensibly , their strongest piece of evidence .
What do you make of this ?
POSNER : That 's what they make it sound like , but it 's not .
Let me tell you , the late public hears this , they think that 's the evidence .
Those are the spores that got people sick , sent out from the envelopes , not true .
That was liquid anthrax in that flask .
Even if the FBI can tie it to that flask , they can't explain how it was then made into this extremely sophisticated type of weapon with small milligramage with electric charges to it , with polyglass on top of the coating , all to go deep inside the lungs , to spray into the air .
This was weaponized , military anthrax .
They cannot explain how it went from that glass flask in a liquid form into the form that was sent out in the envelopes .
That they do n't have the evidence on .
OLBERMANN : What , if anything they presented today , is the strongest evidence ?
What do they got going for them ?
POSNER : Well , they threw out this machine , what they called the lyopholizer , they say that can make wet anthrax into dry anthrax , but I talked to six different microbiologists today and people involved formerly in weapons programs in the United States and in Russia , who say that the machine that the FBI talks about can't do that .
[ What a novel journalistic technique --- speaking with other experts to confirm the credibility of the government 's case . ]
The strongest evidence they have going for them is also their Achilles ' heel and that 's his psychological profile .
That fact that he 's very unstable , that he was someone who was an alcoholic , that he might wanted to have the vaccine continue to go along , but that 's also the fact that he could have been set up as a cutout , a patsy , or used by a group of people who wanted the anthrax out there .
They also knew about his weak psychological profile .
How was he employed with the most secret biological warfare lab in the United States with this type of background that we now hear about that they should have known about from day one ?
The Defense Department should hang its head in shame .
OLBERMANN : Right .
Thirty - five years of murderous intent and nobody knew about it , and they let him in to the germ warfare lab .
As to motive , they mentioned it but almost as if it were in passing .
Is that a weak part of the case ?
Do they offer anything that made any sense ?
POSNER : Boy , I 'll tell you , I thought it was a weak part of the case .
I listened to the press conference today and then sort of at the end as though they thought they had to throw something out , they said , “ Oh , by the way , let 's give you the reasons to why we think he sent out and went on this homicidal rage . ”
And the motive they said was , “ Well , he helped develop a vaccine for anthrax , he probably wanted to continue to see that developed so that by killing people , by having come up with some unknown way of this high military grade anthrax .
We would keep the vaccine program going . ”
That was pretty weak , and , you know , I thought they just literally were fishing .
They do n't have a good motive , unfortunately , for them and their prosecution .
But as you said in the lead into this , they do n't need to because the primary suspect , the only suspect , is dead .
They 're going to close this case .
OLBERMANN : But the declaration that he is the only , it 's not just a question of proving a dead man did this or was part of this , but the insistence is he did by himself , the lone , mad scientist thing .
Did they get anywhere near confirming that ?
POSNER : No .
As a matter of fact , Keith , that 's my major problem with this .
You know , if you look at it and you say , “ He ‘s involved , he ‘s got a role in it , he ‘s done something . ”
That , the evidence , I 'm waiting to see that and they may nail that down .
But I spoke to enough experts in the last few days who have convinced me , who know how this process works , that these spores that were sent out , were not the work of one lone scientist and that , I believe , is the case .
Nevertheless , this story disappeared from network news studios by the following morning .
No mention on TV Thursday on CNN or MSNBC , nor on NBC , CBS or ABC 's national nightly newscasts .
Nor did it warrant any further network coverage Friday , Saturday or Sunday .
Dr. Bruce Ivins is dead .
He may have been the anthrax killer and acted alone .
He may have acted with others .
( Based on the known evidence , both of these two scenarios seem less likely with each passing day . )
He may have just been a convenient fall guy .
( As Gerry Andrews , microbiologist and former longtime colleague of Ivins , wrote in a New York Times editorial yesterday : " After the anthrax attack , Dr. Ivins himself worked directly with the evidence .
The F.B.I. asked Dr. Ivins to help them with the forensics in the case by analyzing the contents of suspicious letters .
And he did so for years , until the authorities began to suspect that the anthrax spores used in the mailings might have originated from his lab .
[ Awfully convenient , no ? ]
Dr. Ivins , for instance , was asked to analyze the anthrax envelope that was sent to Mr. Daschle ’s office on Oct. 9 , 2001 .
When his team analyzed the powder , they found it to be a startlingly refined weapons - grade anthrax spore preparation , the likes of which had never been seen before by personnel at Fort Detrick . " )
The person or persons who murdered and poisoned Americans with those anthrax letters may even have framed him .
The FBI may have also driven Ivins to take his own life after relentlessly hounding him and his family for a crime he never committed .
But the FBI and DOJ wanted this case closed .
Now .
And in one of the most important criminal investigations in our nation 's history , for the deadliest bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil --- which our government , with help from Brian Ross and ABC News ' curiously sourced false reporting , initially used to build support for invading Iraq --- the networks ( Olbermann 's Countdown coverage notwithstanding ) have thus far refused to substantively question this historically corrupt government 's circumstantial case against a dead man who will never have his day in court .
By the way , have you heard that John Edwards cheated on his wife ?

Replying to questions , why the Marshall Plan does n’t work , and local democracy in Jawzareen
by Connor O’Steen
First off I ’d like to thank you all for your thoughtful and encouraging comments on my previous installments .
The first four were published while I was in Bamyan , so I have n’t had a chance to see them or the feedback until now .
I admit that I had some initial worries about publishing on a blog : it ’s an intimidating ideaÂ toÂ publish copy that will subsequently be dragged across the Internet , perhaps to be eviscerated by packs of battle - hardened commentators .
I think it reflects well on Scholars and Rogues that trolling is notably muted , here , and it ’s convinced me that writing these letters is absolutely worthwhile .
Some of you had great questions that I ’m happy to answer .
Â
I hope to make these letters the beginning of a broader conversation , so if you have any questions or comments please do leave them .
As long as I have the time and the access , I ’ll make sure to respond .
In the future I ’ll address questions in the comments sections , but I ’ll catch up by going over the ones I ’ve missed so far .
Djerrid asked :
How effective are these humanitarian efforts ?
I ’ve gathered that ousting the Taliban and scattering Al Qaeda created a much better environment for a year or two ( lots of schools for girls opened up , for example ) but deteriorated when we could n’t sustain our attention ( which begat the opium explosion ) .
Obama makes the point that since we diverted our resources to Iraq , military and otherwise , we could n’t finish what we started in Afghanistan .
What do you think ?
This is a big question and skirts around a larger one that I ’ll write much more about in the conclusion of these installments .
First off , I would certainly agree with Obama that the movement of troops and money into Iraq from Afghanistan deteriorated our ability to enforce law and order on all of Afghanistan .
This in turn led to disparate levels of aid to different parts of the country .
Kandahar gets less development money because you can’t have a sizeable USAID commitment or even a UN one there ; it ’s simply too dangerous .
This , in turn , leads to bitterness and poverty which , in turn , provide a base of support for a Taliban revival .
In this way , having adequate resources and manpower is crucialÂ to humanitarian efforts .
You can build as many girls ’ schools as you want , but if a Talib with an AK - 47 is standing at the door making sure no one goes in , no one will go in .
That being said , many humanitarian efforts fail with good security and lots of money .
From what I ’ve seen , this is the result of a policy that focuses on dropping the money , building the building , and walking away .
USAID has built a number of facilities ( hospitals , schools , orphanages ) across Afghanistan , most costing millions of dollars , and the majority of these are stripped bare after a month or two .
Whether through inertia , bureaucracy , or lack of interest , the larger aid agencies seem stuck in Marshall Plan development systems .
It ’s easy to build a school in post WWII Germany because you have a largely literate population and , in many cases , teachers or former teachers who themselves have had formal educations .
Building a school in Afghanistan and then leaving it be does very little :
There has to beÂ community engagement and a building of capacity .
In Afghanistan , it ’s not enough to make a school :
You have to convince the local population that they need your school , that they can use your school , and ( hardest of all ) that they have the ability to maintain and staff the school .
If they do n’t have this last piece , the building is only as good as what you can get for its various salvaged parts in the bazaar .
I could go on , but I ’ll save it for later .
Good question .
Russ : I ’ll be here for another two months , so plenty of time to bore you all with these dispatches !
On to the letter .
We drove back from Bamyan yesterday afternoon and I ’ve had a fun day doing very little and not being in a car .
The six days in Bamyan felt so extensive , so full of activity and events , that it seems like any letter will automatically fail at providing a full picture .
Even getting started is intimidating .
I ’ll make this one short , and write a few more about specific experiences , later .
[ Editors note : Â Bamyan is the largest city in Hazarajat with a population of around 62,000 .
Â
You may remember it as the location of the Buddhas of Bamyan , the enormous ancient statues dynamited by the Taliban in 2001 .
Hazarajat is the land of the ethnic Hazaras , a persecuted , Shia minority of Mongol descent , and is located in central Afghanistan . ]
Bamyan is a beautiful , contradictory town .
Green fields of potato and wheat terminate abruptly in a labyrinth of mountain ranges that surround the clustered mud - brick houses on every side .
The sights are largely agrarian and pastoral , especially outside the main bazaar , but derelict Russian tanks are displayed proudly among the crops .
There was no trace of the hostility we encountered in Chaghcharan , but the curiosity of passersby also seems subdued .
By this point I ’ve become so accustomed to stares that ’s it ’s strangeÂ to me to go to a place where someone might look away and keep on walking after a single glance .
The atmosphere there is unequivocally wonderful .
It was safe to walk the streets alone — a rare activity that I took advantage of frequently — and the schedule was loose enough that I was able to explore the surrounding area while still completing PARSA ’s requirements for the trip .
When we were n’t in Bamyan , we were in Jawzareen , a high valley ringed about by mountains that ’s about an hour ’s drive away .
The phrase ‘ achingly beautiful ’ is a miserable clichÃ© , but I just ca n’t think of a better description of that place .
In all of the pictures I took , I could n’t get across how gorgeous the villages there are , or how kind the people .
There was something painful about it for me ; I never wanted to leave the clear streams , the fresh air , or the green mountains .
You could go hiking in all directions for days and still have more to see .
At the same time , I knew I could n’t live with the daily grind .
Life in the villages consists of a few activities ( drawing water , herding sheep , cutting crops , sowing crops ) repeated over and over with no possibility of change .
I know that even with the landscape , that kind of routine would break me .
Jawzareen was great in another way , because its villages showed how positive the influence of social ties in small communities can be .
Unlike Nasim ’s village , practically all children are taken care of and treated well .
They definitely work hard at a young age — to a certain extent that kind of labor is necessary to keep afloat in a poor , rural community — but they have access to education , which provides the possibility for a different kind of life in the future .
In addition to their treatment of children , village life in Jawzareen might be the closest thing Afghanistan has to a functioning democracy .
I met with the wahli of Yatimak on Saturday , a kind - hearted man with reasonably good English and a genuine desire to improve his village .
When I proposed providing support to start classes in his village , he thought it over for a minute and said , “ I really must speak with the other villagers before I can give you an answer . ”
This is a far more promising answer than his simply agreeing , because it means he puts power into a consensus rather than a single opinion .
Our role in Jawzareen was to provide support and conduct evaluations for early childhood development and women ’s literacy classes that PARSA started six months ago , along with trying to expand the program into the nearby village of Yatimak .
The classes that we ’ve started are going well and are heavily attended .
Between two women ’s classes , there are 110 people that come regularly .
The three children ’s classes have about 100 kids total .
Â
TheÂ younger ones are slowly plodding through the complicated Arabic alphabet , while the older kids are busy trying to spell words like “ book ” and “ apple . ”
The going is slow sometimes , but the progress is tremendous seeing as how there were no educational opportunities before these classes .
I ’ve already written more than I intended in responding to questions , and I do n’t want to burn you out on long , tedious copy .
I ’ll end this letter here and write a few more about Bamyan in the coming week .

The Fallout 4 Story Hints Hidden In Previous Fallout Games
Though Fallout 4 is the first game to be set in Boston , it 's not the first Fallout game to mention it .
Here are some hints at what might happen in ...
Commodities - the stuff that feeds us , runs our cars , heats our homes and provides the basic materials of everyday life - recently enjoyed one of the great bull runs of modern investment history , nearly doubling in price in the space of a year .
In the past month , though , prices of a wide range of commodities , from oil to corn to copper , have come back down with a vengeance as the global economy cools .
We now know that the commodities boom was another bubble , not that much different from technology stocks in the 1990s and real estate earlier in this decade , market pros say .
" The recent bull run in commodities was based more on investment demand than the fundamentals of the world economy , " said William Berg , president of Sigma Investment Management in Portland , Ore .
But there 's one great difference .
This was a bubble that picked the pockets of ordinary people around the world , be it a suburban mom in the United States paying $ 4.50 a gallon to fill her minivan or a laborer in Pakistan unable to buy rice or bread to feed his family .
Prices in the commodities markets are not just matters for investors .
They quickly find their way into the retail cost of food , fuel and building materials .
The United Nations has calculated that in recent months an additional 50 million people around the world joined the ranks of those whose health suffers because they can't afford food , notes Sophia Murphy , an analyst with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy , a group critical of agribusiness .
The markets " have a very immediate and negative impact , " Murphy said .
" They exacerbate peaks and troughs .
In the long run , they have less of an impact than in the short run .
But in the short run , people die . "
From the summer of 2007 through the beginning of July , the entire gamut of traded commodities , with few exceptions , shot up in price .
Crude oil nearly touched $ 150 per barrel at the beginning of July , up from $ 70 the year before .
Wheat soared 125 percent from August 2007 to March 2008 .
Natural gas , corn , copper and soybeans traced similar courses .
Supply and demand by themselves can't explain price jumps of those magnitudes , market pros say .
They acknowledge that real - world factors are vital and usually are what set trends in motion .
Yet despite talk of peak oil , global food shortages and China 's growing appetite for raw materials , a significant portion , some argue a majority , of recent commodity price increases stemmed from investors searching for profit .
No huge jump in oil use
Take oil , for example .
In recent years , world demand for petroleum has been growing by a few percentage points annually .
But that incremental gain led to oversize movements in the marketplace .
" Did you see a huge increase in use of petroleum products ?
No , " said Philip Gotthelf , president of Equidex , a New Jersey commodities trading firm .
" Did peak oil happen ?
No .
We did n't have a crisis that warranted this $ 150 oil . "
All the same , if the commodity investment markets are behind much of the price run-ups , the story can't be boiled down merely to one of greedy speculators .
The matter is more complicated than that , both technically and morally .
It 's not just super - rich hedge fund traders who play in commodities .
Pension funds , universities , foundations and other conservative , long - term institutional investors have jumped into the market in a big way .
By March 2008 , investors worldwide had sunk more than $ 400 billion into commodities , up $ 70 billion from the beginning of the year and twice as much as in late 2005 , according to the International Food Policy Research Institute , a nonpartisan Washington think tank .
Specialized funds
Changes in the market encouraged the trend .
Traditionally , commodities changed hands in what are called futures markets where participants buy and sell contracts to take delivery of bulk quantities of heating oil or aluminum or pork bellies months or even years in advance .
These contracts , sold in exchanges that are home to the familiar clamoring , wildly gesticulating traders , are highly volatile and risky .
Historically , the main participants in the market were farmers and businesses that produced or consumed commodities and wanted to control the prices at which they bought or sold .
In addition , speculative investors , such as hedge funds , made bets on which way prices would go .
To make commodities palatable to a broader range of investors , brokerage firms created specialized funds in recent years that allowed investors to buy shares in a range of commodities .
That opened the market to nontraditional investors .
For example , the California Public Employees ' Retirement System , the largest public pension fund in the United States , started a pilot program to invest in commodities in 2007 .
It says commodities now make up less than 1 percent of its portfolio .
All that new money pouring into the market put intense upward pressure on prices .
" The impact of those folks coming onto the scene was greater than the effect of speculative investors , " said James Greenleaf , a finance professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pa .
What really jolted the market though was the subprime mortgage crisis that erupted last summer .
It slammed stocks and devastated the vast market for securities backed by home loans .
The trading desks of major banks and hedge funds saw salvation in commodities .
" People in the know saw that paper assets ( stocks and bonds ) would get into serious trouble , " Gotthelf said .
" They figured the only safe haven was tangible assets .
There was a complete panic out of paper and into physical assets .
They moved not for speculation , but for protection . "
As the months wore on , investors threw ever - larger sums into commodities , even as evidence accumulated that the global economy was slowing and demand for fuel , food and metals was slackening .
The inevitable result was the crash of recent weeks , after worldwide economic weakness became too overwhelming to ignore .
" These things always run their course , " said Edward Meir , an analyst with MF Global , a commodities brokerage firm .
" After a while , the trend stops going one way .
This time , it turned around with particular vengeance . "
The shift will bring some relief to consumers , who are already seeing gas prices fall .
Food prices should ease as well .
" I would n't be surprised if this commodity effect lowers ( food ) prices , maybe in the fourth quarter , " said Daniel Sumner , director of the University of California Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis .
Now a political issue
No one knows where commodity prices will settle .
But even the most optimistic forecasts predict that prices will stay above historic levels , suggesting that $ 2.50 per gallon gas and cheap grain are n't in the cards .
But the wild ride of commodities has had one clear result - it 's made the markets a political issue .
Democrats in Congress have called for controls on commodity trading as a way of easing gas prices .
Critics say it 's far from clear that such regulation is workable and could interfere with the important economic role commodities trading plays for farmers , airlines and other traditional market participants .
As for the real speculators , most will live to trade another day .
" They 're all momentum players , " Greenleaf said .
" Those people do not like to stand in front of steamrollers that are running downhill .
They all can turn on a dime . "
Sarah Palin has cancelled her two - day swing through California next week , the McCain campaign said today .
Whether the planned Sept. 25 fundraiser in Silicon Valley , which will raise money for state and federal GOP efforts , will go on without Palin as headliner is unclear .
More than 1,000 people had RSVP ’d forcing organizers to move the event from the garden of Tom and Stacey Siebel ’s Woodside home to the Santa Clara Convention center .
Palin also was to appear at a large Orange County fundraiser and a rally for which more than 15,000 people were expected .
Campaign spokesman Rick Gorka said the Alaskan governor ’s calendar was “ fluid ” and he could not say where Palin would go instead of California , nor if she would reschedule a visit here before Election Day .
McCain and Palin are campaigning today and tomorrow in Iowa , Wisconsin and Minnesota .
Then they will head to Florida , which is shaping up to be a very competitive state .
A Field Poll released earlier this week found that while Palin had helped McCain solidify support among his GOP base in California , the ticket had made no inroads among independent voters , a key bloc the GOP needs to win to be competitive in California .
Among likely voters , the Barack Obama - Joe Biden ticket has a 16 percentage point advantage over the Republicans .
And a national poll out today showed Obama with a 5 - point lead over McCain , a reversal from their standings before the Wall Street economic crisis hit .
Gorka said the decision to send her elsewhere next week was not made because of the polling results .
“ It ’s a scheduling thing , ” he said .
He noted the campaign was thrilled about the enthusiasm her visit had generated in California in terms of fundraising and new volunteers ,
He acknowledged Californians expecting to get their first glimpse of Palin since she was named McCain ’s running mate might be disappointed .
“ Folks always want to see her .
We do n’t want to cause any disappointment .
We want to get her in front of as many Americans as we can . ”

MELBOURNE , Aug 12 ( Reuters ) - Australian engineering services company WorleyParsons Ltd WOR .
AX set out a plan to build a A $ 1 billion solar power plant , the world 's biggest , within three years as it met market forecasts with a 53 percent jump in full - year profit .
Its shares rose 5 percent in a flat broader market as it expected stronger earnings in the year ahead , riding a boom in energy and mining projects .
As Australia looks to cap carbon emissions with targets for renewable energy and the introduction of carbon credits , Worley Parsons said it aimed to deliver 40 percent of Australia ’s renewable energy needs with 34 solar power plants by 2020 .
It has launched a study , backed by major companies such as top miners BHP Billiton Ltd BHP .
AX and Rio Tinto Plc RIO .
AX , to find potential sites for advanced solar thermal power plants in Australia , which it said has some of the highest intensity sunlight anywhere .
“ I would be cautious about saying that this will work without their support .
But with their support I ’m quite confident that we ’re going to see solar power stations in Australia , ” the head of WorleyParsons ’ EcoNomics arm , Peter Meurs , told reporters .
WorleyParsons , which competes against companies such as Foster Wheeler FWLT.O and KBR KBR.N , has benefited from contracts for major mining and oil and gas projects , including work for ExxonMobil XOM .N in Russia .
The firm flagged more acquisitions after buying eight businesses last year for a total of A$ 247 million ( $ 219 million ) , building its expertise in areas including deepwater oil and gas drilling .
“ Our key markets and sectors continue to experience positive conditions and we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities , ” WorleyParsons Chief Executive John Grill said in a statement .
“ Subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009 . ”
Analysts expect the company to report 23 percent profit growth in 2009 .
Net profit rose to A$ 343.9 million in the year to June , from A$ 224.8 million a year ago , in line with an average of A$ 342.6 million forecast by eight brokers .
Its earnings margins increased to 12 percent from 10 percent as it was able to charge higher prices for its services .
Revenue from WorleyParsons ’ hydrocarbons division jumped 40 percent in 2008 and made up more than three - quarters of the group ’s A$ 4.7 billion in sales .
The group took on more debt last year , taking its gearing up to 31 percent from 22 percent in terms of net debt to net debt plus equity .
It said it remains well positioned to manage that debt , with 11.7 times cover for its interest expenses .
SOLAR POWER BOOM
WorleyParsons ’ solar power plan depends on its customers funding the new power plants , which would boost supplies during peak hours .
It expects to complete its study by the end of this year .
It would need commitments from customers by early next year to meet its goal of building the first 250 megawatt solar power plant in Australia , the biggest solar plant in the world , by 2011 .
It would use technology that has worked successfully in California , based on parabolic mirror troughs that capture sunlight and convert it to heat to drive steam turbines , generating electricity .
Total capacity from solar thermal plants in southern California is 354 megawatts , the company said .
The first plants would cost around A$ 1 billion each , and the company is assuming it would cost around 15 cents a kilowatt hour to produce power .
Meurs said as newer technology became available , the plant cost was likely to fall .
Carbon credits would have to be priced at well over A$ 10 a tonne to make the solar power plants commercially viable and at A$ 50 a tonne would make solar power look relatively cheap .
By comparison in Europe , where carbon trading is active , credits have been trading at around 26 euros ( $ 38.74 ) a tonne for December 2008 delivery .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
And then there were none .
Federal regulators converted Wall Street 's remaining stand - alone investment banks - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - into bank holding companies Sunday night .
The move allows Goldman and Morgan to scoop up retail banks and to streamline their borrowing from the Federal Reserve .
The shift also is aimed at removing them as targets of nervous investors and customers , who brought down their former rivals Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch this year .
But it also puts Goldman and Morgan under the Fed 's supervision , increasing the agency 's regulatory oversight and possibly forcing them to raise additional capital .
As banks , Morgan and Goldman will be forced to take less risk , which will mean fewer profits .
And it brings to a close the era of the Wall Street investment bank , a storied institution that traded stocks and bonds , advised mergers and showered lavish bonuses on its executives .
" The separation of investment banking and commercial banking has come to an end , " said Bert Ely , an independent banking consultant .
The conversion is but the latest in a series of unprecedented events on Wall Street as it convulses through the global credit crisis .
In the past eight days , the federal government announced a $ 700 billion plan to rescue the financial sector by buying up troubled mortgage assets and an $ 85 billion emergency loan to insurance titan American International Group .
Also , Lehman filed for bankruptcy and Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch .
Morgan ( MS , Fortune 500 ) and Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , whose shares plummeted last week before the $ 700 billion bailout was unveiled , will likely avoid those fates with the conversion , experts said .
" They were afraid they'd get killed if they did n't [ convert ] , " said Christopher Whalen , managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics .
" The Fed is scrambling to take the remaining targets off the radar . "
Beefing up the retail banks
The duo is expected to quickly add to their tiny existing retail banking divisions , which will give them access to a cheaper and more stable source of funding - customer deposits - rather than the volatile short - term funding they rely on .
The companies , which both requested the conversion , signaled as much in separate press releases Sunday .
They have plenty to pick from now that the credit crisis has devastated the banking sector .
Morgan , which has $ 36 billion in deposits , may already have a partner in mind .
Rumors have flown on Wall Street in the past week that it would hook up with Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) , a large but troubled bank .
Sunday 's shift would make such a merger easier .
With $ 20 billion in deposits , Goldman said it plans to grow its deposit base through acquisitions and internally .
It is also shifting assets from other divisions into its Goldman Sachs Bank USA , which will become one of the 10 largest banks in the United States with $ 150 billion in assets .
Access to the Fed funding
The action also solidifies their standing with the Fed .
While the investment banks received emergency access to the Fed funding in the wake of Bear Stearns ' demise in March , Goldman and Morgan will now have all the same privileges at the Fed lending window as their banking peers .
As part of Sunday 's move , the Fed extended additional credit to Goldman and Morgan , as well as Merrill , allowing them to pledge a wider array of collateral .
The companies also hope the shift will end investors ' fears that the investment banks are not solid enough to survive .
" This new bank holding structure will ensure that Morgan Stanley is in the strongest possible position , " said John Mack , Morgan 's chief executive .
" It also offers the marketplace certainty about the strength of our financial position and our access to funding . "
" We believe that Goldman Sachs , under Federal Reserve supervision , will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources , " said Lloyd C. Blankfein , Goldman 's chief executive
Turmoil on Wall Street
The Fed 's decision is just the latest in a dizzying series of events over the past week representing a dramatic reordering of the financial world .
All eyes now turn to the troubled traditional banks , such as Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) and Wachovia , which are scrambling to shore up their books as lending has frozen up and investor confidence has sunk .
Five days after Georgia invaded and seized the breakaway separatist region of South Ossetia , sparking a larger - scale Russian invasion to drive Georgian forces back and punish their leaders , Russia surprised its Western detractors by calling a halt to the country ’s offensive .
After all , the mainstream media , egged on by hawkish neocon pundits and their candidate John McCain , had everyone believing that Russia was hellbent on the full - scale annihilation and annexation of democratic Georgia .
But then came Tuesday ’s cease - fire announcement–and we ’re now forced to ask ourselves serious questions about the recent conflict : what really started it , how dangerous was it and what , with serious careful consideration , could be done to prevent it from turning into a worst - case scenario ?
Up until now , this war was framed as a simple tale of Good Helpless Democratic Guy Georgia versus Bad Savage Fascist Guy Russia .
In fact , it is far more complex than this , morally and historically .
Then there are two concentric David and Goliath narratives here .
The initial war pitted the Goliath Georgia–a nation of 4.4 million , with vastly superior numbers , equipment and training thanks to US and Israeli advisers–against David - Ossetia , with a population of between 50,000 - 70,000 and a local militia force that is barely battalion strength .
Reports coming out of South Ossetia tell of Georgian rockets and artillery leveling every building in the capital city , Tskhinvali , and of Georgian troops lobbing grenades into bomb shelters and basements sheltering women and children .
Although true casualty figures are hard to come by , reports that up to 2,000 Ossetians , mostly civilians , were killed are certainly believable , given the intensity of the initial Georgian bombardment , the wanton destruction of the city and surrounding regions and the generally savage nature of Caucasus warfare , a very personal game where old rules apply .
But you do n’t hear about this story from the Western media .
Indeed , you hear little if anything about the Ossetians , who seem to hardly exist in the West ’s eyes , even though their grievance is the root cause of this war .
While Russia and America see the conflict in abstract terms about spheres of influence and protecting allies , for Ossetians , who still recall the centuries of massacres Georgians committed against them , it is highly personal .
They will still recall the Georgian massacres in the early 1920s , when Georgia was briefly independent , which exterminated up to 8 percent of the Ossetian population .
In 1990 , when Georgia was again moving towards independence , the ultranationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia abolished Ossetia ’s limited autonomy , leading to another Ossetian rebellion that was only quelled by a peace agreement signed by Georgia , Russia and the Ossetians .
Gamsakhurdia was subsequently deposed , and Georgia ’s ethnic chauvinism was shelved until the rise of current president Mikhail Saakashvili in 2003 .
Ossetians have traditionally relied on their powerful northern neighbor Russia for protection against Georgia .
The Georgians , in turn , have tried to counter Russian hegemony , for which they are no match , by aligning closely with the United States , finding friendly ears among old cold warriors and Bush - era neocons .
When he first rose to prominence , the American - educated Saakashvili was often referred to as “ Georgia ’s Vladimir Zhirinovsky ” –the Russian ultranationalist firebrand who once promised to retake Alaska .
Although Saakashvili was subsequently rebranded as a Euro - democrat , he promised to reunite Georgia and bring his separatist regions to heel , by force if necessary , whether the aggrieved ethnic groups liked it or not .
At the root of this conflict is a clash of two twentieth - century guiding principles in international relations .
Georgia , backed by the West , is claiming its right as a sovereign nation to control the territory within its borders , a guiding principle since World War II .
The Ossetians are claiming their right to self - determination , a guiding principle since World War I .
These two guiding concepts for international relations–national sovereignty and the right to self - determination–are locked in a zero-sum battle in Georgia .
Sometimes , the West takes the side of national sovereignty , as it is in the current war ; other times , it sides with self - determination and redrawing of national borders , such as with Kosovo .
In that 1999 war , the United States led a nearly three - month bombing campaign of Serbia in order to rescue a beleaguered minority , the Albanians , and carve out a new nation .
Self - determination trumped national sovereignty , over the objections of Russia , China and numerous other countries .
Why , Russians and Ossetians ( not to mention separatist Abkhazians in Georgia ’s western region ) ask , should the same principle not be applied to them ?
The answer is clear : because we say so .
That sort of logic , in an era of colossal American decline and simultaneous Russian resurgence , no longer works on the field .
But sadly , this news has n’t been conveyed to neocon hawks like Robert Kagan or to John McCain , who seem to still be living in 2002 , when American military power was seen as the answer to all the world ’s problems .
There is even evidence to suggest that America encouraged Saakashvili to think he could solve this conflict by war .
Ever since 2002 , when American Green Berets dropped into Georgia to train its troops against phantom Al Qaeda cells , the Bush Administration has drawn the former Soviet nation closer into what appeared to be a military alliance , culminating in Georgia ’s 2,000 - man contribution to the Iraq coalition forces ( the third - largest contingent ) , and American joint training exercises in July , just a few weeks before Georgia ’s blitzkrieg attack on South Ossetia .
In the UN , Russian attempts in the early hours of the war to pass a resolution calling for a cease - fire were shot down by American and British diplomats , who objected to the clause calling on both sides to “ renounce violence ” –exactly Saakashvili ’s position .
The question we must ask is :
Are we willing to risk war , including nuclear holocaust , in order to fulfill the aspirations of Mikhail Saakashvili ?
While Bush and McCain speak of Saakashvili as if he ’s a combination of Thomas Jefferson and Nelson Mandela , he ’s seen by his own people as increasingly authoritarian and unbalanced .
Last year , Saakashvili sent in his special forces to violently disperse opposition protesters in the capital city , followed by a declaration of martial law .
He sacked the opposition television station ( partly owned by Rupert Murdoch ) , exiled or jailed his political opponents , and stacked the courts with his own judges while removing neutral observers , leaving even onetime neocon cheerleaders like Bruce Jackson and Anne Applebaum feeling queasy .
Hardly the image of the “ small democratic nation ” that everyone today touts .
The Russian response has , of course , been disproportionate and heavy - handed –exactly what ’s to be expected of them ever since Boris Yeltsin first showed the world how post - Soviet Russia fights its wars , starting with Chechnya in 1994 .
Georgia has been terrorized by indiscriminate aerial bombing and the constant threat of invasion by a vastly superior Russian force–eerily reminiscent of NATO ’s campaign against Serbia in 1999 .
Indeed , many observers believe that the current Russian response is a direct blowback of the Kosovo campaign , which is why there are so many similarities .
But what is the best way to respond ?
The neocons and even CNN reports talk about exploring military options , which is absurd given the consequences of war with nuclear - armed Russia .
Woofing loudly like John McCain is likely to prove as effective as Bush ’s woofing did with North Korea , before he was forced to crawl back to the negotiating table .
In fact , one of the most effective ways America could respond to this crisis is by rethinking its entire geopolitical approach of the past two decades , which has been hegemonic , arrogant , hypocritical and reckless .
If we set a better example , then we could at least reclaim the moral authority , or “ soft power , ” that we once had .
Instead , we ’ve left the world other more brutal lessons about geopolitical power and how to use it , and the Russians are showing they ’ve learned from us well .
One lesson they learned from Kosovo is that when you bomb a petty nationalist leader like Saakashvili or Milosevic , eventually –when the cease - fire is called and the sense of defeat settles in –the nationalist firebrand who brought them to defeat pays with his seat in power .

Mr Shafiq said the real issues facing Muslims are poverty , crime and racism British Muslims are guilty of a " victim mentality " and should take greater responsibility for their lives , a Muslim Labour MP has argued .
Sadiq Khan also said more British Muslims must tackle sexism , learn English and condemn forced marriages .
The representative for Tooting , south London , made his comments in a report for the Fabian Society think tank .
Muslim youth organisation the Ramadhan Foundation said Mr Khan was out of touch with grassroots Muslims .
' Liberal anxiety '
In his report , entitled Fairness , Not Favours , Mr Khan said : " We need to take more responsibility for our own families , ignore those who propagate conspiracy theories , and above all we need to leave behind our victim mentality .
" We must all agree that honour killings are murder and forced marriages are kidnapping .
These traditions have no place here or anywhere . "
He also claimed that Muslims in Britain are pre-occupied by foreign policy and not concerned enough about day - to - day political issues .
" Muslims need to recognise childcare is as important as Kashmir , " he said .
We do not have a victim mentality but are victims of this government 's failure
Mohammed Shafiq
Ramadhan Foundation Assistant whip Mr Khan said there was no question that people coming to live in Britain should learn English and he criticised " liberal anxiety " about the issue .
" The requirement to learn English is not colonial .
English is a passport to participation in mainstream society - jobs , education and even being able to use health services , " he said .
" Having poor English creates multiple barriers to work ; it decreases your confidence , makes it harder to gain other skills and qualifications and increases the likelihood of unemployment and your withdrawal from the labour market . "
Islamophobia Mohammed Shafiq , chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation , said the " real issues " holding Muslims back were " poverty , crime , racism and Islamophobia " .
He said : " We do not have a victim mentality but are victims of this government 's failure to deal with real issues , issues around poverty , tackling the underlying causes of why there is terrorism in this country . "
He said the Ramadhan Foundation had a long history of opposing forced marriages and so - called honour killings .
Mr Shafiq added there was no conflict between a concern for the fate of Muslims abroad and an awareness of the domestic political issues of Britain .
Muslims are facing increasing amounts of Islamophobia and discrimination so if some have a victim mentality , can you blame them ?
Shaista Gohir
Muslim Voice UK However Shaista Gohir , director of both Muslim Voice UK and Muslim Women 's Network UK , agreed that more needed to be done by Muslims to tackle sexism , forced marriages and honour killings .
She also agreed it was important for British Muslims to speak English .
Ms Gohir , who is a government adviser on Muslim women , told the BBC : " Not being able to speak English is not only a barrier to integration but is also disempowering for individuals , so I agree that Muslims who do not speak English need to make more of an effort to learn . "
But she said it was an over - generalisation to say Muslims had a victim mentality .
She said : " Muslims are facing increasing amounts of Islamophobia and discrimination so , if some have a victim mentality , can you blame them ? "
" Yes Muslims do need to take greater responsibility of their lives but so do other communities that suffer problems such as under - age drinking and increased gun and knife crime . "
In July the government launched a package of measures responding to calls from Muslim communities to support the promotion of citizenship and shared values , said a Department of Communities and Local Government spokesman .

Friday , August 29 , 2008 Geostrategy - Direct.com LONDON — Al Qaida - aligned suicide strikes in Morocco were believed to have been directed from several southern European countries .
In August 2008 , a senior facilitator of the Al Qaida strikes was arrested in Italy .
The facilitator was identified as Abdul Majid Zergout , a 43 - year - old imam in a mosque in the northern Italian city of Varese .
Law enforcement sources said Varese has become a hotbed of Al Qaida - inspired activity .
They said this included financing , training and recruiting of North Africans for Islamic insurgency operations .
Also In This Edition Amazon.com Widgets European law enforcement sources said investigations in such countries as Belgium , Italy and Spain have pointed to guidance and financing for Al Qaida operations in Morocco over the last year .
The sources said the failed suicide operations in Morocco in 2007 marked an effort to revive the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group .
European law enforcement sources said investigations in such countries as Belgium , Italy and Spain have pointed to guidance and financing for Al Qaida operations in Morocco over the last year .
The sources said the failed suicide operations in Morocco in 2007 marked an effort to revive the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group .
" The facilitators for the attacks were Moroccans in several southern European countries who provided both financing and instruction to organize and conduct the terrorist attacks , " a European source said .
Italian authorities have been tracking Zergout for several years .
In 2007 , a Milan court acquitted Zergout of security offenses amid a determination by the European Court of Human Rights that he and other Moroccan fugitives could undergo torture in their North African homeland .
But on Aug. 16 , Italian police arrested Zergout and renewed extradition proceedings .
Italy could decide to extradite Zergout by October 2008 .

Iraq financially prepared to pay for country 's reconstruction : Report RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday August 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Sens. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) and John Warner ( R - Va. ) announced Tuesday the release of a Government Accountability Office report on Iraq 's oil revenues .
It concludes that the Iraqi government , after several years of ramped - up oil revenues , is financially capable of shouldering the burden of the country 's reconstruction .
The report claims that between 2005 and 2007 , the Iraqi government took in $ 96 billion , mostly on oil revenue .
In 2008 , the group estimates as much as $ 86 billion will pour into coffers , driven by the high costs of crude .
In spite of these revenues , the United States treasury has paid in excess of $ 48 billion for reconstruction in the country , while the Iraqis have spent some $ 896 million .
At the end of 2008 , Iraq is expected to hold a budget surplus of roughly $ 52 billion ; more than enough , says the report , to take up the mantle of rebuilding the shattered nation .
" The Iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects , " said Sen. Levin in a Tuesday media advisory .
" It is inexcusable for U.S. taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the Iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves .
" We should not be paying for Iraqi projects , while Iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from $ 4 a gallon gas prices in the U.S.
We should require that U.S. taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects . "
" It is time for the sovereign government of Iraq , using its revenues , expenditures and surpluses , to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people , " added Sen .
Warner in the release .

A proposed constitutional amendment against gay marriage in California — already lagging among likely voters — continues to lose support , according to a new Field Poll released today , while the percentage of those who say they oppose the ban appears to be on the rise .
Fifty - five percent of voters indicated they would say no to the proposed amendment , which would make same - sex marriage illegal in California .
That is up from 51 percent opposing the measure , Proposition 8 , in a previous poll conducted in July .
In the sampling of more than 800 likely voters , only 38 percent said they would support the ban , down from 42 percent nearly three months ago .
“ Initiatives that are trailing , either at the initial measurement or in subsequent measures , rarely pass , ” said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll , also noting that opinions on issues like same - sex marriage tend not to fluctuate dramatically .
“ History is working against passage . ”
But that trend is hardly surprising , a spokeswoman for the “ Yes on 8 ” campaign said , especially after the state won approval last month to change the ballot language , specifically mentioning a ban on same - sex marriage .
“ That was certainly something we expected to see , ” Jennifer Kerns said , adding that , at the same time , “ historically , the Field Poll has underestimated support for traditional marriage . ”
The poll also sought to examine what effect that new ballot language had on voters ’ views .
It found that opposition to the ban increased slightly when voters were shown the new language instead of the original .
Those changes were unsuccessfully challenged in court by supporters of the proposition , who argued it was misleading .
To reach that finding , voters in the study were randomly divided into two groups , with one receiving the original ballot language to appear on the ballot .
The other group received the new language , which will appear on the Nov. 4 ballot .
While support for the measure remained static at 38 percent , opposition increased from 52 percent to 55 percent .
“ That has to do with the description , ” DiCamillo said .
“ Eliminating an individual right , no matter what that right might be , is not as popular as the alternative . ”
When broken down across party affiliation , religion or geography , today ’s Field Poll revealed a handful of other , subtle changes when compared with July ’s poll , which marked the first independent examination of the issue following the California Supreme Court ’s decision June 4 to remove the last hurdles to same - sex marriages .
More voters in inland counties now appear opposed to the measure than in favor , 48 percent to 44 percent .
That ’s a significant shift from July , when 40 percent said they opposed the ban with 54 percent in favor .
The new poll also showed slightly softening support among Protestants and Catholics and among Democrats and Republicans alike .
Despite the widening margin of those who say they oppose a constitutional ban , the groups fighting to defeat Proposition 8 “ wo n’t let up , ” said Molly McKay of Marriage Equality USA , part of the “ No on 8 ” coalition .
Still , she said , “ I think most fair - minded people ca n’t imagine changing the California Constitution to take away civil rights .
That ’s just not what California is all about . ”
But Kerns again cautioned against reading too much into the new Field Poll results , explaining that other polls this summer have shown support for the ban leading and that the campaign ’s own internal polling shows approval of the measure at a dead heat .
“ The most important numbers are the ones that happen on Election Day , ” she said .
“ But no doubt about it , we expect it to be very close all the way through . ”

Perhaps only one word can be used to describe all of the leading presidential contenders : multimillionaire .
Compared to the Average American Family
Barack Obama , with the lowest asset total of all candidates , is worth 25 times more than the average American household .
Mitt Romney , with the highest asset total , is worth 1075 times more than the average American household .
On average , the major Presidential candidates have assets of 47 million dollars , or 505 times the average American household .
Data
Rudy Giuliani – 40 Million Dollars
Mitt Romney – 100 Million Dollars *
Hillary Clinton – 51 Million Dollars
John McCain – 35 Million Dollars
Barack Obama – 2.5 Million Dollars **
John Edwards – 50 Million Dollars
Average American Household – .093 Million Dollars ( 93 Thousand Dollars )
* This number represents an average from the lower quintile from several sources that estimate Romney ’s total assets
** This figure is from May 2007 and do not include revenues his highly profitable book ‘ The Audacity of Hope ’ .
Note : Personal assets of presidential candidates do not include the assets of their spouses .
Most notably , assets for the McCain ’s and Clinton ’s is much higher when their spouses are factored in .

Capital and its Complements : A Summary
The following is a non-technical summary of Brad DeLong ’s May 2008 paper Capital and Its Complements .
Adam Smith explained that in all countries with “ security of property and tolerable administration of justice ” citizens would spend all their money ( capital ) , either on consumption or investment , causing the country ’s economy to grow .
After some contention , later economic studies tended to bare this out : a shortage of capital was n’t always the bottleneck , but when it was , removing it could lead to extraordinarily rapid growth .
The problem for poor countries is that , because of high mortality rates ( which require more children to have some survive ) and low educational levels ( which mean those children can find productive employment quickly ) , they have high population growth and thus low capital - to - labor ratios .
Worse , trade allows you to spend your money buying manufactured goods from overseas , for which you have only your very cheap labor to provide in return .
The result is that it requires an enormous amount of domestic investment to improve capital - to - labor ratios .
And so rich country economists made “ the neoliberal bet ” on behalf of poor countries : they hoped that loosening restrictions on international capital flows would send capital rushing in to poor countries and build their economies , the same way that Great Britain ’s massive investment in a young United States ( in 1913 Britain ’s foreign assets equaled 60 % of its domestic capital stock ) built up that country .
But what ended up happening was exactly the opposite .
Yes , NAFTA led US companies to invest the $ 20 to $ 30 billion a year on manufacturing in Mexico that its boosters predicted , but that investment was more than outweighed by the $ 30 to $ 40 billion a year fleeing the country from Mexico ’s wealthy wanting to invest it in the United States .
Why ?
In part because the US was more politically stable , and thus a safer investment climate .
And in part because the US treats its own workers so poorly — with productivity rising 35 % since 2000 while real wages remain flat — it provides an excellent investment opportunity .
But meanwhile , all this investment in the US was dwarfed by the Chinese acquisition of our debt ( and thus the political risk it represents ) .
China needed to do this , since US purchase of their exports is the only thing funding the manufacturing - led industrialization of a massive portion of their economy ; there would be massive dislocation if that funding dried up .
“ Recognition of these facts came slowly . ”
First , Larry Summers said it was our unsustainable current account deficit .
( That was the 1990s ; today that deficit is four times as large . )
Later , economists thought it must have been our large budget deficits .
Then they began thinking it was the run-up in housing prices .
But that , it is now clear to most economists , was the result of a bubble .
And yet the flow of capital to the US continues .
But , perhaps even more frighteningly , it could stop at any moment .

La Bourse de Paris a plongé , mardi 8 juillet , jusqu'à son plus bas niveau en séance depuis trois ans .
Dans la matinée , le CAC 40 a cédé jusqu'à 2,73 % , à 4 224,08 points , un niveau qu'il n'avait pas connu depuis juillet 2005 .
REPLI DES VALEURS FINANCIÈRES
A 10 h 35 , l'indice évoluait encore en baisse de 2,55 % , à 4 231,66 points .
La place parisienne souffre en particulier de la rechute des valeurs financières , de nouveau attaquées dans une note inquiétante de la banque d'affaires américaine Lehman Brothers .
Ainsi , la Société générale a perdu 3,67 % , BNP - Paribas 3,66 % , Dexia 5,12 % et Crédit agricole 4,34 %. Selon Lehman Brothers , les sociétés américaines de refinancement hypothécaire Freddie Mac et Fannie
Mae devraient lever chacune plus de 40 milliards de dollars ( 25,4 milliards d'euros ) pour faire face à leurs engagements respectifs .
Autre élément négatif pour les indices , l'Eurogroupe et la Commission européenne ont estimé que la croissance en zone euro s'annonce beaucoup plus " mauvaise " au deuxième trimestre qu'au premier et risque d'être en deçà des prévisions .
" LE BARIL EST ÉGALEMENT UN FACTEUR D'INQUIÉTUDE "
La plupart des autres Bourses européennes baissaient également nettement à l'ouverture .
Vers 9 h 30 , Londres cédait ainsi 2,31 % et Francfort 2,19 % .
" Les craintes concernant le crédit restent au centre de l'attention des courtiers des deux côtés de l'Atlantique et le fait que les prix du brut ne soient pas passés sous la barrière des 140 dollars le baril est également un facteur d'inquiétude " , a déclaré Paul Webb de CMC Markets à l'agence Dow Jones Newswire .
Auparavant , la plupart des Bourses asiatiques avaient clôturé en baisse .
A Tokyo , l'indice Nikkei a perdu 2,45 % pour clore à 13 033,10 points , son plus bas niveau depuis mi-avril .
La place de Taïwan et la Bourse de Séoul ont également enregistré de sérieux replis , tout comme à Hongkong , qui a perdu 2,96 %.
Seule Shanghaï a enregistré une très légère hausse de 0,81 % .

As I said before , as for me , I 'd like unleavened bread ( which represents a sinless Christ ) and wine ( which represents the blood ) for communion .
And , again , just because you have the Holy Ghost does NOT mean you 're always right .
We still have a finite mind to contend with .
The answer ?
Do your best , and be open to the idea that you may be wrong .

Before I got saved we used to say prayers to them .

# 3 The natives got sick and almost died .
So , that would be a bad example to say that Jesus was the Bread of Life .
However , their staple food was made from the sabal palm , so they changed the scripture to read , " Jesus is the Sabal of Life . "
Then the people who lived on Sabal understood that Jesus was the giver of Life .
Perhaps when they observed communion that had baked sabal in banana leaves with some fermented fruit juice .

Jack :
Even though the Holy Spirit is one of unity , the spirit does NOT possess us - we still retain our free wills , and egos , etc. Even Peter and Paul argued .
Also , there are probably many things we think about whose importance is beneath the Holy Spirit 's notice ( Should I have cheerios for breakfast ?
or toast ?
while God is aware of my choices , I 'm sure this matter is of so little importance that he does n't much care one way or the other ) .

By using such it is no longer traditional communion but is now potluck fellowship !

We do NOT know that the original Lord 's supper was using unleavened WHEAT bread .
It could have been barley or it could have been bread with the ingredients listed in Ezekial 4:9 - wheat and barley , and beans , and lentils , and fitches and make thee bread there of . . .
I agree with Alan , what about the countries that do not have bread , they have rice ?

# 2 Also years ago we had a missionary from New Guinea at our church .
They lived among a tribe that did not have the bible or a written language , so they learned the language , developed an alphabet and then wrote the bible in the native language .
He explained that Jesus as the Bread of Life had to be changed , because someone sent them white bread from the states and they shared with the natives .

Communion came from the last supper in which Jesus broke the bread and poured the wine .
I assume that if Jesus wanted Nachos to be used then he would have created them for that moment .
No , Jesus used bread and wine so that will be good enough reason for me to use them as well .

Jack : I 'm not God .
I 'm human .
We are going to disagree on some things .
The problem with people like you is they always deny the human element and man 's ability to make mistakes .
Holy Spirit or not , I 'd rather be on the side of humility , and admit some things are my opinion , than speak for God on every matter , and take His name in vain in doing so .
So , whether I 'm right or wrong , let God be the judge .
As far as I know , God 's name is not " Jack " .

** Gordon : just because we both have the spirit does not mean we will always come to the same conclusions .

Wrong .
The Holy Spirit is a spirit of unity .
If you BOTH had the SAME Holy Spirit , you'd be coming to the exactly same conclusions .
The fact you do n't means one of two things :
1 . One of you has the Holy Spirit and the other does n't .
2. Neither of you does .
--- Jack on 12/19/07
Gordon : just because we both have the spirit does not mean we will always come to the same conclusions .
Also , beginning in 2008 I will be starting my 4th time reading through the entire Bible .
Unity , does not mean uniformity .
We are brothers unified through the blood of Christ , but we differ on this issue .
I personally would like my communion with unleavened bread and WINE .
But if we do EVERYTHING as unto the Lord , I do n't think logistics are the point .
--- j._nonymous on 12/17/07
j. nonymous ,
You are still totally missing the point .
It is what the Bread and Wine represent !
The Sacred , Holy and Pure Blood of the Son of GOD Jesus Christ ( YAHUSHUA ) .
That Blood is the ONLY THING that can keep you , me and anyone else OUT OF HELL .
And , if you will take the time to allow the Holy Spirit to show you through different resources , including the Bible , just what Hell is really like , you 'll THEN understand why I and others are " fussing " about this so much .

** If the communion elements do , in fact , become the literal body and blood of Christ ( as some churches teach ) , then what does it matter whether they started out as wheat , or as corn ?**

He took bread , gave thanks and broke it , and gave it to them , saying " This is My body which is given for you , do this in
rememberance of Me. " --- truthseeker on 12/12/07
No !
That was not blasphemous !
It merely goes against our tradition .
Once a person came to me in " a work office " setting and asked me to hold communion .
I was most reluctant to do so but several workers wanted me to do so .
We used ordinary white bread and Cokes with the people had bought for this in - house communion .

At least Grape Juice and Leavened bread are CLOSER to what YAHUSHUA instructed us to use .
If nachos and soda pop is ALL ONE HAS , that 's ONE thing .
But , if nachos are used INSTEAD , as a " change of pace " or for a " taste sensation " , then it is Blasphemous indeed .
YES !!!
TAKE CARE of the bigger issues that need dealt with , but WHY ADD ON UNECESSARY LITTLE ONES ??!!
You do n't NEED to remember the Lord YAHUSHUA 's Blood Sacrifice with Nacho Chips and a Coke !
It 's DISRESPECTFUL ! --- Gordon on 12/12/07

If the communion elements do , in fact , become the literal body and blood of Christ ( as some churches teach ) , then what does it matter whether they started out as wheat , or as corn ?

Well as I remember Nachos do n't contain leavening agents and it could be a Grape diet soda so if some one is trying to use it in a contemporary worship service it my work very well .
The most comprehensive account of the last supper is John account and John does not write about this .
So you are left with Matthew for an eye witness account of the last supper .
The meal was a regular evening meal as no lamb or bitter herbs are mentioned .

No , this is not blasphemy .

Yes , bread and wine were main staples in that day and age , and it was something the people could relate to .
So looking at it from that perspective , I could see where he is coming from .
It 's so easy to be hard on people when we do n't understand the whole picture .
--- kady on 12/10/07
If this did happen I would not agree with it , as Jesus used bread and wine at the Last Supper to use anything else would be unacceptable .
IMO
But , I was told by a preacher that the reason why bread and wine was used it was a common meal of the time .
So if Jesus lived in modern times it could have been beer and pizza or soda and nachos .
Which are more common meals of our time .

If communion is nothing more than a mental remembering , what difference does it make what is used , or even if it is done at all ?
OTOH , if , as " anamnesis " indicates , it 's an actual making present of that which is memorialized , then the matter ( as the bread and wine are called ) makes all the difference in the world .

We want a " DC vs Marvel : the Springfield Wars " miniseries now .
[ Springfield Punx , Thanks Oscar ]
SEATTLE ( MarketWatch ) -- Mutual funds ' Achilles ' heel is a bear market .
Your 401 ( k ) has an Achilles ' heel too : mutual funds .
Most mutual funds families ' fund prospectuses state they will do nothing to protect shareholders ' assets from a bear market .
They will not sell stocks short , go to cash , or hedge against obvious risks .
This meant that older workers with larger retirement savings lost heavily in the three - year 2000 - 2002 bear market .
After that traumatic experience , it took the unlikely discipline of staying fully invested for the next five years simply to break even .
... Here we go again down that slippery slope
In the past 10 months , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % has fallen about 17 % , the U.S. dollar index is down about 6 % , and inflation as measured by the CPI ( all items ) is rising at a 4.9 % annualized rate .
That means that in just 10 months investors ' wealth has been eroded almost as much as it was during the entire three - year bear market .
The difference this time is that the recession and the bear market are just beginning -- one year after the credit crisis news broke .
Different markets require different strategies .
Get your priorities straight
Given that your employer probably wo n't be making any substantial changes to your 401 ( k ) plan soon , you and your fellow employees may want to take some actions to protect your savings and embrace investments more appropriate to a bear market .
Your priorities should be :
(1) Shift investments in the 401 ( k ) to the safety of cash until you can decide where more productive investments might be .
(2) See if your plan offers Rydex or ProFunds bull and bear market funds .
(3) Put your savings in a self - directed brokerage account if the plan offers such an option .
(4) Even better , find out if an in - service rollover to a self - directed IRA is available .
(5) Ask your human resources department to enlist an independent accountant and investment adviser experienced in bear - market investing to counsel workers .
Do n't accept a representative of the fund family that is losing you money .
" Stay the course " and " think long - term " are not good advice to employees who do n't have a long - term left .
( This recession could take you as long as a decade to experience and recover your losses ; the last bear market took eight and one half years to unfold and recover . )
(6) Start an investment club to educate employees about how to survive this bear market .
For example , you might want to discuss why , when you are hearing about the oil companies ' obscene profits , your 401 ( k ) plan does n't have an energy - sector fund for you to invest in .
Head your employer off at the pass !
Some employers are considering dropping the incentive of matching employer contributions when they implement automatic ( just say " No " or " negative option " ) enrollment plans that will require you to participate unless you opt out .
Congress has approved so - called lifecycle or target maturity funds as default investments if you do not make another choice .
These unproven funds start out with a larger allocation to stocks and increase the allocation to bonds as you approach the target maturity .
Target maturity funds are largely unproven ( 32 have 10 - year track records and the best only averaged 4.88 % over a full investment cycle of bull and bear market years ) , and have on average lost almost 8 % in the first six months of 2008 .
More importantly , interest rates are at or near historic lows and are more likely to rise than fall over the coming decades , guaranteeing that the increasing bond allocation will be a losing proposition as time goes by .
Once again , most plans offer no provisions to even try to profit during bear markets .
Finally , if your employer is laying off staff , having difficulty getting bank financing or otherwise having financial troubles , that 's a clear sign that you should not be investing in company stock .
The revolution begins
Post this column on a bulletin board at work and email the link to your friends .
It 's time to assemble the wisest investors in your company and schedule a meeting with the Plan trustees and the human resources staff , perhaps with the supporting attendance of the corporate treasurer to attach credibility to the discussion .
This week would be a good week to start scheduling such a meeting and formulating strategy on how to deal with the very real possibility of a prolonged bear market standing between you and your retirement .
It 's your money in your 401 ( k ) plan and no one from your employer will be ready to bail you out in retirement .
Now is the time for all good employees to protect their interests and make retirement savings an employee benefit that benefits employees .
COCHRANE : When 21 - year - old Cambodian actress Amy checked her email earlier this month , there was an unexpected message waiting for her .
AMY : When I checked it said that I won the lottery from the UK and I get an amount on this , maybe a lot of money and then I feel surprised and I replied to them with their requirements , like write down my name , write down my phone number and my email address .
COCHRANE :
She did n't know it at the time but Amy was being lured into an internet scam that fools people into giving away millions each year .
For Amy , there was extra reason to be hopeful .
Her sister - in - law had recently won a visa in the annual American visa lottery and Amy thought perhaps she really had won the 300 thousand pounds the email offered .
But there were signs that something was suspicious .
AMY : After I send them , they send me back immediately and say that contact this bank and contact that bank .
In the end I find that they want to see my account , so I feel wonder and think why do you need to see my account , and I 'm not sure with that , so I need to tell my friend .
COCHRANE : Initially , Amy's Cambodian friends were excited about her good luck , but still she had doubts .
AMY : So I ask my British friend and he told me , ' They cheat you Amy , they cheat , they cheat you . '
I 'm very very hopeless and I still do n't believe that so I asked him , ' Why , what 's the reason that you know that I was cheated by them , why ?.
COCHRANE : The reason the British man knew , was that internet scams are well known and avoided by most internet users .
But in countries like Cambodia , where the internet is still emerging , innocent users are prime targets for scam artists trying to steal money or identities .
The lottery scam is a variation of what 's known as a " 419 " scam or a " Nigerian scam " , so - called because they first started in Nigeria using a legal loophole known as clause 419 .
Typically , scammers send out thousands of emails telling people they have inherited or embezzled millions of dollars and need a bank account to stash the money , in exchange for a slice of the spoils .
In Nigeria , there 's even a cheeky pop song that boasts of ripping off gullible foreigners .
It might seem like a joke to some , but police say millions of dollars are lost each year , a fact hidden by the victims reluctance to admit they were fooled and report the crime .
A UK study in 2006 found that 150 thousand pounds a year was lost to these scams , with each victim losing an average of 31 thousand pounds .
That led to failed businesses and broken marriages , said the study .
Bill Caelli is from the Institute of Information Security at Queensland University of Technology .
He says there 's little a government can do about protecting the gullible .
CAELLI : The problem here is basically one of education and awareness , that 's about the best thing we can do at the present moment .
Even the concept of trying to block the source of those particular messages wo n't work because the scammers simply change their addresses .
COCHRANE : New technology might help , but until internet users realise that anything that seems too good to be true , is probably a trick , scammers around the world will continue to chop the dollars from foreign bank accounts .
It was n’t until Hurricane Katrina  when the heckuva job done by the man of whom Ms. Noonan said , “ if there ’s a fire on the block , he ’ll run out and help ” revealed the true costs of obliviousness  that the cult began to fade .
What ’s more , the politics of stupidity did n’t just appeal to the poorly informed .
Bear in mind that members of the political and media elites were more pro-war than the public at large in the fall of 2002 , even though the flimsiness of the case for invading Iraq should have been even more obvious to those paying close attention to the issue than it was to the average voter .
Why were the elite so hawkish ?
Well , I heard a number of people express privately the argument that some influential commentators made publicly  that the war was a good idea , not because Iraq posed a real threat , but because beating up someone in the Middle East , never mind who , would show Muslims that we mean business .
In other words , even alleged wise men bought into the idea of macho posturing as policy .
All this is in the past .
But the state of the energy debate shows that Republicans , despite Mr. Bush ’s plunge into record unpopularity and their defeat in 2006 , still think that know - nothing politics works .
And they may be right .
Sad to say , the current drill - and - burn campaign is getting some political traction .
According to one recent poll , 69 percent of Americans now favor expanded offshore drilling  and 51 percent of them believe that removing restrictions on drilling would reduce gas prices within a year .
The headway Republicans are making on this issue wo n’t prevent Democrats from expanding their majority in Congress , but it might limit their gains  and could conceivably swing the presidential election , where the polls show a much closer race .
In any case , remember this the next time someone calls for an end to partisanship , for working together to solve the country ’s problems .
It ’s not going to happen  not as long as one of America ’s two great parties believes that when it comes to politics , stupidity is the best policy .
“ Swiss banks must verify your identity and wo n’t accept your business if they think it is illegal , says Ken Wassell , CEO of Los Angeles , California - based Offshore Company , a firm that aids its customers in overseas financial services .
“ About five percent of applications a year are turned down because of possible fraud , ” says Wassell .
It does n't stop there .
James Nason , spokesman for the Swiss Bankers Association , adds that Swiss banks must not only verify your identity but also verify the source of the funds you are putting in the bank .
“ And besides that , ” says Nason , “ the beneficiary of the funds must also be positively identified . ”
That ’s not to say there is n’t secrecy in having a Swiss bank account .
Any Swiss banker today who reveals your information without your consent risks prison time by law .
And there is secrecy when it comes to issues like inheritance or divorce .
It ’s up to plaintiffs to prove someone has a bank account in Switzerland , if they want access to it through a lawsuit .
There are , of course , exceptions to the secrecy rule , especially concerning crimes such as gun running and drug trafficking .
Swiss banks are forbidden by law to accept money which they know might be as a result of a crime .
And when it comes to names , the so - called secret numbered accounts in Swiss banks are not completely secret .
" Yes , banks can set up an account by number only , " says Nason , " but you will have to go through the same process to open the account as a named account — at greater expense .
Your name will be known to several upper management types in the bank and there are records of ownership . "
Origins Of Secrecy
The concept got its start in the 18th century , when a group called The Great Council of Geneva passed a law in 1713 , preventing banks from sharing information about their clients .
A funny thing happened when LG Electronics began selling its Zenith digital converter box in January : People could n't figure out the remote control .
The boxes enable analog television sets to receive digital signals from broadcasters .
But some people who bought them did n't realize that they should first remove the protective plastic wrap from the AA battery than came with the device .
This alone accounted for 10 % of the 27,000 converter - related calls the Korean company received between January and the end of August .
Although that 's a tiny fraction of the 1 million customers who purchased the device in that time period , LG and other companies that make converter boxes are urging people to get their converters now , before the night of Feb. 17 .
At the stroke of midnight that day , TV stations will cease to broadcast over - the - air signals and go all - digital .
There 's not likely to be chaos , but there could be hiccups if everyone who needs a converter box waits until the last minute , said John I. Taylor , LG 's vice president of government affairs .
" We do n't anticipate any catastrophic results , " Taylor said in an interview Wednesday .
" But will there be challenges ?
Absolutely . "
One possible scenario is a temporary run on converter boxes .

Conyers reiterates demand for RNC documents Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Chairman says committee must cooperate with probe of Justice Dept. after judge 's subpoena ruling House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers is reiterating his demand that the Republican National Committee hand over e-mails and other documents relating to its probe of the Bush administration 's politicization of the Justice Department .
Conyers ( D - MI ) wrote to RNC lawyer Robert Kelner Thursday explaining that a judge 's recent ruling upholding Congress 's authority to subpoena two White House aides also complied to the political committee , which maintained separate e-mail address for some administration figures like former adviser Karl Rove .
The Judiciary Committee has spent more than a year trying to get its hands on the RNC documents in its probe that began with an inquiry into the firing of nine US Attorneys and has expanded to consider all aspects of the Justice Department , including the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
Critics and whistleblowers say Rove helped orchestrate the Siegleman prosecution ; at the time he was sent to jail on what many see as trumped - up charges , Siegelman was the only Democratic governor in the south .
In his letter ( .pdf ) , Conyers noted the White House has not claimed executive privilege to scuttle its inquiry into Siegelman 's case , as it has with other Congressional investigations .
Therefore , the Michigan Democrat argues , there is no reason for the RNC not to cooperate .
In addition , I would also like to request that you identify and produce any emails transmitted to or from the White House staff through RNC computer servers that mention former Governor of Alabama Don Siegelman .
Because there has been no White House claim of privilege regarding Siegelman documents -- to the contrary , the White House has permitted Karl Rove to provide written statements to the Committee 's Ranking Member on this very subject -- I would assume that you will be able to produce these documents directly and that no listing or privilege log will be required .
To the extent that your client does elect to withhold any of these documents from the Committee , I would appreciate a comparable listing so that the Committee can evaluate any claims of privilege that you believe apply .
US District Judge John Bates ruled last week that the White House 's " claim of absolute immunity " to avoid handing over documents and prevent testimony from Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former counsel Harriet Miers " is without any support in case law . "
That ruling went on to require the White House to produce subpoenaed documents or offer a detailed list of what it was withholding , outlining specific executive privilege claims in each case .
" [ Y ] our client has declined to produce or itemize the subpoenaed documents relying on the very Executive Privilege claim that was considered by Judge Bates , and you have previously indicated that the RNC would adhere to the terms of a court resolution of the dispute between the Committee and the Executive , " Conyers wrote to Kelner .
" Accordingly , I expect you will provide any non-privileged documents that your client possesses and an appropriate list and description of any subpoenaed documents that you continue to withhold . "

These women said no - one had the right to tell them how to dress About 70 Turkish women have protested in Istanbul after a court found a woman guilty of exhibitionism for fishing in what was termed " improper clothing " .
The protesters marched across the iconic Galata Bridge chanting slogans .
" It 's not exhibitionism , it 's male abuse ! " and " State , take your hands off my body ! " they cried .
Rows of bemused fishermen watched as they passed - many were wearing strappy tops , flimsy sun-dresses with plunging necklines , or shorts .
The incident they were protesting about occurred last summer , on the same bridge , when men complained that the woman 's clothing was " improper . "
Turkish newspapers quote court documents as saying she was wearing a lightweight outfit like a nightdress , which blew up in the wind .
Last week a judge upheld the men's complaints .
' Conservative pressure ' Women protesters say finding the woman guilty of " exhibitionism " is disturbing proof that conservative thinking is on the rise here .
" They think women should stay home and dress properly , " complains Cigdem Mater .
" The question is what is proper ?
No-one has the right to tell us what to wear , that is the point . "
Fishermen on the bridge seemed bemused by the protest None of the men who witnessed the actual incident were about on Saturday .
But other fishermen expressed their disapproval at the ruling .
" I do n't think anyone should be arrested because of their clothing .
People cross this bridge wearing all sorts of things , " one of the fishermen said .
" But unfortunately there is conservative pressure on people now because we have a religious government . "
The AK Party - which is led by devout Muslims - has been in power since 2002 .
Some are concerned Turkey is becoming more conservative under its rule .
" Men here are not well educated , " another fisherman adds .
" It 's the mothers that fail to teach them .
But overall , the state sides with men when things should be equal . "
The protesters sang songs and carried banners calling for the law on exhibitionism to be overturned .
They argue it reinforces the patriarchal order in Turkey and discriminates against women .
A number of men who groped a woman on Taksim Square last New Year 's Eve were fined 57 lira ( $ 45 , £ 23 ) .
The fisherwoman in a flimsy dress was given a five - month suspended prison sentence for exhibitionism .

Enlarge By Tom Tingle , The Arizona Republic A TSA officer views the scan from a backscatter machine at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix , in February 2007 .
Backscatter X - ray technology is currently being tested for cars to stop potential terrorists from blowing up a car bomb at one of the nation 's airports , homeland security officials say .
HOW THE CAR SCANNER WORKS HOW THE CAR SCANNER WORKS • Car drives slowly under arch - like portal .
• Portal takes X - ray images of top and two sides .
• Screener views images for large organic materials such as bombs or narcotics .
• Screening takes about 30 seconds .

A controversial new X - ray technology is being tested that could stop potential terrorists from blowing up a car bomb at one of the nation 's airports , homeland security officials say .
The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is running a test at a North Carolina ferry terminal of a 21 - foot - high arch - like machine that shoots low - intensity X - rays at cars as they pass through .
The photos show whether explosives or drugs might be in the car .
The technology , called backscatter X - ray , is in use at several airports to screen passengers .
Privacy advocates have denounced scanning people as invasive because the X - rays can see through clothes .
Melissa Ngo , a Washington , D.C. , lawyer who focuses on privacy issues , says using the technology for cars could pave the way for " Big Brother " government spying .
" If this technology ends up being deployed widely , it seems to be another step toward a society where you need to accept surveillance in every part of your life , " Ngo says .
TSA Assistant Administrator John Sammon said motorist privacy wo n't be invaded because taking X - rays of cars " is a fairly non-intrusive way of being able to inspect vehicles that are coming in " to an airport .
At many airports , cars are currently stopped at random and searched by authorities .
Sammon said the TSA has made no decision about using the X - ray portals at airports .
The four - week test at a small ferry terminal in Cherry Branch , N.C. , will gauge public reaction and the machine 's ability to find bombs , Sammon said .
Searches escalated last summer after two men with ties to al - Qaeda drove an SUV into entrance doors at Glasgow Airport in Scotland , igniting a fire .
Sammon said the test is not related to the Glasgow terror attack .
The TSA has no intelligence pointing to a potential car bombing at an airport , Sammon said , adding that the X - ray machine could be useful if there was such a threat .
" Rather than stopping all vehicles or doing random checks , you could run vehicles , especially large - panel trucks , through the machine , " Sammon said .
Ferry officials say the X - ray portal has intrigued but not alarmed motorists lining up for the 20 - minute ferry ride from Cherry Branch across the Neuse River to Minnesott Beach on North Carolina 's coast .
" I am not aware of any complaints , " said David Lewis , security coordinator for the North Carolina Ferry Division .
Similar machines are protecting military bases in the USA and in Afghanistan , said Joe Reiss , head of marketing for manufacturer American Science and Engineering .
The machines , first marketed last year , cost $ 1.2 million to $ 1.7 million .

I think that , in any tough situation , there 's a kind of normal way a person can react and a completely angry , psycho , absurd way a person can react .
The normal way is the best way about 99.99 % of the time .
Example : A waiter brings you the wrong drink , so you politely ask for another .
Result :
You get the drink you wanted without traces of type 1 herpes .
See ?
Everybody wins .
Anyway , that 's the rational way to responding to a bad situation .
Here 's an example of the irrational :
My husband had repeatedly warned our 3 boys about their behavior while playing the XBOX .
Tuesday , after I arrived home from work , our oldest son told me to look in the backyard at " Dad 's artwork " .
Well , I was n't surprised to see the XBOX proudly displayed on the nearest tree ... way to go Honey !!!!!

Maybe the boys were jackasses .
Maybe they deserved it .
Or maybe , just maybe , the father antagonized a bit too much and will come home from work one day to some " artwork " made just for him .

DETROIT ( AP ) 
Three lawyers are refusing to testify at next week ’s proceedings by Michigan ’s governor that could lead to the ouster of Detroit ’s mayor , Kwame M. Kilpatrick .
Mr. Kilpatrick ’s lawyer , Sharon McPhail , said the refusals could harm the mayor ’s ability to defend himself .
She urged Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm to delay the proceedings , press the witnesses to testify or seek subpoena power to compel them to do so .
“ The inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings , ” Ms. McPhail said in a letter to the governor ’s legal adviser , Kelly Keenan .
China has set aside three parks during the Olympics , to allow people to demonstrate .
But , as the BBC's Michael Bristow finds out , the parks are empty and those who apply for permission to protest are even finding themselves arrested .
Shijie Park is full of tourists admiring model buildings rather than protesters Just before the Olympic Games began , officials said ordinary Chinese people would be able to apply for permission to vent their feelings .
But several would - be demonstrators appear to have been detained by the authorities after trying to apply for that permission .
This is just one way in which China is attempting to restrict embarrassing protests during the Olympic Games .
" The protest application process clearly is n't about giving people greater freedom of expression , but making it easier for the police to suppress it , " said Sophie Richardson , from Human Rights Watch .
One of those detained is Zhang Wei , who was held after applying to stage a protest about her family 's forced eviction from their courtyard home .
Her son , Mi Yu , said she was initially supposed to be held for just three days for " disturbing social order " , but that that had now been extended to 30 days .
Ms Zhang , forced to move to make way for redevelopment in Beijing 's Qianmen district , made several protest applications .
" She went every two or three days after seeing a report about the parks .
But the police did not give their approval , " Mr Mi said .
His mother was taken away last week .
The family have not heard from her since .
Many obstacles
Another activist held after making a protest application was Ji Sizun , who was detained on Monday , according to Human Rights Watch .
The 58 - year - old , from Fujian province , wanted to call for greater participation by ordinary people in the political process .
Citing witnesses , the rights group said Mr Ji was taken away shortly after entering a Beijing police station to ask about his application .
This application process is a taxing one .
Would - be protesters even have to tell police what posters and slogans they intend to use .
There have been reports of others who have been prevented from staging protests in the designated areas .
Some have just had their applications turned down , one was sent back to her home province and yet others have been stopped from travelling to Beijing .
Confusion
The parks designated as protest zones - Shijie , Zizhuyuan and Ritan - do not seem to have been inundated with protesters .
There has been the occasional protest by pro-Tibet campaigners At Shijie ( " World " ) Park on Wednesday one worker said there had not been a single demonstration since the Olympics began .
Potential protesters might have been put off by the police car and van parked directly outside the main entrance of the park , which houses large models of famous world sites .
No one seemed to know where a protest could be held , even if Beijing 's Public Security Bureau gave its approval .
" I do n't know anything about that , " said a ticket collector when asked where protesters could express their opinions .
It was a similar story at Ritan Park , where there seems to have been no protests either .
Dissuading people from protesting is just one tactic being used by China 's security forces to prevent demonstrations .
Beijing 's streets are full of police , other security personnel and volunteers , wearing red armbands , on the lookout for trouble .
Eight pro-Tibet demonstrators from Students for a Free Tibet were quickly detained on Wednesday after staging a protest .
Some well - known Chinese activists have also been told to keep a low profile during the Olympics .
The friend of one said she had decided to leave the city during the Olympics to avoid trouble .

Cheap " nanoantennas " for the win
As the price of oil continues to climb , new energy - collecting technologies are being developed , and they increasingly look more and more attractive .
One of the latest , revealed by Idaho National Laboratory , is an enhanced variety of solar collector , that is so effective , it can even work at night .
The key to it all is nanotechnology .
With this new technology , millions of extremely small twists of metal are molded into banks of " microantennas " , which can be placed on almost any material , including plastic sheets .
These spiral shaped " microantennas " are about 1/25 the width of a human hair .
They are so small that they resonate from the interaction with the sun 's infrared rays .
This resonation can be translated into energy .
During the day , the Earth soaks up a lot of this infrared energy , which is then radiated out at night -- enabling these microantennas to collect power even after the sun has set .
Conventional solar panels can convert about % 20 of what hits them into electricity .
The research team behind this new tech believes they can hit an efficiency rating of about % 80 .
Also , conventional solar panels are expensive to produce because the rely on high - grade silicon , which is becoming increasingly expensive .
These new solar collectors can be manufactured for much less -- the research team aims " to make nanoantenna arrays as cheap as inexpensive carpet . "
But !
It 's not all worked out yet .
A big stumbling block remains .
While these solar collectors are able to collect solar energy , they are currently unable to transmit this energy into usable electricity .
The solar infrared rays hitting the nanoantennas generate a current that has a frequency which oscillates ten thousand billion times a second -- which is far to great of an oscillation that standard electrical appliances can handle .
But the teams working on it : " At this point , these antennas are good at capturing energy , but they 're not very good at converting it , " INL engineer Dale Kotter said , " but we have very promising exploratory research under way . "
On left : A plastic sheet filled with zillions of nanoantennas .
Each square has 260 million nanoantennas on it .

So far , the international economic consequences of the war in the Caucasus have been fairly minor , despite Georgia ’s role as a major corridor for oil shipments .
But as I was reading the latest bad news , I found myself wondering whether this war is an omen  a sign that the second great age of globalization may share the fate of the first .
If you ’re wondering what I ’m talking about , here ’s what you need to know : our grandfathers lived in a world of largely self - sufficient , inward - looking national economies  but our great - great grandfathers lived , as we do , in a world of large - scale international trade and investment , a world destroyed by nationalism .
Writing in 1919 , the great British economist John Maynard Keynes described the world economy as it was on the eve of World War I .
“ The inhabitant of London could order by telephone , sipping his morning tea in bed , the various products of the whole earth ... he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world . ”
And Keynes ’s Londoner “ regarded this state of affairs as normal , certain , and permanent , except in the direction of further improvement ...
The projects and politics of militarism and imperialism , of racial and cultural rivalries , of monopolies , restrictions , and exclusion ... appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life , the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice . ”
Crackdown on short - selling leaves the city 's ' robbers in pinstripes ' facing huge losses
Ruthless
City traders who made millions by sending share prices into freefall were finally the big losers .
The crackdown on ' short - selling ' triggered a record - breaking rise in the FTSE index of Britain 's 100 biggest public companies .
Because the short - selling traders make their money when stocks fall in price , yesterday 's announcement left them with a multi-million - pound bill .
Defiant gambler : Trader Simon ' Knievel ' Cawkwell
They rushed to close down all their deals in a bid to cut their losses before the market rose any further .
Short - selling involves a trader borrowing somebody else 's shares in a company he thinks is going to fall in value .
The trader then sells the shares .
Eventually he must buy the same number and return them to the lender .
If the price has dropped by that time , he makes a profit on the difference .
In order to drive down the price , many short - sellers spread malicious and false rumours to trigger a fall in the share price - and make themselves a fortune .
It is a concept which many people find difficult to understand , as they assume investment only involves buying shares and hoping the price goes up .
Defiant short - seller Simon Cawkwell said the big funds would have lost billions overnight but claimed they would live to fight another day .
The trader - known as Evel Knievel is thought to have made more than £ 750,000 betting this way during the turmoil in recent weeks .
The crackdown , which came into force at midnight on Thursday , stops any trader from ' short - selling ' 29 financial stocks , including those of all the high street banks .
After a week of stock market mayhem , other countries , such as Ireland and Australia , also joined in the crackdown the practice .
In the U.S , the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an emergency order to stop short - selling temporarily .
It is banned in nearly 800 financial stocks in a bid to protect investors from the disastrous share price plunges which short - sellers can trigger .
The market turmoil in the U.S. has sent three of its five major investment banks - Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch - into bankruptcy or forced them into an emergency merger with a rival .
For the next four months , the Financial Service Authority 's ruling means it is illegal to take out or increase a ' short ' position in any one of these companies .
While it is not illegal to continue to ' short ' , such deals must be disclosed by 3.30 pm on Tuesday if they represent more than 0.25 per cent of a company 's portfolio .
The threat of exposure prompted many short - sellers , which include notoriously secretive hedge funds , to close , rather than disclose , their positions .
Final payday : Lehman Brothers ' workers arrive at its London office on Friday to make sure they are paid their last wages following the bank 's collapse
One market expert said it was rather like asking Coca - Cola to give away its secret formula .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said : ' They do n't like the exposure .
They want to remain anonymous so they are closing , not disclosing .
' They thrive in the dark and are totally unaccountable .
' The FSA 's ban on the short selling of bank shares is a death sentence hanging over many hedge funds . '
He predicted the widespread closure of hedge funds , particularly if the City watchdog carries out its threat to include other industries in the temporary ban .
The last laugh : Gordon Brown wants to clean up the City 's dirty practices
Financial experts attacked the FSA 's ruling on short sellers , accusing it of a massive over - reaction .
David Buik , from the brokers BGC Partners , said it is ' totally naive ' to blame them for the collapse in the recent plunge in share prices .
He said : ' It is not the short - sellers ' fault that HBOS , the housebuilders , M&S , Next and others have lost so much value this year .
' It is sentiment which has been negative towards these sectors .
To blame it on short - sellers is totally naive . '
David Rule , chief executive of the International Securities Lending Association , which represents companies which lend shares to other investors , including short - sellers , said the level of short selling was ' pretty modest ' in banks .
' The idea that short - selling was driving down HBOS was frankly far - fetched , ' he insisted .
' There is not real evidence that there was a huge short position in the bank . '
The DHS has disclosed its official policy on laptop border seizures : they can take your laptop , or anything else , for no reason at all , forever , and disclose anything they find to anyone they feel like :
Also , officials may share copies of the laptop 's contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation , data decryption or other reasons , according to the policies , dated July 16 and issued by two DHS agencies , U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" The policies . . . are truly alarming , " said Sen. Russell Feingold ( D - Wis. ) , who is probing the government 's border search practices .
He said he intends to introduce legislation soon that would require reasonable suspicion for border searches , as well as prohibit profiling on race , religion or national origin .
Speech critical of the government , considered undesirable by the authorities , or which might incite “ conflict , ” has increasingly fallen prey to Russia ’s vague anti-extremism law .
Earlier this week , Savva Terentyev , an obscure musician and blogger from Russia ’s northern republic of Komi , became the first individual to be convicted of extremism on the basis of a comment left in a blog .
Terentyev received a one - year suspended sentence for a ranting criticism of the police , in which he , using a rhetorical flourish , called for burning bad cops twice daily in the central square of every Russian city .
The judge ruled that Terentyev had used the media intentionally to incite hatred and hostility , and that he had humiliated policemen as a “ social group . ”
Terentyev ’s comment was by any measure offensive .
However , it was hardly a credible call to violence .
It was appended to someone else ’s blog posting , and was deleted shortly after it was written .
The authorities simply did n’t like Terentyev ’s criticism , so they decided to stretch the law to send a warning to other would - be critics – not even the web can offer refuge , so be careful what you say , we are watching you and we will get you .
Vigorous efforts to combat extremism are understandable in light of the alarming growth in attacks and nationalistic , racist or religious motivated violence in Russia .
Russian authorities , however , have also increasingly used the extremism law ’s vague provisions to stitch together criminal cases against strident and opinionated critics , people venting steam , and the political opposition , on and off - line .
Shutting down critical and unfriendly speech is happening with increased frequency in Russia today .
For the last few years the authorities have tried to close down Ingushetiya.ru , a website affiliated with the political opposition in the small North Caucasus republic of Ingushetia .
In November 2007 , visitors to the site , which was attempting to provide news of a planned protest against human rights abuses , were forwarded to a porn website .
This innovative strategy backfired however , and provoked a wave of indignation directed at the government .
The authorities then chose to take the “ rule of law ” approach .
The prosecutor ’s office alleged that some materials published on Ingushetiya.ru , particularly an interview with an opposition leader sharply critical of the president , included extremist content .
On this basis , in June 2008 , a Moscow court ruled to have the website closed down for disseminating extremist materials .
Ingushetiya.ru is currently appealing this ruling and meanwhile continues to operate .
In other cases , prosecutors have sent warnings about alleged involvement in extremism to newspapers that write about religious and ethnic conflicts .
Government agencies that oversee NGOs have “ audited ” human rights organizations for signs of extremism , and in one case , even issued an official non-extremist certificate to one which passed the dubious test .
Gay rights groups cannot register officially because promoting gay and lesbian rights is viewed as extremism .
One gay rights group was recently called in for an “ audit ” by the organised crime department of the police .
The insidious aim and cumulative effect of these extremism “ audits ” is clear : to keep citizens from speaking out .
Even art is not immune from spurious claims of extremism .
Yuri Samodurov , director of the Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow is being charged with inciting religious hatred for hosting the provocative exhibit “ Forbidden Art - 2006 , ” a compilation of art banned from museums and galleries in Moscow in 2006 .
Visitors to the exhibition had to make a special effort to view it : each piece could be viewed only through a peephole in a curtain with the work ’s title hung in front if it .
The prosecution of Terentyev and others on dubious extremism charges can serve only one purpose : to silence them .
The stifling and pernicious effect of the anti-extremism law and its use against critical bloggers , commentators , and artists is palpable .
As one blogger pointed out during a heated debate in the wake of Terentyev ’s conviction , “ This concerns all of us ! ”
Now that ranting on a blog is considered “ mass communication , ” bloggers are warning that they have got to watch out for themselves .
There is a simple answer if you do n’t like the criticism : stay away from the web , cover your ears , and do n’t go near the curtain .
But criticism of the government or debate about controversial issues is not extremist activity , but rather a normal and vital feature of a plural democratic society .
A responsible government however , will listen to its citizens ’ concerns and criticisms , rather than tell them to shut up .
One day in 1995 , Barack Obama went to see his alderman , an influential politician named Toni Preckwinkle , on Chicago ’s South Side , where politics had been upended by scandal .
Mel Reynolds , a local congressman , was facing charges of sexual assault of a sixteen - year - old campaign volunteer .
( He eventually resigned his seat . )
The looming vacancy set off a fury of ambition and hustle ; several politicians , including a state senator named Alice Palmer , an education expert of modest political skills , prepared to enter the congressional race .
Palmer represented Hyde Park — Obama ’s neighborhood , a racially integrated , liberal sanctuary — and , if she ran for Congress , she would need a replacement in Springfield , the state capital .
Obama at the time was a thirty - three - year - old lawyer , university lecturer , and aspiring office - seeker , and the Palmer seat was what he had in mind when he visited Alderman Preckwinkle .
“ Barack came to me and said , ‘ If Alice decides she wants to run , I want to run for her State Senate seat , ’ ” Preckwinkle told me .
We were in her district office , above a bank on a street of check - cashing shops and vacant lots north of Hyde Park .
Preckwinkle soon became an Obama loyalist , and she stuck with him in a State Senate campaign that strained or ruptured many friendships but was ultimately successful .
Four years later , in 2000 , she backed Obama in a doomed congressional campaign against a local icon , the former Black Panther Bobby Rush .
And in 2004 Preckwinkle supported Obama during his improbable , successful run for the United States Senate .
So it was startling to learn that Toni Preckwinkle had become disenchanted with Barack Obama .
Preckwinkle is a tall , commanding woman with a clipped gray Afro .
She has represented her slice of the South Side for seventeen years and expresses no interest in higher office .
On Chicago ’s City Council , she is often a dissenter against the wishes of Mayor Richard M. Daley .
For anyone trying to understand Obama ’s breathtakingly rapid political ascent , Preckwinkle is an indispensable witness — a close observer , friend , and confidante during a period of Obama ’s life to which he rarely calls attention .
Although many of Obama ’s recent supporters have been surprised by signs of political opportunism , Preckwinkle was n’t .
“ I think he was very strategic in his choice of friends and mentors , ” she told me .
“ I spent ten years of my adult life working to be alderman .
I finally got elected .
This is a job I love .
And I ’m perfectly happy with it .
I ’m not sure that ’s the way that he approached his public life — that he was going to try for a job and stay there for one period of time .
In retrospect , I think he saw the positions he held as stepping stones to other things and therefore approached his public life differently than other people might have . ”
On issue after issue , Preckwinkle presented Obama as someone who thrived in the world of Chicago politics .
She suggested that Obama joined Jeremiah Wright ’s Trinity United Church of Christ for political reasons .
“ It ’s a church that would provide you with lots of social connections and prominent parishioners , ” she said .
“ It ’s a good place for a politician to be a member . ”
Preckwinkle was unsparing on the subject of the Chicago real - estate developer Antoin ( Tony ) Rezko , a friend of Obama ’s and one of his top fund - raisers , who was recently convicted of fraud , bribery , and money laundering : “ Who you take money from is a reflection of your knowledge at the time and your principles . ”
As we talked , it became increasingly clear that loyalty was the issue that drove Preckwinkle ’s current view of her onetime protégé .
“ I do n’t think you should forget who your friends are , ” she said .
Others told me that Preckwinkle ’s grievances against Obama included specific complaints , such as his refusal to endorse a former aide and longtime friend , Will Burns , in a State Senate primary — a contest that Burns won anyway .
There was also a more general belief that , after Obama won the 2004 United States Senate primary , he ignored his South Side base .
Preckwinkle said , “ My view is you have to bring your constituency along with you .
Granted , you have to make some tough decisions .
Granted , sometimes you have to make decisions that people wo n’t understand or like .
But it ’s your obligation to explain yourself and try to do your supporters the courtesy of treating them with respect . ”
Ivory Mitchell , who for twenty years has been the chairman of the local ward organization in Obama ’s neighborhood — considered the most important Democratic organization on the South Side — was one of Obama ’s earliest backers .
Today , he says , “ All the work we did to help him get where he finally ended up , he did n’t seem too appreciative . ”
A year ago , Mitchell became a delegate for Hillary Clinton .
The same month Mitchell endorsed Clinton , the Obama campaign reached out to Preckwinkle , and eventually she signed on as an Obama delegate .
I asked her if what she considered slights or betrayals were simply the necessary accommodations and maneuvering of a politician making a lightning transition from Hyde Park legislator to Presidential nominee .
“ Can you get where he is and maintain your personal integrity ? ” she said .
“ Is that the question ? ” She stared at me and grimaced .
“ I ’m going to pass on that . ”
“ Who Sent You ? ”
Obama likes to discuss his unusual childhood — his abandonment by his father and his upbringing by a sometimes single mother and his grandparents in Indonesia and Hawaii — and the three years in the nineteen - eighties when he worked as a community organizer in Chicago , periods of his life chronicled at length in his first memoir , “ Dreams from My Father . ”
He occasionally refers to his time in the United States Senate , which he wrote about in his second memoir , “ The Audacity of Hope . ”
But his life in Chicago from 1991 until his victorious Senate campaign is a lacuna in his autobiography .
It is also the period that formed him as a politician .
Some Obama supporters professed shock when , recently , he abandoned a pledge to stay within the public campaign - finance system if the presumptive Republican nominee , Senator John McCain , agreed to do the same .
Preckwinkle ’s concern about Obama — that he is a pure political animal — suddenly became more widespread ; commentators abruptly stopped using the words “ callow ” and “ naïve . ”
Chicago is not Obama ’s home town , but it ’s where he chose to forge his identity .
Several weeks ago , he moved many of the Democratic National Committee ’s operations from Washington to Chicago , making the city the unofficial capital of the Democratic Party ; his campaign headquarters are in an office building in the Loop , Chicago ’s downtown business district .
But Chicago , with its reputation as a center of vicious and corrupt politics , may also be the place that Obama needs to leave behind .
Simply moving there , as he did after graduating from Harvard Law School , was a bold decision .
Chicago , where the late mayor Richard J. Daley and his son , the current mayor , have governed for forty out of the past fifty - three years , is not hospitable to political carpetbaggers .
Abner Mikva , who was a congressman from Hyde Park and later the chief judge on the Washington , D.C. , Circuit Court , was one of the first Chicago politicians to successfully challenge the Daley machine , and it took him years to overcome people ’s skepticism about his Wisconsin roots .
Mikva , who is now eighty - two , tried to recruit Obama to work for him in Washington as a law clerk .
Obama turned him down , replying that he was returning to Chicago to run for office .
“ I thought , Boy , does he got something to learn , ” Mikva told me recently .
“ You just do n’t come to Chicago and plant your flag . ”
I met Mikva at the Cliff Dwellers , a private dining club atop a downtown office building .
As we looked out over Lake Michigan , he told me a story that has often been repeated by others to capture the essence of politics in the city .
“ When I first came to Chicago , Adlai Stevenson and Paul Douglas were running for governor and senator , ” he said .
“ I had heard about the closed Party , closed machine , but they sounded like such great candidates , so I stopped in to volunteer in the Eighth Ward Regular Democratic headquarters .
I said , ‘ I ’m here for Douglas and Stevenson . ’
The ward boss came in and pulled the cigar out of his mouth and said , ‘ Who sent you ? ’
And I said , ‘ Nobody sent me . ’
He put the cigar back in his mouth and said , ‘ We do n’t want nobody nobody sent . ’ ”
There was another tradition in Chicago politics , the so - called Independents , which grew up in opposition to Richard J. Daley — Boss Daley — whose reign lasted from 1955 to 1976 .
Anchored in Hyde Park and nurtured by the University of Chicago community , the Independents brought together African - Americans and white liberals in coalitions that became the city ’s main alternative to the Democratic machine .
The Independents arose after the Second World War to challenge the closed patronage system that controlled the city , and became a serious political force in the mid-nineteen - fifties .
Their numbers increased with a new wave of black activists energized by Martin Luther King , Jr. , ’s Chicago organizing in 1966 , and with white liberals outraged when antiwar protesters were beaten and teargassed by Chicago police during the Democratic National Convention in 1968 .
Mayor Daley died in office in 1976 , at the age of seventy - four .
He was replaced by a reliable and ineffectual machine candidate , Michael Bilandic , whose appointment marked the beginning of twelve years of chaotic , balkanized politics , sometimes called the “ inter - Daley period . ”
David Axelrod , who has been Obama ’s chief strategist since 2002 and is the foremost political consultant in Chicago , was a witness to all of it , first as a political reporter for the Chicago Tribune and later as the chief consultant to two mayors : Harold Washington , Chicago ’s first black mayor and a hero of the Independents , and the current Mayor Daley , whose last name still carries negative connotations in the precincts of Hyde Park .
Axelrod , who is fifty - three , is by nature subdued .
He wears a mustache that curls down the sides of his upper lip in a permanent expression of melancholy .
We met in a Houlihan ’s , off the lobby of the building that houses the Obama campaign headquarters .
Axelrod recalled the election , in 1979 , of Jane Byrne , Chicago ’s first female mayor , which he wrote about for the Tribune .
Byrne ’s campaign , assisted by snowstorms that shut down the city and showcased Bilandic ’s incompetence , was the first successful insurgency in modern Chicago history .
“ It was a great reform campaign , ” Axelrod said .
“ I then chronicled , for the next four years , her systematic abrogation of every commitment she had made to reform .
She became sort of a parody of a machine mayor . ”
In office , Byrne aligned herself with City Council officials who were hostile to the city ’s black leadership , pandered to the voters of the most racist wards of the city , and purged African - Americans from key positions .
On the South Side , there was a backlash ; Washington , who had run a spirited campaign for mayor in 1977 , was elected to Congress in 1980 .
In 1983 , he was essentially drafted by a Hyde Park - based coalition desperate to unseat the disappointing Byrne .
Washington won a three - way primary , with thirty - six per cent of the vote , and went on in the general election to defeat a white Republican who ran , briefly , on the implicitly racist slogan “ Before it ’s too late . ”
Washington ’s first term was dominated by warfare with a City Council controlled by white aldermen determined to stymie every proposal .
But in 1986 he took control of the council and the following year was reëlected .
Seven months after his victory , he collapsed at his desk , dead of a heart attack at the age of sixty - five .
Axelrod saw much of this history from the inside , as Washington ’s strategist ; Obama saw it from the perspective of an organizer who occasionally had brushes with the powerful at political events or meetings at City Hall .
“ He saw the jagged edges of Chicago politics and urban politics pretty close up , ” Axelrod said .
Obama spent three years in the city , from 1985 , after he graduated from Columbia University , to the end of the Washington era .
As a community organizer , he tried to turn a partnership of churches into a political force on the South Side .
But the work accomplished very little .
“ When I started organizing , I understood the idea of social change in a very abstract way , ” Obama told me last year .
“ It was to some extent informed by my years in Indonesia , seeing extreme poverty and disparities of wealth and understanding sort of in a dim way that life was n’t fair and government had something to do with it .
I understood the role that issues like race played and took inspiration from the civil - rights movement and what the student sit-ins had accomplished and the freedom rides .
“ But I did n’t come out of a political family , did n’t have a history of activism in my family .
So I understood these things in the abstract .
When I went to Chicago , it was the first time that I had the opportunity to test out my ideas .
And for the most part I would say I was n’t wildly successful .
The victories that we achieved were extraordinarily modest : you know , getting a job - training site set up or getting an after - school program for young people put in place . ”
Constructing A Network
In 1988 , Obama left for Harvard Law School , returning to Chicago twice for summer stints at élite law firms , including , after his first year , Sidley Austin .
( Sidley Austin is where he met Michelle Robinson , whom he married in 1992 . )
He returned to Chicago permanently when he graduated , in 1991 .
In a short period , he built a notable résumé and a network of connections .
During the 1992 Presidential campaign , he ran a voter - registration drive that placed him at the center of the city ’s politics .
That year , Illinois elected the first African - American woman to the U.S. Senate , Carol Moseley Braun , and Bill Clinton became the first Democratic Presidential candidate to carry Illinois since Lyndon Johnson , in 1964 .
Meanwhile , Obama practiced civil - rights law at a firm admired in the city ’s progressive circles , and became a popular lecturer in the law school at the University of Chicago .
He was on the board of two liberal foundations that spread grant money around Chicago , and he settled in Hyde Park .
It was a neighborhood in transition when Obama arrived .
The Hyde Park Herald serves as a sort of time capsule .
It reported that crime was rising ; a series of violent robberies was another reminder that Hyde Park existed as a middle - class island in a sea of high - crime urban poverty .
New data showed that white enrollment was steeply declining at one local school .
During the Martin Luther King , Jr. , celebrations , the newspaper noted in passing that Jeremiah Wright was scheduled to give a speech at the University of Chicago .
Considerable coverage was given to two institutions : the local food co-op , where Obama shopped every Saturday , and the Independent Voters of Illinois–Independent Precinct Organization , or I.V.I. - I.P.O. , one of the neighborhood ’s most influential political groups .
There was a new political force in Hyde Park as well .
Real - estate developers were swooping in to rehabilitate low - income housing .
On more than one occasion , the Hyde Park Herald reported on the rise in campaign donations from these developers to South Side politicians ; in 1995 , it ran a front - page article about Tony Rezko , who was then a very active new donor on the scene .
While it ’s true that nobody sent Obama in the sense that Abner Mikva meant it , one of Obama ’s underappreciated assets , as he looked for a political race in the early nineties , was the web of connections that he had established .
“ He understands how you network , ” Mikva said .
“ I remember our first few meetings .
He would say , ‘ Do you know So-and - So ? ’
And I ’d say yes .
‘ How well do you know him ?
I ’d really like to meet him . ’
I would set up some lunches . ”
The 1992 voter - registration drive , Project Vote , introduced him to much of the city ’s black leadership .
“ If you want to look at the means of ascent , if you will , look at Project Vote , ” Will Burns , the former Obama aide , said .
In Chicago progressive circles , Burns , who is thirty - four , is described as an up - and - coming African - American legislator in the Obama tradition .
Obama ’s refusal to endorse Burns in his primary earlier this year infuriated and mystified a number of Chicago Democrats , though Burns himself displays no bitterness and is now an adviser to the Obama campaign .
At Project Vote , Burns said , Obama “ was making connections at the grassroots level and was working with elected officials .
That ’s when he first got a scan of the broader black political infrastructure . ”
It was also the beginning of a dynamic that stood out in Obama ’s early career : his uneasy relationship with an older generation of black Chicago politicians .
Project Vote “ is where a lot of the divisional rivalries popped up , ” Burns said .
In this early foray into politics , Obama revealed the toughness and brashness that this year ’s long primary season brought into view .
As Burns , who has a mischievous sense of humor and a gift for mimicry , recalled , “ Black activists , community folks , felt that he did n’t respect their role ” — Burns imitated a self - righteous activist — “ in the struggle and the movement .
He did n’t engage in obeisance to them .
He wanted to get the job done .
And Barack ’s cheap , too .
If you ca n’t do it and do it in a cost - effective manner , you ’re not going to work with him . ”
Ivory Mitchell , the ward chairman in Obama ’s neighborhood , says of Obama that “ he was typical of what most aspiring politicians are : self - centered — that ‘ I can do anything and I ’m willing to do it overnight . ’ ”
During Project Vote , Obama also began to understand the larger world of Chicago ’s liberal fund - raisers .
“ He met people not just in the African - American community but in the progressive white community , ” David Axelrod said .
“ The folks who funded Project Vote were some of the key progressive leaders . ”
Obama met Axelrod through one of Project Vote ’s supporters , Bettylu Saltzman , whose father , Philip M. Klutznick , was a Chicago shopping - mall tycoon , a part owner of the Bulls , and a former Commerce Secretary in the Carter Administration .
Saltzman , a soft - spoken activist who worked for Senators Adlai E. Stevenson III and Paul Simon , took an immediate interest in Obama .
“ I honestly do n’t remember what it was about him , but I was absolutely blown away , ” Saltzman says .
“ I said to several people that this guy , who is now thirty years old , is someday going to be President .
He will be our first black President . ”

A wealth of new research findings continue to underscore the wonders of resveratrol , the compound discovered only a few years ago that has already achieved superstar status .
Found predominately in red wine , grapes and peanuts , resveratrol is now showing to significantly impact the aging process , regulate for positive cardiovascular function , and protect against and reverse cancer .
Researchers at Zhejiang University in China investigated the effect of injections of resveratrol on the central regulation of blood pressure , heart rate , and renal sympathetic nerve activity in animals .
Their results suggest that resveratrol powerfully inhibits blood pressure , heart rate , and renal sympathetic nerve activity .
This study has tremendous implications for anti-aging therapies .
In the July 26 , 2008 , researchers addressed the question of the potential chemo - preventative activity of resveratrol against human cancers and its effect on normal cells .
They examined the differential effect of resveratrol at physiologically relevant concentrations on nonmalignant and malignant cell lines and compared the underlying mechanisms via cell cycle modulation , induction of cell death , and potential toxicity .
They found that 24 hours of exposure to resveratrol was toxic to both nonmalignant and malignant cells in a dose dependent manner .
However , nonmalignant cells re-grew 5 times more than malignant cells after 120 hours .
Significant alterations in cell cycle kinetics were induced by resveratrol in the malignant cells , but to a lesser extent for the nonmalignant cells .
The proportion of cell death was 3 times higher in malignant cells compared to nonmalignant cells .
This research confirms that resveratrol produces a selective action that is able to target malignant cells for destruction while allowing nonmalignant cells to modulate its effect .
It is just this type of malignant cell action that chemotherapy aims to achieve .
However , the effects of chemotherapy are also toxic to healthy cells . , July 26 , 2008 reports a search for compounds capable of protecting cells against deoxycholate , a bile salt that harms cells and causes disease .
In colon epithelial cells , deoxycholate increased generation of reactive oxygen species and caused DNA damage and cell death .
Resveratrol and also quercetin were each able to largely prevent the occurrence of cell death in cells exposed to deoxycholate .
These findings suggest that resveratrol may be able to undo cellular damage that leads to colon cancer .
The July 9 , 2008 reports researchers finding that resveratrol is able to mimic the effects of rigorous calorie restriction in several cytoskeletal maintenance and multiple stress response pathways .
This effect is achieved by control of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover , critical factors in the maintenance of energy production , the prevention of endogenous oxidative stress , and the promotion of healthy aging .
Previous research has revealed the healthy benefits associated with daily caloric restriction of between 30 and 50 percent below what is considered today as average .
These benefits also occur as the result of fasting .
Such diets have been linked to reduction in the risk of age associated diseases and stress , along with a slowing of age related functional decline .
In a previous study , this research team found that consuming resveratrol improved the health and survival of obese mice , even while they continued to consume a high calorie diet .
Resveratrol showed to have the same positive effect on the livers , muscles , hearts and bones as calorie restriction .
Resveratrol has also been shown to extend the lives of yeast , worms , flies and fish .
In another study at Zhejiang University in China researchers investigated the effects of resveratrol on adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) - induced platelet aggregation .
Compared with the control group , resveratrol inhibited ADP - induced platelet aggregation and fibrinogen in a dose dependent manner .
The accumulation of platelets can form clots which may result in heart attack by lodging in an artery and restricting blood flow to the heart or brain .
Resveratrol 's most abundant source is the grapes used to make red wine , with the highest concentrations being found in the skins .
Red wine contains approximately 160 micrograms per fluid ounce .
Significant amounts of resveratrol are also found in peanut kernels , with one ounce of peanuts containing about 73 micrograms , the amount also contained in 6 cups of red grapes .
It is a component of Ko-jo - kon , an oriental medicine used to treat diseases of the circulatory system , heart and liver .
Since wine is the most notable dietary source , it is the primary object of speculation and research on resveratrol , although wine contains many other compounds with biologic effects .
Resveratrol 's properties as an antioxidant and anti-cancer agent are rapidly becoming documented , and it is sometimes referred to as an explanation for the " French Paradox " , the low incidence of heart disease in the French population who eat a relatively high fat diet .
In grape and peanuts plants , resveratrol 's role is antibiotic and part of the defense system .
Results from various research studies have shown resveratrol to be protective against the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in the blood .
It is this oxidation of LDL that initiates the deposition of cholesterol in the walls of the arteries that can lead to heart attack .
Its hydrophilic and lipophilic properties can provide more effective protection than other well - known antioxidants , such as vitamins C and E. Research at the University of Illinois in Chicago using resveratrol extracted from grapes found that the threat of cancer was reduced in animals when the compound was used to stop the growth of damaged cells .
Had these damaged cells been left to grow , they would have become out of control , resulting in cancer .
The Peanut Institute has concluded that the finding of resveratrol in peanuts may support epidemiological studies from Loma Linda University , Harvard School of Public Health and University of Minnesota that show peanuts may reduce the risk of heart disease by more than half when eaten frequently in small amounts .
Research on resveratrol is just beginning to reveal its array of health benefits , and many extracts of resveratrol are appearing on the market that make adding it to your diet very easy .
Probably the best choice is to add a glass of red wine or peanuts to your diet .
Both red wine and peanuts have been proven to provide very significant overall health benefits .
The consumption of red wine is an integral part of the Mediterranean diet , found to be extraordinarily health promoting .
It is in red wine and peanuts that resveratrol is found in nature , suggesting that this is how nature intended for us to consume it .
When any compound is part of a whole food , it is a part of a complex of balanced compounds that give it an integrity not found when it appears as an isolated extract .

A white boat about the size of a Cadillac labors out of the shadows beneath the 17th Street Causeway just south of Fort Lauderdale .
The tiny vessel — flying the French national flag — crawls across the Intracoastal toward a small cement pier .
As the craft coasts in , the man at the helm leaps to the dock .
He 's slight , with glasses , a head of dark curls , and a thin beard .
His polo shirt , once light green , is gray from sweat .
He ties his boat to a rusty hook and mumbles in French .
Jean - Gabriel Chelala , a 27 - year - old engineer and freelance journalist , is arriving from a journey that began months ago , on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean .
It would n't be a remarkable feat , except that his ride has no engine or sails .
It does n't even have oars .
Chelala made the daunting 5,000 - mile journey in a pedal boat .
He left Lagos , in southern Portugal , March 7 .
He pedaled alone for 107 days , eating military - style dehydrated meals and fish from the ocean , sleeping on a six - foot mattress in the small cabin , braving hurricane season and all manner of sea creature .
Info Frenchman pedals around world
After leaving Portugal , Chelala headed to Morocco and then west to the Canary Islands .
Next , following the route used by Columbus more than 500 years ago , across the deep blue wonder of the open ocean , to Saint Martin .
Then it was around Puerto Rico and into South Florida .
Chelala averaged about two knots , pedaling for as many as 20 hours a day into strong winds .
At one point , he says , he went more than two months without human contact .
But the journey from Portugal to Florida is just the second leg of a trip Chelala has been planning for more than two years .
He 's aiming to be the first person to circumnavigate the globe using only human power , he says .
It began in January , when he biked from his native Paris to Lagos .
From Florida he plans to pedal across North America to the eastern tip of Alaska .
There he 'll get back into the pedal boat ( which will be transported by truck ) to cross the Bering Strait and then hop back on a bicycle to ride across Siberia and Europe , all the way back to rance .
" I want to prove that we can do anything we want with just the power of humans , " he says .
Waiting for him on shore in Fort Lauderdale is his father , Jean - Marie Chelala , who has n't seen his son since he departed Portugal .
Dad tells him to pose for the camera .
Chelala introduces himself to the handful of strangers gathered on the dock for his arrival : fans who 've followed the trip on his blog , representatives from the local Rotary Club , a reporter , a photographer , and a few marina employees .
Designed by Guy Saillard , a French naval architect who specializes in building boats for extreme adventures , Cyclomer is 25 feet long and five feet wide , with a single chair in the middle .
Solar panels line the sides .
Beneath the front of the vessel , in the bow , Chelala keeps a desalinator ( " it makes the water taste like plastic , " he says with a smooth French accent ) , some electronics , and his garbage .
In the cabin , at the stern , he has a small gas - powered hot plate , a bed , a GPS , and radio equipment .
The pedals are attached to a propeller beneath the hull , and Chelala steers with a wheel on the starboard side .
The whole thing cost him 100,000 euros , more than $ 165,000 .
Ron Yentz , a manager at the marina , invites Chelala and his father inside for lunch .
Chelala takes a seat at a table overlooking the water .
What he 's been craving most during his time at sea , he says , is " a very , very cold Coke , with lots of ice — it gets very hot in the middle of the ocean . "
Asked how he feels about his son's daring trip , Jean - Marie beams .
" I have three words : very , very proud . "
So far , the most difficult aspect of the trip for Chelala has been the solitude .
" It gets lonely , " he says .
" I miss my family .
I miss being around people .
You realize how much you need to talk to someone , anyone . "
But loneliness was far from his only challenge .
Just 20 miles off the coast of the Canary Islands , as he slept in the cabin , something large and powerful struck the bottom of the boat , lifting it out of the water and jarring him awake .
When Chelala began pedaling the next morning , the steering did n't respond .
He put on goggles , jumped into the water , and went down to examine the underside of the boat .
" When I put my hand down to feel the rudder , " he says , " I had a , a — how do you say ? — a heart attack . "
The large fin beneath the boat that helps steer was completely gone .
He says he took the boat back to shore by pedaling , jumping out , pushing it in the right direction , and then jumping back on .
" I think it must have been a large whale , " he says .
Within a week , though , he had a new rudder and a renewed passion to pump his calves across the current .
Early in the cross-Atlantic journey , four small fish began following his boat .
Soon he was talking to them , naming the quartet : Andy , Charlie , Bobby , and Teddy .
" They thought I was the mother , " he says .
They were small when he first saw them , but as the weeks passed , he says , they grew to three times their original size .
Every person at the dock eventually gets around to asking Chelala the obvious question :
Why do you want to pedal around the world ?
Big business has been accused of misleading children by producing educational materials for schools about pupils ' diets which experts say are wrong and likely to encourage poor eating habits .
Questionable claims include advice to children to eat three portions of dairy products each day , to avoid refilling their water bottle from the tap , and not to eat less food if they want to lose weight while also being physically active .
In other leaflets , study aids and teaching packs , pupils are told to eat six slices of bread a day , that eating cheese ' will soon have you a lot healthier ' and that soft drinks are carbohydrates , the same food type as rice , pasta and bread .
The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) , Britain 's food watchdog , the Department of Health and the body that represents the country 's 6,000 dieticians have dismissed some or many of the statements as highly selective , misleading and not based on independent evidence .
Richard Watts of the Children 's Food Campaign ( CFC ) , an alliance of health , education and children 's organisations , which is assembling a dossier to send to the government , said the organisations had acted shamefully .
' These claims are wrong , misleading , taken out of context or blatant marketing , and are n't backed up by scientific advice .
It 's bad nutritional advice , which could give children wrong ideas about food at a very impressionable time in their lives and could also get them into some bad dietary habits . '
Organisations such as the baker Warburtons and bodies including the Dairy Council , the British Soft Drinks Association and the Food and Drink Federation collated the material .
A Dairy Council leaflet for seven- to 11 - year - olds promotes eating three dairy portions a day .
It says : ' You need most calcium when you are a teenager - three to four servings of milk , yoghurt or cheese will help ensure that teenagers get all the calcium they need .
' Three servings of milk , yogurt or cheese every day will provide most people with just about all the calcium their body needs . '
But the FSA disagreed .
It advises eating dairy products but not any specific amount .
The European Food Safety Agency , which advises the EU , has rejected the idea that eating three dairy portions a day is beneficial , stating : ' A cause - and - effect relationship is not established between the consumption of dairy foods and a healthy body weight in children and adolescents . '
Dr Alice Cotter , the Dairy Council 's senior nutrition scientist , insisted that the recommendation had been ' created ' using nutrient intake information produced by the Department of Health .
The FSA disagreed with most of the claims and said they were not in line with its recommendations .
It said pupils should continue refilling water bottles with tap water , despite the British Soft Drinks Association producing a ' Drinks Detective ' graphic which says that it is ' unsafe ' and ' can lead to contamination ' .
Liz Bastone , the association 's spokeswoman , said : ' We advise that soft drinks bottles should be recycled after use rather than refilled ... [ they ] are not intended to be reused .
If bottles are not washed properly , they can become a source of bacterial infection . '
The National Union of Teachers and the National Heart Forum are among those claiming that the government 's guidelines to schools on how to manage such links with business are too lax .
' We are concerned that children are not exploited or misled by marketing of food products which make claims that are at best ambiguous or open to interpretation , ' said Christine Blower , the union 's acting general secretary .
• This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008 .
We have clarified some points in the first two paragraphs .
DIGG THIS
It is useful at this point to step back for a moment and think about the meaning of the past several weeks ’ financial crises .
The government has been bailing out banks , a large insurance company , investment banks , overseas central banks , and money market funds .
The amounts of money involved are stupendous .
The government ’s bailout is our bailout .
Every last cent of the cost will be borne by Americans who pay taxes .
The government ’s actions indict government itself .
We are seeing the failures within our system of government showing up as failures in the banking and financial system .
These are not failures of free markets or free enterprise or free banking .
We do not have free markets or free enterprise or free banking , and we have n’t had them for a very long time .
This is a time to look at matters carefully and decide :
Do you favor free markets or do you favor the State ?
Do you think that these failures are failures of the free market or do you think they are failures of the State ?
The same questions arose when the Great Depression occurred .
The government blamed that on speculators , on the stock market crash , on greed , on over - consumption , on under - consumption , on sticky prices and wages , etc .
But the real causes of the Great Depression and the real failures owed to government .
The government created the Federal Reserve system , and it was the Fed that created the deflation .
The government regulated banks and supported unit ( isolated ) banks , and it was these isolated banks that failed in the thousands .
It was the government that raised taxes and tariffs and choked off economic activity .
Then , having begun the depression , it was the New Deal that prolonged it .
It was the New Deal that over - regulated and cartelized the economy .
It was the New Deal that started up a new devaluation of the dollar .
This is a time to look carefully and choose up sides : free markets or the State ?
There is no in between .
Freedom vs. slavery .
Which is it ?
A free market is not a lawless market .
It is governed by natural law and judges and juries administering that law .
It is governed by agreements that merchants make among themselves , and judges and juries that handle disputes that arise .
It is governed by the consumer who has the say - so of whether or not to buy a product or service .
Liability is assigned to those who are responsible .
Losses , when they occur , are borne by those who are responsible .
They are not spread to taxpayers by edict or force .
A free market is not chaos .
It has governance , but it does not stem from the variable and fickle authority of legislators who take bribes and lobbyist money .
It stems from jurists who follow a body of jurisprudential principles .
A free market is definitely not a State - regulated and State - controlled market .
Once the State starts legislating markets , the consumer ’s say - so disappears .
Merchant agreements become targets for anti-trust .
Product innovation deteriorates .
Once the State starts legislating markets , the weak sisters petition the State to halt the successful companies in their tracks .
When the EU fines Microsoft an unbelievable amount of money and diddles around with the details of what Microsoft may or may not include in its operating system , there is no free market any longer .
Once the State gets into the act , it plays favorites .
Some businesses that have losses are bailed out .
The business does not pay the price of its errors .
The losses are shifted to taxpayers .
That is what is happening today .
This is the opposite of a free market .
When we have a central bank that controls the amount of high - powered money in the economy and when such a bank can bail out at its own discretion whatever financial institutions it pleases and in whatever amounts it pleases , we definitely do not have a free market in money or banking .
When bank deposits are insured , we have no free market in banking .
When we have government - sponsored enterprises with direct lines of credit to the U.S.
Treasury that buy mortgages , we do not have a free market in banking or mortgage lending or housing .
Free enterprise means that losses are borne by those responsible for them .
When the U.S. government plays favorites and bails out the institutions with losses that it selects , there is no free market .
In sum , government forces wealth transfers by uncalled for violence , whereas persons exchange goods and services without such violence in a free market .
The one is criminal in nature , the other peaceful .
The one makes slaves of persons , the other respects their liberty .
Too many of us hold to a middle - of the - road wishy - washy position .
Some of us are nave and misguided .
There are also many who want to support government anyway and are anti-free market .
They typically choose one instance where the State deregulated .
Ah - hah , they say , look at how badly the industry performed thereafter !
They completely overlook that the government ’s basic regulatory framework is still in place , and that piecemeal deregulation often acts perversely .
It makes no sense whatever , for example , to deregulate banks and allow them to engage in gross speculations while at the same time insuring their deposits .
The Fed has been in bed with investment bankers who also act as government bond dealers and distribute the government ’s bonds .
This elite group has always used high leverage in its operations because the Fed supported the market during bond issues .
After bailing out a hedge fund like Long Term Capital Management , is it any wonder that these investment bankers have used excessive financial leverage in many of their speculations ?
None of this is what a free market is .
The State is out of the picture altogether in a free market .
The free market does not need the State to exist , as some think and claim .
The State kills the free market .
They are opposites .
One must choose .
Are you pro-free market ?
Then you must be anti-State regulation of free markets .
Once a State regulates a free market , that is no longer a free market .
The New Deal in the 1930s is usually chosen as one clear time period when free enterprise went by the boards .
One can find others .
But certainly , since the 1930s the movement away from free enterprise and toward big government is unmistakable .
No one on any side of the political spectrum can deny that .
The State has taken it upon itself to govern and regulate industry after industry .
Its regulation of banking goes back nearly to the founding of the U.S.A .
The First and Second Banks of the United States came in the late 1700s and early 1800s .
The National Bank system came in the mid and late 1800s .
The Federal Reserve System came in 1913 .
Central banks are always in bed with States .
This is a marriage made in Hell .
Control of money and finance is absolutely essential to a State .
The Bank of England was begun in 1694 explicitly to support the government .
In the U.S. case , that control is one of several key props that hold up the Empire and the ability of the State to wage incessant warfare .
Another main prop is the efficient tax - collecting system .
The tax system and the money system work together .
Bonds cannot be issued unless there are tax revenues to pay the interest on the bonds .
Behind the tax revenues are the basically decent and hard - working American people .
They are being taken for a ride .
There are many more props , but I will stop here .
I am at a loss to know what term to use to describe this octopus of the State ’s control over finance and industry .
Call it socialism , or fascism , or communism , or democracy , or democratic socialism , or regulatory socialism , or statism , or authoritarianism , or collectivism , or centralization , or nationalism .
The failures we are seeing right now are failures of all of these ideas , every last one of them .
None of them work .
They all are the antithesis of free markets , which is the only institutional framework that does work in conjunction with appropriate arrangements to maintain natural law , to assign liability to those who damage others , and to uphold legitimate agreements .
In functional terms , what we have now is authoritarian centralization .
This system is mistakenly supported by the nationalistic sentiment of a good many Americans .
The national government is held in a regard that it totally fails to deserve .
It has successfully shifted the blame for its own failures to business enterprise .
It blames Americans for its own faults .
The two presidential candidates blame the greed of Americans for the current debacle .
This is a Big Lie , one of the Biggest .
The same Lie has been used in the past to blame oil companies for high oil prices .
Politicians are inveterate liars because their lies are believed .
They are also in many cases economic and financial illiterates , although they know enough to line their own pockets .
Love of country should never be confused with love and support of national government .
The national government ’s modus operandi is to centralize decision - making and to impose it by law .
It does this in areas where there is not the slightest justification for it .
Money and banking is one such area .
The government ’s control over money and banking , essential to its own growth and survival , has now failed so badly that the debacle is making daily headlines .
Authoritarian centralized decision - making and control is doomed to failure .
The big guys do n’t know what they are doing .
They are full of hot air .
They are con-men .
They are fakes .
They are out for themselves .
They could care less about you and me .
They have the power , and they will use that power to paper over their failures .
They will use their power to print money and make loans to cover over the failures of the State - controlled money and banking system that America is saddled with .
This is why it is a time to get off the fence and choose .
Do you favor free markets and its methods of governance , or do you favor the State and its authoritarian centralized government ?

Presidential Polls Over Time
By LEE BYRON , CHRIS BARNES AND HENRY CORRIGAN -GIBBS
November 2 , 2008
See how John McCain and Barack Obama compare in state and national polls that asked people which candidate they would vote for in the presidential race .
More details on The Times 's polling standards »
This , two weeks after he said that Spain was in Latin America .
Here ’s the video ( below ) from McCain ’s economic forum that just took place today – Ben Smith has the transcript :
McCain , talking about energy policy , stresses the importance of “ ensuring that America is secure , and not dependent on oil from people like Hugo Chavez or other parts of the Middle East which is , we know , could be destabilized under certain sets of circumstances . ”
Hugo Chavez is the leader of Venezuela , a country located in South America .

You .
Your friends and family .
Your classmates and coworkers .
In the brave new world of the internet , everybody has power .
Information is interactive , knowledge is collaborative and history is open source .
The nerdy kid next door has just as much influence as a high school teacher ; the dorky dude at the comic book shop has just as much voice as a college professor .
Problem is , the nerds and dorks tend to have a lot more free time - and passion - than the teachers and professors .
The end result ?
A hilariously skewed , terrifyingly twisted view of the world in which all the wrong things are deemed " important " and worthy of serious academic discussion .
Here are 15 mind - boggling examples .
See what we mean ?
When thedeadliest , costliest warin the history of mankind has been trumped bya videogame franchiseabout that war , you know something 's off .
One involved over 50 countries and took over 70 million lives ; the other involves button mashing and tea bagging .
On an encouraging note , we did have to add all the Call of Duty games ' individual pages together to reach the crazy number above .
On a discouraging note , we did n't have to add Call of Duty 4 and its non-WWII setting , which would have brought the total word count to an even crazier 18,927 .
Oh , and on a simply ridiculous note ?
Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfarebeats " modern warfare " ... 5,858 to 2,873 .
Also less important than Call of Duty !
• American Revolutionary War= 8,078
• American Civil War= 11,729

While the magic menagerie of super - powered , frilly - maned , sparkly - eyed , rosy - cheeked wonder beasts might make for slightly more exciting cards than a Three of Spades , the emphasis here is still extremely wonky .
Pokerhas been around for longer than anyone can remember ... the Pokemon Trading Card Gamewas invented in 1996 .
Poker has created millionaires and forced bankruptcy ... the Pokemon Trading Card Game might have resulted in some lost lunch money and a temper tantrum or two .
Also less important than Pokemon Trading Cards !
• Baseball cards = 4,686
• Blackjack= 5,228
• Roulette= 5,492
• Checkers= 2,326

Before you get the wrong impression , no , the Master Chiefdoes not win in a Wikipedia matchup againstGeorge W. Bush ... though his approval ratings are undoubtedly higher .
The truly astounding thing , however , is that he does emerge victorious against not one , not two , but TEN of this country 's past commanders in chief .
Yes , 23 % of the men who helped make the United States the strongest nation on Earth are easily defeated by a fictional and faceless videogame character who barely knows how to speak and takes orders from a naked hologram .
Go America !
The orange word count above is an average taken fromthe US Presidents beaten by the Master Chief .
Here 's the full , pathetic breakdown :
Leaders of the Free World less important than Master Chief !

Humanity stands on the cusp of a new age , with accelerated technological growth converging toward a singularity point , promising an undreamt - of future .
Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth , humanity has conquered the solar system and partially terraformed Mars .
Advancements in biotechnology , nanotechnology , artificial intelligence and cognitive science have transformed our lives .
Everyone is wirelessly networked with the world around them , AIs process vast amounts of information , and nano - fabrication enables people to “ print ” complex devices from the molecular level — at home .
Biotechnology allows people to genefix , enhance , and clone their bodies , while others pursue body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human .
People ’s minds and memories can be digitized , uploaded , transferred over long distances , and downloaded into new bodies ( biological or synthetic ) .
Death has been defeated — for those who can afford it .
From within , disaster struck .
Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when a group of military AIs known as TITANS achieved full sentience , autonomy , and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth .
The AI intelligences spawned by this hard - takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity , enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence , disaster , and warfare .
What began as a struggle between man and machine escalated into a whirlwind of conflict between political factions , revolutionaries , and hypercorps .
In less than a year , transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes , biowarfare plagues , destructive nanoswarms , infowar attacks , mass uploads , and other unexplained singularity events , ripping the superpowers of old to pieces .
Our planetary home — Earth — was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole , while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space .
Just as quickly as they came , the TITANS disappeared , taking millions of uploaded minds with them , leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways .
Known as Pandora Gates , these poorly - understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems — often one - way and / or fatal .
Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist — each highly contested — the foolish , brave , curious , and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond .
In the aftermath of the Fall , transhumanity lives on , divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines , survivalist stations , transhuman faction species , and city - state habitats .
Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies , advanced technologies remain highly restricted , and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or resleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor .
In the outer system , rebel transhuman scientists and techno - anarchists struggle to maintain a new society — from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need .
And on the fringes and in the niches lurk networked tribes of political extremists , religious fanatics , criminal entrepreneurs , and bizarre posthumans , among other , stranger , and more alien things ...
Though most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out - of - control TITANS , others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars — both AI and transhuman — were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors — biological , information , nano — dubbed the Exsurgent virus .
Whatever its source , this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable ... something monstrous and reality - altering .
Whatever the truth , the remnants of the TITANS and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system , where they remain hidden away in dark corners , quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them ...
Isabella , is a golden retriever at the Safari Zoological Park that recently got famous .
Famous for nursing three white tiger cubs born one week ago who were abandoned by their mother .

Though it ’s unusual for dogs to care for tiger cubs , Isabella who just recently weaned her own puppies , had nothing against it .
Actually , she does n’t really care if these are hers or not .
She licks them , cleans them and feeds them .
Tom Harvey , the owner of Safari Zoological Park said that “ it ’s a miracle ” .
Though they are adorable right now , these tigers will grow 300 pounds big .
Will Isabella care for them when they are adults ?
Should n’t take long .

Hmmm …
You can install it with easy_install virtualenv , or from the subversion repository with easy_install virtualenv==dev .
It is written by Ian Bicking , and sponsored by the Open Planning Project .
It is licensed under an MIT - style permissive license .
virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments .
The basic problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions , and indirectly permissions .
Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo , but another application requires version 2 .
How can you use both these applications ?
If you install everything into / usr / lib / python2.4 / site - packages ( or whatever your platform ’s standard location is ) , it ’s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that should n’t be upgraded .
Or more generally , what if you want to install an application and leave it be ?
If an application works , any change in its libraries or the versions of those libraries can break the application .
Also , what if you ca n’t install packages into the global site - packages directory ?
For instance , on a shared host .
In all these cases , virtualenv can help you .
It creates an environment that has its own installation directories , that does n’t share libraries with other virtualenv environments ( and optionally does n’t use the globally installed libraries either ) .
The basic usage is :
$ python virtualenv.py ENV
This creates ENV / lib / python2.4/site-packages ( or ENV / lib / python2.5/site-packages on Python 2.5 , etc ) , where any libraries you install will go .
It also creates ENV / bin / python , which is a Python interpreter that uses this environment .
Anytime you use that interpreter ( including when a script has #!/ path/to/ENV/bin/python in it ) the libraries in that environment will be used .
( Note for Windows : scripts and executables on Windows go in ENV \Scripts \ ; everywhere you see bin / replace it with Scripts \ )
The one second carwash -)
When 911 first happened , and i started to hear stories of it being an inside job , I thought these people were crazy for even thinking something so diabolical , I mean as if the President of the United States would do that to his own people that was so ludicrous .
But then i started to see things , i started to see holes in the official story , i started to see a President that didnt care about the American people , i saw a Vice President , who shrugged when informed about the amount of American soldiers killed in Iraq , and i started to hear about evidence that didnt exist .
We all saw a hole in the Pentagon , a hole which by no stretch of anyones imagination , did a passenger plane go through , I saw a hole in the ground in which everyone was told a passenger plane went into with its passengers and crew , again no stretch of the imagination could ever convince me of that .
Everyone was told who was responsible , accepted it , but then began to question how did these people manage this ?
Then came evidence of Warnings received before the event , telephone calls , even TV shows , running the same plot that happened that day , TV plots from years before , we even saw the untimely deaths of several people who could have been key witnesses to the truth of that day , what we never saw , were the video's from the Pentagon that where confiscated , we never got to see or examine the steel from the WTC buildings themselves , we got to see only a fraction of the evidence , evidence which was found on grass , on very hot days that left no marks at all on the immaculate groomed grass it was found on , not even a tiny piece of evidence they had been traveling at any speed with anything like a source of heat added to them .
So some people call all this coincidence , and i have not even touched the bottom of the iceberg .
So let me ask you think all of the above is nothing to worry about ?
IMO i think whoever did this , thought they had dumbed everyone down a lot further than they have , those who had not been dumbed down at all , started asking questions , and those who had been began to wake , and still are .

It looks weird but also it is amazing how one or more spiders made this web covering 180 metres of trees .
Blue Nile ( NILE ) , an online retailer of diamonds and fine jewelry , reports its June quarter results tomorrow after close ( Tuesday , August 5th ) .
AmTech 's estimates are now roughly in - line with the Street , which have been revised materially lower over the course of the quarter .
However , the firm anticipates a weak guidance and therefore continues to recommend a SHORT position in NILE :
Checks during the quarter , cautious comments from other mid- to high - end jewelry retailers and lackluster traffic data ( down 16 % Y/Y ) all suggest little reason to expect upside in the P&L this quarter .
Management 's existing 2008 guidance is for top - line growth of at least 10 % and EPS that is in - line with 2007 levels ( $ 1.04 ) .
The problem here is that with only 4 % top - line growth in 1Q08 and a projected 4 % in 2Q08 , as well as 1H08 EPS that is tracking to levels 20 % below 1H07 , this guidance implies expectations for a significant recovery in consumer demand during the back half of the year .
We believe such an improvement - at least in higher price point luxury items - is highly unlikely .
We continue to recommend a short position in NILE shares .
We believe NILE shares remain grossly overvalued at a 2008 P/E of 38 x and 0 % EPS growth at best this year .
Consumers gobbling up diamonds does seem like a dubious proposition right now .
AmTech reiterates SELL on Blue Nile ( NILE ) .

( Natural News ) Infection with methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) is 16 times higher than the national average among Texas high school football players , according to three studies conducted by the Texas Department of Health Services .
MRSA is an antibiotic resistant version of the same bacteria that causes staph infections .
If untreated , staph infections can spread to the blood and from there to internal organs , with potentially lethal consequences .
A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) found that MRSA kills more people in the United States than any other infection tracked by the CDC , including AIDS .
The disease is often associated with hospitals , but in recent years has become more common in other institutional settings such as prisons , nursing homes and schools .
Because the disease can live harmlessly on a person 's skin until it enters through an abrasion , it is easily spread through physical contact , making athletes who share locker rooms particularly susceptible .
MRSA infection rates are higher among football players than among other athletes , perhaps because football players are more likely to get minor skin abrasions when they slide in the turf .
A totally of 276 football players in the United States contracted the disease between 2003 and 2005 , translating to 517 out of every 100,000 .
This contrasts sharply with the overall national rate of 32 per 100,000 .
As the disease has become more widespread , health experts have increasingly come to view it as a major public health threat .
" This is an epidemic , '' said MRSA researcher David Smith .
" It 's a big problem , and it 's likely to get bigger . '' A study co-authored by Smith and published in the journalfound that hospitalizations in the United States due to MRSA more than doubled between 1999 and 2005 .
Athletes and people in institutional settings can reduce their risk of contracting MRSA by washing their hands frequently , washing and covering skin wounds , disinfecting whirlpools between users and not sharing towels or razors .

From Freddie Mac : National Home - Value Drop Moderates in Second Quarter
Freddie Mac ( NYSE : FRE ) announced today that its Conventional Mortgage Home Price Index ( CMHPI ) Purchase - Only Series registered a modest 0.4 percent annualized decline in U.S. home values during the second quarter of 2008 , following a downward revised 10.8 percent annualized drop in the first quarter .
Over the four quarters ending with the second quarter of 2008 , home sales prices fell an average of 6.0 percent in the CMHPI Purchase - Only Series – the largest annual fall in values over the 39 - year history of the series .
" While U.S. home value indexes continued to decline , an encouraging sign has been the significant moderation in the rate of decline of the Purchase - Only series , " said Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist .
" After falling sharply over the prior two quarters – more than a 10 percent annualized drop – home value depreciation slowed substantially to only a 0.4 percent annualized rate .
While we expect to see further declines in average U.S. home values throughout this year and into 2009 , we will be watching for signs of stabilization in indicators of real housing activity , such as a leveling off in home sales and for - sale inventories .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the year - over - year change in the Conventional Mortgage Home Price Index ( CMHPI ) Purchase - Only Series vs. the quarterly change ( annualized ) .
Guess what ?
There is a strong seasonal component to the series , and I see nothing encouraging about this " moderation " when seasonal factors are considered .
The headline could have read : " Worst Second Quarter Ever for Freddie Mac CMHPI Purchase - Only House Price Series "
I love when I find a product that we can use on several items and in recipes .
Country Bob ’s All Purpose Sauce is one of those products .
Not only can you use it in recipes such at meatloaf ( more on that later ) , but you can use it on steak , hamburgers , pork , and chicken .
Personally , I am a ketchup person , but I may have found my ketchup replacement .
My husband made their meatloaf recipe the first night we had this .
I do n’t normally care for meatloaf at all , so I was n’t thrilled to be trying this sauce on something like that .
However , I was impressed .
The meatloaf was not dry , and it was awesome .
Not once did I feel the need to dip it in ketchup .
My kids even asked for seconds !
My husband wanted to know if there were more recipes we could try !
It is just as good on steaks and hamburgers too .
Country Bob has several other products you can try also : BBQ Sauce , Seasoning Salt , and Spice All Purpose Sauce .
If they are as good as the All Purpose Sauce , then these are winners too !
Now , their product is good , but how about their site ?
I love that too .
It is super easy to navigate .
You can easily find recipes to try and retail locations close to your house besides a ton of other stuff .
I found several local grocery stores by me that carry this besides the one I normally go to .
If you check out their online store , all of their products have free shipping !
If you are looking for a present , they have a cookbook and gift pack that would work out great !
Now , because I liked this product so much , I asked if I would be able to give a couple of my readers a chance to try this .
Of course , they said yes !
So Country Bob ’s will be sending 2 lucky readers 2 bottles of their All Purpose Sauce .

It is for US residents only .
Good luck !
As a rule , I ’m an easy - going guy .
Hardly anything gets my goat , ruffles my feathers or raises even a single hackle .
I always try to put myself in the other fellow ’s shoes , and am always prepared to give people the benefit of the doubt .
There is only one area in which I give no quarter .
If it were up to me , lack of punctuality would be a felony .
And while I might not make it a capital crime , I would n’t think twice about tossing the terminally late in the cooler for 10 or 20 years ; preferably in solitary confinement , so that they would n’t be distracted while mulling over their anti-social behavior .
Where punctuality is concerned , my motto is : Better half an hour early than 10 minutes late .
They ’re words I live by , and so should the rest of you .
When you live in Los Angeles , as I do , people are constantly arriving late and then using traffic as their excuse , as if they had no reason on earth to expect there might actually be other cars on the road .
So , first they insult you by keeping you waiting , and then they follow up by insulting your intelligence .
Do they imagine that I , who somehow managed to arrive on time , came by helicopter ?
When my wife catches me fuming about these inconsiderate louts , she ’ll invariably suggest I should always take along something to read .
Being , like Professor Higgins , a very reasonable man , I point out that if I wanted to read , I ’d have stayed home in my easy chair .
Perhaps it ’s a gender thing .
Maybe women simply are n’t aware that when people keep you waiting , they might just as well spit in your eye .
It ’s their way of saying that they ’re more important than you , and that you ’re lucky they bothered showing up at all .
How do I know this ?
Easy .
These same people are never late when they ’re going to meet their boss or a potential employer or somebody from whom they want to borrow money .
Or take Marilyn Monroe .
When she became a star , she was notorious for her tardiness .
She would regularly keep an entire movie company standing around waiting for her to show up three or four hours late .
People would rationalize her boorishness .
They ’d say she was nervous , even frightened , about facing the camera .
So how was it that she was absolutely punctual during those years when she was still a starlet , with small roles in movies like “ The Asphalt Jungle ” and “ All About Eve ” ?
It was only when she became the 800 - pound gorilla and could n’t be fired that , all of a sudden , she developed this phobia where punctuality was concerned .
Recently , I was supposed to meet a guy for lunch at noon .
By 12:15 , I began to fret .
Did he think we were supposed to get together at 12:30 ?
By 12:40 , I figured he ’d gone to a different deli .
If only I ’d heeded my wife ’s counsel and brought along some reading material , I could have made a decent dent in “ War and Peace . ”
When I got home , I phoned the guy .
He said he ’d forgotten .
It seems that for some bizarre reason this fool keeps two appointment books .
He ’d made a notation in one , but not the other , and of course the other was the one he ’d looked at that morning .
That was bad enough , but what really floored me was his cavalier manner .
Where was the note of hysteria in his voice ?
Where was the stammering apology ?
Where , at the very least , were the lies ?
It would have killed this yutz to tell me he ’d rushed his wife to the hospital or his dog to the vet because one of them had choked on a chicken bone ?!
The plain truth is that people who are late think they ’re entitled to be late .
And what exactly is it that makes these folks think they ’re so special ?
Well , they must be , must n’t they ?
After all , people are always waiting for them to show up .
Better late than never ?
I think not .

What is MontyLingua ? [ top ]
MontyLingua is a free* , commonsense - enriched , end - to - end natural language understander for English .
Feed raw English text into MontyLingua , and the output will be a semantic interpretation of that text .
Perfect for information retrieval and extraction , request processing , and question answering .
From English sentences , it extracts subject / verb / object tuples , extracts adjectives , noun phrases and verb phrases , and extracts people 's names , places , events , dates and times , and other semantic information .
MontyLingua makes traditionally difficult language processing tasks trivial !
Version 2.0 is substantially FASTER , MORE ACCURATE , and MORE RELIABLE than version 1.3.1 .
It has now been tested across Windows , many flavors of UNIX , and Mac OS X , and several flavors of Java , and is in use by several university research projects and under several commercial settings .
MontyLingua differs from other natural language processing tools because :
it is complete end - to - end .. input raw_text ; output semantic interpretation
not many dated tools and implementations sewn together ; it is one well - integrated implementation
it does not require " training " and other fidgetting , and will work right out - of - the - box
it is enriched with " common sense " knowledge about the everyday world , allowing it to escape many stupid interpretive mistakes .
e.g. : " ( NX the / DT mosquito / NN bit / NN NX ) ( NX the / DT boy / NN NX ) " ==corrected== >
" ( NX the / DT mosquito / NN NX ) ( VX bit / VBD VX ) ( NX the / DT boy / NN NX ) "
it is lightweight and portable across platforms , written in portable Python and also available as a compiled Java library
it is easy to customize by allowing for a user lexicon
MontyLingua performs the following tasks over text :
MontyTokenizer - Tokenizes raw English text ( sensitive to abbreviations ) , and resolve contractions , e.g. " you 're " == > " you are " MontyTagger - Part - of - speech tagging based on Brill94 , enriched with common sense .
MontyChunker - Lightning fast regular expression chunker MontyExtractor - Extracts phrases and subject / verb / object triplets from sentences MontyLemmatiser - Strips inflectional morphology , i.e. changes verbs to infinitive form and nouns to singular form MontyNLGenerator - Uses MontyLingua 's concise predicate - arg representation to generate naturalistic English sentences and text summaries

THE FACTS
Manipulating your neck is supposed to relieve pain , not cause it .
But years ago neurologists noticed a strange pattern of people suffering strokes shortly after seeing chiropractors , specifically for neck adjustments .
Their hypothesis was that a chiropractic technique called cervical spinal manipulation , involving a forceful twisting of the neck , could damage two major arteries that lead through the neck to the back of the brain .
Strokes in people under age 45 are relatively rare , but these cervical arterial dissections are a leading cause of them .
Image Credit ... Leif Parsons
Studies that followed suggested a link .
One at Stanford that surveyed 177 neurologists found 55 patients who suffered strokes after seeing chiropractors .
Another , published in the journal Neurologist , said young stroke patients were five times more likely to have had neck adjustments within a week of their strokes than a control group .
It estimated an incidence of 1.3 cases for every 100,000 people under 45 receiving neck adjustments .
Welcome to Comic - Con , where Stan Lee is God and Dan Martin finds that you 're nobody without a good get - up
Back in 2005 , top aspirational celebutard drama serial Entourage featured an episode wherein Vince and the boys drove out to San Diego for Comic - Con ; the four - day superhero love - in where California gets its geek on and Stan Lee is the One True God .
The joke was that this was the only place on Earth that Vince 's less - successful older brother Johnny Drama - having starred in a bizarre low - budget Xena - style schlock series in the 1980s - was the bigger star .
Here was a parallel universe where the geeks really had inherited the earth .
Last weekend , the whole shebang roared into action once more , taking over California 's cultural consciousness in a sprawl of graphic novels , steampunks , Tamagotchis , time - travellers , Terminators , and more people dressed as The Joker than the combined forces of the DC Universe of superheroes could ever hope to see off .
With 150,000 people spread over the six square miles of San Diego Convention Centre , this is the Sundance of geekdom , a place where a working knowledge of the moons of Alderaan will actually help your chances of getting laid .
The place might be crawling with megastars ( safely protected from the more devotional of their disciples , of course ) , but the real stars here are the fans .
Devotees of the superhero dress - up cult known as " cosplay " , they make the pilgrimage from all over the world .
People like Bob Mitsch , the Pasadena Doctor
Who fan who 's marshalled an army of 10 likeminds to parade around in perfect replica costumes of Doctors one through 10 .
Or the teenagers camped outside the Convention Centre terrace .
There 's a twofold advantage here : they 'll hardly get cold in the 40 - degree heat , and sleeping outside the 6,000 - capacity hub that is Hall H is the only sure guarantee of getting a seat at the coveted Heroes session , where the entire cast will unveil footage from Chapter 3 , Villains , and be quizzed by their fans .
Or people like Dan Enfield , a 39 - year - old computer programmer who 's come dressed as Red Arrow , gleeful that he gets to be a celebrity for the day .
" Growing up I loved comic books , a lot of people did , " he says .
" But I think we were afraid to express how we felt and , y'know , kept ourselves to this other world .
Here you 're not alone .
Everybody shares your dream . "
In the overwhelming vastness of the exhibition hall everything from The Clone Wars to Emily The Strange to Knight Rider to BBC America to Dark Horse Comics to My Little Pony has a presence , selling , showcasing or just hanging giant fibreglass effigies of their characters from the ceiling .
Giant Pokemon look down on animatronic Hulks , Ghostbusters squadrons from every state in America parade the hall in search of ectoplasmic menace .
And there are even more Jokers .
Amid it all sits John Barrowman , putting in eight - hour signing stints behind a notice that roars " NO FLESH WILL BE SIGNED ! "
" Oh , the reason for that ? " bellows Barrowman when quizzed .
" People want you to sign their skin , but you do n't know if they have an allergy to the ink . "
John 's here to plug his role as Captain Jack ( and play down his expected casting in Marvel 's Captain America movie ) ; Torchwood is BBC America 's highest - rated show ever , a far bigger deal in the US than Doctor Who .
So John , Naoko Mori ( Toshiko ) and Gareth David - Lloyd ( Ianto ) are over to meet their public .
Hardly a shrinking violet , even Barrowman is overwhelmed .
" I describe it to people as like the Cannes Film Festival but for science fiction .
I 'm a nerd myself so I enjoy this kind of stuff . "
The truth , though , is that in the three years since that episode of Entourage aired , that parallel universe has shifted to the point where we all now occupy it .
With the music industry in freefall and conventional celebrity lost in snideness , the cult world is fast becoming entertainment 's biggest business .
Only Sex And The City made more noise this summer than the big three superhero movies .
A culture built upon heroism can't be sullied by incriminating YouTube clips or DUIs .
Geeks did inherit the Earth , and now everybody else wants a piece .
In one night here you 'll run into Samuel L Jackson , Keanu Reeves , Mark Wahlberg , Mark Hamill and Mel B .
" There are girls everywhere .
Normally , straight up , this place used to be full of guys , " says Seth MacFarlane , the brains behind Family Guy .
" It 's a whole new Comic - Con .
It 's like a frickin ' Coldplay concert , girls whooping the whole time ! "
But it 's not the actors who are truly revered here , but the creators .
People like Joss Whedon , who 's here to preview his new series Dollhouse with the rather ace Eliza Dushku .
The show wo n't air until 2009 , but fans are already fielding online petitions to prevent its cancellation , after his last show Firefly was taken off air mid-season .
" The enthusiasm of it I adore , " shrugs Whedon .
" And the wariness ?
Well , it 's earned . "
Or Frank Miller , here to preview his solo directorial debut , an adaptation of the comic pioneer Will Eisner 's strip , The Spirit , starring Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johansson .
Or Simon Pegg , Jessica Hynes and Edgar Wright , returning to America victorious after seeing off the botched plan to remake Spaced US and met by a queue that stretches right outside .
Or Kevin Smith , who is everywhere ; hosting the Battlestar Galactica session ( " A show so good it will get you pregnant " ) and unveiling his new movie Zack And Miri Make A Porno with Seth Rogen , Elizabeth Banks and Traci Lords in tow .
But most of all , it 's about Marvel overlord Stan Lee .
" A few years ago I experienced a bad time in my life and I thought about ending it all , " confesses one unfortunate fan at his panel session .
" And the reason I did n't , Stan , was you and your comics .
I experience rage like the Hulk .
I get confused about my identity like the X - Men .
Now I live for two things : Stab - my six - year - old boy - and your comics . "
The jewel in the crown are Friday night 's prestigious Eisner Awards , the industry 's Oscars .
This year 's surprise winner , was My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way 's dysfunctional superhero saga The Umbrella Academy , picking up Best Limited Series for its first run - a sweet vindication after more than a few eyebrows were raised when he started the project with illustrator Gabriel Ba .
" A lot of people were probably thinking , ' He 's not much of an underdog any more , he 's a rock star now so this is easy for him , ' " says Gerard .
" So I got to be an underdog all over again .
I did n't have it easy . "
Deified in his day job , Gerard used to be able to walk around these things pretty much invisible .
Now , all that 's changed .
" At first I would just go to comic conventions and just walk around .
Now I make that difficult for myself because I write comics .
But it 's so good to have a book that was appreciated .
Acceptance was optional , I wanted the work to be appreciated . "
A final thought from our new friends Matt and Ramona from Temecula , CA , who rounded off our Comic - Con by solving its final mystery - the difference between a geek and a nerd .
" A geek is somebody who bites the heads off chickens in a circus .
A Nerd is just way cooler . "

Sorry to be away , readers .
I just arrived home from a week with my family , no tv , no radio , no phone service , just lovely woods and each other .
I did have the opportunity to stop by a colleague 's clinic for a tour and I 'm all full of ideas that I want to implement at our facility .
Just now opening up my email and starting to get plugged in again and it seems like I 've missed quite a bit .
Just some initial thoughts on what I might do if I were a governor with a special needs child and a pregnant teenage daughter and I wanted to really support families and show respect for the sanctity of life ...
Perhaps I would advocate for medical insurance for all pregnant women , regardless of ability to pay .
I could increase the compensation and training for foster families willing to parent special needs children ( after all , they are the most vulnerable and require the most skilled caretakers ) and start seriously trying to decrease the huge waiting list of special needs kids who are in need of adoption / fostering .
Maybe I would require that any teenage mother or father receive free or low - cost child care for as long as they are in high school or college .
I would revise the regulations around receiving public assistance so that teen mothers could work towards some level of financial self - sufficiency while still living at home .
( Current regulations frequently add up the income of ALL adults in a household to establish eligibility . )
I would enhance my state 's requirements for the family medical leave act , to ensure that the parents of an infant with special needs are able to extend their leave as long as the infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit .
Then again , I could slash the budget of one of the few residential facilities for teen parents in my state , refuse to support comprehensive sex ed and leave the mothers and fathers in my state to deal with these " situations " on their own .
They are , after all , " private family matters . "

But whether they grew up to be biologists or sociologists or lawyers , when they were surveyed in their 30s , these women were as content with their careers as their male counterparts .
They also made as much money per hour of work .
Dr. Lubinski and Dr. Benbow concluded that adolescents ’ interests and balance of abilities — not their sex — were the best predictors of whether they would choose an “ inorganic ” career like physics .
A similar conclusion comes from a new study of the large gender gap in the computer industry by Joshua Rosenbloom and Ronald Ash of the University of Kansas .
By administering vocational psychological tests , the researchers found that information technology workers especially enjoyed manipulating objects and machines , whereas workers in other occupations preferred dealing with people .
Once the researchers controlled for that personality variable , the gender gap shrank to statistical insignificance : women who preferred tinkering with inanimate objects were about as likely to go into computer careers as were men with similar personalities .
There just happened to be fewer women than men with those preferences .
Now , you might think those preferences would be different if society did n’t discourage girls and women from pursuits like computer science and physics .
But if you read “ The Sexual Paradox , ” Susan Pinker ’s book about gender differences , you ’ll find just the opposite problem .
Ms. Pinker , a clinical psychologist and columnist for The Globe and Mail in Canada ( and sister of Steven Pinker , the Harvard psychologist ) , argues that the campaign for gender parity infantilizes women by assuming they do n’t know what they want .
She interviewed women who abandoned successful careers in science and engineering to work in fields like architecture , law and education — and not because they had faced discrimination in science .
Instead , they complained of being pushed so hard to be scientists and engineers that they ended up in jobs they did n’t enjoy .
“ The irony was that talent in a male - typical pursuit limited their choices , ” Ms. Pinker says .
“ Once they showed aptitude for math or physical science , there was an assumption that they ’d pursue it as a career even if they had other interests or aspirations .
And because these women went along with the program and were perceived by parents and teachers as torch bearers , it was so much more difficult for them to come to terms with the fact that the work made them unhappy . ”
Ms. Pinker says that universities and employers should do a better job helping women combine family responsibilities with careers in fields like physics .
But she also points out that female physicists are a distinct minority even in Western European countries that offer day care and generous benefits to women .
Lil' Kim's Party Guest Ingrid Rivera Found Dead on Roof
Spotlight Live nightclub , located in the middle of Times Square , was the hot destination forand her birthday party guests last Sunday .
Guest went missing some time during the evenings festivities and had not been seen since the party - that is until yesterday .
Rivera 's body was found on the roof of the club yesterday and police are saying that she sustained a head injury and other unidentified injuries .
How the guest and Lil ' Kim were connected is not known .
This can't look good for Kim since she spent time in 2005 and 2006 in prison for conspiracy and perjury over a shooting outside a Manhattan club .
One might want to think twice if the singer invites you to an upcoming party .
Rapper Missy Elliot was also at the party .
No comments have been forthcoming from either parties reps .

High - tech televisual bells and whistles have carried couch - based Olympic watching way beyond the mere reality of being here .

Why do all these people seem to ignore what is most important ?
Let us berate them for their foolishness , and convince them that they should be moving toward the bar . ”

Cost of a U.S. shopping spree soars as pound collapses to 22 - month low against the dollar
A sudden slump in the pound against the dollar means that millions of Britons taking a summer holiday in the States are facing a surge in bills .
The pound has fallen from two dollars to around 1.86 in recent days amid fears for the UK economy .
The net effect has been to push up the cost of taking a holiday in the United States by more than 7per cent on everything from a hotel room to hiring a car or buying a coffee .
Macy 's department store in New York in the shadow of the Empire State Building .
The weakening of the pound will mean fewer Britons will be flocking to the States for their shopping
Some four million Britons take a holiday in the USA each year , a number swelled by hopes that spending money would go further than last summer .
Many families opted for a sunshine holiday in Florida and other parts of the USA after a fall in the value of the pound versus the Euro put up the cost of going to the Mediterranean .
However , the fact is that the pound is now falling sharply against both the dollar and the euro - making leaving these shores considerably more expensive than a year ago .
The credit card bills landing on the mat following this summer are likely to carry a hidden surprise for holidaying Britons .
Not only has the currency shifted against travellers , but banks have also put up the fees they use for using credit and debit cards overseas .
The news is the latest blow to a nation that is already struggling to meet spiralling ' must pay ' bills for food , energy and petrol .
Frances Tuke , of the Association of British Travel Agents , said : ' The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar will be very disappointing for travellers .
' The USA has been a very popular destination this year by virtue of the fact that Sterling was trading at two dollars to the pound .
' Everything has been fine until just the last few weeks .
The fall has really been quite sudden and unexpected .'
She added : ' Some people may have bought their currency early , which means they will be okay , but not everyone is that organised . '
Miss
Tuke said that it is important to remember that even with the currency shift in recent days , the cost of clothes , electronics and other products is still lower than in Britain .
The pound hit the magic two dollar value in November last year , the first time this had happened for more than 26 years .
It triggered a rush of Christmas travel bookings to cities like New York .
Despite the fall of recent days , the pound still has a very long way to go before it reaches a significant low .
The figure hit 1.50 dollars to the pound in 1992 after Sterling crashed out of the ERM when John Major was Prime Minister .
The current fall in the value of the pound has been triggered by warnings from the governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , that the UK is teetering on the brink of a recession .
International investors like to invest in currencies where interest rates are high or likely to rise .
The problems in the UK economy have triggered speculation that the Bank is likely to cut interest rates sharply .
The interest rate banks charge each other to borrow money over a two year period has fallen to 5.33 per cent in the last few days , which is the lowest rate since May .
City analysts now believe there is a 50:50 chance of an interest rate cut by November .
Economist Jonathan Loynes said the pound had been knocked by market expectations for a series of interest rates cuts over the next year as the Bank sought to counter slowing growth .
Mr Loynes , chief European economist at Capital Economics , added that the pound had further to fall .
' The bottom line is that the pound 's recent drop is part of a fundamental adjustment which we believe has got further to go as the economy 's imbalances continue to unwind , ' he said .
While the pound 's weakness is bad news for those travelling abroad , the strength of the dollar is helping the raft of UK companies which have US operations .
FirstGroup , which owns Greyhound in the US , has seen shares rise in recent days .
A final update of the evening on McCain ’s uber - gaffe .
There ’s some unclarity whether the interviewer was done by a Spanish reporter or a Spanish language reporter Caracol from 1260 in Miami .
I suspect they may have had some joint arrangement since they both appear to claim it as their own exclusive .
Or perhaps the local station in Miami is working as the affiliate of the Spanish radio network .
That does n’t change the underlying story .
But TPM
Reader RC points out that if you go to the Caracol1260 website and scroll down below the fold to the section of audio links on the left under the headline “ Hoy por Hoy ” , these folks have their own version of the recording .
They spliced the Spanish translations in differently .
And in the way they did it , you can hear much more of McCain ’s actual English .
It ’s still a bit difficult to hear McCain since the translator is speaking simultaneously .
But you can hear most of what he says .
It ’s pretty clear that McCain does n’t remember who Zapatero is .
And he keeps referring to his approach to Latin America even after the interview keeps pointing that she ’s asking him a question a Spain , which is actually in Europe .
( ed.note : Another point about this version of the interview audio , Caracol seems to have completely dubbed out the interviewers voice in exchange for a translator speaking in Spanish .
If you listen to the other version from the Spanish radio channel , it ’s clear that the original interview was entirely in English .
The Caracol version also appears to cut portions of the the exchange .
So we still need to hear the unaltered recording of the exchange . )
The latest analysis from Jakob Nielsen 's UseIt focuses on " bounce rates " and getting that elusive " second click " .
It 's pretty much in line with everything experts have been saying on this topic for the last couple of years : unique visitors are a bad way to measure traffic , traffic from loyal users and search engine traffic are the kind of traffic you 're aiming for , etc .
Amidst the analysis , Nielsen focuses on Digg , quoting it as a particularly bad example .
" Low - value referrers , such as Digg .
People arriving through these sources are notoriously fickle and are probably not in your target audience .
You should expect most of them to leave immediately , once they 've satisfied their idle curiosity .
Consider any value derived from Digg and its like as pure gravy ; do n't worry if this traffic source has a sky - high bounce rate . "
The problem here is that he does n't understand the value of social media .
Yes , Digg or Reddit or StumbleUpon users will swarm to your page , probably wo n't click on anything else , they 'll probably stay only a couple of seconds , and there 's no way in hell you can convert them to buy anything .
This is true .
Angry website owners have often described such users as lazy bums with a short attention span ; I think it 's simply because they 're smart and they do n't want to waste time .
When I 'm on Digg , I do n't want to waste time either ; I want to read and see the stuff that really interests me , and move on .
However , it 's not true that Digg traffic has no value .
First of all , Digg users almost always create a very interesting conversation in Digg comments .
The fact that it 's not happening on your blog is your problem , buddy .
Welcome to the world of fragmented conversations ; the same thing happens on Twitter , FriendFeed , and a great number of other social media sites .
I 'm not sure what the long - term implications of this are , but I sure as hell am not going to fight it ; if people would rather discuss my article on FriendFeed , so be it : I 'm glad they 're discussing it at all .
The thing is , Diggers and Redditers do n't see your website as a separate entity .
It 's a Digg / Reddit link ; it 's meant to be opened , skimmed , and perhaps read quickly if it 's interesting .
They do , however , bookmark it by clicking that little vote button , share it with their friends who follow what they like , and comment on it - everything you could ever want from a visitor , really .
And , with the upcoming Digg recommendation engine , your article will spread even quicker amongst those who are really interested in it .
Yes , I 'm sure that every web site owner would want all those comments and links and all that traffic to themselves .
Unfortunately , most websites are n't organized as well as Digg and Reddit are , so they 'll have to settle with what they can get .
And it 's not that bad , really .
Digg is indexed by Google well ; some visitors will have to click through Digg to get to your site , but I 'm guessing that most of them will do it because Digg does n't steal your content , it merely points to it .
Digg itself sends some traffic over time ; that initial spike will subside , but hey , people can't be interested in the same thing all the time , anyway .
Finally , the biggest value that comes from Digg is the fact that it creates a buzz over your content ; it makes your article the Internet 's star for a couple of minutes .
Use that time well , and even Diggers will recognize that your site is great and will start visiting it on a regular basis .
Therefore , instead of shunning Digg 's traffic as useless , analysts should try finding the hidden values it contains , even if it 's not happening directly on your website .
Underestimating the power of social media - which may not have even reached its full potential yet - is the same as thinking that only unique visitors count .
Mike Strizki lives in the nation 's first solar - hydrogen house .
The technology this civil engineer has been able to string together – solar panels , a hydrogen fuel cell , storage tanks , and a piece of equipment called an electrolyzer – provides electricity to his home year - round , even on the cloudiest of winter days .
Mr. Strizki's monthly utility bill is zero – he's off the power grid – and his system creates no carbon - dioxide emissions .
Neither does the fuel - cell car parked in his garage , which runs off the hydrogen his system creates .
It sounds promising , even utopian : homemade , storable energy that does n't contribute to global warming .
But does Strizki's method – converting electricity generated from renewable sources into hydrogen – make sense for widespread adoption ?
According to some renewable - energy experts , the answer is " no , " at least not anytime soon .
The system is too expensive , they say , and the process of creating hydrogen from clean sources is itself laced with inefficiency – the numbers just do n't add up .
Strizki's response : " Nothing is as wildly expensive as destroying the whole planet . "
Life free from the power grid
Strizki lives with his wife in a rural section of Central New Jersey .
His 12 - acre property is surrounded by trees and his gravel driveway leads to a winding country road .
His 3,500 - square - foot house has all the amenities , including a hot tub and a big - screen TV .
It was here , four years ago , that Strizki set out to do something that 's never been done in this country – power his home completely through a combination of solar and hydrogen .
" My motivation was , I saw what fossil fuels were doing to the environment , " he says .
Strizki works for a company that installs solar panels .
In previous jobs , he 's helped integrate hydrogen fuel cells into cars , a boat , a fire truck , and an airplane .
His latest project , the one involving his house , is an extension of that expertise .
The solar - hydrogen house took longer to complete than Strizki expected – a strict local zoning officer and the state permitting process caused delays , he says – but in October 2006 , the system finally went online .
The total cost , $ 500,000 , was paid for in part with a $ 250,000 grant from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities .
This is how it works
On sunny days , solar panels on the roof of Strizki 's detached garage generate more than enough electricity to power his home .
The excess electricity powers a device inside the garage called an electrolyzer , which transforms a tank of water into its base elements – oxygen and hydrogen .
The oxygen is released into the atmosphere , while the hydrogen is stored in 10 1,000 - gallon propane tanks on Strizki 's property .
In the winter , when the solar panels collect less energy than the home needs , that hydrogen is piped to an air - conditioner - size fuel cell , located just outside the garage , which generates electricity .
The final piece of the equation is " The New Jersey Genesis , " a hydrogen fuel - cell car Strizki helped design and now maintains for the New Jersey Department of Transportation .
He can fill up the Genesis with hydrogen from his electrolyzer and drive it pollution free .
Strizki understands that few people can afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for clean energy .
Now that he 's demonstrated his idea works , his goal is to make the system better and less expensive .
( For example , the 10 propane tanks could be replaced by one high - pressure hydrogen tank buried underground . )
With mass production , he believes he could get the price of the system , not including the solar panels , down to about $ 50,000 .
( A new solar panel system can cost as much as $ 80,000 , Strizki says , but some states , including New Jersey , have offered rebates that cover up to 70 percent of the cost . )
Strizki is seeking government grants and private donors for funding , and he 's started a company , Renewable Energy International , which he hopes will one day market his product .
He says he 's already heard from potential customers : " We 've been called by some A - list Hollywood types interested in powering their islands . "
Hydrogen hurdles
Strizki's project proves that carbon - free living is possible right now , but renewable - energy experts are skeptical that hydrogen houses with hydrogen - run cars in the driveway will catch on anytime soon .
" There 's no way your average person is going to want to buy five expensive pieces of hardware , " says Joseph Romm , a former Department of Energy official who analyzed clean - energy technologies during the Clinton administration .
In addition to the high cost of the equipment , there 's another huge hurdle that must be overcome if hydrogen is to become a viable clean energy :
Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe , it does n't exist alone in nature ; you can't just bottle it up .
To get at hydrogen , it must be processed from another source , such as natural gas , oil , coal , or water .
According to the National Hydrogen Association , 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States is made through steam reforming natural gas – a process that releases greenhouse gases into the air .
Strizki's method for making hydrogen is totally clean , but suffers from a different problem : Electrolyzers are only 50 percent efficient .
By the time the electricity from his solar panels is converted into hydrogen , and the hydrogen converted back into electricity in the fuel cell , half of the clean energy he started with is used up .
Mr. Romm thinks it 's a waste .
That electricity would do more good toward reducing pollution if it was sent into the main power grid to displace other energy , he says .
" [ Strizki's system ] does n't get you that much environmentally , " he says .
Romm is an advocate for clean - energy use – in recent books and articles he advocates a sharp cut in greenhouse - gas emissions within 10 years – but he 's characterized hydrogen as an overhyped distraction that is n't ready yet to help toward that goal .
He supports continued hydrogen research , but other technologies that are more developed could help the Earth much more and much sooner , he says .
Not ready for prime time
Robert Boehm , director of the Center for Energy Research at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , has studied renewable energy for the past 35 years .
His reaction to Strizki's home project is tempered .
" Does it make sense in the present environment ?
Probably not .
Does it make sense as a sustainable thing in the future ?
It very well could , " Dr. Boehm says .
Boehm predicts that it will be at least a decade before hydrogen energy is ready for the mainstream , and then only if enough money is put into research and development .
" In any of these new technologies , they need a lot of government support , " he says .
Boehm sees the most immediate potential for a system like Strizki's in places far from a power grid , where selling renewable energy back to a power company is not an option .
Strizki is n't dissuaded by criticisms that his system is too expensive or too inefficient to be practical .
He 's determined to push technology ahead toward an end goal – totally clean energy – and he sees renewable hydrogen as the best solution .
" It 's the way that makes the most sense , and we have to start somewhere , " he says .
" If you look at it , no one has said what I 'm doing does n't work . "
China 's alleged torch summit of Everest , complete with no bearing for verification , a casual lack of exertion on the part of the participants , and moist breath with no rime ice .
In light of the new information being reported on the wires about Chinese olympic " ethics , " such as the reversal to allow journalists unfettered access to the internet , the blatant forging of 14 year old gymnast He Kexin 's olympic application so that she appears 16 and thus , within olympic rules ; and the increase , rather than decrease of stringent clamp - downs on all manner of dissent ; we here at blogdai feel its time to report on a story we 've been working on for a few months now .
Most of you know of blogdai and June 's repulsion at Chinese bullying , so we have been very careful to verify sources , interview those present , and intensely study all film footage involved so as not to present the facade of impeachable bias against the Chinese .
So , after almost 2 months of research we here at blogdai have concluded :
China faked their olympic torch run to Mt. Everest .
We have friends who were among the first to summit Everest after the climbing ban was lifted .
Their comments help inform this report .
Plus , we 've interviewed climbers , famous and lesser for their opinions and their startling insights .
Some observations supporting our theory :
---- No " money shot . "
All photos taken are from close range making verification of the summit difficult .
Most , if not all expeditions take the photo proof shot , regardless of weather .
Proof lies in showing a recognizable land feature or peak who 's perspective in a summit photo proves the altitude and angle that confirms a successful bid .
The Chinese offered nothing more than close - in shots .
Even an " immediate space " shot was not available ( at least none that we could find ) to verify the approximate dimensions of the summit area .
Also , there was no apparent evidence of the old , faded prayer flags that mark the summit and have been known to stay in place for a few seasons or more .
Prayer flags in Chinese photos stand alone and look newly placed .
---- China 's dubious ascent in 1960 .
They 've done this before , apparently .
Sketchy verification of a summit bid in 1960 is still in dispute in some climbing circles .
They claimed to have climbed it at night so verification was difficult .
Hmm .
---- The claim of " mysterious lights " near the summit .
Hard to buy since Nepal maintained armed guards from camp II upwards on the Nepal side to prevent anyone sneaking up on the Chinese .
What were those " lights " then ?
Perhaps a loose - lipped expeditioner was seeing members of his own support team near the much lower level that they were actually reporting from .
---- Chatter boxes .
Through the summit torch lighting ceremony on Youtube video , women climbers are heard chattering away in the background with out a hint of the exertion expert climbers feel at the summit of Everest .
They are talking in long , single - breath sentences .
Ask anyone who 's summited Everest and they 'll tell you it 's not a place for a monologue .
Short , clipped sentences are all most can manage at that altitude .
----Moisture .
No one we 've spoken with who has summited Everest has ever remembered there being fog - like moisture coming from a climber 's breath .
They few times moisture has been present in the atmosphere near , but much lower than the summit , other phenomenon present themselves as one of our experts mentions below :
The one thing that struck me funny about the footage ; if you watch it , you see peoples breath .
In my 8 years on that hill , the air is too dry on top to see your breath that much .
They were also not that iced up , if it indeed was a moist enough storm to see breath , they would have been covered in rime ice .
They would have seen no other lights , as the military at camp 2 on the Nepal side made sure no one went above them .
Friends of blogdai at summit of Everest just a few weeks after the China 's alleged summit .
Peaks in the background give reasonable verification .
" Game 's Over : Free Tibet " banner was a nice touch .
----
Chinese footage on Youtube showing a long line of climbers traversing a long pitch is not recognizable as a portion of the north face ascent of Everest and may be tied to a secondary peak .
---- Climbers and blogdai contributors who were among the first to summit Everest after the alleged Chinese bid report no new flags , momentos or any evidence that the olympic torch ever reached the summit .
---- By their own claims , the Chinese torch bid was doomed to fail simply by their planning hubris .
A quick , alpine - style ascent is a sure recipe for failure on Everest ( Unless you are Reinhold Messner )
Our blogdai consultant was waiting to summit from the Nepal side during this time and filed this dispatch :
The ( Chinese ) truly ( expletive ) themselves with an elementary mistake , by the sounds .
Drop your camps in the windy spots , do n’t leave them up unattended to get ripped apart ...
_____________________
So , blogdai has a request : climbers and anyone who knows , chime in here .
Thousands of you were in the Khumbu at the time of the Nepal ban and the Chinese attempt .
We want to hear from you .
In the interest of fairness , we will give first priority to those who can offer definitive PROOF that the Chinese actually made the summit of Everest with their damn torch .
Even more , blogdai opens up the discussion to anyone with an opinion on this .
Get informed first .
Google " China Everest Torch " or anything similar ; go to Youtube.com and watch all the footage you can on the Chinese bid and report your opinions here .
Good luck and good hunting .

TV's Go Digital , but Where Do Old TV's Go ?
July 19th , 2008 by Courtney Carlisle Bolton
On February 17 , 2009 television stations will go digital , meaning that analog TV ’s will not longer receive a signal , leaving millions of analog TV owners with a dark and useless TV set .
As technology is rapidly advances , we are constantly ‘ trading up ’ to get a faster connection and sharper image – whether its a cell phone , MP3 player or television .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have a comprehensive way to deal with E - waste .
In fact , when the stations go ‘ lights out ’ on analog sets next year , there is n’t an e-waste program to handle the discarded TV’s .
Currently , only Sony electronics has offered to take back and recycle old Sony sets .
If old sets are n’t properly disposed of , we face cadmium , lead , beryllium seeping into the soil and contaminating our water supply .
According to the Take Back My TV campaign this is the largest government mandated obsolescence program in US history .
The Sony announced their recycling campaign earlier this year in a release that noted the amount of e-waste is on the rise and the issue is becoming increasingly crucial as the FCC - mandated switch to all digital TV signals in February 2009 nears .
The Consumer Electronics Association expects at least 30 million digital televisions to be sold in the U.S. this year alone .

“ Does n’t Jean Georges have that fluke with a buttermilk dressing and champagne grapes ? ” Chang said .
“ It ’s fucking badass , over fluke . ”
David Chang and Peter Serpico were sitting in the basement office of Momofuku Ssäm Bar , going over what they had to get done before the opening of Ko .
The stoves were in , and the gas was ready to be turned on , but they could n’t cook there yet , because the fire - extinguishing system was n’t installed .
Ssäm Bar was Chang ’s second restaurant ;
Ko was his third .
Chang is only thirty , but in the past couple of years he has unexpectedly and , in his mind , accidentally and probably fraudulently , become one of the most celebrated chefs in the country .
He is way too neurotic to handle this , however , so he compensates by representing himself as a bumbling idiot .
He is five feet ten , built like a beer mug , and feels that most food tastes better with pork .
Serpico is Ko ’s chef .
He has worked with Chang for a couple of years , after a job at Bouley .
He and Chang both raze their hair to buzz cuts , but while Chang ’s makes his head look rounder and more baby - like , Serpico ’s makes him look sharper , wirier , ready to flee .
“ O.K. , the one thing we do n’t have down and standardized is scallops , which we ’re gonna do right now . ”
They ’d been working on the scallop dish for weeks .
It was a thing of beauty : a smear of black nori purée on the bottom of the bowl ; then a layer of sea scallops and chanterelles and possibly clams ; and then , spooned on top in front of the customer , a soft heap of foaming dashi ( kelp and dried - bonito broth ) , made intentionally unstable with just a little methylcellulose , so that in front of the customer ’s eyes the bubbles would burst and dissipate into a fishy liquid , at exactly the speed that foam from a wave dissipates onto sand .
It looked like the sea and tasted like the sea , and Chang was extremely proud of it .
The only thing he was worried about was the word “ foam , ” which , owing to its trendiness in the nineties , had become a symbol of everything pretentious and unnatural about nineties cuisine .
In Chang ’s mind , he was making fun of foam , but of course some people were not going to get that and were going to think he was just another leftover foam slave .
“ It ’s gonna piss people off , ” he said happily .
Serpico noticed a giant eggshell next to Chang ’s computer .
“ Is that the ostrich egg you cooked up the other day ? ” he asked .
“ How was it ? ”
“ It was awful , ” Chang said .
“ I wanted it over easy , you know — I wanted to pretend I was Fred Flintstone .
So I got a big rondeau , put like two inches of oil , and I was gonna deep - fry the motherfucker , but there was so much water content in the white that it just sort of dispersed .
It looked like cottage cheese . ”
“ Eww . ”
“ The egg yolk , though — the egg yolk was massive .
Equivalent to twenty - four chicken eggs . ”
“ Wow . ”
“ We ’re gonna be ready to roll next week , ” Chang said .
“ If not , I ’m gonna chop Hiro ’s pinkie off . ”
Hiro was Ko’s architect .
“ I ca n’t wait , ” Serpico said .
“ I ’m fucking killing myself , man .
I ’ve got nothing to do .
I guess I could look for an apartment . ”
Serpico had to be out of his apartment in less than a month but had not yet found another place to live .
He has not historically paid much attention to his living arrangements .
He is twenty - six and inherited his first bed a year ago .
Until then , he had n’t even owned a mattress — he just slept on the floor .
He still does n’t have a closet : he drops his clothes at the laundry , then just takes stuff as he needs it right out of the bag .
He has cooked at home once in six years .
If he is n’t eating at the restaurant , he usually gets McDonald ’s or KFC .
Serpico ’s habits are not unusual among the cooks at Momofuku .
Chang never cooks at home , either — he orders Chinese or pizza .
He had a bed in his old apartment , but only because it had been left behind by the previous tenant .
Recently , he bought a place , but he had no furniture , so one day he braced himself and went to Crate & Barrel .
He had only an hour to shop , though , so he picked out one of the mockup rooms and told a salesperson he wanted to buy everything in it , just as it was .
The consequence of this , he realized when the furniture arrived , was that his apartment looked like a hotel room , but at least there was stuff on the floor .
“ You ’re freaking out , ” Chang said .
“ Let ’s go cook , dude . ”
“ This is awesome ! ” Chang cried to Serpico , running his hands along the countertop .
For the first time , Ko was starting to look like a restaurant .
It was filthy , it was tiny , it was constructed almost entirely of plywood — walls , doors , counter , cabinets — but it was a restaurant , and soon they would cook there .
“ Telepan saw this last night , ” Chang said .
Bill Telepan runs the restaurant Telepan , on the Upper West Side .
“ He laughed his ass off .
He ’s like , ‘ This is the smallest fucking place I ’ve ever gotten into . ’
You ’re a dumb man , Serpico .
Nobody in their right mind would do something like this . ”
Chang was hoping that the opening of Ko would be marginally less disastrous than the opening of his first two restaurants , but he was expecting the worst .
Already they ’d saved themselves from several ideas that , in retrospect , seemed to them so incredibly stupid it was hard to believe they ’d had them in the first place .
The idea that the cooks would wash all the dishes themselves during service , for instance .
That had been a kind of principled thing for Chang — he felt that no one who worked for Momofuku should be too proud to help out with the grossest tasks in the kitchen — but it was still a really bad idea .
They were sticking to the concept that there would be no servers , because Chang wanted the cooks to get all the tips .
( “ Servers are such greedy bastards , ” he says .
A server at Ssäm Bar could bring in seventeen hundred dollars in a week working thirty - two hours ; a cook working the same hours would earn three hundred and fifty . )
On the other hand , most cooks were not fully domesticated , and it was already expecting kind of a lot to have them do their job two feet from normal people who were paying to have a pleasant evening .
( Ko is set up like a sushi bar , with all the customers at a counter facing the stoves . )
Asking them to act like waiters as well might be one step too far .
It was unbelievable how many decisions had to be made before they opened .
Just figuring out how to pour the miso soup into bowls in front of the customer had taken a whole discussion with Cory Lane .
( Cory Lane manages the front of the house — servers , setup , beverages — at all three restaurants .
He went to cooking school , decided that he was n’t a very good cook , and became a wine expert instead . )
“ What would be easier is maybe a small pot , like something ghetto , and then just pour it in , ” Chang had said .
“ No , you ’re leaning over and you pour it from the pan , ” Serpico said .
“ It ’s gonna get all over the place ! ” Chang said .
“ You wanna spoon it or ladle it .
Like a teapot , dude . ”
“ With those sake carafes , you can do them ahead of time and they hold hot for a little while , ” Lane suggested .
“ I do n’t know , man .
You reach over and you pour it right in their bowl , ” Serpico said , pouring the liquid from a tiny saucepan into a bowl over the back of a spoon , so that it flowed smoothly and did n’t splash .
“ That I like , pouring it over the back of the spoon like that , ” Lane said approvingly .
“ I mean , you can go anywhere and have a soup poured tableside out of a fucking pitcher .
I like that . ”
In the beginning , Chang ’s whole goal was to open a noodle bar .
He did n’t really give much thought to what he would do with it once he did .
When he thinks back on the ridiculous way he went about starting his first restaurant , four years ago , and the way it succeeded so wildly , despite his complete ignorance of the business and all the mistakes he made as a consequence , and led to another restaurant , and then another , and all the chef ’s prizes he ’s received since , it all seems to him like an impossible fairy tale , and he becomes convinced that it could vanish at any moment .
“ I feel like I did n’t deserve any of this , ” he says .
“ I blame my parents for my guilty conscience .
Growing up , no one ever told me , ‘ Dave , you ’re smart , you ’re fast , you ’re witty ’— it was quite the opposite .
I ’m still so insecure , I feel like I ’m Forrest Gump — I ’m mildly retarded , and people are , like , ‘ Look how far this guy has come ! ’ ”
Chang ’s parents emigrated from Korea as adults in the nineteen - sixties , he from North Korea , she from South .
His father , Joe , had fifty dollars when he arrived .
He started out working as a dishwasher in New York , and later moved to a suburb of Washington , D.C. , and opened a couple of delis .
He began making real money when David was a teen - ager ( David is the youngest of four ) , with a golf - supplies business .
David became a junior golf champion but quit when he was thirteen .
Chang was miserable in school and claims to have failed everything .
“ I never even made the high - school golf team , ” he says .
“ I was too much of a head case .
Remember that scene in ‘ The Royal Tenenbaums ’ when Luke Wilson ’s playing tennis and crying and he throws his shoe ?
That ’s what I was like . ”
He went to Trinity College , in Connecticut , but says he only got in because he was Asian ; he smoked pot almost every day .
But one thing that interested him was religion — his parents and his sister were very involved with a Korean Presbyterian church , and he had turned against that — so he became a religion major and wrote a thesis on Thoreau .
Something about the mindful ordinariness of “ Walden ” appealed to him — the elevation of daily repetitions into an honorable way of life .
“ Even menial tasks such as domestic chores were a pleasant pastime , ” Chang wrote .
“ He enjoyed these duties because he completed them with painstaking diligence . ”
After college , he spent six months at the French Culinary Institute ; at the same time , he worked the dinner shift at Mercer Kitchen and , on his days off , answered phones at Craft until he got a job as a cook .
Meanwhile , for years he ’d been obsessed with ramen ( “ momofuku ” means “ lucky peach , ” but it is also the name of the man who invented packaged ramen noodles ) , and he knew he wanted to apprentice in a Japanese noodle shop .
Finally , an opportunity presented itself : his aunt was friends with Reverend Paul Hwang , a Korean businessman who had turned a building he owned in Tokyo into a combination church and men ’s homeless shelter , with a ramen shop on the first floor .
Reverend Hwang said that Chang could live in the homeless shelter and work in the ramen shop .
As it turned out , Reverend Hwang ’s ramen shop was one of the few really bad ramen shops in Tokyo , so Chang did n’t stay there for long , but his true apprenticeship came from eating around the city and realizing what it meant to live in a food culture where even the smallest , cheapest place served food more delicious than you could get in half the restaurants in Manhattan .
“ Sorry , you ca n’t be Client 9 — we ’re retiring that number . ”

When he got back to New York , he got a job at Café Boulud , a three - star restaurant on the Upper East Side then being run by Andrew Carmellini .
He worked six or seven days a week , fifteen - hour days ( though only because he felt he had to get there two hours early to keep up ) .
It was brutal .
“ Café Boulud was intentionally difficult , ” he says .
“ It was chip - on - your - shoulder cooking , like , all these other restaurants have twice as many cooks , all this new equipment , and we ’re gonna fucking outcook them with nothing but our sheer will and technique . ”
But it was n’t just machismo — it was also beautiful .
“ Andrew knows how things should taste , ” Chang says .
“ It ’s crystal clear in his mind .
There were so many instances when he was , like , ‘ It ’s missing something , do this , ’ and it ’s fucking perfect . ”
Chang felt lucky to be working in such a kitchen , but he was preoccupied with trouble at home — fights between his father and his oldest brother over the family business , then his mother being diagnosed with cancer — and he could feel that he was starting to freak out .
His hands were shaking so much that he could n’t sauce plates .
Finally , he had an epiphany .
“ Why ca n’t I cook something simple ? ” he said to himself .
“ I ’m not an awesome cook — I just want to make noodles . ”
He quit Café Boulud and moved home for a while to help take care of his mother .
Then he put together a business plan , asked his father for just shy of two hundred thousand dollars in seed money , and started looking for a place to open a noodle bar .
Still more Tropic Thunder outrage .
The head of The Arc — the world 's largest grassroots organization supporting people with intellectual and developmental abilities — is calling on Ben Stiller to have a sit down and meet with people with disabilities and their families , to help him understand why his movie offended them .
They 're also demanding that Stiller , Paramount and DreamWorks issue an official apology .
So , funny little trivia I found out .
The Arc was originally an acronym .
When it started , the organization operated under the name The Association of Retarded Children .
Since expanding its function beyond children , they stopped calling themselves that .
More than 780 chapters of The Arc across the United States will be at movie theaters throughout the weekend handing out flyers condemning the word " retard " and urging people to stay away from the movie .
Arya's hot tip of the day : if you do n't want to be bothered by flyers , go see the movie at malls .
Most malls do n't allow distribution of leaflets and protests inside the premises , as it would be considered tresspassing , so they can only campaign on the parking lot .
The open letter follows :
Scientists have created a robot controlled by a biological brain made of rat neurons .
The robot , named Gordon , is not exactly an Einstein but represents a remarkable bridging of the gap between biology and technology .
Gordon relies a dish with about 60 electrodes to pick up electrical signals generated by the brain cells .
The brain drives the robot 's movements .
Every time the robot nears an object , signals are directed to stimulate the brain by means of the electrodes , the researchers explained in a statement released today by the University of Reading in England .
In response , the brain 's output drives the robot's wheels left and right , so that it moves around in an attempt to avoid hitting objects .
The robot has no additional control from a human or a computer , the scientists state .
Its sole means of control is from its own brain .
" This new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body , and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorizes its experiences , " said the university 's Kevin Warwick of the School of Systems Engineering .
" This research will move our understanding forward of how brains work , and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine . "
The researchers aim to get the robot to learn , by applying different signals as it moves into predefined positions .
That might allow them to witness how memories manifest themselves in the brain when the robot revisits familiar territory .
They hope the work will eventually lead to a better understanding of Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , stroke and brain injuries .
" One of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms , " said Ben Whalley , a pharmacist at the university and member of the team that built Gordon .
" This project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors , but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons .
Hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions . "
The project was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
PRINCETON , NJ -- According to a Sept. 26-27 USA
Today / Gallup poll , just 27 % of Americans approve of the job George W. Bush is doing as president , the lowest rating of his presidency .
The new personal low rating for Bush comes amid the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street in recent weeks .
Bush 's approval rating has declined from 31 % in the previous Gallup Poll , conducted before the crisis intensified with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the near - collapse of Merrill Lynch , and the federal government bailout of AIG .
It is down 6 points from 33 % just after the Republican National Convention early this month .
Bush 's previous low had been 28 % , measured at several points earlier this year .
( The most recent poll was conducted before the House of Representatives voted down a bill to address the problems on Monday . )
The timing of the decline strongly suggests that it is because of the financial crisis , and the government 's largely unpopular response to it .
In a separate question in the Sept. 26 - 27 poll , only 28 % of Americans approved and 68 % disapproved of Bush 's response to the financial crisis -- the worst of six government leaders tested in the poll ( although no leader received a majority positive response ) .
While most Americans agreed that some type of government action is necessary to address the crisis , last week only a small minority seemed to favor passing a bill similar to the Bush administration 's original proposal .
Republicans are mostly responsible for the further erosion in Bush 's job rating .
Sixty - four percent of Republicans approve of Bush , down from 71 % in the prior poll .
Independents ' and Democrats ' ratings are essentially the same as two weeks ago .
There has been an even sharper drop in Bush 's ratings among self - identified conservatives , from 59 % to 47 % , likely reflecting opposition to the expansion of government involvement in the economy that the Bush administration proposed .
Bush 's Long Losing Streak Continues
Low approval ratings have become routine for Bush .
He has not had an approval rating above 40 % for over two years , and only a handful of ratings at or above 50 % his entire second term in office .
The low ratings throughout much of his second term have arguably been because of the unpopular war in Iraq .
But as conditions for the United States in Iraq have improved in the past year , the economy has gotten much worse and has served as an anchor on Bush 's ratings .
Bush has registered 28 % approval ratings several times this year , in the spring and summer months as gas prices rose .
His high rating for the year is only 34 % .
The all - time low rating for any president is 22 % , for Harry Truman in February 1952 .
Bush now joins Truman and Richard Nixon as the only presidents who have had approval ratings of 27 % or lower in Gallup Polls .
Bush , like Truman , has the distinction of having some of the highest individual approval ratings in Gallup polling history and some of the lowest .
That includes a record - high 90 % approval rating for Bush just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Truman recorded an 87 % approval in 1945 just after V - E Day .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,011 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Sept. 26 - 27 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Search Google for “ web application MVC patterns ” or any variant thereof , and the vast majority of results will talk about the server side MVC .
This traditional answer will tell you the browser sits outside the MVC altogether , and sends in HTTP requests that are handled by the Controller , then all the MVC garble happens , and finally the View spits out a brand new HTML page ( or XML / JSON for AJAX ) for the browser to consume .
All this ends up looking something like :
“ So what ’s the problem with this model ? ” you ask ?
The JavaScript layer of course 😉 .
All of the code that runs in the browser does n’t fit anywhere inside the classic MVC architecture .
What ends up happening is usually one of two things :
All of the JavaScript in an app is completely unmanaged , and it ends up looking like spaghetti , or The server side View tries to manage and encompass everything that happens in the browser – including JS – and the code still looks like spaghetti
The “ honest ” version of the above diagram should really look more like this :
Clearly this is n’t any way to design an app .
JavaScript and AJAX have become increasingly important in an application ’s user interface , and many web apps entirely depend on it .
There has to be a better way to organize the JavaScript in your app to be more efficient , testable , and most importantly – manageable .
What ’s needed is to rethink web application architecture .
What ’s needed is a new MVC pattern - er , patterns .
The solution is to not only build an MVC on your server , but also a second MVC in JavaScript .
Stop thinking of your web app as a web app .
Instead – think of it as two : one in the browser and one on your server .
This architecture lets you isolate JavaScript code that ’s inherent to AJAX and your data , letting you build a bridge between your JavaScript UI and your server .
What ’s more , it does it in an organized and manageable way .
Now all of your JavaScript UI code does n’t need to be re-hacked every time you make a slight change to your AJAX responses , and all of your AJAX code does n’t have to care about what div is updating or what widget is changing which other widget .
Data code manages data , view code manages view , and a controller to tie it all together .
To demonstrate how easy it is to set up a client - side MVC , I ’ve released my first JavaScript tutorial that walks through exactly this : creating an MVC in JavaScript using JQuery .
I ’ve also set up a tutorials section on the site ( this being the only tutorial so far : P ) and hope to expand over the coming weeks and months .
Also be sure to check out Listotron.com , a project Buck and I are starting that will be using exactly this architecture .
This is a relationship blog , that means we will cover all parts of relationships and how to deal with them , including how to start one ( how to pick up chicks , woot !
and for girls , how to attract the RIGHT guy ) , how to deal with various problems once it gets going , how to make your partner happy , dealing with marriage , dealing with break - up and divorce , how to get your ex back ( if you want ) , how to move on when it ’s over , etc. etc. etc .
Right now I ’d just like to cover a few very general , basic , ground rules for relationships that I ’ve gotten from my own experience and from talking with friends :
Choose a partner wisely and well .
We are attracted to people for all kinds of reasons .
They remind us of someone from our past .
They shower us with gifts and make us feel important .
Evaluate a potential partner as you would a friend ; look at their character , personality , values , their generosity of spirit , the relationship between their words and actions , their relationships with others .
No “ zinging . ”
Many of us think a little , friendly “ zing ” or sarcastic remark is harmless .
Not so .
In fact , one of the number - one indicators of underlying conflict or negativity within a work environment or relationship is increased sarcasm .
There is nothing harmless about it .
( teasing is ok , just do n’t be insulting , no matter how mild or ‘ harmless ’ you think it is )
Do n’t interrupt .
It ’s not only rude , but it often creates the opposite of what we want to achieve .
When we interrupt , we generally think we will end or reduce the length of the conversation , but the opposite is true .
Respect , respect , respect .
Inside and outside the relationship , act in ways so that your partner always maintains respect for you .
Mutual respect is essential to a good relationship .
Learn to negotiate .
Modern relationships no longer rely on roles cast by the culture .
Couples create their own roles , so that virtually every act requires negotiation .
It works best when good will prevails .
Because people ’s needs are fluid and change over time , and life ’s demands change too , good relationships are negotiated and renegotiated all the time .
Accept and embrace your partner ’s differences .
You get out of it what you put into it .
Remember your partner is n’t perfect .
Many times we love our partner so much that we see them as more perfect than other people in our life .
In this light , we hold them to an ideal , one that embraces the thought that this person will not hurt us .
Treat your spouse with the respect and kindness you show your friends .
You married your best friend , but sometimes you may not feel this way .
Still , they deserve the courtesies and kindness you bestow on your friends .
( maybe seems stupidly obvious , but if you ’ve ever seen a couple quarreling and saying things to each other so nasty that you would n’t say them to your worst enemy , you know what I mean )
Make Time to Cuddle .
Cuddling is romantic and proven to produce closeness between couples .
However , spouses should part ways once they drift off into a deep sleep .
If not , they will only wake up to a hot , sweaty , clingy entanglement .
This is obviously not what spouses want to associate cuddling with .
Keep the drama out of your relationship !
Many people have a secret ( or not so secret ) penchant for drama .
The popularity of reality tv shows is evidence of this phenomenon .
And it ’s not just women tuning in to watch the highly competitive and sometimes back - stabbing among “ Project Runway ” designers and models for example .
High - adrenaline shows marketed towards men like “ Deadliest Catch ” about the Alaskan crab fishing industry is wrought with tension , fighting , mishaps and roller coaster emotions .
Drama is just fine when you choose to watch it on tv , but it can prevent connection in your love relationship .
I just saw U2 3D film ( click here to view it ) and I was very impacted by this concert .
Bono ’s message of peace pervaded the entire film and along with the dynamic music and talented musicians , this was quite an experience .
The message was clear in this film –Coexist even though we are all different .
Enlarge By John Moore , Getty Images Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , carrying the briefcase , visits Ramadi , Iraq , on Sept. 6 , 2007 .
Private contractors help the United States provide security when diplomats and other VIPs visit Iraq .
WASHINGTON  The United States is spending more money than ever on private security contractors in Iraq as thousands of troops return home amid steady declines in insurgent attacks , federal records show .
This year , spending on contractors , who protect diplomats , civilian facilities and supply convoys , is projected to exceed $ 1.2 billion , according to federal contract and budget data obtained by USA TODAY .
Most of that bill — about $ 1 billion — is State Department spending , which is up 13 % over 2007 .
The remaining $ 200 million covers Pentagon contracts .
Rising private security costs come as the Pentagon removes the last of the 30,000 extra troops sent to Iraq last year .
Contractors take on roles once handled by U.S. troops , such as securing Iraq 's infrastructure and guarding reconstruction supplies .
Congress is raising concerns about the costs of relying on contractors for that work and the challenges of ensuring that they are supervised properly .
" While security is obviously necessary for American officials in Iraq , we should be transitioning reconstruction to the Iraqi government , which is capable of supporting many of these efforts with its … oil revenues , " says Rep. Nita Lowey , D - N.Y. , who chairs a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending for Iraq reconstruction .
Lowey calls the security costs " exorbitant . "
She has pushed legislation to boost contracting oversight by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction .
Overall U.S. private security spending in Iraq has grown dramatically since the war started in March 2003 , the new spending figures show .
Concern over supervision of these contractors has heightened since guards with Blackwater Worldwide shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians while escorting a State Department officer in Baghdad in September 2007 .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrell said the guards acted in self - defense .
The Justice Department is investigating ; no charges have been filed .
State 's contractor spending has climbed because the focus in Iraq has shifted from combat to rebuilding , department press officer John Fleming says .
More diplomats are leaving secure areas to work in the field , where they need security , he says .
At the same time , U.S. troops who once guarded reconstruction projects and Iraqi infrastructure are leaving .
Contractors " will increasingly take over these former military roles and missions , increasing ( the ) numbers of private security , " Fleming says , noting that the new oversight policies will " hold contractors accountable . "
In recent months , State and the Pentagon have developed policies governing the conduct of security contractors , who are immune from Iraqi law .
State can impose administrative penalties for misconduct in Iraq ; Pentagon contractors are subject to the military justice system .
The Pentagon and the State Department have committed to work with Congress to enact legislation to increase legal accountability for all U.S. government contractors in Iraq .
U.S. contractors in Iraq perform other work beyond security , such as construction and transportation services .
A Congressional Budget Office report released this month showed that U.S. agencies spent a total of $ 85 billion on contractors of all types in Iraq from 2003 through 2007 — about 20 % of all U.S. spending for operations in the country during that period .
Some security costs may be undocumented because they 're buried inside contracts for other services , the report said .
That 's an unacceptable lack of clarity , says Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa. , who chairs the House subcommittee that controls defense spending .
He has proposed to cut $ 4.5 billion from contracting accounts in next year 's defense budget and add $ 943 million to other Pentagon accounts so more of the work can be shifted to civilian government employees .

The last census showed there were just 819 women aged 20 - 24 in Mount Isa
The mayor of a remote Australian mining town has come under fire after saying that female " ugly ducklings " might benefit from its shortage of women .
John Molony told a newspaper last week that " with five blokes to every girl , may I suggest that beauty - disadvantaged women should proceed to Mount Isa " .
The council has since been swamped with complaints from both men and women .
But Mr Molony has refused to apologise for the remarks , saying he was " telling it like it is " in the Queensland town .
Located 1,829 km ( 1,136 miles ) from Brisbane , Mount Isa is home to one of the world 's biggest underground mines .
In 2006 , there were just 819 women aged 20 - 24 living there out of a total population of 21,421 , according to the most recent census .
' Lonely women '
In an interview with the Townsville Bulletin last week , Mr Molony proposed a novel solution to Mount Isa 's shortage of eligible women .
It 's an absolute disgrace - it's not council 's view and it's not mine
Mount Isa Councillor Jean Ferris
" Quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face .
Whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening , there is a degree of happiness , " he said .
" Some , in other places in Australia , need to proceed to Mount Isa where happiness awaits .
Really , beauty is only skin deep .
Is n't there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan , " he added .
A fellow councillor , Jean Ferris , said the invitation to " beauty - disadvantaged women " had caused consternation among both sexes .
" It 's an absolute disgrace , " she told the Courier Mail .
" It 's not council 's view and it 's not mine .
It 's hard when you 've got to defend something someone else has said .
We 're definitely appalled . "
Mr Molony has since refused to retract his remarks and insisted he is " a bloke who respects women " .
" I believe we should look after women , " he said .
" I 'm told men outnumber women here by five to one .
If that 's the case , then perhaps it 's an opportunity for some lonely women . "

Nanotech Research Could Remove Need For Hydrogen
In Fuel Cells
August 8th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Fuel cells have long been hailed as a promising technology , but they face a major hurdle : the need for hydrogen , which is usually derived from oil and gas .
Now a research team from the University of Virginia is trying to change that .
The team will divide its research into two parts .
One part of the project will try to create a “ solar cell ” to gather energy from the sun , and the other part will attempt to use nano - scale structures to create a fuel cell that can transform renewable biofuels into electricity .
Working at a nano level will make ion reactions quicker and more efficient than they would be otherwise , and it will be easier to control any problems that come up .
Ultimately , the goal is to create a fuel cell that could provide enough power for an entire town or city block .
Similar research into alternative methods of powering fuel cells is also being performed by other groups , including Innovatek and a team at Aberdeen University .
But do n’t hold your breath waiting for a fuel cell to power your house ; we probably wo n’t see tangible results from these studies for many years .

Mid-1970s : Hawks , Neoconservatives Join Forces to Oppose Detente , Arms Control Talks
The middle of the 1970s sees a fundamental paradigm shift among American conservatives and some formerly liberal intellectuals .
' Hawks ' Disenchanted with Detente - Republican and Democratic “ hawks , ” defined by author J. Peter Scoblic as relatively conservative “ establishment policy makers who played a higher premium on confrontation and the use of military force than did their more ‘ dovish ’ colleagues , ” become more and more disenchanted with the US ’s relations with the Soviet Union .
They do n’t believe that the program of detente — a gradual thawing of relations that foresees the end of the Cold War — has provided the US with any real benefits , but has allowed the USSR to build an enormous military and nuclear stockpile , more than enough to coerce the US into following its wishes .
This reflects the mindset of former presidential candidate Barry Goldwater ( R - AZ ) , who had fought negotiations with the USSR since the Eisenhower administration .
Anti-Communist ' Neoconservatives ' -
On the other side of the debate , a group of formerly liberal intellectuals unhappy with the Democratic Party ’s pacifist post - Vietnam foreign policy positions find themselves bringing their militantly anti-Communist views across the aisle to join forces with their former conservative opponents .
This group will eventually dub themselves “ neoconservatives ” ( see Late 1930s - 1950s ) .
Joining Forces - Scoblic will write : “ Like sheets of ice calving away from a glacier , the hawks and the neoconservatives fell away into the sea of conservative discontent that had been lapping at Washington ’s centrist foreign policy establishment for decades .
These converts shared the conservative belief that , in the Soviet Union , the United States faced an ideological enemy with messianic goals .
The neoconservatives , particularly , subscribed to the simplistic good - versus - evil , us - versus - them schema that animated the Right .
They believed that there were clear sides in the Cold War and worried that Democrats had forgotten this defining principle .
The hawks were less moralistic but no less explicit in their assessment of the Soviet threat .
They agreed that MAD [ the theory of nuclear “ mutual assured destruction ” that says neither side will risk nuclear war because of the likelihood that both sides will be destroyed ] was a choice , that nuclear war fighting was a better strategy , and that negotiation was of little value — and in doing so they effectively accepted the Manichaean worldview that had led conservatives to the same conclusion .
' Systematic Failures ' of US Intelligence Community -
The neoconservatives in particular bring the view that the US intelligence community has , through incompetence or perhaps outright collusion with the Soviets , systematically underestimated the Soviet threat for years , and their own assessments — based on instinct and political convictions rather than ascertainable data — are inherently more accurate than those of the CIA or the NSA .
“ In essence , ” Scoblic will write , “ they argued that the nature of the Cold War was something to be morally intuited , not empirically observed . ”

1980 : Israeli Prime Minister Begin Curries Favor of US Televangelist Jerry Falwell Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin seeks to expand his base of influence in the US .
Israel has long enjoyed the support of liberal Democrats , so Begin begins reaching out to conservative American evangelicals who , in many cases , espouse anti-Semitic views ( see February 1 , 1972 ) .
But more important to Begin is the fact that these conservative Christians are becoming politically active and powerful .
Begin seeks out conservative televangelist and political activist Jerry Falwell , who publicly views the birth of Israel as “ the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy . ”
Falwell has often said that the friendship between the US and Israel is a cornerstone both of political stability in the Middle East and a matter of faith .
Begin presents Falwell with the prestigious Jabotinsky Award , making Falwell the first non-Jew to ever receive the award .
More tangibly , he also gives Falwell ’s ministry a private jet .

1981 -1983 : US Launches Military PSYOPS Missions Designed to Agitate , Frighten Soviets
The US begins launching what the Pentagon calls “ psychological operations , ” or PSYOPS , against the USSR .
The operations consist in part of military exercises designed to agitate and frighten the USSR into believing the US might be preparing for a military assault .
Few outside of the White House and the Pentagon ’s top officials — and Soviet officials , of course — know about the series of provocative exercises .
Undersecretary of Defense Fred Ikle will later recall : “ It was very sensitive .
Nothing was written down about it , so there would be no paper trail . ”
The idea behind the operations is to keep the Soviets off - balance about what , if anything , the US might do .
It also is designed to probe for gaps and vulnerabilities in the Soviets ’ early warning intelligence system .
General Jack Chain , a Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) commander , will later recall : “ Sometimes we would send bombers over the North Pole and their radars would click on .
Other times fighter - bombers would probe their Asian or European periphery . ”
Sometimes the operations send out several probes in a week , coming at irregular intervals to make the effect that much more unsettling .
Then the probes stop , only to begin again several weeks later .
Undersecretary of State for Military Assistance and Technology Dr. William Schneider will later recall : “ It really got to them .
They did n’t know what it all meant .
A squadron would fly straight at Soviet airspace , and other radars would light up and units would go on alert .
Then at the last minute the squadron would peel off and return home . ”
The operations include naval incursions as well as aerial missions , with US aircraft carrier groups regularly conducting exercises alarmingly close to Soviet military and industrial sites , often without being detected until the groups are already in place .
Some exercises simulate surprise attacks on Soviet targets , sometimes simulating air assaults on Soviet fighter units .
The naval pressure is particularly intense in the area of the North Atlantic called the “ Greenland - Iceland - United Kingdom ( GIUK ) gap . ” [ Fischer , 3/19/2007 ] Entity Tags : William Schneider Jr. , Fred C.

Bazaar 1.6 released !
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -----
Hash : SHA1
Finally , the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released .
This release includes new features like Stacked Branches , improved weave merge , and an updated server protocol ( now on v3 ) which will allow for better cross version compatibility .
With this release we have deprecated Knit format repositories , and recommend that users upgrade them , we will continue to support reading and writing them for the forseeable future , but we will not be tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to be better at scaling .
This will also be the first release to bundle TortoiseBzr in the standalone Windows installer .
This was an extended release cycle , and more work than normal went into this release .
Many thanks to all the people who contributed development time , bug reports , and polish to all parts of Bazaar .
Our next release ( 1.7 ) should be back on our normal time - based release schedule .
The source code and changelog is available at : https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6/
Ubuntu packages will be available from the bzr ppa : https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive
Windows and Mac installers should be available soon from : http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download John =:->
Release Notes for all changes since bzr 1.5 : bzr 1.6 2008-08-25 - ------------------
Finally , the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released .
This release includes new features like Stacked Branches , improved weave merge , and an updated server protocol ( now on v3 ) which will allow for better cross version compatibility .
With this release we have deprecated Knit format repositories , and recommend that users upgrade them , we will continue to support reading and writing them for the forseeable future , but we will not be tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to be better at scaling .
This will also be the first release to bundle TortoiseBzr in the standalone Windows installer .
bzr 1.6rc5 2008-08-19 - ---------------------
BUG FIXES : * Disable automatic detection of stacking based on a containing directory of the target .
It interacted badly with push , and needs a bit more work to get the edges polished before it should happen automatically .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 259275 ) bzr 1.6rc4 2008-08-18 - ---------------------
BUG FIXES : * Fix a regression in knit => pack fetching .
We had a logic inversion , causing the fetch to insert fulltexts in random order , rather than preserving deltas .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 256757 ) bzr 1.6rc3 2008-08-14 - ---------------------
CHANGES : * Disable reading `` . bzrrules`` as a per -branch rule preferences file .
The feature was not quite ready for a full release .
( Robert Collins ) IMPROVEMENTS : * Update the windows installer to bundle TortoiseBzr and ``qbzr`` into the standalone installer .
This will be the first official windows release that installs Tortoise by default .
( Mark Hammond ) BUG FIXES : * Fix a regression in ``bzr +http`` support .
There was a missing function ( ``_read_line`` ) that needed to be carried over from ``bzr + ssh`` support .
( Andrew Bennetts ) * ``GraphIndex`` objects will internally read an entire index if more than 1/20th of their keyspace is requested in a single operation .
This largely mitigates a performance regression in ``bzr log FILE`` and completely corrects the performance regression in ``bzr log`` .
The regression was caused by removing an accomodation which had been supporting the index format in use .
A newer index format is in development which is substantially faster .
( Robert Collins ) bzr 1.6rc2 2008-08-13 - ---------------------
This release candidate has a few minor bug fixes , and some regression fixes for Windows .
BUG FIXES : * ``bzr upgrade`` on remote branches accessed via bzr :// and bzr+ssh :// now works .
( Andrew Bennetts ) * Change the ``get_format_description ( ) `` strings for ``Repository FormatKnitPack5 `` et al to be single line messages .
( Aaron Bentley ) *
Fix for a regression on Win32 where we would try to call ``os.
listdir ( ) `` on a file and not catch the exception properly .
( Windows raises a different exception . )
This would manifest in places like ``bzr rm file`` or ``bzr switch`` .
( Mark Hammond , John Arbash Meinel ) * ``Inventory.copy ( ) `` was failing to set the revision property for the root entry .
( Jelmer Vernooij ) * sftp transport : added missing ``FileExists`` case to ``_translate_io_exception`` ( Christophe Troestler , # 123475 ) *
The help for ``bzr ignored`` now suggests ``bzr ls -- ignored`` for scripting use .
( Robert Collins , # 3834 ) *
The default ``annotate`` logic will now always assign the last - modified value of a line to one of the revisions that modified it , rather than a merge revision .
This would happen when both sides claimed to have modified the line resulting in the same text .
The choice is arbitrary but stable , so merges in different directions will get the same results .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 232188 ) bzr 1.6rc1 2008-08-06 - ---------------------
This release candidate for bzr 1.6 solidifies the new branch stacking feature .
Bazaar now recommends that users upgrade all knit repositories , because later formats are much faster .
However , we plan to continue read / write and upgrade support for knit repostories for the forseeable future .
Several other bugs and performance issues were fixed .
CHANGES : * Knit format repositories are deprecated and bzr will now emit warnings whenever it encounters one .
Use ``bzr upgrade`` to upgrade knit repositories to pack format .
( Andrew Bennetts ) IMPROVEMENTS : * ``bzr check`` can now be told which elements at a location it should check .
( Daniel Watkins ) * Commit now supports `` -- exclude`` ( or `` - x`` ) to exclude some files from the commit .
( Robert Collins , # 3117 ) * Fetching data between repositories that have the same model but no optimised fetcher will not reserialise all the revisions , increasing performance .
( Robert Collins , John Arbash Meinel ) *
Give a more specific error when target branch is not reachable .
( James Westby ) * Implemented a custom ``walkdirs_utf8 `` implementation for win32 .
This uses a pyrex extension to get direct access to the ``FindFirstFileW`` style apis , rather than using ``listdir`` + ``lstat`` .
Shows a very strong improvement in commands like ``status`` and ``diff`` which have to iterate the working tree .
Anywhere from 2 x - 6 x faster depending on the size of the tree ( bigger trees , bigger benefit . ) ( John Arbash Meinel ) * New registry for log properties handles and the method in LongLogFormatter to display the custom properties returned by the registered handlers .
( Guillermo Gonzalez , # 162469 ) BUG FIXES : * Add more tests that stacking does not create deltas spanning physical repository boundaries .
( Martin Pool , # 252428 ) * Better message about incompatible repositories .
( Martin Pool , # 206258 ) * ``bzr branch -- stacked`` ensures the destination branch format can support stacking , even if the origin does not .
( Martin Pool ) * ``bzr export`` no longer exports ``. bzrrules`` .
( Ian Clatworthy ) * ``bzr serve -- directory = / `` now correctly allows the whole filesystem to be accessed on Windows , not just the root of the drive that Python is running from .
( Adrian Wilkins , # 240910 ) * Deleting directories by hand before running ``bzr rm`` will not cause subsequent errors in ``bzr st`` and ``bzr commit`` .
( Robert Collins , # 150438 ) *
Fix a test case that was failing if encoding was n't UTF - 8 . ( John Arbash Meinel , # 247585 ) * Fix " no buffer space available " error when branching with the new smart server protocol to or from Windows .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 246180 ) * Fixed problem in branching from smart server .
( #249256 , Michael Hudson , Martin Pool ) * Handle a file turning in to a directory in TreeTransform .
( James Westby , # 248448 ) API CHANGES : * ``MutableTree.commit`` has an extra optional keywork parameter ``exclude`` that will be unconditionally supplied by the command line UI - plugins that add tree formats may need an update .
( Robert Collins ) *
The API minimum version for plugin compatibility has been raised to 1.6 - there are significant changes throughout the code base .
( Robert Collins ) *
The generic fetch code now uses three attributes on Repository objects to control fetch .
The streams requested are controlled via : ``_fetch_order`` and ``_fetch_uses_deltas`` .
Setting these appropriately allows different repository implementations to recieve data in their optimial form .
If the ``_fetch_reconcile`` is set then a reconcile operation is triggered at the end of the fetch .
( Robert Collins ) *
The ``put_on_disk`` and ``get_tar_item`` methods in ``InventoryEntry`` were deprecated .
( Ian Clatworthy ) * ``Repository.is_shared`` does n't take a read lock .
It did n't need one in the first place ( nobody cached the value , and ``RemoteRepository`` was n't taking one either ) .
This saves a round trip when probing Pack repositories , as they read the ``pack - names`` file when locked .
And during probe , locking the repo is n't very useful .
( John Arbash Meinel ) INTERNALS : * ``bzrlib.branchbuilder .BranchBuilder`` is now much more capable of putting together a real history without having to create a full WorkingTree .
It is recommended that tests that are not directly testing the WorkingTree use BranchBuilder instead .
See ``BranchBuilder.build_snapshot`` or ``TestCaseWithMemoryTree.make_branch_builder`` .
( John Arbash Meinel ) * ``bzrlib.builtins.internal_tree_files`` broken into two giving a new helper ``safe_relpath_files`` - used by the new ``exclude`` parameter to commit .
( Robert Collins ) * Make it easier to introduce new WorkingTree formats .
( Ian Clatworthy ) *
The code for exporting trees was refactored not to use the deprecated ``Inventory Entry`` methods .
( Ian Clatworthy ) * RuleSearchers return ( ) instead of [ ] now when there are no matches .
( Ian Clatworthy ) bzr 1.6beta3 2008-07-17 - -----------------------
This release adds a new ' stacked branches ' feature allowing branches to share storage without being in the same repository or on the same machine .
( See the user guide for more details . )
It also adds a new hook , improved weaves , aliases for related locations , faster bzr+ssh push , and several bug fixes .
FEATURES : * New ``pre_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called before the branch tip is moved , while the branch is write - locked .
See the User Reference for signature details .
( Andrew Bennetts ) * Rule - based preferences can now be defined for selected files in selected branches , allowing commands and plugins to provide custom behaviour for files matching defined patterns .
See ``Rule - based preferences`` ( part of ``Configuring Bazaar`` ) in the User Guide and ``bzr help rules`` for more information .
( Ian Clatworthy ) * Sites may suggest a branch to stack new branches on .
( Aaron Bentley ) * Stacked branches are now supported .
See ``bzr help branch`` and ``bzr help push`` .
Branches must be in the ``development1 `` format to stack , though the stacked - on branch can be of any format .
( Robert Collins ) IMPROVEMENTS : * ``bzr export -- format=tgz -- root=NAME
-`` to export a gzipped tarball to stdout ; also ``tar`` and ``tbz2`` .
( Martin Pool ) * ``bzr ( re ) merge -- weave`` will now use a standard Weave algorithm , rather than the annotation - based merge it was using .
It does so by building up a Weave of the important texts , without needing to build the full ancestry .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 238895 ) * ``bzr send`` documents and better supports ``emacsclient`` ( proper escaping of mail headers and handling of the MUA Mew ) .
( Christophe Troestler ) * Remembered locations can be specified by aliases , e.g. : parent , :public , :submit . ( Aaron Bentley ) *
The smart protocol now has improved support for setting branches ' revision info directly .
This makes operations like push faster .
The new request method name is ``Branch.set_last_revision_ex`` . ( Andrew Bennetts ) BUG FIXES : * Bazaar is now able to be a client to the web server of IIS 6 and 7 .
The broken implementations of RFC822 in Python and RFC2046 in IIS combined with boundary - line checking in Bazaar previously made this impossible .
( NB , IIS 5 does not suffer from this problem ) .
( Adrian Wilkins , # 247585 ) * ``bzr log -- long`` with a ghost in your mainline now handles that ghost properly .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 243536 ) * ``check`` handles the split - up . bzr layout correctly , so no longer requires a branch to be present .
( Daniel Watkins , # 64783 ) * Clearer message about how to set the PYTHONPATH if bzrlib can't be loaded .
( Martin Pool , # 205230 ) * Errors about missing libraries are now shown without a traceback , and with a suggestion to install the library .
The full traceback is still in `` .bzr.log`` and can be shown with `` -Derror`` .
( Martin Pool , # 240161 ) * Fetch from a stacked branch copies all required data .
( Aaron Bentley , # 248506 ) * Handle urls such as ftp://user@host.com @www.host.com where the user name contains an @. ( Neil Martinsen - Burrell , # 228058 ) * ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now suppress an error during ``unlock`` if there was an error in the original function .
This helps most when there is a failure with a smart server action , since often the connection closes and we cannot unlock .
( Andrew Bennetts , John Arbash Meinel , # 125784 ) * Obsolete hidden command ``bzr fetch`` removed .
( Martin Pool , # 172870 ) *
Raise the correct exception when doing `` - rbefore : 0 `` or `` - c0`` .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 239933 ) *
You can now compare file revisions in Windows diff programs from Cygwin Bazaar .
( Matt McClure , # 209281 ) * revision_history now tolerates mainline ghosts for Branch format 6 . ( Aaron Bentley , # 235055 ) *
Set locale from environment for third party libs .
( Martin von Gagern , # 128496 ) DOCUMENTATION : * Added * Using stacked branches* to the User Guide .
( Ian Clatworthy ) * Updated developer documentation .
( Martin Pool ) TESTING : * ``-Dmemory`` will cause / proc / PID / status to be catted before bzr exits , allowing low - key analysis of peak memory use .
( Robert Collins ) * ``TestCaseWithTransport.make_branch_and_tree`` tries harder to return a tree with a ``branch`` attribute of the right format .
This was preventing some ``RemoteBranch`` tests from actually running with ``RemoteBranch`` instances .
( Andrew Bennetts ) API CHANGES : * Removed ``Repository .text_store`` , ``control_store`` , etc.
Instead , there are new attributes ``texts , inventories , revisions , signatures`` , each of which is a ``Versioned Files`` .
See the Repository docstring for more details .
( Robert Collins ) * ``Branch.pull`` now accepts an ``_override_hook_target`` optional parameter .
If you have a subclass of ``Branch`` that overrides ``pull`` then you should add this parameter .
( Andrew Bennetts ) * ``bzrlib.check.check ( ) `` has been deprecated in favour of the more aptly - named ``bzrlib.check.check_branch ( ) ``. ( Daniel Watkins ) * ``Tree.print_file`` and ``Repository .
print_file`` are deprecated .
These methods are bad APIs because they write directly to sys.stdout .
bzrlib does not use them internally , and there are no direct tests for them .
( Alexander Belchenko ) INTERNALS : * ``cat`` command no longer uses ``Tree.
print_file ( ) `` internally .
( Alexander Belchenko ) * New class method ``BzrDir.open_containing_tree_branch_or_repository`` which eases the discovery of the tree , the branch and the repository containing a given location .
( Daniel Watkins ) * New ``versionedfile .
KeyMapper`` interface to abstract out the access to underlying . knit/.kndx etc files in repositories with partitioned storage .
( Robert Collins ) * Obsolete developer - use command ``weave - join`` has been removed .
( Robert Collins ) * ``RemoteToOtherFetcher`` and ``get_data_stream_for_search`` removed , to support new ``Versioned Files`` layering .
( Robert Collins ) bzr 1.6beta2 2008-06-10 - -----------------------
This release contains further progress towards our 1.6 goals of shallow repositories , and contains a fix for some user - affecting bugs in the repository layer .
Building working trees during checkout and branch is now faster .
BUG FIXES : * Avoid KnitCorrupt error extracting inventories from some repositories .
( The data is not corrupt ; an internal check is detecting a problem reading from the repository . )
( Martin Pool , Andrew Bennetts , Robert Collins , # 234748 ) * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 235407 ) *
Fix infinite loop consuming 100 % CPU when a connection is lost while reading a response body via the smart protocol v1 or v2 . ( Andrew Bennetts ) *
Inserting a bundle which changes the contents of a file with no trailing end of line , causing a knit snapshot in a ' knits ' repository will no longer cause KnitCorrupt .
( Robert Collins ) * ``RemoteBranch .pull`` needs to return the ``self .
_real_branch``'s pull result .
It was instead just returning None , which breaks ``bzr pull`` .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 238149 ) * Sanitize branch nick before using it as an attachment filename in ``bzr send`` .
( Luká š Lalinský , # 210218 ) * Squash ``inv_entry.symlink_target`` to a plain string when generating DirState details .
This prevents from getting a ``UnicodeError`` when you have symlinks and non-ascii filenames .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 135320 ) IMPROVEMENTS : * Added the ' alias ' command to set / unset and display aliases .
( Tim Penhey ) * ``added`` , ``modified`` , and ``unknowns`` behaviour made consistent ( all three now quote paths where required ) .
Added `` --null`` option to ``added`` and ``modified`` ( for null - separated unknowns , use ``ls -- unknown -- null`` ) ( Adrian Wilkins ) * Faster branching ( 1.09 x ) and lightweight checkouts ( 1.06 x ) on large trees .
( Ian Clatworthy , Aaron Bentley ) DOCUMENTATION : * Added * Bazaar Zen* section to the User Guide .
( Ian Clatworthy ) TESTING : * Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it is running , allowing it to be used in blackbox tests .
( Robert Collins ) API CHANGES : * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_( ids / trees ) `` will now filter out revisions which are in the ancestry of other revisions .
So if you merge the same tree twice , or merge an ancestor of an existing merge , it will only record the newest .
( If you merge a descendent , it will replace its ancestor ) .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 235407 ) * ``RepositoryPolicy.__init__`` now requires stack_on and stack_on_pwd , through the derived classes do not .
( Aaron Bentley ) INTERNALS : * ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDir.sprout`` now accepts ``stacked`` to control creating stacked branches .
( Robert Collins ) * Knit record serialisation is now stricter on what it will accept , to guard against potential internal bugs , or broken input .
( Robert Collins ) bzr 1.6beta1 2008-06-02 - -----------------------
Commands that work on the revision history such as push , pull , missing , uncommit and log are now substantially faster .
This release adds a translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish .
( Contributions of other translations would be very welcome . )
Bazaar 1.6 beta1 adds a new network protocol which is used by default and which allows for more efficient transfers and future extensions .
NOTES WHEN UPGRADING : * There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr :// , bzr+ssh :// and bzr + http:// connections .
This will allow more efficient requests and responses , and more graceful fallback when a server is too old to recognise a request from a more recent client .
Bazaar 1.6 will interoperate with 0.16 and later versions , but servers should be upgraded when possible .
Bazaar 1.6 no longer interoperates with 0.15 and earlier via these protocols .
Use alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 83935 ) CHANGES : * Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr selftest`` so that developers can see if their code is using deprecated functions .
( John Arbash Meinel ) FEATURES : * Adding `` -Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin fails to load .
( James Westby ) IMPROVEMENTS : * ``bzr branch / push / pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for finding the revno of the new revision ( ``Graph.find_distance_to_null`` ) .
This should make something like ``bzr branch -r - 100 `` in a shared , no - trees repository much snappier .
( John Arbash Meinel ) * ``bzr log -- short -r X .. Y`` no longer needs to access the full revision history .
This makes it noticeably faster when logging the last few revisions .
( John Arbash Meinel ) * ``bzr ls`` now accepts `` - V`` as an alias for ``--versioned`` .
( Jerad Cramp , # 165086 ) * ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without having to search the whole ancestry .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 174625 ) * ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access , rather than always extracting the full revision history for a branch .
This makes it resolve the appropriate revisions much faster ( in testing it drops uncommit from 1.5s => 0.4s ) .
It also means ``bzr log -- short`` is one step closer to not using full revision history .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 172649 ) BUGFIXES : * ``bzr merge -- lca`` should handle when two revisions have no common ancestor other than NULL_REVISION .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 235715 ) * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 235407 ) * ``bzr push`` with both ``-- overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no longer fails .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 234229 ) * Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using bzr +
http:// URLs , which was causing spurious " No repository present " errors with branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 230550 ) * Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so that all implementations have the attribute .
Fixes ' PyCurlTransport ' object has no attribute ' _remote_is_at_least_1_2 ' attribute errors .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 220806 ) * Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning message , not a fatal error .
It may for example fail if the file is still in use by another process .
( Martin Pool ) * Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the amount of data we try to read per ``recv`` call .
The problem was observed with Windows and a proxy , but might affect other environments as well .
( Eric Holmberg , # 215426 ) * Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger. from_mergeable .
Stricter get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here .
( Aaron Bentley ) * Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in authentication .
conf when used for an ssh scheme ( sftp or bzr+ssh ) .

The ``_set_file_mode`` and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles which were advertised as a way for plugins to control this are no longer consulted .
( Martin Pool ) * ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated .
This method required local instances of both versioned file objects and was thus hostile to being used for streaming from a smart server .
The new get_record_stream and insert_record_stream are meant to efficiently replace this method .
( Robert Collins ) * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_( ids / trees ) `` will now filter out revisions which are in the ancestry of other revisions .
So if you merge the same tree twice , or merge an ancestor of an existing merge , it will only record the newest .
( If you merge a descendent , it will replace its ancestor ) .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 235407 ) * ``WorkingTreeFormat2.stub_initialize_remote`` is now private .

In my last article , I wrote about how important it was to keep on learning new technologies and broadening your horizons ; this time , we 're going to look at some things you might have missed inside Perl itself .
I 've just finished writing the new edition of Advanced Perl
Programming , which covers a lot of the more practical things about writing Perl applications - useful CPAN modules and techniques .
But what about the more hidden and less obviously practical things ?
Here is a collection of ten facts to intrigue , delight and inspire ...
You can write scripts in UTF - 8
Someone mentioned to me the other day that Perl 6 was the only language they knew of which allowed Unicode identifiers .
Funny , I thought - I 'm sure you can do that in Perl 5 as well .
Well , you can , so long as you remember to turn on the " utf8 " pragma :
use utf8 ; my $ = Dog->new ( ) ;
Similarly , subroutines and comments can be in your native language and script .
If you want to go further and start translating the actual language constructs ( " if " , " for " , etc. ) into your native language , then look at things like the " JCode " module on CPAN , and be aware that you 're creating a maintainance nightmare for yourself .
There 's a new way of trapping signals
I did not even know about this one until I was wandering around the Perl source trying to find interesting tidbits for this article , ( which may reflect more on my ability to read the manual than anything else ... ) but it looks like a very useful tip .
Normally , I 'd trap signals in Perl with something like this :
$ SIG{ALRM} = \&handler ;
However , there 's a pragma in the Perl core called " sigtrap " which makes it easier to handle signals .
With " sigtrap " you 'd write the above statement as :
use sigtrap handler => \&handler , " ALRM " ;
Why is this any better ?
Well , with " sigtrap , " you can set special built - in handlers , to either die or to give a stack trace , and apply them to built - in sets of signals .
For instance , to give a stack trace for any of the more " serious " error signals ( ABRT , BUS , EMT , FPE , ILL , QUIT , SEGV , SYS and TRAP ) that you have n't specified another handler for , you would say
use sigtrap ' stack - trace ' , ' untrapped ' , ' error - signals ' ;
This makes it much easier to work out what your signal handling code is actually trying to do .
Appending from a file to a scalar is special - cased .
Try these two little programs :
perl - we ' $_ = < A > ' perl - we '$ _.= < A >'
Both will complain about " A " being used only once , and both will complain about reading an unopened filehandle , but look at how they do so :
readline ( ) on unopened filehandle A at -e line 1. append I /O operator ( ) on unopened filehandle A at -e line 1 .
" Append I /O operator ( ) " ?
What 's happening is that appending from a filehandle to the end of a scalar $ x .= <..> is optimized by Perl into a special operation in its own right .
Actually , it turns out that readline , or the " < FH > " operator is actually three different operators , as you can see from running " perl - MO=Terse , - exec " on the following three lines :
print < A > ; $ _ = < A > ; $ _ .= < A > ;
The first one creates two operations , as you would expect : one reads the line , and the other prints it .
The second line does something I did n't expect until I tried it - I would have expected one op to fetch $ _ , one to fetch " A " , one " readline " and one to assign them , but there 's no " sassign " op at the end .
This is because " = <..> " is a special case of the readline op which knows to store its return value not onto the stack but into the scalar variable referenced by the next value on the stack , eliminating an assign op .
And , as we 've already seen , " .= <..> " is a special " rcatline " operation that reads and concatenates at the same time .
Useful for micro-optimizers and interrnals hackers !
Subclassing Exporter
The usual way to write modules which provide subroutines is to optionally export them into the caller 's package .
So , for instance :
package My :: Application ; use URI :: Escape qw( uri_escape ) ; print uri_escape ( " Hello there " ) ;
Here URI :: Escape has provided the uri_escape subroutine , which our package has imported and used .
It does this by subclassing the standard Exporter module , like so :
package URI :: Escape ; use vars qw( @ISA @EXPORT @EXPORT_OK $ VERSION ) ; use vars qw ( %escapes ) ; require Exporter ; @ ISA = qw( Exporter ) ; @ EXPORT = qw(uri_escape uri_unescape ) ; @EXPORT_OK = qw( %escapes uri_escape_utf8 ) ;
The heavy work of moving subroutines from the URI :: Escape package into the My :: Application package is done by Exporter 's import method , and use Foo actually calls require Foo ; Foo ->import so the uri_escape subroutine comes our way rather behind the scenes .
Now , suppose you 're writing your module which imports subroutines this way , but you also want to do some additional set - up code when the module is loaded up .
The import routine is a sensible place to do this set - up , so you say something like this :
sub import { my ( $ self , @stuff ) = @_ ; $ self -> setup ( ) ; $ self -> SUPER ::import( @stuff ) ; }
Unfortunately , this does n't work .
Exporter 's import works by looking at caller to determine who 's calling it , and therefore ends up trying to move symbols from Exporter to My : : Application , instead of from My :: Application to the client code .
The way around this is to use the export_to_level routine instead , which gives you a parameter to control how far back up the stack to perform the exporting :
sub import { my ( $ self , @stuff ) = @_ ; $ self -> setup ( ) ; $ self ->export_to_level ( 1 , $ self , @stuff ) ; }
The first parameter , 1 , says that we 're going back one level from the point of view of Exporter ; the next is the package name , and then this is followed by the import tags .
You can lock up hashes
Anyone who 's done any development of " perl " itself over the past five years or so will cringe when I mention the word " pseudohashes " .
They were a great idea , to be honest , but the implementation was a little unfortunate .
The idea of a pseudohash goes like this .
When you 're using a hash as an object , you 'll generally only have a fixed set of keys , known in
advance , that you 're interested in using :
package Person ; sub new { my $ class = shift ; bless { name => ... , address => .... , job => ... , date_of_birth => .... } , $ class }
Now if at some point I say
$ person->{dateofbirth}
then this is going to cause a bug .
Perl should " know " that I meant to say " date_of_birth " and complain .
Additionally , if we have a fixed set of keys , we can essentially turn these keys into constant indexes , and use an array instead of a hash , making access faster .
So a pseudohash was something that behaved like an array and looked like a hash , and was implemented like the evil hybrid monster that this implies .
As a compromise , the functions in Hash : : Util were implemented .
These take an ordinary hash , and locks it down in various ways - prevents you from adding new keys , or from changing certain values , and so on .
use Hash : : Util qw( lock_keys ) ; sub new { my $ class = shift ; my $ self = bless { name => ... , address => .... , job => ... , date_of_birth => .... } , $ class ; lock_keys ( %$ self ) ; return $ self ; }
Now if at some point I say $ self->{dateofbirth} = " 1978-05 - 29 " , Perl will die because I tried to add a new key to a locked hash .
It 's important to note that it does n't prevent you from accessing non-existant keys , so $ person -> {dateofbirth} will still slip by unnoticed .
This means Hash :: Util is n't a complete replacement for pseudohashes ; try looking at Dave Cross 's Tie : : Hash : : FixedKeys for a more robust but slower implementation of this idea .
DBM Filters
DBM files are essentially a hash on disk - they 're random - access files which allow you to associate a key with a value .
My irrational favourite is the Berkeley DB , DB_File :
tie %hash , " DB_File " , " test.db " ; $ hash { " Larry Wall " } = " 555-112-3581 " ;
The only slight problem with DBMs is that they 're generally implemented by an external C library which knows nothing about Perl , so you can't store complex Perl data structures as DBM values .
The usual way around this is the " MLDBM " module , which sits in front of the DBM , marshalling the data that gets stored and retrieved .
If it comes across an attempt to store a reference , it will use either " Storable " or " Data : : Dumper " to serialize that reference into a string ; similarly , if you 're retrieving a string like that , it'll perform the appropriate inverse process ( " Storable " again , or " eval " ) to turn the string back into a reference .
use MLDBM qw( DB_File ) ; tie %hash , " DB_File " , " test.db " ; $ hash { " Larry Wall " } = Person ->new ( ... ) ;
" MLDBM " works the slow , stupid way ; it implements the " tie " interface itself , does the serializing and deserializing , and then passes on the request to another , underlying tied hash :
sub FETCH { my ( $s , $ k ) = @_ ; my $ ret = $s ->{ DB}->FETCH( $k ) ; $s ->{ SR}->deserialize ( $ret ) ; } sub STORE { my ( $s , $ k , $ v ) = @_ ; $v = $ s ->{ SR}->serialize( $v ) ; $ s ->{ DB}->STORE ( $k , $ v ) ; } sub DELETE { my $s = shift ; $ s ->{DB}->DELETE(@_ ) ; } sub FIRSTKEY { my $s = shift ; $ s ->{DB}->FIRSTKEY( @_ ) ; } sub NEXTKEY { my $s = shift ; $ s ->{DB}->NEXTKEY( @_ ) ; } ...
There 's actually a better way to do things nowadays , which hopefully " MLDBM " will move to behind the scenes .
You can now add filters onto a DBM , so that when something is stored or retrieved , a subroutine of your choice gets called .
So we can implement the same functionality as " MDLBM " with just a few lines of code :
my $ db = tie %hash , " DB_File " , " test.db " ; use Storable qw( freeze thaw ) ; $ db->filter_store_value ( sub { $ _ = freeze ( $_ ) } ) ; $ db->filter_fetch_value ( sub { $ _ = thaw ( $_ ) } ) ; $ hash {" Larry Wall " } = Person ->new ( ... ) ;
When we store the " Person " object , it goes through the filter we registered with filter_store_value , and the value is transformed via the freeze subroutine we got from Storable - this turns it into a scalar value suitable for storing in the DBM .
Similarly , when we retrieve it again , it goes through Storable : : thaw which turns it back into a reference .
For more about what you can do with DBM filters , see " perldoc perldbmfilter " .
File handles with a _< in them ?
Here 's something that I was asked about the other day : why does my program contain globs which start " _< " followed by a filename ?
To see this for yourself , run this code :
perl -le ' print for keys % main : : '
You 'll see , amongst the rest of the keys in the symbol table , " _<universal.c " .
To make things more interesting , run the same code in the debugger :
perl -d - le ' print for keys % main : : '
This time you 'll see a few more : I got
_</usr/share/perl/5.8/Term/ReadLine.pm
_</usr/share/perl/5.8/Carp/Heavy.pm
_</usr/share/perl/5.8/strict.pm
_</usr/share/perl/5.8/AutoLoader.pm
amongst others .
Where do these come from ?
Well , there are actually two kinds of globs named like this .
The first , usually non-Perl files like the " universal.c " that we saw earlier , are used as the globs attached to the XS subroutines that they contain .
The second kind are provided by the debugger whenever a program file is loaded .
From the " perldebguts " documentation :
Each array @{ " _ < $ filename " } holds the lines of $ filename for a file compiled by Perl ...
Values in this array are magical in numeric context : they compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable .
holds the lines of for a file compiled by Perl ...
Values in this array are magical in numeric context : they compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable .
Each hash % { " _< $ filename " } contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number .
contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number .
Each scalar $ { " _< $ filename " } contains _ < $filename .
You can find the name of a subroutine with Devel : : Peek
This is another one which came up on IRC the other day .
You have a subroutine reference , and you want to know what it 's called , either so that you can report about it for your debugging , or you can do some dirty tricks .
How do you know where the subroutine reference came from ?
Let 's say we want to make some method " private " , in the sense that it can only be called by the class which created it .
Here 's as much of the " make_private " routine as we can do :
package UNIVERSAL ; sub make_private { my ( $ class , $ method ) = @_ ; # Find out where the method was actually defined my $ orig = $ class - > can ( $ method ) || return ; my $ subname = some_magic ( $orig ) ; *{ $ subname} = sub { my $ class = shift ; die " $ method is private " unless $ class eq caller ; $ class -> $ orig ( @_ ) ; } }
In this routine , $ orig is a code reference .
Normally , the fully - qualified subroutine name for this method would be $ class . " : :" .$ method , but since inheritance is in play , the method might actually come from somewhere else ; that 's why we use can ( ) to find out where it came from .
Of course now we need to go back from the code reference to the subroutine name , so we can write our " guard " subroutine into the appropriate glob .
The guard subroutine , the inner one in our code sample , checks that we 're calling this from inside the appropriate class , and then dispatches to the original subroutine .
The key thing we 're missing is getting the subroutine name from the code reference , and the answer to this is Devel : : Peek :: CvGV .
Devel : : Peek is better known for dumping out the internal details of Perl variables , but in this case it comes to the rescue by looking at the code reference 's glob pointer , which tells us where in the symbol table it lives .
A " debugger " does n't have to debug
You may well be familiar with the Perl debugger , invoked via " perl -d " .
As it happens , that 's not " the " Perl debugger ; it 's just " a " Perl debugger , albeit the standard one which comes with Perl .
A debugger is just something that sits in the " DB " package and implements a few subroutines in there .
The DB : : DB subroutine , for instance , is called by Perl for every statement in your program .
DB :: sub gets called for every subroutine run . " perldebguts " describes the variables available in these and other DB : : subroutines .
Modules like Devel : : Trace demonstrate how to write your own debugger :
# This is the important part .
The rest is just fluff .
sub DB :: DB { return unless $ TRACE ; my ( $p , $f , $ l ) = caller ; my $ code = \@{ " : : _< $f " } ; print STDERR " >> $ f:$l : $ code - > [ $l ] " ; }
Notice that this uses the special glob for a Perl code file we discovered earlier , in order to extract the line of code currently being run .
For a debugger to run neatly , it should be named " Devel : : ... " .
This is because Perl turns " perl - d: Foo " into the equivalent of " use Devel : : Foo . "
Devel : : DProf , Devel : : Coverage , and other modules in the Devel : : namespace show what can be done with customized debuggers .
The Internals package
Our final tip is the somewhat underdocumented " Internals " package .
Like UNIVERSAL , this is a built - in package provided by the Perl core , which contains a few handy functions .
The first is SvREADONLY .
This is what is actually used to lock hashes , as mentioned above .
It takes any Perl SV container - a scalar , an array or hash , or an array or hash reference - and gets and sets the read only flag on that container :
% perl - le '@a= ( 0..10 ) ; Internals :: SvREADONLY ( $ a [ 5 ] , 1 ) ; $ a [ 5 ] ++'
Modification of a read - only value attempted at -e line 1 .
Another function gets and sets the reference count of an SV :
my $ count = Internals : : SvREFCNT ( $obj ) ;
Internals :: SvREFCNT ( $obj , $ count+1 ) ; # Make immortal
Still other functions can get and set the internal seed of the hashing algorithm for a hash , or fiddle with the placeholders set up when a locked hash is used .
Conclusion
There are still things I 'm discovering even about the internals of Perl itself , and many techniques which are only now being exploited to give interesting results .
Source filters sat in the Perl core for a few years before people realised what sort of things could be done with them .
We 've taken a look at ten of the lesser known corners of Perl ... it 's up to you to do interesting things with them !

So if McPalin does succeed in stealing this election , there will certainly be quite a show of protest in the streets of DC on Inauguration Day .
It 's what happened when Bush / Cheney stole it in ' 04 - - although the press most courteously showed us none of it -- and the s**t will hit the fan ( excuse me ) even harder if McPalin force themselves upon us .
Of course , there will be heavily armed battalions of police -- and probably contingents of the National Guard , and maybe other troops as well -- on hand to hit the protesters with gas and riot sticks and rubber bullets .
And , if BushCo has its way with these " new regulations , " all such violence will take place somewhere far away from the Inauguration Route , which the regime now wants to privatize .
Say NO to this as loud as possible , and spread the word about it .
MCM
ImpeachBush is circulating the following message from the Partnership for Civil Justice , which is spearheading the campaign to stop the Bush administration 's assault on free speech in Washington , DC .
Please take a moment to send a letter to the National Park Service demanding that the inaugural route -- which they are attempting to privatize -- remain open to the public .
Also , please circulate this message to your friends , family members , classmates and co-workers , and on social networking sites .
Bush has systematically attacked the First Amendment since he came into office , and your help is needed to stop him in his tracks .
Do n't Let the National Park Service Privatize the Inauguration Route
Tell the government : Pennsylvania Ave. Belongs to the People
Bush Administration proposes new regulations - comment period closing
A ground breaking free speech legal victory in federal court has opened up Pennsylvania Avenue for " We the People " on Inauguration Day .
Unless you and thousands of others take action today , however , that courtroom victory could be effectively overturned by a new set of regulations proposed by the Bush Administration 's National Park Service .
" The Inauguration is not a private event , " ruled U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman on March 20 , 2008 .
Judge Friedman declared unconstitutional the practice of the National Park Service of exempting the Presidential Inaugural Committee from the ordinary permit process in order to give that private political advocacy organization exclusive rights to exclude the public from along the Inaugural Parade route .
The ruling capped a nearly four year challenge by the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition represented by the Partnership for Civil Justice .
The Coalition stood up for thousands of anti-war protesters and political dissenters who - - like the general public - - have been excluded from communicating their views along the quadrennial Inaugural Parade route .
The victory was so resounding that the U.S. Government did not even appeal the ruling .
That courtroom victory is in jeopardy .
We need your help , to take just a couple minutes of your time right now to protect free speech along the Presidential Inaugural Parade route by sending a comment to the National Park Service .
You Can Make a Difference By Acting Now
Tell the NPS that you do not want the land that belongs to the public along " America 's Main Street " of Pennsylvania Avenue privatized and set aside for the exclusive use of the private Presidential Inaugural Committee to sell to the wealthy corporations on America 's Inauguration Day .
Click here to send your comment now .
Help flood them with thousands of comments and tell your friends and family to join in this effort .
The Bush Administration 's National Park Service has re-written its regulations in response to the court ruling .
Again , the regulations set aside prime swaths of the Inaugural Parade route for the exclusive use of the corporate donor friends of the incoming administration .
The period for public comment closes in a few days , September 22 , - so act now by clicking here to send your comment on these proposed regulations .
Background Information :
What 's at Stake
We say the parade route is not for the exclusive use of privileged elite and fat cat Wall Street donors .
No matter who wins this next election , it is the ordinary people from all across the country who should be allowed along the Presidential Parade route .
The corporate donors and wealthy elite have the Inaugural Balls , the swearing - in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol , the ceremonial reviewing area at the White House .
The sidewalks , at the very least , are for the people and the NPS is planning to give many blocks of sidewalk and parkland along the parade route to those hand - picked by the Presidential Inaugural Committee and party elite .
The National Park Service is trying to privatize Pennsylvania Avenue so that forever more , significant sections of parkland and sidewalks , including all of Freedom Plaza , will be for the exclusive use of the Presidential Inaugural Committee ( PIC ) .
In fact , the NPS has for the upcoming inauguration , just as it did for the last inaugurations , given itself a permit in advance which it will sublet to the PIC .
The PIC is a private corporate - funded organization that is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars solicited from the biggest banks , corporations , oil and energy companies , Wall Street and military contractors .
The PIC has as funders those who make the biggest profits off of the war drive , including $ 250,000 and $ 100,000 ' contributions ' from oil and defense industries .
Nowhere in the Constitution does it state that Pennsylvania Avenue is reserved for the rich corporations on Inauguration Day .
What This Means for the Coming Inauguration in January 2009
No doubt , the outpouring of public expression and sentiment on Inauguration Day will be different depending on the outcome of the election .
For instance , 100,000 people came out on January 20 , 2001 to protest George W. Bush 's new administration which was taking office in spite of the fact that it had lost the election .
On January 20 , 2005 , tens of thousands demonstrated demanding an end to the Iraq War and occupation .
Many were blocked from entering through the government 's checkpoints .
One thing must remain the same no matter who is the next President :
The parade route is for the people .
Under existing regulations the Presidential Inaugural Committee is already given exclusive and set - aside space around the White House and Lafayette Park as well as at the Capitol .
We are not challenging their use of the Capitol area or the White House area for the Presidential reviewing stands and for the Presidential Inaugural Committee bleachers ( In fact , when this White House set - aside was established , it was justified by the NPS on the fact that the parade route and nearby areas remained open for demonstrators and the public ) .
The PIC already has its space at the White House .
Pennsylvania Avenue , " America 's Main Street , " must remain open for the public .
On January 20 , 2009 , there will still be 140,000 U.S. forces in Iraq .
There will be the problem of skyrocketing mass layoffs and foreclosures on the home front .
Regardless of who they support in the Presidential election , millions of people will want to send a message to the next administration about the war in Iraq and domestic priorities .
They have a right to assemble along the Inaugural parade route .
As even one of the candidates acknowledged , " Change comes from below . "
Federal law requires the National Park Service to open its proposed regulation to public comment .
Please take a couple minutes - - right now , as you are sitting before your computer - - to submit online comments against the discriminatory PIC set - asides in the proposed regulations .
Tell the Government that you oppose the discriminatory reservations of spectator space along the Inaugural Parade route for the Presidential Inaugural Committee .
The White House area of Pennsylvania Ave. and Lafayette Park is already set aside for the Presidential Inaugural Committee .
The Parade Route is for the people .

If you do n't know what a " prayer circle " is , do n't worry .
You are in good company .
I had never heard the term before moving to Mississippi .
That does not necessarily mean they never happened in the region where I grew up , but they either went by a different name or I just never heard about them .
But really , if you have not encountered this term before , consider yourself lucky .
I wish I still did n't know what it was .
What is a Prayer Circle ?
Imagine yourself back in the third grade .
It is recess , and you are with your classmates on the playground .
There is a teacher in the vicinity , but the level of adult supervision is minimal .
Suddenly , a group of 6 or more children approach you and say something along the lines of , " Have you been saved ? "
You are not sure what to make of the question , so other questions about your religious beliefs and experiences follow .
Without understanding the consequences , you tell them that you and your family are atheists , Jews , Catholics , Buddhists , non-fundamentalist Protestants , or pretty much anything other than evangelical fundamentalist Christians .
The children start calling you names , hurling insults at you .
If you happen to be Jewish , you will hear things from these children that would make neo -Nazi 's proud .
You are a sinner .
You are going to burn in a lake of fire .
You will rot in hell .
They form a circle around you , holding hands to make sure you can't easily escape .
They tell you that the only way you can save yourself is to accept Jee-zuhs .
They begin praying around you loudly to " save your soul . "
The teacher , if he / she even notices what is happening , shrugs it off .
Maybe he or she cannot see that you are crying by now .
It does not look like the children are touching you , so there seems little cause to disrupt the activity .
Maybe the teacher even approves of what the children are doing .
After all , he or she may have been raised in the same culture of intolerance that spawned these children .
This , dear reader , is a prayer circle .
Now you know .
This Doesn't Really Happen , Does It ?
I wish I could tell you that I am just making this up .
I really do .
Unfortunately , this sort of thing happens far more often and is often far worse than my feeble attempt to describe it here can capture .
Prayer circles like this are sufficiently common on public school playgrounds here in Mississippi that nearly everyone I know with children who has not raised them to be evangelical fundamentalist Christians has had it happen to their children .
In some cases , especially if the family is not Christian at all , it happens many times throughout elementary school .
Many victims are Jewish ; some are Catholic , Buddhist , Muslim , atheist , or even non-fundamentalist Protestants .
The first couple times I heard about this , I was stunned .
I vividly remember my mouth hanging open as I kept repeating , " No way " to a Jewish colleague who was describing what his daughter had to endure at one of the local public schools .
That was when he pulled out a scrapbook he had kept since moving to Mississippi from the Northeast .
This was no ordinary scrapbook .
It was a collection of fundamentalist Christian propaganda and anti-Semitic material his daughter had been given by her peers at her public school .
That is to say , it was a collection of Christian hate his daughter had brought home from school .
I wanted to cry .
And speaking of crying , that is exactly how almost all of the children subjected to this initially respond .
They burst into tears on the playground and again when they get home and recount their ordeal to their family .
Remember , these are young children we are talking about and not adults .
For them , this can be a terrifying experience .
If we are going to consider it abusive for Christian parents to threaten their children with hell , we should probably consider this abusive .
How Do The Parents Cope ?
Honestly , I have no idea .
I do n't think I could handle it .
From what I have observed , and this is admittedly a small sample of approximately 8 parents , the initial response is what you would expect : outrage .
The parents typically meet with the school officials to express their concern , push for increased supervision , etc .
But time and time again , they run into the same wall .
The evangelical fundamentalist Christians are the overwhelming majority here , and teachers can't be everywhere .
School personnel can't control what other children say , and this is part of the culture here in the South .
Many parents seem to tire of banging their head against this wall and come to believe that their primary role should be one of providing emotional support for their children .
As parents realize that this really is part of the culture here , they tend to set efforts to change it aside in favor of trying to help their children deal with it .
I certainly do n't condemn them for this .
I have little idea what I would do as a parent in this situation .
All I can say is that I hate that they have to do this .
Their children should not be subjected to religiously - motivated bullying simply because they do not share the religion of the majority .

I shudder to think what the reaction might be if Barack Obama tried to pull a stunt like this one .
Vice President Cheney ’s invitation to address wounded combat veterans next month has been yanked because the group felt his security demands were Draconian and unreasonable .
The veep had planned to speak to the Disabled American Veterans at 8:30 a.m. at its August convention in Las Vegas .
His staff insisted the sick vets be sequestered for two hours before Cheney ’s arrival and could n’t leave until he ’d finished talking , officials confirmed .
“ Word got back to us … that this would be a prerequisite , ” said the veterans executive director , David Gorman , who noted the meeting hall does n’t have any rest rooms .
“ We told them it just was n’t acceptable . ”
David Autry , another Disabled American Veterans official , said Cheney ’s demands would be “ a huge imposition on our delegates . ”
That certainly seems to be the case .
Some of the veterans were severely wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan , and many more are elderly veterans who “ left pieces of themselves on foreign battlefields since World War II . ”
Getting to an early - morning event two hours beforehand , and getting stuck in a room they can’t leave , is n’t much of an option .
Once inside , the vets “ could not leave the meeting room , and the bathrooms are outside , ” Autry added .
Now , I understand the importance of security .
The Secret Service no doubt has restrictions in place for a reason .
But that ’s why I found this part of the New York Daily News article especially interesting .
[ T ]he vice president ’s rules for speaking to groups seem more stringent than those of his boss .
President Bush routinely speaks at events such as large dinners where thousands of guests freely pass back and forth through Secret Service screening portals .
Wait , Dick Cheney would impose unreasonable restrictions on wounded veterans by choice ?
His security restrictions are more burdensome than the president’s ?
If there ’s a logical explanation for that , I ca n’t think of it .
BEIJING 
An ecstatic China finally got its Olympic moment on Friday night .
And if the astonishing opening ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games lavished grand tribute on Chinese civilization and sought to stir an ancient nation ’s pride , there was also a message for an uncertain outside world :
Do not worry .
We mean no harm .
Usually , that message is delivered by the dour - faced leaders of the ruling Communist Party , who dutifully , if sometimes unconvincingly , regurgitate the phrase “ harmonious society ” coined by President Hu Jintao .
But in the nimble cinematic hands of Zhang Yimou , the filmmaker who directed the opening ceremonies , the politics of harmony were conveyed in a visual extravaganza .
The opening ceremonies gave the Communist Party its most uninterrupted , unfiltered chance to reach a gargantuan global audience .
At one point , thousands of large umbrellas were snapped open to reveal the smiling , multicultural faces of children of the global village .
Benetton could not have done it better .
Any Olympic opening is a propaganda exercise , but Friday night ’s blockbuster show demonstrated the broader public relations challenge facing the Communist Party as China becomes richer and more powerful .
The party wants to inspire national pride within China , and bolster its own legitimacy in the process , even as leaders want to reassure the world that a rising China poses no danger .

Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness ( NCC ) are the minimal set of Figure 1 : The ( NCC ) are the minimal set of neural events and structures – here synchronized action potentials in neocortical pyramidal neurons – sufficient for a specific conscious percept or a conscious ( explicit ) memory .
From Koch ( 2004 ) .
The Neural Correlates of Consciousness ( NCC ) can be defined as the minimal neuronal mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious percept ( Crick & Koch 1990 ) .
The Neurobiological Approach to Consciousness
Consciousness is a puzzling , state - dependent property of certain types of complex , biological , adaptive , and highly interconnected systems .
A science of consciousness must strive to explain the exact relationship between phenomenal , mental states and brain states .
This is the heart of the classical mind - body problem :
What is the nature of the relationship between the immaterial , conscious mind and its physical basis in the electrochemical interactions in the body ?
Brain scientists are exploiting a number of empirical approaches to shed light on the neural basis of consciousness .
This article reviews these approaches and summarizes what has been learnt .
See http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html for a glossary of related terms .
The Neural Correlates of Consciousness
Progress in addressing the mind - body problem has come from focusing on empirically accessible questions rather than on eristic philosophical arguments .
Key is the search for the neuronal correlates -- and ultimately the causes -- of consciousness .
The above definition of Neural Correlates of Consciousness stresses the attribute minimal because the entire brain is clearly sufficient to give rise to consciousness .
The question of interest is which of its subcomponents are essential to produce a conscious experience ( Figure 1 ) .
For instance , it is likely that neural activity in the cerebellum does not underlie any conscious perception , and thus is not part of the Neural Correlates of Consciousness .
That is , trains of spikes in Purkinje cells ( or their absence ) will not induce a sensory percept although they may ultimately affect some behaviors ( such as eye movements ) .
This definition does not focus exclusively on the necessary conditions because of the great redundancy and parallelism found in neurobiological networks .
While activity in some population of neurons may underpin a percept in one case , a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated .
Every phenomenal , subjective state will have associated Neural Correlates of Consciousness : one for seeing a red patch , another one for seeing grandmother , yet a third one for hearing a siren , etc .
Perturbing or inactivating the Neural Correlates of Consciousness for any one specific conscious experience will affect the percept or cause it to disappear .
If the Neural Correlates of Consciousness could be induced artificially , for instance by cortical microstimulation in a prosthetic device or during neurosurgery , the subject would experience the associated percept .
What characterizes the Neural Correlates of Consciousness ?
What are the communalities between the Neural Correlates of Consciousness for seeing and for hearing ?
Will the Neural Correlates of Consciousness involve all pyramidal neurons in cortex at any given point in time ?
Or only a subset of long - range projection cells in frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back ?
Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner ?
Neurons that fire in a synchronous manner ?
These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years ( Chalmers 2000 ) .
It should be noted that discovering and characterizing the Neural Correlates of Consciousness in brains is not the same as a theory of consciousness .
Only the latter can tell us why particular systems can experience anything , why they are conscious , and why other systems - such as the enteric nervous system or the immune system - are not .
However , understanding the Neural Correlates of Consciousness is a necessary step toward such a theory .
Level of Arousal and Content of Consciousness
States of Consciousness and Conscious States
There are two common , but quite distinct , usages of the term consciousness , one revolving around arousal and states of consciousness and another one around the content of consciousness and conscious states .
To be conscious of anything , the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal ( sometimes also referred to as vigilance ) .
This is as true of wakefulness as it is of REM sleep that is vividly , consciously experienced in dreams , although usually not remembered .
The level of brain arousal , measured by electrical or metabolic brain activity , fluctuates in a circadian manner and is influenced by lack of sleep , drugs and alcohol , physical exertion , etc. in a predictable manner .
High arousal states are usually associated with some conscious state – a percept , thought or memory - that has a specific content .
We see a face , hear music , remember an incident , plan an experiment , or fantasize about sex .
Indeed , it is unlikely that one can be awake without being conscious of something .
Referring to such conscious states is conceptually quite distinct from referring to states of consciousness that fluctuate with different levels of arousal .
Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction ( for instance , the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source ) .
Clinicians use scoring systems such as the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess the level of arousal in patients .
Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences .
The awake state in a normal functioning individual is quite different from the dreaming state ( for instance , the latter has little or no self - reflection ) or from the state of deep sleep .
In all three cases , the basic physiology of the brain is changed , affecting the space of possible conscious experiences .
Physiology is also different in altered states of consciousness , for instance after taking psychedelic drugs when events often have a stronger emotional connotation than in normal life .
Yet another state of consciousness has been reported to occur during certain meditative practices , when conscious perception and insight are assumed to be enhanced compared to the normal waking state .
In some obvious but difficult to rigorously define manner , the richness of conscious experience increases as an individual transitions from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness .
This richness of possible conscious experience could be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience ( e.g. , the integrated - information - theoretical account of consciousness ; see Tononi 2004 ) .
Inactivating all of visual cortex in an otherwise normal individual would significantly reduce the dimensionality of conscious experience since no color , shape , motion , texture or depth could be perceived .
As behavioral arousal increases , so does the range and complexity of behaviors that an individual is capable of .
A singular exception to this progression is REM sleep where most motor activity is shut down in the atonia that is characteristic of this phase of sleep , and the person is difficult to wake up .
Yet this low level of behavioral arousal goes , paradoxically , hand in hand with high metabolic and electrical brain activity and conscious , vivid states .
These observations suggest a two - dimensional graph ( Figure 2 ) in which the richness of conscious experience ( its representational capacity ) is plotted as a function of levels of behavioral arousal or responsiveness .
graph .
Here increasing levels of behaviorally determined arousal is plotted on the x-axis and the “ richness ” or “ representational capacity of consciousness ” ( Tononi 2004 ) is plotted on the y axis .
Increasing arousal can be measured by the threshold to obtain some specific behavior ( for instance , spatial orientation to a sound ) .
Healthy subjects cycle during a 24 hour period from deep sleep with low arousal and very little conscious experience to increasing levels of arousal and conscious sensation .
In REM sleep , low levels of behavioral arousal go hand - in - hand with vivid consciousness .
Conversely , various pathologies are associated with little or no conscious content .

Global Disorders of Consciousness
Global disorders of consciousness can likewise be mapped onto this plane ( Figure 2 ) .
Clinicians talk about impaired states of consciousness as in “ the comatose state ” , “ the persistent vegetative state ” ( PVS ) , and “ the minimally conscious state ” ( MCS ) .
Here , " state " refers to different levels of consciousness , from a total absence in coma , PVS and general anesthesia , to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in MCS , sleep walking or during a complex partial epileptic seizure ( Schiff 2004 ) .
The repertoire of distinct conscious states or experiences that are accessible to a patient in MCS is presumably minimal ( mainly pain and discomfort , possibly sporadic sensory percepts ) , immeasurably smaller than the possible conscious states that can be experienced by a healthy brain .
In the limit of brain death , the origin of this space has been reached with no experience at all ( Figure 2 ) .
A more desirable state is global anesthesia during which the patient should not experience anything – to avoid psychological trauma – but the level of arousal during the operation should be compatible with clinical exigencies .
While anesthetics may , in principle , be useful for the study of consciousness , they have as yet failed to provide breakthrough insights about the Neural Correlates of Consciousness .
This is mainly due their diverse mechanisms of molecular action , targeting receptors throughout large parts of the brain .
As our ability increases to differentiate subreceptor variation and target them with molecular tools by means of genetic in vivo studies ( Rudolph & Antkowiak 2004 ) , this is likely to change .
Given the absence of any accepted theory for the minimal neuronal criteria necessary for consciousness , the distinction between a PVS patient – who shows regular sleep - wave transitions and who may be able to move their eyes or limbs or smile in a reflexive manner as in the case of Terri Schiavo in Florida - and a MCS patient who can communicate ( on occasion ) in a meaningful manner ( for instance , by differential eye movements ) and who shows some signs of consciousness , is often difficult in a clinical setting .
Functional brain imaging may prove immensely useful here .
Blood - oxygen - level - dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( BOLD fMRI ) recently demonstrated that a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury showed the same pattern of brain activity as normals when asked to imagine playing tennis or to imagine visiting all rooms in her house ( Owen et al. 2006 ) .
Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness ( including akinetic mutism ) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of consciousness ( Laureys 2005 ) .
Impaired consciousness in epileptic seizures of the temporal lobe was likewise found to be accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the mediodorsal thalamus ( Blumenfeld et al. 2004 ) .
Localized Brain Lesions affecting Consciousness
In contrast to diffuse cortical damage , relatively discrete bilateral injuries to midline ( paramedian ) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of consciousness .
These structures are therefore part of the enabling factors that control the level of brain arousal ( as determined by metabolic or electrical activity ) and that are needed for any form of consciousness to occur .
One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen ( on each side ) of nuclei in the upper brainstem ( pons , midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus ) collectively referred to as the reticular activating system ( RAS ) .
These nuclei – three - dimensional collections of neurons with their own cytoarchitecture and neurochemical identity - release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine , noradrenaline / norepinephrine , serotonin , histamine and orexin / hypocretin .
Their axons project widely throughout the brain ( Figure 3 ) .
These neuromodulators control the excitability of thalamus and forebrain and mediate the alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as the general level of both behavioral and brain arousal .
Acute lesions of nuclei in the RAS can result in loss of consciousness and coma .
However , eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return ( Villablanca 2004 ) .
Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more intralaminar nuclei ( ILN ) of the thalamus .
These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly to the basal ganglia and , in a more distributed manner , into layer I of much of neocortex .
Comparatively small ( 1 cm3 or less ) , bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness ( Bogen 1995 ) .
Figure 3 : Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal .
Small , bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness .
From Koch ( 2004 ) .
In summary , a plethora of nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the thalamus , midbrain and pons must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all .
These nuclei belong to the enabling factors for consciousness .
Conversely , it is likely that the specific content of any one conscious sensation is mediated by neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures , including the amygdala , thalamus , claustrum and the basal ganglia .
Split - Brain Studies
The brain has a remarkable degree of bilateral symmetry .
The mind , however , has but a single stream of consciousness , not two .
Under ordinary conditions , the two hundred million fibers making up the corpus callosum , together with the anterior commissure and other minor bundles , integrate neural activity in the two halves of the forebrain such that only a single , integrated percept arises .
In certain cases of intractable epileptic seizures , part or all of the corpus callosum are surgically cut .
Remarkably , after recovery , these patients usually act , speak , and feel no differently from before .
They do not complain of a loss of half their visual field or of other dramatic deficits .
Upon closer inspection , however , a persistent and profound disconnection ( split - brain ) syndrome can be observed .
If specific sensory information is provided to one or the other hemisphere , the information is not shared with its twin .
A split - brain patient with typical ( left hemispheric ) language dominance is unable to name an image of an object presented in the left visual hemifield , but can pick this object from a group of objects using his left hand .
This procedure involves conscious perception followed by a targeted motor response with the neural correlates necessarily being constrained to one hemisphere .
The primary conclusion from split - brain patients , work for which Roger Sperry was awarded the Nobel prize in 1981 , is that both hemispheres are independently capable of conscious experience ( Bogen 1993 ; Gazzaniga 1995 ) .
Whatever the neuronal correlates of consciousness , these must exist independently in both cortical hemispheres .
Another example of a complex impairment of conscious perception , not to be confused with the split - brain syndrome , is the neglect syndrome , properly called visuospatial hemineglect .
It can be found after extensive damage typically to the right brain hemisphere affecting the inferior parietal cortex .
Patients with a hemineglect syndrome show an impaired awareness of their left visual hemifield despite the visual pathway being completely intact .
The Neuronal Basis of Conscious Perception
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made vision a preferred modality in the quest for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness .
Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – masking , binocular rivalry , continuous flash suppression , motion - induced blindness , change blindness , inattentional blindness – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject ’s mind is disrupted ( Kim and Blake 2004 ) .
In particular , a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time : the image is projected into one of the observer ’s eyes but is invisible , not seen .
In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated , permitting the footprints of visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain .
In a perceptual illusion , the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates .
The best known example is the Necker cube whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth ( Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : The Necker Cube :
The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right .
Without any other cue , the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations .
From Koch ( 2004 ) .
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is binocular rivalry .
Here , a small image , e.g. , a horizontal grating , is presented to the left eye , and another image , e.g. , a vertical grating , is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye .
In spite of the constant visual stimulus , observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one .
The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images .
Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image .
The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon .
In a series of elegant experiments , Logothetis and colleagues ( Logothetis 1998 ) recorded from a variety of visual cortical areas in the awake macaque monkey while the animal performed a binocular rivalry task .
In primary visual cortex ( V1 ) , only a small fraction of cells weakly modulate their response as a function of the percept of the monkey .
The majority of cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time .
Conversely , in a high - level cortical area such as the inferior temporal ( IT ) cortex along the ventral ( “ what ? ” ) pathway , almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus ( in other words , a “ face " cell only fired when the animal indicated by its performance that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye ; see Figure 5 ) , implying that the Neural Correlates of Consciousness involves activity in neurons in inferior temporal cortex .
However , it is likely that specific reciprocal interactions between IT cells and neurons in parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary in order for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness to be generated .
Figure 5 : A few seconds in the life of a typical IT cell while a monkey experiences binocular rivalry .
The upper row indicates the visual input , with dotted vertical lines marking stimulus transitions .
The second row shows the individual spikes , the third the smoothed firing rate , and the bottom row the monkey 's behavior .
The animal was taught to press a lever when it saw either one or the other image , but not both .
The cell responded only weakly to either the sunburst pattern or to its optical superposition with the image of a monkey 's face around 5 sec .
During binocular rivalry ( gray zone ) , the monkey 's perception vacillated back and forth between seeing the face and seeing the bursting sun .
Perception of the face was consistently accompanied ( and preceded ) by a strong increase in firing rate .
From N. Logothetis ( private communication ) as modified by Koch ( 2004 ) .
In a related perceptual phenomenon , flash suppression , the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye ( while the original image remains ) .
Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event .
The majority of cells in IT cortex and in the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal ’s percept .
That is , when the cell ’s preferred stimulus is perceived , the cell responds .
If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed , the cell falls silent , even though legions of primary visual cortex neurons fire vigorously to this stimulus ( Leopold and Logothetis 1996 ; Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997 ) .
Single neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of their responses when their preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked ( Kreiman et al. 2002 ) .
A number of fMRI experiments have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans .
They demonstrate quite conclusively that BOLD activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway ( e.g. , the fusiform face area and the parahippocampal place area ) as well as in early regions , including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) , follow the percept and not simply the retinal stimulus ( Rees and Frith 2007 ) .
Furthermore , a number of elegant fMRI experiments ( Haynes and Rees 2005 ; Lee et al. , 2007 ) support the hypothesis that V1 is necessary , but not sufficient for visual consciousness ( Crick and Koch 1995 ) .
Forward versus Feedback Projections
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid , transient , stereotyped , and unconscious ( Milner and Goodale , 1995 ) .
They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen , e.g. , in complex partial epileptic seizures .
These automated responses , sometimes called zombie behaviors ( Koch and Crick 2001 ) , could be contrasted by a slower , all - purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader , less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs ( or a reflection of these , as in imagery ) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses .
Without such a consciousness mode , a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events .
A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ( " physiological prematurity " ) .
To compensate for this , we have an unmatched ability to learn , i.e. , to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration .
Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised , these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness .
Take as an example the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road .
Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control .
In fact , the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs ( Beilock et al. 2002 ) .
From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner , and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior .
This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness .
It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the dorsal ( “ where ? ” ) stream in the parietal region ( Milner and Goodale , 1995 ) .
However , parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream , at least under some circumstances .
The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas ( beyond V1 ) and especially on the ventral stream .
Seemingly complex visual processing ( such as detecting animals in natural , cluttered scenes ; see Fast Visual Processing ) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130 - 150 ms ( Thorpe et al. 1996 , VanRullen and Koch 2003 ) , much too fast for eye movements and conscious perception to occur .
Furthermore , reflexes such as the oculovestibular reflex take place at even more rapid time - scales .
It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed - forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1 , into V4 , IT and prefrontal cortex , until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press ( as in a typical laboratory experiment ) .
The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times ( approx . 100 ms ) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells .
Conversely , conscious perception is believed to require more sustained , reverberatory neural activity , most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas ( Crick and Koch , 1995 ) that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold .
At this point , the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal , prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions , thalamus , claustrum and related structures that support short - term memory , multi-modality integration , planning , speech , and other processes intimately related to consciousness .
Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented .
This is the core hypothesis of the global workspace model of consciousness ( Baars 1988 , Dehaene et al. 2003 ) .
In brief , while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo - cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation , it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well - organized neural activity dependent on long - range cortico - cortical feedback .
Other Aspects of Consciousness
Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness
It is implicitly assumed by most neurobiologists that the relevant variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level , among the synaptic release or the action potentials in one or more population of cells , rather than at the molecular level .
A few scholars have proposed that macroscopic quantum behaviors underlie consciousness .
Of particular interest here is entanglement , the observation that the quantum states of multiple objects , such as two coupled electrons , may be highly correlated even though they are spatially separated , violating our intuition about locality ( entanglement is also the key feature of quantum mechanics hoped to be exploited in quantum computers ) .
The role of quantum mechanics for the photons received by the eye and for the molecules of life is undisputed .
But there is no evidence that any components of the nervous system - a 37o Celsius warm and wet tissue strongly coupled to its environment - display quantum entanglement .
And even if quantum entanglement were to occur inside individual cells , diffusion and action potential generation and propagation , the principal mechanism for getting information into and out of neurons , would destroy superposition .
At the cellular level , the interaction of neurons is governed by classical physics ( Koch and Hepp 2006 ) .
Volition and Consciousness
A particular aspect of the mind - body problem is the question of free will .
The spectrum of views ranges from the traditional and deeply embedded belief that we are free , autonomous , and conscious actors to the view that we are biological machines driven by needs and desires beyond conscious access and without willful control .
Whether volition is illusory or is free in some libertarian sense does not answer the question of how subjective states relate to brain states .
The perception of free will , what psychologists call the feeling of agency or authorship ( e.g. “ I decided to lift my finger ” ) , is certainly a subjective state with an associated phenomenal content ( quale ) no different in kind from the quale of a toothache or seeing marine blue .
So even if free will is a complete chimera , the subjective feeling of willing an action must have some neuronal correlate .
Direct electrical brain stimulation during neurosurgery ( Fried et al. 1991 ) as well as fMRI experiments implicate medial pre-motor and anterior cingulate cortices in generating the subjective feeling of triggering an action ( Lau et al. 2004 ) .
In other words , the neural correlate for the feeling of apparent causation involves activity in these cortical regions .
Summary
Progress in the study of the Neural Correlates of Consciousness on one hand , and of the neural correlates of non-conscious behaviors on the other , will hopefully lead to a better understanding of what distinguishes neural structures or processes that are associated with consciousness from those that are not .
The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate in a reversible , transient , deliberate and delicate manner identified populations of neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools ( e.g. , Adamantidis et al. 2007 ) opens the possibility of moving from correlation - observing that a particular conscious state is associated with some neural or hemodynamic activity - to causation .
Exploiting these increasingly powerful tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large - scale genomic analysis and manipulation .
It is the combination of such fine - grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans , complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework and coupled to a more refined philosophical analysis , that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness , one of the central mysteries of life .

It 's been a while since CFFI 's previous release , almost two years .
During this period , a lot of development work happened and lots of cool new features were implemented .
Here 's a brief highlight of some of the important changes :
foreign string encodings using Babel .
UTF - 8 becomes the default encoding for foreign strings .
improved foreign type system that takes better advantage of CLOS features .
emulated : long - long types on Lisps whose native FFI does n't support these types .
types on Lisps whose native FFI does n't support these types .
integrated a groveller inspired by SBCL 's sb- grovel .
. support for the stdcall calling convention .
removed finalizer - related code in favour of trivial - garbage .
function and variable lookups can now be linked to a specific foreign library instead of assuming a global namespace .
the cffi-features package has been deprecated in favour of trivial - features .
CFFI - specific features are now interned in the CFFI - SYS package .
package has been deprecated in favour of trivial - features .
CFFI - specific features are now interned in the package .
dozens of bug fixes and minor enhancements .
The long hiatus between releases caused all sorts of problems and confusions .
Hopefully that wo n't happen again and you 'll see more frequent CFFI releases in the future .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Seasoned travelers know that waiters in the United States expect tips of 15 to 20 percent -- $ 60 on a $ 300 dinner for two at one of New York ’s top restaurants .
The Manhattan restaurant Redeye Grill is seen in New York , September 18 , 2008 .
Seasoned travellers know that waiters in the United States expect tips of 15 to 20 percent -- $ 60 on a $ 300 dinner for two at one of New York 's top restaurants .
What is less well known is that the money does n't all go to the waiters and more lowly staff .
In June , a New York judge approved the first payment in a settlement totaling $ 3.9 million for workers at the Redeye Grill and five other restaurants owned by the Fireman Hospitality Group .

What is less well known is that the money does n’t all go to the waiters and more lowly staff .
In lawsuits filed in the last three years , staff have accused dozens of New York restaurants , including many well - known ones , of stealing tips and cheating them out of wages .
Among those named in the suits are celebrity haunt Pastis ; three New York restaurants co-owned by actor Robert De Niro in the global Nobu chain ; Jean Georges -- which has three Michelin stars -- and other restaurants owned by French chef Jean - Georges Vongerichten ; and hip hop star Jay Z’s 40/40 Club .
Peruvian Ivan Arias said he was happy just to have a job when he came to New York and found himself working as a busboy at the Redeye Grill , an eatery in midtown Manhattan where eight of its signature “ dancing shrimp ” cost $ 39 .
But Arias , 36 , said he soon realized he was being cheated out of overtime , breaks and promotions , and denied a fair share of tips .
“ The conditions were not OK .
They did not pay me tips .
They did not pay me overtime , ” Arias told Reuters .
In June , a New York judge approved the first payment in a settlement totaling $ 3.9 million for workers at the Redeye Grill and five other restaurants owned by the Fireman Hospitality Group .
As part of the settlement , Fireman agreed not to let managers share in tips .

A spokesperson for the company did not return a call seeking comment .
A spokesman for the New York State Restaurant Association was not available for comment .
Carolyn Richmond , an attorney representing several restaurants , blamed decades - old workplace labor laws , as well as state and federal laws that do not clearly state who can share in tips and how they should be divided .
“ It is a result of these antiquated laws and regulations that plaintiff class action lawyers have been able to swoop in and take advantage , ” she said .
CELEBRITY CHEF
Indeed , the suits , filed mainly by low - paid immigrants who work as dishwashers and busboys , has emboldened usually white front - of - house staff to file their own suits .
The restaurants have also accused a nonprofit group called the Restaurant Opportunities Center , which organized protests outside the Redeye Grill , of orchestrating a campaign based on unfounded accusations .
But an attorney for the center , Rekha Eanni , said the lawsuits show that poorly paid immigrants were losing their fear of speaking up .
“ It ’s really significant that this is the first time -- this meaning in the past six or so years -- when workers are really coming forward , ” said Eanni .
Since the suit was filed against Fireman , dozens of similar ones followed .
Some are still pending while others have settled .
Vongerichten has agreed to pay $ 1.75 million to eight waiters who filed suit on behalf of all staff at Jean Georges and four of his other New York restaurants , pending final approval by a judge .
And last year celebrated chef Daniel Boulud agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount with immigrant workers at his restaurant , Daniel .
They accused the restaurant of promoting white French workers ahead of nonwhites .
Arias , married with a young daughter , now works as a busboy at Craftbar , an offshoot of one of the city ’s top restaurants , Craft .
Whereas at the Redeye Grill he earned $ 400 for up to 60 hours a week , he now earns around $ 600 for 35 to 40 hours , he said .
“ Now I am happy , with my tips , with my check , every time , ” he said .
Julio Anzures , who received a payout of $ 20,000 in a settlement with a restaurant owned by Smith and Wollensky in 2003 , said conditions have improved since the lawsuits started .
“ I feel good not about the money but about the change of conditions , ” said Anzures , who has since moved up from dish washer to line cook and who sends most of his money home to his family in Mexico .
“ After these campaigns there are now breaks and overtime . ”
But he and others say there is still abuse .
“ The people that make the laws , they know what is happening in the industry , ” Anzures said .
“ They need to make more changes . ”

Thanks to sites like Digg and Hugg , recently I ’ve seen several stories regarding the possible return of the electric car , I thought it might be worth it to do a quick sanity check to see if these vehicles would actually be viable for most of us .
It seems to me that the most common knock against the electric car is the fact that most of them can only go 200 to 250 miles – which is more than a round trip from New York to Philadelphia – between charges .
While I do n’t think that most of us drive more than 200 miles each day , I figured it was safer to ask than to just assume .
So on that note , I recently put up a poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , which asked , “ How many miles do you drive on an average day ? ” and it appears that , on an an average day , an electric car would probably be able to fit our needs .
Here are the results of the poll :
45 % of people drive 25 miles or less per day
23 % of people drive between 26 and 50 miles per day
20 % of people drive between 51 and 75 miles per day
7 % of people drive between 76 and 100 miles per day
5 % of people drive more than 100 miles per day
By the looks of it , it appears that roughly 95 % of us would have no problem traveling under 100 miles per day , let alone 200 miles per day .
This sounds like a pretty compelling argument for electric cars for a couple of reasons , namely :
You probably would n’t have to worry about the infrastructure of setting up random “ charging stations ” because , for most people , they could make it through the day on one charge and simply recharge their car at night .
Commuting to work is probably the largest factor in why most people drive so few miles each day .
Last time I checked , if it ’s just you ( and maybe another passenger ) you ’re probably not going to need to drive a big sedan or SUV to get to work , and a smaller car would probably do just fine .
Hopefully the realization by both consumers and manufacturers that we really do most of our driving on a local level will help get electric cars and plug - in hybrids to the market that much quicker .
But he claimed that Wallace and the Scots soldiers who fell that day would approve , adding : “ The only way the English will be allowed in is if they sign a scroll pledging allegiance to Scotland - the kind of thing Edward I routinely did to Scots . ”
Did the whole world just get a lot smaller and go whooosh ?

I do n't know about you , but I feel much safer without him here in America , taking the subject not so seriously .
Wth kind of grip is that ?
Was it the christian right wing extremists who enforced he should use such a useless grip or could it be so that mr .
President plainly sucks at volleyball ? :p

On a side note , the way he gripped is pretty dangerous .
You shoulder never interlock your hands in volleyball as a grip .
You could seriously hurt your knuckles .

BONN , Germany ( Reuters ) - Mobile operator T - Mobile and Nortel Networks NT .
TO have successfully tested a new high - speed wireless technology designed to make mobile connections as fast as fixed fiber links , T - Mobile said .
A connection was maintained while driving in a car in range of three cell sites on a highway in Bonn , Germany at an average speed of 67 kph , T - Mobile , the wireless business of Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE , said on Thursday .
The experiment achieved data rates of up to 170 Mbit/s for downloads and up to 50 Mbit /s for uploads , the operator said , about three times faster than the new high - speed broadband technology VDSL it is currently rolling out across the country .
If the Long - Term Evolution ( LTE ) technology proved promising in more everyday situations , the Bonn - based company would consider upgrading its network with it , said Philipp Humm , head of T - Mobile Germany .
A decision would be made within six months .
There is increasing urgency for fourth - generation ( 4G ) wireless networks , where growing demand for mobile data is driven by such tools as smartphones and embedded laptops .
The industry has not settled on a standard for 4G networks , with some operators and developers lining up behind Sprint Nextel Corp 's S.N WiMax technology and others promoting the LTE system .
Hamid Akhavan , head of T - Mobile , which operates in 12 countries , said in February LTE appears to be the most promising prospect for future networks but he was not willing to commit to the technology until it proved itself .
“ There ’s still quite a few issues to be resolved , ” Akhavan told Reuters then .
“ In a best case scenario , some of our markets may be demonstrating LTE in 2010 . ”
Canada ’s Nortel Networks has said it sees LTE as the most likely upgrade path for about 80 percent of the world ’s existing mobile phone providers , with others going for WiMax .
People who fail to comply will be subject to a $ 5500 fine .
The president of the NSW Bar Association , Anna Katzmann , SC , described the regulations as " unnecessary and repugnant " .
The Greens MP Lee Rhiannon said if someone exposed themselves in public , they faced a fine of only $ 1100 or six months ' jail under the Summary Offences Act .
" So if someone flashes a WYD participant they will face a $ 1100 penalty but if they wear an anti-Catholic T - shirt they could face a $ 5500 penalty , " she said .
A police source said causing an " annoyance or inconvenience " was a highly subjective offence .
A police lawyer would define it in layman 's terms for operational use by officers .
Civil libertarians said they had never seen anything like the new powers and believed they are more extreme and broader in scope than those used during last year 's APEC summit and the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
But the State Government said " World Youth Day is a happy and positive celebration of youth " and " no additional or ' APEC - like ' police powers have been granted under the World Youth Day regulations " .
The Catholic Church denied it had called for such powers .
The regulations were quietly gazetted by the Deputy Premier , John Watkins , on Friday afternoon and apply to more than 40 city locations , including museums , galleries and cinemas , as well as Darling Harbour , the Opera House , the Harbour Bridge , Randwick Racecourse and parklands .
More than 500 schools across Sydney and 35 train and bus stations have also been listed as " declared areas " .
People entering them will be subject to vehicle and baggage searches that require them to remove jackets , gloves , shoes and headwear if requested .
" Reasonable force may be used to effect the person 's exclusion " if they do not permit the search , the regulations stipulate .
The Government 's World Youth Day spokeswoman , Kristina Keneally , said " bag checks are a sensible safety precaution which any young person who is going to a major event in Australia … would expect " .
Everyone had the right to protest so long as it was " peaceful and lawful " .
The president of the NSW Council of Civil Liberties , Cameron Murphy , said the broad meaning of " causes annoyance " had the potential to encompass any activity .
" This sort of amendment is extreme , unnecessary and is likely to escalate conflict when officers issue directions , " he said .
" People are going to be unaware that they have the power to do this and will find themselves in court facing an enormous fine . "
Ms Katzmann said : " The mere presence in the vicinity of a person wearing the apparel or insignia of another religion might be annoying or inconvenient to a participant in a World Youth Day event . "
Ms Rhiannon said the regulations were about " shutting down protests and quarantining the Pope and visiting Catholics away from messages World Youth Day authorities do n't approve of " .
Bill Gwatney , the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party , was fatally shot in his office in Little Rock on Wednesday morning , police officials said .
The officials said a gunman fired several shots at Mr. Gwatney , a former state legislator , in the party ’s headquarters near the Capitol .
After a long car chase , the suspect was fatally wounded in a shootout with the police , the authorities said .
Bill Sadler , a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police , identified the suspect as Timothy D. Johnson , 50 , of Searcy , Ark. Mr. Gwatney , 48 , was rushed to the medical center of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , but a family friend who asked not to be identified said doctors determined that he was too unstable to undergo surgery .
He died several hours later , police officials confirmed .
“ We have no indications of motive at this time , ” Lt. Terry Hastings of the Little Rock police said at an afternoon news conference .
As I read “ Clean Code ” by Robert C Martin , I was particular drawn to the passage about why unrealistic commitments should not be an excuse for writing bad code .
He points out that while it is a manager ’s job to “ defend the schedule and requirements ” , it is a developer ’s “ job to defend the code with equal passion . ”
What management says vs what management wants
One way this becomes a problem is when a developer hears management say “ I want it by Tuesday . ”
They may want it by Tuesday , but does that mean they are getting it by Tuesday .
The manager also wants it to work correctly and meet all the requirements .
A manager is n’t going to be happy if we claim it is done on Tuesday and then a whole pile of rework needs to be done afterwards .
This really means the task was n’t done by Tuesday and we just claimed it was .
“ Done ”
The manager also does n’t want this one date to be met at the cost of meeting other dates .
One way this comes up is by saying the task is done while silently thinking that parts of it will be done “ later . ”
Regardless of whether “ later ” ever comes about , the task is n’t REALLY done .
When I disagree with someone on whether a task is done , I ’ll ask if they need anymore time to work on things related to it .
This may bring up parts of the task that are n’t really done .
Sometimes it brings up additional tasks that were discovered during this task .
Either way , it is often a productive answer .
Trust
When unrealistic estimates come up , there are often two responses .
One is to silently accept it knowing the date will not be met ( or will be met at the cost of other things ) because it is “ what the manager wants . ”
The other is to discuss why the estimate will not be met with management .
Of course , the later requires much more energy at first .
However , it pays off in getting everyone to have a realistic understanding of the project .
Schedule gambling
These other desires tend to be implicit , so we only hear the deadline .
That does n’t mean that the manager wants it done by Tuesday at the expense of all else .
I ’m fond of saying that management would rather meet the production date than a development date .
So if we are meeting the development date at the expense of something that affects the production date , management will really be less happy .
This may be sloppiness that makes other tasks take longer or leaving parts of the task incomplete .
What all of these things have in common is that it is our responsibility as developers to keep management up to date and provide them with accurate visibility into what is going on within the project .

Hillary Clinton 's camp was seething yesterday over what it sees as a snub by Barack Obama in appointing a former staffer with whom she has fallen out to a key post in his campaign team .
" This is a stick in the eye to her , " one of her inner circle said , adding that it effectively ruled Clinton out as his vice - presidential running mate .
The clash comes only a fortnight after Obama and Clinton held a private hour - long chat in Washington at the end of a long and acrimonious primary contest .
Neither spoke publicly afterwards but the new appointment indicates that the meeting failed to repair relations .
Obama , announcing on Monday his enlarged campaign team for the November 4 presidential election , appointed Patti Solis Doyle , Clinton 's former campaign manager , as chief of staff for the vice - presidential candidate .
Clinton , having failed to win the Democratic presidential nomination , has been pushing to become vice - presidential candidate but Obama is reluctant to make the offer .
Clinton has been estranged from Solis Doyle since she sacked her earlier this year , blaming her for mismanaging funding and for ignoring the caucuses that gave Obama a lead that proved to be decisive .
The source in her team said : " It creates a bad taste .
It is very counterproductive .
A foolish political move ...
Choosing her as chief of staff to the vice - presidential nominee - someone that [ Clinton ] has not chosen and whom she removed - is a way of saying Hillary Clinton is not going to be the vice - president . "
Obama 's public position is that no one has been ruled out in the search for a vice - presidential candidate .
He has established a small team to vet candidates , and the list of potential running mates is long .
After the Washington meeting , Senator Dianne Feinstein , who provided her home for the two to meet , said they appeared happy .
Two days later , Clinton made a speech in Washington conceding the race and endorsing Obama .
But since then there has been no reciprocal conciliatory move by Obama .
As well as not offering her the vice - presidential slot , he has not yet proposed a joint public appearance with her or with Bill Clinton .
The Obama team does not want her on the ticket , in spite of her accumulating 18 m votes during the campaign and being more successful than him in attracting women , Latinos and white working - class males .
It fears she and her husband could be divisive , operating as an alternative power base in the White House .
There is also lingering resentment inside Obama 's camp from the primaries , blaming Bill Clinton for making race an issue .
The strain between the two camps is undermining attempts to reunite the Democratic party .
Some of Clinton 's supporters and donors have said they will not switch their support to Obama .
Clinton is scheduled to hold a conference call today with her donors urging them to switch funding to Obama .
A poll by the Washington Post / ABC published yesterday recorded that 46 % of Democrats favoured Clinton as the vice - presidential candidate .
No other potential running mate made it out of single digits .
The poll puts Obama ahead of the Republican candidate John McCain by 48 % to 42 % .
Among independents , who could hold the key to the election , the two candidates are about even .
The main issue of the day was energy policy , dominated by a speech by McCain in which he proposed extending drilling for oil in US waters .
Obama accused him of pandering to the interests of the major oil companies .
McCain , who is popular with some environmentalists because he was early among US politicians in accepting the climate change argument , aired ads yesterday distancing himself on climate change from George Bush , whose unpopularity is a drag on his candidacy .
Pro-Democratic groups paid for a counter - ad showing a woman with a baby saying she did not want McCain to send her child to Iraq .

It took only a few minutes for the blame game to begin .
Moments after the House failed to pass the $ 700 billion bailout plan , the Republican leaders –who could not produce the expected number of Republican votes for the legislation–came before the cameras with an explanation for the bill ’s collapse : a speech Nancy Pelosi gave .
House minority leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) told reporters that prior to the 228 - to - 205 vote everything was hunky - dory .
Then the House Speaker delivered a “ partisan speech ” before the floor vote began .
This , Boehner said , “ poisoned our conference and caused a number of members we thought we could get to go south . ”
Representative Eric Cantor , a member of the Republican leadership , held up a transcript of Pelosi ’s speech and decried her “ failure to lead . ”
What did Pelosi say that was so heinous ?
Here are some portions from the text that was issued by her office :
When was the last time someone asked you for $ 700 billion ?
It is a number that is staggering , but tells us only the costs of the Bush Administration ’s failed economic policies –policies built on budgetary recklessness , on an anything goes mentality , with no regulation , no supervision , and no discipline in the system … .
Over the past several days , we have worked with our Republican colleagues to fashion an alternative to the original plan of the Bush Administration … .
Our message to Wall Street is this : the party is over .
The era of golden parachutes for high - flying Wall Street operators is over .
No longer will the U.S. taxpayer bailout the recklessness of Wall Street .
The taxpayers who bear the risk in this recovery must share in the upside as the economy recovers .
And should this program not pay for itself , the financial institutions that benefited , not the taxpayers , must bear responsibility for making up the difference .
These were the Democratic demands to safeguard the American taxpayer , to help the economy recover , and to impose tough accountability as a central component of this recovery effort .
Today , we will act to avert this crisis , but informed by our experience of the past eight years with the failed economic leadership that has left us left capable of meeting the challenges of the future .
We choose a different path .
In the new year , with a new Congress and a new president , we will break free with a failed past and take America in a New Direction to a better future .
Tough stuff , eh ?
In comments she added to her prepared remarks , she referred to George W. Bush ’s “ reckless economic policies . ”
Even so , the Republicans ’ excuse –that nasty ol ’ Pelosi made us do it–is silly .
Boehner told reporters that what Republicans care most about is “ what ’s best for the American people . ”
Then how could members of his caucus be swayed by a few partisan words ( if they were partisan ) from Pelosi ?
Do they put easily - bruised feelings ahead of important policy matters ?
As Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House financial services committee , put it , a number of Republicans simply do not believe in government intervention in markets .
He derided Boehner ’s explanation , characterizing it this way : “ Somebody hurt my felelings and I decided to hurt my country . ”
Frank added , “ Give me those 12 Republicans [ who supposedly would have voted for the bill had it not been for Pelosi ’s speech ] , and I will talk uncharacteristically nice to them . ”
( Dozens of House Democrats , bucking Democratic leaders , concluded that this proposed intervention was not a good deal for American taxpayers . )
Meanwhile –with the Dow Jones dropping a historic amount –John McCain ’s campaign had another explanation for the bill ’s collapse : it was Barack Obama ’s fault .
A McCain campaign aide told reporters , “ It failed because Barack Obama phoned it in . ”
Meaning that Obama did not round up enough Democrats to vote for the legislation .
( Ninety - five Democrats opposed the package . )
Yet it was McCain ’s party comrades who voted in higher numbers against the bill .
( One hundred and thirty three GOPers said no to the proposal . )
Why does n’t that make McCain responsible for the bill ’s flameout ?
For his part , Barack Obama released a statement blasting McCain ’s “ angry and hyper - partisan statement . ”
Maybe the problem was that the bill was not very good and that a bipartisan majority ( for very different reasons ) could n’t swallow it .
Now members of Congress are considering another vote ( on what might be another version of the bill ) later in the week .
In the meantime , expect lots of spin .

This misspelling of “ bastards ” continues through the screenplay , suggesting we were right when we guessed Tarantino was writing really , really fast .
He does n’t even have time to spell - check if he ’s gonna get this movie turned around by Cannes !
The script is 165 pages long and follows a squad of American soldiers called the Bastards — a guerrillalike force who travel behind German lines in 1944 , striking terror into the hearts of Nazi soldiers .
The Bastards are headed by Lieutenant Aldo Raine — the role we ’d imagine Tarantino is hoping to land Brad Pitt for — described by the script as a “ hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee , ” who has around his neck a scar from where he survived a lynching .
( “ The scar will never once be mentioned , ” Tarantino writes . )
In a parallel story , Inglorious Bastards follows a French Jewish teenager named Shosanna who survives the massacre of her family and flees to Paris , where she winds up running a movie house during the Nazi occupation .
The Bastards ’ and Shosanna ’s stories intersect when a gala premiere of a Goebbels - produced propaganda film is put on in Shosanna ’s theater , with Hitler and most of the German High Command scheduled to attend .
Both the Bastards and Shosanna launch plots intending to end the war a little earlier than anyone expected .
The script ’s divided into five chapters :
te >Chapter One : Once Upon a Time … Nazi Occupied France
Chapter Two : Inglorious Basterds
Chapter Three : German Night in Paris
Chapter Four : Operation Kino
Chapter Five : Revenge of the Giant Face
The first chapter , set in 1941 , introduces Shosanna and the film ’s antagonist , a Nazi officer named Landa who ’s known as the “ Jew Hunter . ”
The second chapter introduces the Bastards and their tactics :
They kill Nazis on sight , take their scalps , and — when they let one go — carve a swastika into his forehead .
The third chapter , set in 1944 , reintroduces Shosanna in Paris ( “ This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave Black and White ” ) .
The fourth sets up the Bastards ’ attack on the theater .
And it all comes together in Chapter Five , which plays fast and loose with history , to say the least .
The script is definitely the ur-text of Quentin Tarantino ’s career up to now ; it combines his love of old movies ( war movies , Westerns , and even prewar German cinema ) , his attraction to powerful female protagonists , his love of chatter , and his willingness to embrace the extreme — visually and in his storytelling .
( The flashbacks have particularly Tarantinoian flourishes : a thought bubble pops out of a character ’s head to introduce one , while another is shot spaghetti Western style . )
All in all , it reads like Kill Bill meets The Dirty Dozen meets Cinema Paradiso .
We wondered at times if this script was a fake , and it ’s still possible that it is — but if so , it ’s such a skillful fake that the author has even mastered Tarantino ’s ability to write moments that seem almost like parodies of his own tastes .
Such as , for example , our favorite moment in the screenplay , with a mix of fetishism and inspired comedy that feels authentically alive .
Late in chapter four , the Nazis are preparing Shosanna ’s movie theater for its big premiere , and Goebbels tells her that he appreciates “ the modesty of this auditorium . ”
Then he suggests sprucing the place up a bit , with a chandelier from Versailles and a couple of Greek nudes from the Louvre scattered around the lobby .
A quick montage shows this happening , and then Tarantino describes the result :
We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty , to hoist the huge , heavy , and twinkingly fragile chandelier , in Shosannas auditorium , which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass ’s Italian B - movie rip - off ’s of Visconti ’s “ The Damned ” .
If anyone is crazy enough to fund it , this movie is gonna be awesome .

WHETHER mobile phones can cause cancer remains moot ( see article ) .
But they are also accused by some of causing pain .
A growing number of people around the world claim to be “ electrosensitive ” , in other words physically responsive to the electromagnetic fields that surround phones and the other electronic devices that clutter the modern world .
Indeed , at least one country , Sweden , has recognised such sensitivity as a disability , and will pay for the dwellings of sufferers to be screened from the world 's electronic smog .
The problem is that , time and again , studies of those claiming to be electrosensitive show their ability to determine whether they are being exposed to a real electric field or a sham one is no better than chance .
So , unless they are lying about their symptoms , the cause of those symptoms needs to be sought elsewhere .
Michael Landgrebe and Ulrich Frick , of the University of Regensburg , in Germany , think that the “ elsewhere ” in question is in the brain and , in a paper presented recently to the Royal Society in London , they describe an experiment which , they think , proves their point .
Dr Landgrebe and Dr Frick used a body scanner called a functional magnetic - resonance imager to see how people 's brains react to two different kinds of stimulus .
Thirty participants , half of whom described themselves as electrosensitive , were put in the imager and told that they would undergo a series of trials in which they would be exposed either to an active mobile phone or to a heating device called a thermode , whose temperature would be varied between the trials .
The thermode was real .
The mobile phone , however , was a dummy .
The type of stimulus , be it the authentic heat source or the sham electromagnetic radiation , was announced before each exposure and the volunteers were asked to rate its unpleasantness on a five - point scale .
In the case of heat , the two groups ' descriptions of their experiences were comparable .
So , too , was their brain activity .
However , when it came to the sham - phone exposure , only the electrosensitives described any sensations — which ranged from prickling to pain .
Moreover , they showed neural activity to match .
Some of the same bits of their brains lit up as when they were exposed to high temperatures .
This suggests that electrosensitivity , rather than being a response to electromagnetic stimulus , is akin to well - known psychosomatic disorders such as some sorts of tinnitus and chronic pain .
A psychosomatic disorder is one in which the symptoms are real , but are induced by cognitive functions such as attitudes , beliefs and expectations rather than by direct external stimuli .
The paradoxical upshot of Dr Landgrebe 's and Dr Frick 's experiment is that mobile phones do indeed inflict real suffering on some unfortunate individuals .
It is just that the electromagnetic radiation they emit has nothing whatsoever to do with it .
With senator Barack Obama poised this week to clinch his party 's nomination for President , there are growing fears in some quarters that the Democratic party may not be choosing its strongest candidate to beat Republican John McCain .
Senator Hillary Clinton has been making that argument for weeks .
Now some recent polls and analysis , looking particularly at vital battleground states and support among white voters , have bolstered her case - even as Obama looks certain to become the nominee .
Obama supporters reject this argument and point to his record of boosting Democratic voter turnout , especially among the young .
But sceptics in the party , already nervous about nominating Obama after the furore over outspoken pastor Jeremiah Wright , are growing increasingly concerned .
' There is an element of buyer 's remorse in some areas .
The question is whether it gets really strong now or in September - or even after the election is over , if he loses , ' said Steve Mitchell , head of political consultancy Mitchell Research .
Another boost to Clinton 's case came late last week after a pro-Obama preacher gave a race - tinged rant against her at Obama 's church in Chicago .
In a recent sermon Michael Pfleger - a long - term Obama backer who is white - mocked Clinton as an entitled white person angry at a black man having beaten her .
His angry , red - faced speech , in which he mimicked Clinton weeping , was played repeatedly across American cable channels and the internet .
The news sent shock waves through Democratic circles ; many had hoped Obama had put ' pastor problems ' behind him .
' It is more of the same problem as Wright .
It reinforces the image among some voters that Obama does not share their values , ' said Mitchell .
The uproar also lent a disturbingly antagonistic tone to scenes in Washington DC where Clinton and Obama supporters gathered yesterday outside a party rules meeting called to resolve the problem of the disputed Michigan and Florida primaries , which Clinton claims as victories .
Clinton supporters chanted ' Count our votes ! ' and waved placards and banners .
Clinton wants those states ' delegations seated at the Denver convention , even though they broke party rules by holding early contests .
Obama is now to some extent limping to the finishing line .
Clinton 's refusal to bow out even though her odds of victory have become almost impossible has seen her win several of the most recent contests .
In fact , since 4 March , Clinton has won around half a million more votes than Obama .
That run of victories should easily continue today when Puerto Rico goes to the polls , and could even extend to the final primaries - South Dakota and Montana - which vote on Tuesday .
Obama had been expected to win there , but Clinton has been campaigning furiously and it could be close .
Clinton has been making the case for several months , as her support has grown stronger among white working class voters , that those voters will not support Obama in a general election .
By contrast , experts believe Obama 's core - educated Democrats and blacks - will remain loyal to the party no matter who the nominee is .
There is strong data to back that up , especially from recent votes in West Virginia and Kentucky where large proportions of Clinton voters said they would not back Obama in November .
There is also a growing fear that many of the women backing Clinton are turning against Obama .
Clinton and her supporters have controversially accused their rival , and the media , of being misogynistic in the last few weeks of the race .
A recent Pew Poll showed Obama 's support among white women collapsing from 56 per cent to 43 per cent .
But the electoral fact remains the same .
The dramatic Obama vs Clinton contest is now down to a few hundred uncommitted party ' superdelegates ' , who are under huge pressure to make their decisions in the next few days .
Senior party figures , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , have been working privately to convince them to make that decision as soon as possible , ideally this week .
With Obama 's delegate lead unassailable , the vast majority are almost certain to come over to his side .
Republican analysts , meanwhile , are surprised about how healthy their party 's prospects look in a year when almost all indicators suggested they should lose .
McCain remains competitive against Obama .
He even leads in some key states .
Indeed , some research predicts he could romp home against Obama .
It is that prospect , Clinton supporters say , that leads them to keep fighting .
They point to Obama 's performance in North Carolina as a bellwether : it was his strong win there earlier this month that dealt an almost fatal blow to Clinton 's chances .
Yet , two weeks after that win , polls showed Clinton easily outperformed Obama there when measured against McCain .
' Clinton has a very strong argument that she is a stronger candidate against McCain .
It is just that it has fallen on deaf ears , ' said Mitchell .
Cops : Md. Mom Kept Dead Kids in Freezer Police are investigating how a woman kept her kids in a freezer unnoticed .
Sept. 29 , 2008  --
Police in two Maryland counties are trying to figure out how a woman allegedly has been able to live with the frozen corpses of her children for at least a year without anyone knowing .
The children 's remains , which police believe to be the two young daughters of Renee Bowman of Lusby , Md. , were found last week stuffed in a freezer in the family 's home .
Police made the discovery after raiding the home in search of evidence relating to child abuse charges involving a third daughter , Calvert County Sheriff 's Office Lt. Bobby Jones told ABCNews.com .
While the medical examiner 's office has not formally identified the girls , Jones said they are believed to be Bowman 's adopted daughters , born in 1997 and 1999 .
Police are still piecing together a timeline for the family , but believe the two girls were killed in Montgomery County one to two years ago .
Their frozen bodies may have been transported in a freezer when Bowman and her now 7 - year - old daughter , also adopted , moved more than an hour away to Lusby in February .
" We believe they 've been in the freezer the whole time , " Jones said .
Montgomery County Police Lt. Paul Starks said police were interviewing people in the area to determine when the family lived in the town of Rockville and " also when the children were last seen alive . "
She has not yet been charged with the murder of the children , Starks said , because police have not yet confirmed where exactly they were killed .
Bowman is being held without bond in Calvert County on child abuse charges , Jones said , while the Montgomery County authorities investigate .
The case was set in motion last week when Calvert County police officers were called to a home on Pawnee Lane after Bowman 's 7 - year - old knocked on the door of a neighbor after jumping out of her second - story bedroom window on nearby Buckskin Trail .
" When the officer got there , he saw she has some signs of what looked to be physical abuse and neglect , " Jones said .
The girl showed police where she had jumped out the window , telling officers that she had been locked in her bedroom and left unattended .
Bowman , Jones said , was charged with first - degree assault and child abuse , both felonies .
" She basically admitted that she had struck the child with a hard - heeled shoe , " he said .
A search warrant was granted to look for further evidence , which led police to find the frozen bodies in a basement freezer Friday .
Jones said police in Calvert County never had a reason to question the welfare of Bowman or any children .
The only contact police have made with her since she moved into town was a routine traffic stop .
Likewise , Child Protective Services in Montgomery County also never had reason to visit the home , Starks said .
A teenage neighbor said he lives about three houses away from Bowman 's Buckskin Trail house , but never knew the woman or her 7 - year - old .
" I 've seen a car there a couple of times , but never people , " he said .
The teen said the two - story tan house was blocked off with police - tape , and a crush of police and news vehicles made it nearly impossible to get a car down the street .
" It 's , like , unusual it would happen around here , " he said .
( CNN ) -- Asian and Pacific stock markets sank in early trade on Tuesday after the U.S. House of Representatives failed to adopt a financial bailout plan , which triggered the largest point drop in U.S. market history .
Many of the markets expanded their losses toward the end of the trading day .
The Hong Kong stock exchange dropped 2.42 percent , while the Australian Securities Exchange fell 4.58 percent .
The Korea Exchange in Seoul , South Korea , was down 0.72 percent , after being off more than three percent earlier .
Japan 's Nikkei Index was down 3.6 percent .
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday morning pumped another 2 trillion yen ( $ 19.23 billion ) into money markets , amid an effort among the world 's central banks to calm worries about a global financial crisis , The Associated Press reported .
The Bank of Japan in recent weeks has been injecting trillions of yen by the day to add liquidity into the system .
The latest brings the bank 's infusion to a total of 20 trillion yen ( $ 192.3 billion ) , AP reported .
Watch why the Asian financial system remains resilient »
The American stock market was down almost 778 points at closing -- just under 7 percent -- the worst single - day point loss ever , topping even the loss following the September 11 terrorist attacks ..
U.S. lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Monday voted against the biggest proposed government intervention in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression of 1929 .
Government officials ,
Treasury chiefs and political leaders from both sides of the political divide thought they had agreed Sunday on the details of a $ 700 billion rescue plan that would prop up the nation 's ailing financial system -- and be supported in the House of Representatives .
Watch a Wall St. veteran tell why he thinks the bailout is vital »
As it became apparent the vote was lost , the Dow Jones plunged .
Monday 's plummet knocked out approximately $ 1.2 trillion in market value , the first post - $ 1 trillion day ever , according to a drop in the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 , the broadest measure of the stock market .
However the 7 percent decline does not rank among the top 10 percentage declines .
Republicans and Democrats blamed each other for the result -- 205 to 228 against the bailout .
President George W. Bush was " very disappointed , " his spokesman , Tony Fratto said .
Bush will be meeting with his advisors and will be calling congressional leaders , Fratto added .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he will continue to work with congressional leaders to draft a plan that does pass .
Before the vote , Bush said the plan was of " tremendous importance to all Americans . "
Bailout explainer :
What 's in the bill ?
The Democratic candidate for U.S. president , Sen. Barack Obama , blasted Congress for not passing a financial rescue package , while the Republican candidate , Sen. John McCain 's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of putting " politics ahead of country . "
A four - hour debate included impassioned pleas for and against the measure from Democrats and Republicans alike .
Even some of those arguing for the legislation were quick to point out problems with it .
But the vote began with both Democratic and Republican leadership telling their members the only way to protect the economy from a spreading credit crunch was to vote for the difficult to swallow measure .
After the defeat , Republican leaders accused Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House , of giving a partisan speech which " poisoned " Republican support .
Watch Republicans lay the blame at Democratic feet »
Pelosi said the $ 700 billion " is a number that is staggering , but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration 's failed economic policies . "
But Barney Frank , the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee , demanded : " Because somebody hurt their feelings , they decided to punish the country ? "
He said he did not think the Republican leadership was able to get enough colleagues to support the bailout and was diverting attention to Pelosi .
When leading House Republicans signed on to the proposal Sunday after earlier reservations , the bill was expected to pass .
Governments , markets and businesses around the world were watching developments in Washington closely amid fears that failure to tackle the crisis on Wall Street could have disastrous repercussions for the entire global economy .
Markets tumbled again on Monday , affected by uncertainty earlier in the day over the U.S. bailout plan and fresh anxiety over the longterm consequences of so - called " toxic debts " which have already brought many established financial names to their knees .
Light , sweet crude oil for November fell $ 10.52 , or 8.9 % , to $ 96.37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Argentina 's principal index -- the Merval -- tumbled nearly 10 percent .
" This is going to affect the whole planet .
It 's not a problem of the United States alone .
The United States is the world 's foremost economy and this is going to affect everyone , " said one person in Buenos Aires .
European and Asian markets were closed by the time the bailout was rejected .
In Europe , London 's FTSE 100 closed down about 4.16 percent , Paris ' CAC - 40 was down 4.9 percent and Frankfurt 's DAX fell 3.87 percent .
In other developments Monday , federal regulators said they had brokered a deal for Wachovia , the fourth largest bank in the U.S. , to sell its banking assets to Citigroup .
Shares in Wachovia crashed on Friday amid concerns over its exposure to subprime mortgage debt .

The U.S. bailout bill , released Sunday and endorsed by Bush after days of intense negotiations , is based on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's request for authority to purchase bad debts from financial institutions so banks can resume lending to enable credit markets , now virtually frozen , to resume operating normally .
Concerns among some politicians over potential costs to taxpayers led to several amendments inserted to protect them from risk while giving them a chance to share in any profits if companies on Wall Street benefit from the plan .
Pelosi said Sunday the provisions added by Congress -- which include a restriction on salary packages for senior executives whose companies benefit from the rescue plan -- will protect taxpayers from having to foot the bill for the bailout .
The aim of the rescue plan , which Paulson has been pushing since September 18 , is to unfreeze the credit markets -- short - term lending among banks and corporations .
The core of the problem is bad real estate loans that led to record foreclosures when the housing bubble burst and home prices declined .
In the past two weeks , the banking world and Wall Street have been reordered by a wave of collapses and corporate mergers .
The U.S. government has already intervened to protect key mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurance giant AIG .

An anonymous reader alerts us to an Orlando Sentinel report based on a leaked NASA email , indicating that NASA is looking at options to extend the Shuttle program .
The fighting between Russia and Georgia has put a strain on plans to rely on Russian boosters until the Shuttle 's replacement flies in 2015 .
Yet extending the Shuttle 's life is no sure thing .
According to a former NASA program manager , " We started shutting down the shuttle four years ago .
That horse has left the barn . "
And NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has told Congress that if the Shuttle fleet were to fly two missions a year until 2015 , " the risk would be about one in 12 that we would lose another crew .
That 's a high risk ... [ one ]
I would not choose to accept on behalf of our astronauts . "
And then there 's the matter of finding the $ 4 billion a year it would take to keep the fleet operational .
The Sentinel mentions that John McCain has called for additional Shuttle flights , but does n't mention that Barack Obama has made the same point , as the BBC reports .
Assuming the federal government has , after almost seven years , finally identified the perpetrator of the anthrax attacks in 2001  admittedly a generous assumption given that for most of those years , it pursued , hounded , embarrassed , and ruined the career of the wrong man  larger dangers remain .
As is normally the case with issues surrounding terrorism , the average citizen will probably be shocked to learn that their government is often a bigger threat than the terrorists .
Remember the CIA ’s creation of the 9/11 threat by supporting the most radical Islamist groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s and then the U.S. government ’s provocation of terrorist attacks from those same militants by its non-Islamic military presence in Islamic Persian Gulf countries in the 1990s , which had continued unnecessarily subsequent to the first Gulf War .
Similarly , in the case of bioterrorism , the threat from the government is greater than from foreign groups such as al - Qaeda .
Although U.S. intelligence has created fear among the U.S. public by saying that al - Qaeda has made efforts to obtain biological weapons , the capabilities of small terrorist groups to make , handle , weaponize , and disperse biological agents is very limited .
Even Aum Shinrikyo , a well - funded Japanese terrorist group that hired Ph.D. scientists , could not successfully carry out a biological weapons attack .
( Even their chemical attacks , which are technologically easier to accomplish , were ham - handed and did not result in mass deaths . )
The sophisticated weaponization and dispersion of biological agents are difficult for technologically challenged and relatively poor terrorist groups to master ; they usually require the resources and technology of governments .
Whether Bruce Ivins , a government bioscientist , is the real culprit in the anthrax attacks or not , it seems that the FBI has traced the perpetrator to the U.S. government ’s own research facility , which has plenty of people qualified to carry out such an attack .
And apparently some employees would have a motive to do so .
The FBI insinuated that Ivins had a motive because his anthrax vaccine research program was in trouble .
What better way to get more money for your project that to generate a non-hypothetical threat to combat ?
It ’s true that the vast majority of people on the government ’s payroll working on lethal biological agents would not stoop to perpetrate such a heinous crime .
Yet the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks the same year had the effect that Ivins allegedly desired .
An avalanche of government funding went into countering the minimal threat from a terrorist group capable of using biological weapons .
To capture some of the governmental windfall , many medical and infectious disease programs tried to tie their efforts to battling bioterrorism .
It worked .
Before 9/11 , only five laboratories existed that were equipped to study the most lethal bioagents  biosafety level 4 labs .
Now there are 15 in operation or being built .
Combined , there are now 400 biosafety 3 and 4 facilities , which can produce lethal anthrax .
In all , nationwide , 14,000 scientists can work on such lethal biological agents , many of whom are researchers at non-governmental universities .
According to experts , security at such facilities is lax ; the government merely requires them to have locked doors but no video surveillance .
And government background checks of employees would not prevent a person who had homicidal tendencies or a sociopathic personality  allegedly exhibited by Ivins  from working in them .
Even if Ivins is not the perpetrator of the anthrax attacks , he made homicidal threats to a therapist a year before the attacks and was allowed to continue to work in a lab with dangerous bioagents for years after he exhibited mental problems .
( Not to mention that the FBI seems to have ignored such information for years while erroneously pursuing an innocent suspect . )
Thus , to combat a minimal bioterror threat from ragtag terrorist groups , the government has actually dramatically increased the probability of another bioattack from a trained scientist  whether because of malicious criminal intent , mental illness , or a desire to increase funding for his or her antidote or vaccine program  who could competently carry out such an attack .
This counterproductive effect resembles what the government did to remedy coordination problems among security agencies that caused a failure to detect and prevent the 9/11 attacks : its creation of the Department of Homeland Security and reorganization of the intelligence community added more bureaucracy , thus making coordination even more difficult .
In short , the anthrax case illustrates few security problems exist that the government does n’t create or make worse .
After several days of violent fluctuations , the world ’s stock markets registered a massive increase in share prices on Thursday afternoon and on Friday , September 18 and 19 , 2008 .
Why ?
As the Associated Press put it , “ investors stormed back into the market , relieved that the government plans to restore calm to the financial system by rescuing banks from billions of dollars in bad debt .
The Dow Jones industrials rose about 365 points , giving them a massive gain of about 775 over two days . ”
Other stock markets also rose tremendously : on Friday the S&P 500 closed up more than 49 points , or about 4 percent ; the Nasdaq closed up almost 75 points , or 3.4 percent .
Exactly what the government will do remains to be determined .
Officials from the Treasury and the Fed and members of Congress intend to spend the weekend hammering out the details .
Be afraid , be very afraid .
The impending measures come close on the heels of a series of wrong - headed actions undertaken by the government , including the bailout / takeover of Fannie , Freddie , and AIG ; massive injections of new credit by the Fed and other major central banks ; and the SEC ’s prohibition of short - selling for almost 800 financial - company stocks .
If , as anticipated , the Treasury moves next to assume the rotten paper currently being held by banks and other lenders ( presumably mortgages and related securities , for the most part ) , then it is fair to conclude that the government has given up entirely on the free market and has decided to occupy the wasteland where outright socialism and economic fascism meet .
Of course , everyone engaged in this hysterical flailing will assert that the objective is only to save capitalism in a crisis .
Such government saviors always make that claim , oblivious to its absurdity .
Franklin D. Roosevelt and his gang claimed to be saving capitalism , too , but look at what was left of it when they had finished their work .
As economic historians witness the current machinations , they cannot help but recall the eerily similar events of August 13 - 15 , 1971 , another ill - fated weekend .
At Camp David , President Richard M. Nixon huddled with his top economic advisers in an atmosphere of crisis and hastily crafted an extraordinarily inauspicious package of policy actions .
As described in the 1972 Council of Economic Advisers Report , “ The United States suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets , for the first time since 1934 .
It imposed a temporary surcharge , generally at the rate of 10 percent , on dutiable imports .
Prices , wages , and rents were frozen for 90 days , to be followed by a more flexible and durable — but still temporary — system of mandatory controls . ”
Herbert Stein , Nixon ’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , later recalled : “ Even after 25 years I am amazed by how little we looked ahead during that exciting weekend at Camp David , when we ( the president , really ) made those big decisions . ”
Everybody seems to have assumed without discussion that after a 90 - day wage - and - price freeze , the government would somehow ease back to a regime of free , flexible prices .
However , “ [ a ] s it turned out , we were in the price and wage control business not for 90 days but for nearly 1,000 .
[ Moreover , ] [ w]e were in the business of controlling energy prices for much longer . ”
Likewise , the emergency policies the government is currently concocting will certainly have extensive ramifications , many of them unanticipated , for years to come .
The encouragement to moral hazard now being given to financial institutions promises to make them more reckless than the biggest plunger in Las Vegas .
After all , any profit will go into their pockets , but any big losses , they will reasonably expect , will be sloughed off onto the taxpayers .
Yes , indeed , that image shimmering on the horizon is Casino Capitalism .
Henry Paulson , Ben Bernanke , and the rest of these statist saviors are making a mighty contribution to this country ’s economic ruin .
Notice , however , that the investors love every bit of it , just as they did after Nixon audaciously displaced the broadcast of Bonanza to announce his New Economic Policy to the nation on Sunday evening , August 15 , 1971 .
The people loved it , even those with money at stake .
As Stein observed , “ [t ] he Dow - Jones Average rose 32.9 points on Monday after the President ’s announcement — the biggest one - day increase up to that point . ”
Here then are two dates matched in history : August 16 , 1971 , and September 19 , 2008 .
On those days , investors demonstrated that they were willing to sell the soul of capitalism for a shabby promise of temporary government salvation .
What Stein wrote about the 1971 episode in his book Presidential Economics might with equal validity be written about today ’s events : “ This reaction is important to the history of economic policy in America .
It shows how shallow was the general support in principle for the basic characteristics of a free market economy . ”
How shallow it was ; how shallow it remains .
The question is , How many times can the government race its emergency bailout vehicle toward the cliff without dragging the entire economy irretrievably into the abyss of outright socialism or full - fledged , Mussolini - style economic fascism ?

It ’s always amusing when politicians , cops and other denizens of the dark side lecture the rest of us on morality .
A hit - and - run accident in Hartford , Connecticut , has given everyone from the city ’s chief of police to the state ’s governor an excuse to scold the citizens who pay their salaries .
On Friday , May 30 , 78 - year - old Angel Torres tried to cross a street when one car nearly clipped him and a second hit him .
Neither driver appears to so much as tap his brakes in the video captured by a surveillance camera .
Mr. Torres " is tossed like a rag doll , " as the Associated Press put it , and then " lies motionless " in the middle of the busy , two - lane avenue .
Pedestrians stand staring on the sidewalk .
Cars maneuver past the poor man without apparent concern ; others slow or temporarily stop .
A motorcyclist cuts over to survey Mr. Torres and the bystanders stepping off the sidewalk to gather around him , then roars off .
A cop coincidentally in the area cruises into things about 70 seconds after Mr. Torres goes down .
Aside from the person who hit Mr. Torres — and there ’s no doubt the driver knew what he ’d done : his victim is briefly splayed against the Honda ’s front passenger window before bouncing off — , folks react rationally .
They ’re stunned , hesitant , unsure what to do , but not so much that they ’ve forgotten first aid ’s first lesson : " Try not to move the victim . "
Bryant Hayre , 37 , who " walked over to the accident scene " after buying some smokes , says that Mr. Torres was conscious and bleeding ; he added , “ I ’m not skilled enough when it comes to blood flowing or I would have helped him . "
Good call .
Turns out the accident paralyzed Mr. Torres , and as every course in first aid advises , " If the neck is injured , moving it can lacerate the spine and cause paralysis .
Until proven otherwise , assume that such an injury is possible . "
But Hartford ’s chief of police sees callousness , not caution .
“ No one came to his aid , ” Daryl Roberts claimed .
“ There were actually people looking at him … and driving away . "
The outraged Daryl thundered , " [ These sorts of ] situations … dehumanize our community " before he inadvertently told the truth : " I ’m ashamed to say our city has a toxic relationship with ourselves . ”
So why not pull the plug on that poison and abolish the municipal government ?
Daryl fired his volley after seeing the " very graphic " video , which he decided " sent a very bad message . ”
He leaped to the usual conclusion of Leviathan ’s lackeys : citizens are stupid , derelict , and incompetent .
No wonder they failed to help Mr. Torres .
" We no longer have a moral compass , " said the guy who devotes a good portion of his day to stealing other peoples ’ property ( " Year to date we have seized close to 180 guns , " Daryl brags on his blog , " last year we seized 400 .
In one day alone Vice and Narcotics detectives conducted seven hot spot details , resulting in 42 arrests , seizure of two firearms , three vehicles , ten grams of crack , 1,300 bags of Heroin , and 12 grams of cocaine " ) .
" Anything goes , ” despaired this " chief among plunderers . "
And so " Roberts said he was u2018 calling out ’ city residents .
u2018I ’m challenging them to treat people with dignity and respect , ’ he said .
u2018 This is no longer acceptable . ’"
Hmmm .
Would n’t " treating people with dignity and respect " mean not picking their pockets , nor insulting their intelligence by re-naming robbery " taxation " ?
Should it include prohibiting inspectors from invading businesses and homes on the presumption that without the city ’s guidance , slovenly citizens will wallow in filth and unsafe conditions ?
How about butting out of the marketplace so that consumers can buy whatever they wish wherever they please ?
Assuming that we silly fools will overdose on heroin or blow ourselves up with fireworks does n’t exactly exude " dignity and respect , " now , does it ?
Talk about living in a glass house !
Let ’s hope Daryl ’s hypocrisy inspires enough rock - throwing to demolish it .
Surprise , surprise : Chief Roberts ’ bias against the citizens he supposedly " serves " so blinded him that he never bothered to check with 911 .
He had to " backtrack " when someone pointed out that " four people called 911 within a minute of the accident , and that the victim … received medical attention shortly thereafter . "
Daryl might have suspected as much since one woman in the infamous video appears to be clutching something , presumably a cell - phone , to her ear .
She stands directly in the motorcyclist ’s view .
Perhaps that explains why he rides off : he decided enough people were already dialing 911 .
Dozens more might have phoned — except " bystanders speculated that people were afraid to get involved because they … do n’t feel comfortable talking to police . "
Say it ai n’t so .
Naturally , Connecticut ’s governor could n’t resist the temptation to burnish her own rectitude by denouncing citizens ’ lack of it .
Jodi Rell reflexively and ignorantly condemned " the reaction of some passers - by who did little in the moments after the crash to assist Mr. Torres . ”
She considers the video “ beyond chilling . ”
Nope .
That would be government .

An inquest into the death of Welsh gym owner Gerald Mellin has found the businessman decapitated himself in his Aston Martin DB7 after an argument with his estranged wife .
According to the court , Mellin tied one end of a rope to a tree , climbed into his DB7 and wrapped the other end around his neck .
Mellin then jammed the pedal down on the $ 173,000 car , driving into a busy main road , forcing other drivers to watch his horrific death .
Police found his headless body still in the driving seat and his head on the back seat .
But what caused Millen to kill himself with such heinous vehicular methodology ?

Well , according to Mrs Mellin :
" We had split up and been to court .
He wanted me to walk away from the farmhouse and the business and leave me with nothing ... so we met in a pub after a court hearing and he started having a tantrum .
As we made our way back to our cars he opened the boot and said : " There 's my rope , that 's what I 'm going to kill myself with . "
I told him to grow up and give me the rope .
But he just laughed . "

Apparently , the court also ruled the day before his death that Mrs Mellin would be awarded an extra £ 100 ( $ 192.00 ) a week in maintenance from her husband .
Umm , talk about a low bar to set for suicide , right ?

Create public policies that protect consumers and workers , and that " should support the growth of good , career jobs , and require the public reporting of deployment , actual speed , price , and service . "
The high - speed Internet advocacy Web site , Speed Matters , has just released a report on the average Internet connection speeds by U.S. state .
If you live in Rhode Island ( 6,769 Kbps ) , Delaware ( 6,685 Kbps ) , New Jersey ( 5,825 Kbps ) , Virginia ( 5,033 Kbps ) , or Massachusetts ( 4,564 Kbps ) , you can take pride that your state has one of the fastest average Internet downstream connection speeds in the U.S.
But before you get too smug , compare your speed against the average 63 Mbps downstream speed that the Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) claims Japan has ... Or South Korea ( 49 Mbps ) , Finland ( 21 Mbps ) , France ( 17 Mbps ) , or even Canada ( 7.6 Mbps ) for that matter .
The report states that the overall average dowstream speed for the U.S. is just 2.3 Mbps -- only 0.4 M bps faster than the previous year .
The states ( or territory ) with the slowest average downstream speeds are Puerto Rico ( 499 Kbps ) , Alaska ( 814 Kbps ) , North Dakota ( 1,164 Kbps ) , Montana ( 1,320 Kbps ) , and Wyoming ( 1,325 Kbps ) .
As far as upstream speeds go , the U.S. average is 435 Kbps , with the fastest state , Delaware , at 1,483 Kbps , and the slowest state , Alaska , at 246 Kbps .
These results were collected from a survey of almost 230,000 Internet users who used the Speed Matters Internet speed test between May 2007 and May 2008 .
The Speed Matters site is an advocacy arm of the CWA , a large labor union of communications and media workers .
The mission of the site is to promote high - speed Internet connections in the U.S. , for economic growth , global competition , and to get broadband Internet connections into the homes of low - income families .
" This is n’t about how fast someone can download a full - length movie .
Speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace .
Rural development , telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high - speed , universal networks . " -- Larry Cohen , CWA President
The report offers an eight - step plan for how the CWA envisions the U.S. can meet the CWA 's mission :
At least some of these steps are part of the Broadband Data Improvement Act , which was introduced by Senator Daniel Inouye ( D - HI ) in May 2007 .
The bill is currently with the Senate Commerce , Science , and Transportation - - of which Senator Inouye is the chairman .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Apple Inc. shares fell to their lowest levels in more than 16 months Monday as two analysts cut their ratings on the Mac maker 's stock due to a growing risk that consumer spending on high - end electronics is slowing down heading into the end of the year .
By the time the market closed , Apple 's shares AAPL , - 0.75 % had fallen $ 22.98 , or almost 18 % , closing at $ 105.26 .
The stock has plunged nearly 40 % over the past month on worries about slowing demand , as well as the technical issues that have plagued the launch of its 3G iPhone .
Before the opening bell , Kathryn Huberty of Morgan Stanley cut her rating on the stock to equal - weight from overweight .
RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky made a similar move , lowering his rating to sector perform from outperform .
In her research note , Huberty also lowered her 2009 earnings estimates for Apple , citing evidence that overall PC sales are slowing and that the only area of growth is the market for PCs that cost less than $ 1,000 .
Apple does n't sell any of its laptop or desktop PCs for less than $ 1,000 ; its Mac mini computer starts at $ 599 but does n't come with a keyboard , mouse or monitor .
Mac sales have been strong over the past several quarters .
Apple 's third - quarter results recorded sales of 2.5 million Macs , up 41 % from a year earlier .
Mac revenue rose 43 % to $ 3.6 billion .
However , Huberty said several factors present a challenge for Apple as it tries to maintain its growth rates in the PC market .
She noted that Apple has about 69 % of the market for U.S. consumer PCs that cost more than $ 1,500 , saying that " the combination of slowing unit demand and a shift to lower - end price points put Mac growth at risk . "
She also said that slower growth , along with more investment to expand Apple 's iPhone reach will drive up the company 's operating expenses and put pressure on earnings next year .
Morgan Stanley was concerned that consensus estimates had not been revised downward to reflect slowing consumer demand and that a positive bias among equity analysts -- with 27 of 32 sell - side analysts taking positions on the stock that Huberty characterized as overweight -- had limited the upside for Apple shares during the next three to six months , Huberty wrote .
Huberty cut her 2009 earnings estimate on Apple to $ 5.47 a share from $ 5.91 a share .
On average , analysts surveyed by FactSet Research currently expect Apple to earn $ 6.02 a share in its 2009 fiscal year .
At RBC , Abramsky lowered his price target on Apple 's stock to $ 140 a share from $ 200 , saying that the stock is n't " recession proof . "
The analyst predicted that Apple would report good Mac sales for its fourth quarter , which finishes at the end of September , and said he anticipates unit sales will rise 34 % in the quarter from a year ago .
However , Abramsky trimmed his estimates for Apple 's Mac sales to 2.9 million units from 3 million , and there is an " elevated risk " that the company will give a disappointing first - quarter forecast .
Abramsky cited an RBC survey of 4,300 people that showed the expressed intentions of consumers to buy a Mac are down .
The RBC survey said that 29 % of respondents intend to buy a Mac over the next 90 days , down from 34 % in August .
Abramsky also said that a separate survey showed 41 % of respondents are planning to spend less on electronics over the next three months .
Such a slowdown could lead to a disappointing first quarter and be particularly damaging for Apple .
The last three months of the year , fueled by consumer spending on holiday gifts , historically constitute Apple 's best business period of the year .
Amelia Earhart stands in front of the Lockheed Electra she was trying to fly around the world in 1937 .
Courtesy NASA 1937 : At 8:43 a.m. local time , the Coast Guard cutter Itasca , steaming off Howland Island , receives this faint transmission from Amelia Earhart : " KHAQQ calling Itasca .
We must be on you but cannot see you – but gas is running low … . "
She vanishes along with her navigator , Fred Noonan , into the Central Pacific , and they 're never heard from again .
The disappearance of the celebrated flier remains perhaps the most tantalizing unsolved mystery in aviation history .
In the age of Charles Lindbergh and other daredevil fliers , Amelia Earhart became a household name in 1928 , after becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic .
True , it was as a passenger with a male pilot and copilot , but she soloed across the Atlantic in 1932 .
Although fellow pilots rated her as no better than competent , Earhart parlayed her sex and her absolute devotion to flying into a celebrity that few of her contemporaries enjoyed .
And it 's not like she was n't legit : Earhart was the first pilot of either sex to successfully fly solo from Honolulu to the U.S. mainland , reaching Oakland , California , on Jan. 11 , 1935 .
She wrote voluminously about her experiences and worked hard to promote aviation , both to women and to the public at large .
By 1937 , though , the 39 - year - old Earhart was weary of both the celebrity and the flying .
Saying she had one last good flight in her , she was determined to make it a doozy :
She would fly her specially modified Lockheed L- 10E Electra completely around the world .
A first attempt , flying westward from Oakland in March , ended either with a blown tire or pilot error as she was taking off from Honolulu .
The plane was badly damaged and shipped back to Lockheed in Los Angeles for repairs .
For the second attempt , Earhart was joined by Noonan .
They altered the flight plan for an eastward journey to compensate for shifting weather patterns , and left Oakland on May 21 .
From Miami , their route took them south along the eastern seaboard of South America , then a hop across the Atlantic Narrows to Africa .
They skirted the southern coast of Asia , crossing the Indian subcontinent , Southeast Asia and Australia before arriving in Lae , New Guinea , June 29 .
They had flown roughly 22,000 miles at this stage and had another 7,000 to go , all of it over the Pacific Ocean .
As they left Lae on July 2 , the cutter Itasca was already on station off Howland Island , Earhart 's next destination , to help guide the plane in .
Ship - to - plane radio contact was established , but something – possibly problems with the radio directional finder aboard the Electra – undermined communications .
Whatever the reason , Noonan was unable to pick up the Itasca 's homing signals .
Itasca even raised steam for a possible visual sighting , but the aviators were unable to locate either the cutter or Howland Island .
Seventy - five minutes after receiving Earhart 's last transmission , which included the line , " We are on the line 157/337 , " the Itasca began searching for the plane .
Such was Earhart 's stature that President Franklin Roosevelt dispatched nine U.S. Navy ships and 66 aircraft to help in a search that proved fruitless .
Nevertheless , various stations around the Pacific reported receiving unidentified signals , leading to the hope that Earhart and Noonan had somehow managed to find land somewhere .
None of these reports amounted to anything .
Over the years the mystery only deepened , leading to some pretty fanciful theories concerning Earhart 's fate , including the possibility that she was captured by the Japanese during World War II and forced to broadcast propaganda to American GIs as Tokyo Rose .
Iva Toguri and all the others who broadcast as Rose should have been so lucky .
The likeliest explanation for what became of Earhart and Noonan is that they ran out of fuel , ditched at sea and drowned , but there are other theories out there still being pursued .
In any case , they were officially declared dead Jan. 5 , 1939 .
As for Earhart herself , she knew she was taking a big risk for high stakes :
" Please know I am quite aware of the hazards ....
I want to do it because I want to do it .
Women must try to do things as men have tried .
When they fail their failure must be but a challenge to others . "

OK , so his TV production of The Andromeda Strain did n't turn out that great – Ridley Scott 's moving on .
When the director finishes Nottingham in England , Scott ( pictured ) will probably be taking on Brave New World .
The man who brought us Alien and Blade Runner did n't come right out and say it , but when Eclipse Magazine asked why he has n't made any science fiction movies in recent years , Scott replied , " I am going to do one .
I waited for a book for 20 years and I have got the book .
I am not going to tell you what the book is but that film is going to probably be written within the next month .
That will definitely be what I do next after Nottingham , the Robin Hood film that I am doing now in England . "
Couple that with reports that Leonardo DiCaprio , who starred in Scott 's recently wrapped House of Lies , is pushing Universal to make Brave New World , and it seems likely that Aldous Huxley 's classic nightmare vision of the future will take shape on the big screen with Maestro Scott at the helm .
Huxley 's granddaughter Tessa told Times Online , " There is now nothing stopping this film . "

THOUGH I KNEW nothing about poker when I quit my suit - and - tie desk job , I quickly picked it up on my travels around the world .
Since then I ’ve played hundreds of hands of Texas Hold ‘ Em and met plenty of poker players , many of them fellow globetrotters .
I guess there ’s something about taking a calculated risk that links both travelers and poker players because there seems to be a lot of crossover .
Although illegal in the United States , it ’s quite possible to earn an income playing poker online almost everywhere else in the world as long as you have an Internet connection , knowledge of the game , and willingness to take a calculated risk .
Is it worth it ?
Here ’s a look at some of the pros and cons :
Good News :
You can play anywhere , from Bali to Siberia
Well , anywhere that you can get an Internet connection that is n’t in the United States .
In today ’s globalized , wi- fi world , that ’s not much of a problem .
Sites like Poker Stars , Paradise Poker and Party Poker are easy to use and offer free software that you can download and use to play against hundreds of thousands of poker players all over the world .
Some companies even let you play via cell phone .
Good News :
Anyone can learn to be a pro
While poker involves big elements of luck , so does just about anything .
In the long run , skill will trump luck in poker .
Unlike most gambling games , in poker , the axiom “ the house always wins ” does not apply because cash flows from player to player rather than in the direction of the house .
Most casinos make very little money from poker tables ; instead , the most poker skilled players are the ones who rake in the dough .
This means that poker is actually something you can learn to do well , and there are plenty of books and websites devoted to teaching you just how to do that .
Bad News :
You ca n’t pick it up in a day
The reverse side of this is that if you want to make money , you have to actually know what you are doing .
That means putting the legwork in – playing lots of free or cheap poker to practice , reading poker guides and refining your strategy .
Trying to jump to the big leagues too quickly is the fastest way to lose money .
Good News :
You just have to win 51 % of the time
Once you are able to constantly break even or turn a small profit at the virtual table , you can turn poker into a reliable source of income .
You ca n’t expect to do it by winning a few big hands a day , though .
Big hands do n’t always come .
It ’s a much better to aim for long - term profits by playing as many games as you can , with an expectation that you wo n’t win every single hand , but you ’ll come out ahead more than half of the time .
Fortunately , most poker sites let you play multiple tables at once , giving you lots of chances to maximize your profits .
Bad News :
You have to put in the hours , just like a real job
In order to milk the most out of that 51 % , you ’ll be spending hours in front of the computer playing half a dozen poker tables at once .
If you really love the game , that ’s probably fine .
If you do n’t , it can seem like a lot of number crunching , not that different from processing spreadsheets or balancing budgets .
You might as well go back to the cubicle .
Good News :
It does n’t take a degree
Sure , not everyone will want to put in the legwork or be comfortable taking on some of the risks it takes to become a good poker player , but those willing to spend the time and do the work can turn poker into a reliable source of income .
You do n’t need a killer resume , letters of reference or a college degree .
You can set your own hours and work from a couch .
And you never have to wear a tie .
Bad News :
All you get is money — yes , that ’s bad news !
So you do n’t need a resume to play poker , but you ca n’t exactly put it on a resume either .
Most “ real ” jobs offer some degree of professional development , career opportunities or social networking .
Some of these things do exist in the world of online poker , mostly through satellite tournaments , where players compete for a trip to play in a high - stakes game at an actual bricks - and - mortar casino , usually somewhere exotic .
The chances of winning are n’t high , though .
Besides money , all you can get out of playing poker is the ability to play better poker .
Considering all the other opportunities available for travelers around the world , that ’s not necessarily a great investment unless you never plan on doing anything else with your life .
But no one said you had to make it a career .
In the end , many globe trekkers may find it more rewarding to work their way across a country , earn their way doing volunteer work or even simply saving up for a year before taking a big trip .
On the other hand , there ’s nothing quite like the thrill of turning over pocket aces .
This week marked the arrival of Cuil on the search engine scene .
Being a huge fan of search technology and how search engines work in general , I 've been spending some time playing around with the new service and thought it would be valuable to expose my data on how the classic market leaders - Google , Yahoo ! , Live & Ask compare to the newcomer .
When judging the value and performance of a major web search engine , there 's a number of items I consider critical to the judging process .
In order , these are -- relevancy , coverage , freshness , diversity and user experience .
First , let 's take a quick look at the overall performance of the 5 engines , then dive deeper into the methodology used and the specific criteria .
Interesting Notes from the Data :
I 'm not that surprised to see Yahoo !
come out slightly ahead .
Although their performance on long tail queries is n't spectacular , when you weight all of the items equally , Yahoo ! 's right up there with Google .
There 's a reason why people have n't entirely switched over to Google , despite the far stronger " brand " they 've created in search .
Google is good across the board - again , not surprising .
They 're the most consistent of the engines and perform admirably in nearly every test .
To my mind , despite Yahoo !
eeking out a win in the numbers here , Google is still the gold standard in search .
Ask has some clear advantages when it comes to diversity and user experience , thanks to their 3D interface , which IMO does provide some truly excellent results , particularly in the head of the demand curve .
When it comes to index size , Yahoo !
appears to have the win , but I think my test is actually a bit misleading .
Although Yahoo !
clearly keeps more pages on many of those domains indexed , I suspect that Google is actually both faster and broader , they simply choose to keep less in their main index ( and that may actually help their relevancy results ) .
Google 's also excellent at canonicalization , an area where Yahoo ! and the others all struggle in comparison .
The biggest surprise to me ?
Microsoft 's Live Search .
I 'm stunned that the quality and relevancy of Live Search is so comparatively high .
I have n't done a study of this scale since 2006 or so , but the few dozen searches I run on Live each month have always produced far worse results than what I got this time around .
Clearly , they 're making an impact and getting better .
Their biggest problem is still spam and manipulative links ( which their link analysis algorithms do n't seem to catch ) .
If they fix that , I think they 're on their way to top - notch relevancy .
Cuil does n't permit a wide variety of very standard " power " search options like site : , inurl : , intitle : , negative keywords , etc. making it fairly impossible to measure them at all on index size ( though the lack of any results at all returned for terms & phrases where the other engines had hundreds or thousands speaks volumes ) .
It also put their technical and advanced search scores in the doldrums - none of the " technorati " are likely to start using this engine , and that 's an essential component of building buzz on the web Cuil 's missed out on .
Cuil was foolish to launch now .
Given the buzz they had and the potential to take market share ( even a fraction of a percent is worth millions ) , they should have had lots of people like me running lots of tests like this , showing them how clearly far behind they were from the major engines .
You only get one chance to make a first impression , and theirs was spoiled .
I wo n't predict their demise yet , but I will predict that it will be a long time before Michael Arrington or anyone in the tech or mainstream media believes their claims again without extremely compelling evidence .
Their index , from what I can see , is smaller than any of the major engines and their relevancy is consistently dismal .
I feel really bad for them , personally , as I had incredibly high hopes that someone could challenge Google and make search a more interesting marketplace .
Oh well ...
Maybe next time ( assuming VCs are willing to keep throwing 30 + million at the problem ) .
Methodology : For each of the inputs , I 've run a number of searches , spread across different types of query strings .
This is an area where understanding how search engine query demand works is vital to judging an engine 's performance .
Some engines are excellent at returning great results for the most popular queries their users run , but provide very little value in the " tail " of the demand curve .
To be a great engine , you must be able to answer both .
In most instances , I 've used search terms and phrases that mark different points along the query - demand scale , from the very popular search queries ( like " Barack Obama " and " Photography " ) to long - tail query strings like ( " pacific islands polytheistic cultures " and " chemical compounds formed with baking soda " ) and everything in between .
You can see a full list of the queries I 've used below each section .
During the testing , I used the following scale to rate the engines ' quality :
Now let 's dive into the lengthy data collection process ...
Relevancy
--------------------
Relevancy is defined by the core quality of the results - the more on - topic and valuable they are in fulfilling the searcher 's goals and expectations , the higher the relevancy .
Measuring quality is always subjective but , in my experience , even a small number of queries provides insight into the relative value of the engine 's results .
To collect relevancy , I simply judged the degree to which the top results resolved my inquiry , and weighted those that provided the best answers in the first few positions higher than those that had better results further down .
The following are the queries I used to judge each of the engines on performance :
Top Buzz : gas prices , iphone , facebook , dark knight , barack obama
Popular : laptops , photography , rental cars , scholarship , house plans
Mid-Range : fire prevention , calendar software , snow tires , economic stimulus payment , nintendo wii games
Long Tail : pacific islands polytheistic cultures , chemical compounds formed with baking soda , genuine buddy 50 scooter reviews , google toolbar pagerank formula , getting a novel published
Technical : metalworking inurl: blog , cricket - site :.co.uk - site:.com.au , dark crystal site : imdb.com , top * ways , definition sycophant
Coverage
--------------------
Coverage points towards a search engine 's index size and crawl speed - the bigger the index and faster the engine crawls , the more pages it can return that have relevance to each query .
To judge this metric , I focused on the coverage of individual sites ( both large and small ) as well as queries in the tail of the demand curve .
Queries used for evaluation :
Large Sites : site:government.hp.com , site:research.ibm.com /leem , welsh rugby site : bbc.co.uk , search engine optimization site : w3.org , tango tapas seattle site:nytimes.com
Mid-Size Sites : site:seomoz.org/blog , site:news.ycombinator.com , site:education.com / magazine , bumbershoot site : thestranger.com , snowboards site:evogear.com
Small Sites : site:downtownartwalk.com , site : amphl.org / , site: totebo.com , dockboard site:loadingdocksupply.com , site:microsites.audi.com/audia5 /
Freshness
--------------------
Although coverage can help to indicate crawl speed and depth , freshness in results shows a keen effort by the engine to place relevant , valuable news items and other trending topics atop the results .
I used a number of queries related to recent events both popular and long tail ( including new pages from relatively small domains ) to test the quality of freshness offered by the engine 's index .
Queries used for evaluation :
Top Buzz : los angeles earthquake , obama germany , gas prices , ted stevens , beijing olympics
Popular Queries : new york city weather , dow jones average , seattle mariners schedule , cuil launch , nasa news
Mid-Range Queries : warp speed engine , unesco world heritage , movie times 98115 , comic con 2008 , most charitable us cities
Long Tail Queries : melinda van wingen , over the hedge comic 7 /28 , seomoz give it up blog , scrabulous facebook , internet startups that failed miserably
Diversity
--------------------
When search queries become ambiguous , lesser engines often struggle to provide high quality results , while those on the cutting edge can serve up much higher value by providing diversity in their results or even active suggestions about the query intent .
Queries used for evaluation ( I 've only used 3 queries per level here , as more ambiguous query strings are very challenging to identify ) :
Highly Ambiguous : mouse , ruby , drivers
Moderate Ambiguity : comics , shipping , earth
Relative Clarity : ibm , harry potter , graphic design
Obvious Intent : seattle children 's hospital map , color wheel diagram , great gatsby amazon
User Experience
--------------------
The design , interface , features , speed and inclusion of vertical results all play into the user experience .
An engine that offers a unique display may rank well or poorly here , depending on the quality of the results delivered and whether the additional data provides real value .
Rather than separate queries , I 've judged each of the engines based on their offerings in this field ( using both the data from the previous sets and my own past knowledge & experience ) .
User experience was based on each of the following :
Query Speed - the average time from hitting the search button to having a fully - loaded results page
Results Layout - including the organization of results , ads , query options , search bar , navigation , etc .
Vertical Inclusion - the inclusion of valuable vertical or " instant answer " style results where useful
Query Assistance - the use of disambiguation , expansion , and similar / related queries
Advanced Features - the ability to conduct site specific searches , search for terms only in specific URLs or titles , and narrow by website type , a given folder on a domain , etc .
For those who'd like to provide their own input about how to judge a search engine , Slate.com is running a reader contest to ask How do we know if a new search engine is any good ? - I 'd strongly encourage participation , as I know the audience here can contribute some excellent insight :-)
If you 're interested , here 's a screenshot of the Google Docs spreadsheet I created to conduct this research ( and I 've published the doc online here ) :
This kind of thing is a lot of work , and although this is n't scientifically or statistically significant , and clearly biased ( as I 'm the only one who did the judging ) , I think the results are actually fairly useful and accurate , though it would be fascinating to run public studies like this on a defensible sample size .

Top 10 : Things Only Real Men Can Do
Embrace These 10 Habits And Become The Best Possible You
It ’s long been believed that 18 is the age when a boy turns into a man .
A high school diploma , a driver ’s license and moving out to go live in a college dorm all instill a new sense of freedom in young men .
Unfortunately , an 18 - year - old still knows very little about the real world .
Some feel that 21 is the real “ coming of age ” for boys , since the law recognizes them as adults of drinking and gambling age .
This is also a misconception , since those two vices tend to regress the boys who ca n’t handle the fact that they ’re suddenly able to do everything without parental consent .
So when does a young boy become a man ?
Becoming a man has nothing to do with surviving puberty or reaching a certain milestone in age .
A boy becomes a man through his actions — when he begins to take responsibility for his own behavior and carry himself in a certain way .
An adolescent evolves into an adult when he can handle the bulk of these 10 tasks that prove any boy is a man in the eyes of the world .
Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , was today accused of being worse than " the Keystone Cops " at keeping data safe following the loss a memory stick containing the sensitive personal data of thousands of persistent offenders .
The Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , made the accusation after it was revealed that the stick containing three sets of information from the J Track system - the cross - government electronic system for monitoring offenders - had been lost by an external contractor .
The Tories and the Lib Dems both urged the government to reconsider its plan for the introduction of an ID card database following the incident .
PA Consulting , the contractor that lost the data , has also worked on the ID card project .
The missing data included the names , addresses and dates of birth of around 33,000 offenders in England and Wales , with six or more recordable convictions in the past 12 months on the Police National Computer .
Also lost were the names and dates of birth , but not addresses , of 10,000 prolific and other priority offenders , and the names , dates of birth and , in some cases , the expected prison release dates of all 84,000 prisoners held in England and Wales .
Data from the Drug Interventions Programme was also on the stick , but only offenders ' initials were included , not their full names .
Clegg said today : " I 'm just gobsmacked , like everyone else is , that the government can be so systematically incompetent in failing to keep our data safe .
" Frankly the Keystone Cops would do a better job running the Home Office and keeping our data safe than this government , and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe , why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an ID card database ? "
Dominic Grieve , the shadow home secretary , said : " The public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their £ 20bn ID card project to the firm involved in this fiasco , at a cost of millions of pounds to the UK taxpayer .
" This will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger - rather than strengthen - our security . "
Smith was informed of the loss on Tuesday .
Today she described the loss today as " completely unsatisfactory " , saying the information should not have been downloaded on to a memory stick .
" This was data that was being held in a secure form , but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor , " she told the BBC .
" It runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor . "
Scotland Yard said last night it had not launched a formal investigation , but was helping the contractor , PA Consulting , to " review the circumstances of the loss of data " .
The J Track system was developed for the Home Office by PA Consulting and installed in 2004 .
The government said the transfer of data to the contractor had now been suspended .
A Home Office source said the contractor 's premises had been searched and officials were viewing CCTV footage .
The prisoner information is highly sensitive because if it falls into the wrong hands it could leave some criminals with spent convictions open to retribution at the hands of victims , raising the possibility of the government being sued .
David Smith , the deputy information commissioner , said that " searching questions " would have to be answered about how the information was protected .
" It is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high - profile breaches of the Data Protection Act , more personal information has been reported lost .
The data loss ... reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels . "
The incident is the latest in a series of disturbing security breaches , after the high - profile loss last November of two CDs containing child - benefit details - the personal details of almost half the UK population .
In the nine months since , top secret files on al - Qaida and Iraq 's security forces were found on a commuter train and handed in to the BBC by a member of the public , followed a few days later by a second batch of files on terrorism being found on a train .
Keith Vaz , the chair of the home affairs select committee , said today that it was " deeply disappointing that a loss of this kind had happened yet again " .
Vaz said that Home Office ministers had previously given " absolute assurances " that data - protection blunders would not happen again and that lessons had been learned .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " What is also worrying is that a separate organisation was involved in looking at this data .
" One would expect the Home Office to have this data but if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you , then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away , the company concerned ... have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that I hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit [ discs ] . "
Vaz said the implications of the loss of prisoner data were " very , very serious indeed " .
He added : " I 've written to Jacqui Smith today to say I am deeply disappointed with what 's happened in the view of what ministers have said to the select committee . "
Welsh Conservative MP
David Davies , a member of the home affairs select committee , said that the loss of the data was " disastrous " .
He told Today : " One of the problems is that it is very hard to get rid of people who are not doing their jobs properly .
" Once you get into the government civil service , you 're virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are . "
Davies said that nothing had changed since John Reid , the then - home secretary , declared the Home Office " not fit for purpose " more than two years ago .
Davies added : " I think Jacqui Smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in October . "

A genetic mutation found mostly in people of African descent appears to increase their HIV infection risks by 40 percent .
But how far does this go towards explaining the African AIDS epidemic ?
Not far at all – though some journalists spun it otherwise .
The findings were published yesterday in Cell Host and Microbe , and my Wired Science post is here .
In addition to epidemiology – a long - term analysis of 1,200 HIV - positive U.S. Air Force members – there 's a convincing cell - level hypothesis : the mutation prevents red blood cells from blocking HIV 's hunt for white blood cells .
I felt perfectly comfortable writing about that .
But the researchers also surmised that , as around 90 percent of Africans have the mutation , it accounts for 11 % of sub-Saharan Africa 's AIDS burden .
This angle made me uneasy – partly because it's a very preliminary study on which to base such a broad extrapolation , but mostly because it'd be easy to overstate the mutation 's importance .
Seen in the wrong light , the numbers could present Africa 's AIDS tragedy as a biological inevitability .
Several press accounts do exactly that .
The New York Times credits the mutation for " explaining why the disease is more common there than expected . "
Reuters says it could " help explain why AIDS has hit Africa harder than all other parts of the world , " as this can't be fully rooted in " sexual behavior and other social factors . "
The Guardian says it " may go some way " to explaining the African prevalence of AIDS .
And the Gene Expression blog titles its coverage , " Evolution , a reason for the African HIV epidemic ? "
Not that the genetics of AIDS in Africa should be ignored .
But let 's put these findings in perspective : the World Health Organization estimates that 6.1 percent of adult sub-Saharan Africans are HIV - positive .
Shave that 6.1 percent by one - tenth – the cases apparently attributable to the mutation – and it's still ten times higher than the 0.5 percent HIV infection rate of North America and western Europe .
And when rates drop to 3 % in Angola but jump to 20 % or more in its neighbors , genes are the last place to start looking for clues .
To be fair , the study 's authors themselves were n't at fault .
Robin Weiss , a University College , London virologist , said the findings showed that " HIV rates in Africa are n't just the product of culture and behavior , " but was quick to emphasize the continuing importance of drugs and counseling .
If only everyone were so careful .

on the back of this box is a recipe for cheesecake that is supposed to fit the capacity of this baking tin .
i ended up having about 1/2 a cup extra cheesecake filling .
I zeroed in on the bakeware section first as usual , to see if there was anything new .
I saw some really neat baba molds .
The charlotte molds were so cute too .
What caught my eye though was a single box left of the mini cheesecake molds .
I thought these would be more versatile .

these nonstick mini cheesecake molds have a removable base .
they even provide a dowel for the purpose of assisting unmolding .
I was hoping to find some nice plates .
I 've been eyeing the French - made Pillivuyt line of dinnerware : the rimless white dishes made of porcelain .
I have n't yet been able to legitimize buying a set of these dishes , though I yearn for them each time I go into this store .
You see , I have a perfectly fine set of white IKEA dishes .
Yes , Ikea .
The thing is these Ikea dishes are so darned resilient .
I have n't broken or chipped any and I 'm beginning to wonder how I 'm ever going to break them all require a new dinnerware set .
In the end , after circling the aisles a couple of times , I settled on this ceramic ivory cake stand with ruffles .
It was so adorable .
I hardly ever make cakes this small .
But , now that I have this cake stand , I really do need to start !
I was very happy with the performance of the mini cheesecake pan and in the future , instead of a baked cheesecake , I may do a refrigerated one using gelatin instead so I can incorporate fresh fruit into the batter : like mango !
As well , I was thinking of making other pastries and desserts with this nifty pan .
I was thinking of making mini mousses using a biscuit joconde for the base , flavouring that with some syrup and then topping that with chocolate mousse .
I 'll have to see if that idea is feasible for these tiny molds .

McDonald 's ( MCD ) " Dollar Menu " may be biting the dust , but that does n't mean they do n't still serve the cheapest grub around .
So if Whole Foods ( WFMI ) is cratering , it 's no surprise MCD is doing just fine .
People have to eat somewhere .
Same - store sales in July for McDonald 's rose all around :
6.7 % in the US ( 45 % of sales )
7.6 % in Europe
7.2 % in the Asia / Pacific , Middle East and Africa division
double - digit growth in Latin America
8 % globally
MCD credited cash - strapped consumers cutting back , $ 1 coffees , and a successful Big Mac marketing campaign for the sales increases in the US .

There 's something rotten in Rotenberg
Opposition to electroshock therapy for autistic children
( Natural News )
It appears that the use of electroshock punishment tactics is n't limited to the U.S. military these days :
The state of Massachusetts has renewed a special education school 's authority to use electric shocks as a form of punishment , even after the school admitted to administering excessive and unfair shocks to two children after being told to do so by a prank caller .
Last year , a prank caller believed to be a former student called the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton , MA , in the middle of the night .
Posing as an administrator , the caller told school officials to administer electric shock treatments to two students , one 16 and one 19 , for infractions that had allegedly happened more than five hours before .
In response to the call , the two students were awakened ; one was shocked 22 times , and the other was shocked 77 times .
" I think it 's fair to say that [ giving someone ] 77 shocks is unusual , " school spokesperson Ernest Corrigan later admitted .
" It is excessive to what is normal protocol .
Giving 22 shocks is also excessive . "
So why did they give the shocks to children ?
And why did they do so after merely receiving a prank phone call ?
According to Nancy Alterio , the executive director of Massachusetts ' Disabled Persons Protection Committee , which received a phone tip about the incident , a third person was also shocked based on the same prank call .
In response to the incident , the school fired seven people , claiming , " This [ incident ] happened , we reported it and we 've taken steps necessary so that this does n't happen again , " Corrigan said .
Rotenberg has approximately 250 students , most of whom live in one of 38 nearby group homes .
All the students have mental disabilities that make it difficult for them to function in normal society , and many are low - functioning autistic children .
About two - thirds of Rotenberg 's students are minors .
It is my belief , by the way , that nearly all of these children were put into this mental state through either vaccinations , exposure to toxic chemicals or severe nutritional deficiencies during their mother 's pregnancy .
In other words , virtually all the children in the facility could have avoided mental retardation if our nation had a healthy food supply and realistic nutritional support for expectant mothers .
While much of the behavior modification treatment at the school is based on rewards , Rotenberg remains the only school in the United States to still use electric shock as a form of therapy .
The state of Massachusetts has twice tried to have the school closed due to the practice , but has failed both times .
According to Rotenberg 's
Web site , shock therapy is only used " after obtaining prior parental , medical , psychiatric , human rights , peer review and individual approval from a Massachusetts Probate Court . "
( They forgot to mention it also includes a " prank phone call . " )
Corrigan dismissed the shock as similar in pain to a bee sting , and the school maintains that the shocks have " no significant negative side effects . "
You will note , however , that they did not subject their own employees to such electroshock treatment before firing them .
That would be cruel , of course .
Sixty percent of the school 's students have court - authorized treatment plans that include electric shocks as punishment .
And autism experts and patient 's rights advocates dispute the claim that the shocks are harmless , pointing to the inevitable psychological harm done by such a practice .
According to Barry Pizant of the Brown University Center for the Study of Human Development , shock punishment " interferes with [ autistic students ' ] ability [ to ] trust people who are with them , and these are people who already have trouble understanding people .
"
Yet the Massachusetts Office of Health and Human Services recently extended Rotenberg 's authorization to use electric shock by one year .
To continue using electric shock therapy , the school must prove that it only uses shocks to punish the most dangerous and self - destructive behaviors , and must also prove that the shocks reduce the occurrence of those behaviors .
Shocks must not be used for " seemingly minor infractions " such as swearing or getting out of seats without permission , and the school must show that it is committed to phasing out the treatments , particularly for students who are about to leave the school .
Further , the state criticized the school for failing to customize treatments to individual students , and for failing to address the root causes of disruptive behavior .
Rotenberg has reportedly also agreed to eliminate the practice of delayed punishment or shocking sleeping students , as occurred in the August incident .
Mental health advocates expressed disgust that the practice of shocking children will continue .
" I see [ shock therapy ] as the last vestige of [ an ] old practice that was proven ineffective and we should have stopped doing it all together 20 or 30 years ago , " Pizant said .
" If you look in the mainstream of people working with kids with disabilities these aversives are totally out of the mainstream . "
" I think it 's barbaric and there are really no words , " said Rita Shreffler , executive director of the National Autism Association , " It 's inexplicable .
There 's no reason to [ shock ] another human being . "
Shreffler urged parents with special needs children to carefully investigate the people or institutions that they entrust their children to .
Many schools , of course , continues to assault children with both chemicals ( pharmaceuticals ) and electric shocks , all under the guise of helping these children in some way .
But the truth is that that mentally disabled children need love , nutrition and good parenting , not chemicals and electric shocks .
But I suppose it's not so surprising to learn that a nation now engaged in the routine torture of war prisoners -- in direct violation of the very U.N. treaties our veterans fought so hard to defend -- would also invoke electric shocks on mentally retarded children , too .
There is no longer any respect for the value of a human being by our nation 's leaders , and it appears some institutions disappointingly agree with that assessment .
If I had my way about all this , I would march into the Rotenberg school with a law enforcement team , arrest these school employees , and charge them with first degree assault of a minor .
Let them spend a few years behind bars to think about what they 've done .
