The human race may be caught in a biological catch - 22 , in which sustainable reproduction rates can only be achieved by consuming more energy .
So hypothesizes Melanie Moses , a University of New Mexico computer scientist who wonders if human societies are bound by size - dependent rules of network efficiency seen elsewhere in the biological world .
If the implications of this seem bleak , take heart : people are born to break the rules .
Moses invokes the Metabolic Theory of Energy , which explains the relationship between mammalian size , lifespans and reproduction rates — the bigger a body , the longer it lives , with fewer offspring — as a function of cardiovascular networks .
As the sum length of capillaries and arteries increases , nutrient flow efficiency drops .
The less efficient an animal 's networks , the more difficult it becomes to acquire the energy needed for raising a child .
Compare the size - lifespan - reproduction curve to the relationship between human economic growth and reproduction rates , and the parallels are eerie .
" Across contemporary nations , the decline in human birth rates with increased energy consumption is quantitatively identical to the decline in fertility rate with increased metabolism in other mammals , " writes Moses in an essay published Wednesday in Nature .
" Put another way , North Americans consume energy at a rate sufficient to sustain a 30,000 - kilogram primate , and have offspring at the very slow rate predicted for a beast of this size . "
Perhaps humans obey our own , society - level version of the Metabolic Theory .
As social and infrastructure networks grow , they too become less efficient .
It gets harder for the average parent to scrape together the energy — the time , the money , the resources — necessary to raise a child .
The implication is that birth rates , consistently shown to drop in wealthy nations , actually fall because life in a wealthy society is so energy - intensive .
As a result , writes Moses , energy production needs to be as green and efficient as possible : if keeping the human population at planet - friendly levels requires vast amounts of energy , it might as well be clean .
The connection , however , is not absolute .
There are counter - examples : when birth rates fell in post -Soviet Union Russia , so did energy consumption .
Gro Andam , an Arizona State University systems biologist , called Moses ' analysis simplistic .
An alternative explanation , she said , is our " capacity to take great , personal pleasure in investing in ourselves . "
The richer people get , the more likely they are to indulge themselves rather than another kid .
Moses acknowledged that the link between social and biological energy patterns is still hypothetical .
" It 's at the level of a correlation , " she said .
" That does n't mean causation , but it 's merit for further study . "
But unlike animals , said Moses , humans are socially self - aware .
With awareness comes the power to change .
" It 's obviously a relationship we do n't want to maintain .
In order to break that relationship , we need to understand its causes , " she said .
" Just because this has existed in the past , does n't mean it needs to exist in the future . "

Unemployed workers in China at a train station , waiting to return to their rural areas .

February 23 , 2009 -- Recent International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) reports on global and regional employment trends paint a stark picture of rapidly increasing unemployment in 2008 ; the situation is expected to worsen in 2009 with the prediction of massive job losses .
The message is clear : workers and the poor are already paying heavily for the capitalist economic crisis .
Especially hard hit are working - class and poor women and young people .
After four consecutive years of decreases , global unemployment rates increased from 2007 to 2008 , with the ranks of the unemployed jumping by some 10.7 million people , from 5.7 % in 2007 to 6.0 % in 2008 ( the highest year - on - year increase since 1998 ) .
Women were particularly hard hit , with unemployment increasing to 6.3 % for women compared to 5.8 % for men .
Young people were also hard hit with youth unemployment increasing by 0.4 % in 2008 .
The ILO assesses that very little progress has been made in youth employment levels and that young people have fewer work opportunities than other sections of the workforce .
The largest share of global jobs created was in Asia , while net employment creation in the industrialised economies and the European Union ( EU ) in 2008 was negative .
In the industrialised countries and the EU the total number of unemployed increased by 3.5 million in 2008 or around 33 % of the total increase worldwide , with more than half of these being women .
And unemployment will get worse in 2009 .
The ILO presents several scenarios based on projected estimates of GDP growth rates and concludes that a more ``realistic ’’ scenario for 2009 will see unemployment increase by 30 million people over 2007 figures ( an ``optimistic ’’ scenario based on International Monetary Fund estimates of GDP growth rates in November 2008 , which have now been revised downwards , puts the increase at 18 million unemployed ) .
A ``worst case ’’ option , which given recent trends in decline in growth rates and job losses , is probably the more likely scenario , sees global unemployment increase by 51 million people .
Under the ``realistic ’’ scenario , the number of unemployed people in Asia would increase by 7.2 million to a rate of 5.1 % .
Women are likely to be harder hit : even in the most optimistic scenario , the number of unemployed women would rise by 4.4 % , as compared with 3.8 % for men .
According to the ``pessimistic ’’ ILO scenario , the number of unemployed people in the Asian region could spiral up by 23.3 million .
A drastic increase of those in extreme poverty of a staggering 140 million is projected in 2009 .
Youth are also likely to be disproportionately affected by the crisis : already in 2008 , youth in Asia were more than three times as likely as adults to be unemployed .
In South - East Asia , the youth unemployment rate stood at 15 % in 2008 .
This figure is likely to rise sharply as young workers will be among the first to be sacked , while first - time jobseekers are likely to find themselves at a substantial disadvantage when competing against a rising pool of more experienced ( and recently unemployed ) jobseekers .
In China , for example , an estimated 6.1 million new college graduates will enter the labour market in 2009 , joining the 4 million from previous years who are still seeking employment .
During the last two months of 2008 there were more than 40,000 layoffs in Indonesia .
In the Philippines , some 250,000 workers in plant and machine operation and assembly were sacked .
In Vietnam 300,000 additional workers in the formal sector could lose their jobs in 2009 .
In China , tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs and some 20 million migrant workers who were laid off have returned to their homes in the rural areas , thus causing massive pressure on the rural economies .
An analysis of seven industry groups most affected by the crisis to date , based on labour force surveys of Thailand and the Philippines and the 2004 Living Standards Measurement Survey of Vietnam , shows that the impact of the job losses follows gender lines .
Women dominate garments , textiles and electronics , at the ratio of two to five female workers for every male worker and are thus experiencing some of the initial blows of job losses .
These job losses represent a massive attack on the living standards of the working class , especially women , many of whom gained some level of regular employment due to the partial industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s .
Any remaining gains made in the standard of living of the working population in this period are now being wiped out .
An indication of this massive attack on the living standard of working people in the region is the rise in what ’s politely described as ``vulnerable ’’ employment , i.e. irregular workers , without any job protection or social insurance , usually working out of their own homes , who also constitute the urban poor in the big Asian cities .
Currently , some 80 % of those in this category in South Asia are women .
Based on current growth estimates , the numbers of those in this category would increase by 21 million in Asia in 2009 .
If the economic crisis gets worse this category could increase by 61 million in 2009 .
These numbers essentially represent workers with regular jobs who are now being laid off and new entrants into the labour force , i.e. young workers .
Based on early 2009 trends , growth in the Asian region is now expected to fall to it ’s lowest level since the 1997 Asian financial crisis .
Current forecasts indicate that economic growth in the Asian region will drop to 2.3 % in 2009 , with 2.7 % growth projected in Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand and the Philippines , compared to a forecast of 4.2 % in November last year .
Recent weeks have seen a frantic flurry of downward revisions to growth forecasts across the region by central banks .
In
China
the government ’s target for growth in 2009 is 8 % , but the IMF expects growth to decline to 6.5 % .
In
India
current government estimates are 6.5 % to 7.5 % , but IMF projections are for a fall of growth to 5.1 % .
Indonesia
officials expect a further deceleration in 2009 to between 4.5 % and 5 % .
In
South Korea
some analysts project negative growth for 2009 .
In the
Philippines
growth is expected to fall as low as 2.2 % from 7.2 % in 2007 .

“ STARTING today , ” President Barack Obama declared in his inaugural address from the Capitol , “ we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America . ”
In fact his first , urgent task is to remake finance .
As Mr Obama spoke in Washington , DC , the markets in New York were sinking under the weight of failing banks despite the promise of a plan from his economic team .
A day earlier Britain had put forward its second attempt to get its banks to lend .
Others , such as Germany and Italy , may before long need to step in ; France , Ireland and Denmark already have .
The crisis has shown up flaws in financial markets and the global economy .
Huge flows of capital into debtor nations like America and Britain pumped up asset markets ( see article ) .
These fed the instabilities of financial markets — which , as our special report explains in this issue , were themselves plagued by poor regulation , dangerous incentives and the reckless use of mathematical models .
Fixing this will take a lot of work over the next 18 months or so , when legislation should be ready , but already a picture of a new finance is becoming clearer : smaller , better regulated , more conservative .
That vision is worth keeping an eye on , but the immediate priority is the imperilled banking system .
Just now , with finance in ruins , the nexus of markets and non-banks that make up the “ shadow banking system ” has failed .
Decent businesses are being starved of credit and driven into bankruptcy .
For their sake , and for the people who work for them , it is time to admit that the first round of bank rescues was not enough .
With talk of huge public subsidies — nationalisation even — the question is what to do next ?
A sinking feeling
Nothing at all is one answer .
Because last year 's efforts cost hundreds of billions of dollars , some may conclude that saving the banks is wasteful and pointless .
In fact the first rescue succeeded in one important respect .
The excessive lending of the boom has to be brought under control .
That inevitably brutal change can take place in two ways .
It could be relatively orderly as borrowers scale back and lenders strengthen their balance sheets .
Or it could cause a mass - panic that would wreck banks and businesses as it did in the 1930s .
Just such a panic was in the air in October .
Today 's recession is grave but in sparing the banks , however undeserving , governments spared their citizens from something worse — at least so far .
If a rescue makes sense , what sort ?
Last autumn the rescue of Britain 's banks — perhaps the sorriest in any large economy — became a template for others .
Britain is in the lead once more , but this time round its effort is likely to be remembered for all the wrong reasons .
The main part of the government 's new plans is to insure the banks against their worst losses on their worst assets .
Nobody ( not even the government ) knows how much that will cost ; just that Gordon Brown has once again thrown all his ideas at the problem , including the kitchen sink .
The prime minister should do his bit for the building trade and order a bigger sink .
The markets were unimpressed by the scale of his effort .
Shares in London fell , notably in the very banks the plan was designed to help .
Sterling tumbled on fears for Britain 's economy and the government 's finances .
Saviour of the universe
For any government setting out a rescue , this reception holds two lessons , concerning the scale and the shape of a rescue .
First , its scale must surprise everyone .
Because economies everywhere are suffering from excessive fear as well as over - borrowing , part of the aim is to convince investors that the downward spiral in confidence has been broken .
Britain 's plans were caught in a contradiction : seeking both to save the banks , which need a staggering sum , and also to mollify voters , who ( understandably ) resent handing over a single penny .
Scale is important in this crisis .
As the recession rips through the economy , banks are bound to face further losses .
Shareholders worry that these losses will continue to eat away at the banks ' reserves .
Back in October governments ' promises to save the banks stabilised markets .
But in this topsy - turvy crisis these promises are now pressing down on banks ' share prices .
If a bank looks about to suffer large losses , investors fear nationalisation is imminent — and head for the exit .
And that leads to the second broad lesson from Britain : the design of a rescue matters and history shows that it is hard to get right ( see article ) .
One possibility is government guarantees and insurance .
Another is to take the hit up front , by putting the toxic assets into a “ bad bank ” that acts as a cordon sanitaire .
And a third , which has been gaining traction of late , is outright nationalisation .
Each of the three has its strengths .
Guarantees can quickly swing into action and the assets remain with managers who know most about them .
Bad banks create a clean break that enables the good bank left behind to get on with the real job of raising capital and lending it out .
Even nationalisation has something to say for it .
Gone are the difficulties of valuing assets and of the bank 's shareholders plotting to grab taxpayers ' money — because the government is on both sides of the deal .
Expect to hear that argument a lot more over the coming months , not just in Europe but also in America .
As a capitalist newspaper , we reject a deliberate policy of wholesale nationalisation .
To be sure , state ownership may make some sense as a tactic for specific financial institutions .
We argued for it with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States and with Northern Rock in Britain long before politicians in either country succumbed to the inevitable .
Like it or not , it may be the least bad option in many cases ahead .
But the difficulties are legion .
Unless nationalisation takes place at market prices , it undermines property rights and raises the long - term cost of capital .
And even if expropriation is avoided , there are difficulties .
Although nationalised banks could increase the supply of credit by restoring confidence , their record at allocating it is even worse than private banks ' .
If the idea is state - directed lending , the banks will waste a fortune and kill enterprise .
If the plan is to offer the banks a brief shelter in a storm , it looks fanciful .
Large bank privatisations are unlikely for several years .
But what of the other two options — bad banks and insurance ?
Britain chose insurance alone and , at the moment , it looks as if it has made a mistake .
The suspicion is that the government preferred insurance for political reasons because it is a promise - now , pay - later scheme .
It would have done better to reach for that kitchen sink and do both — buy the worst assets at their market value and put them in a bad bank , as well as insure the healthy assets that remain against catastrophe .
With a clean start , the remaining good banks would be able to raise capital .
The idea would be to examine each bank on its merits , cleaning it out , partially insuring its remaining risks , and recapitalising it with government equity where necessary .
At some banks that might leave the government as the biggest shareholder , as the British government is at the Royal Bank of Scotland , or the sole owner , as at Northern Rock .
In such cases nationalisation is not an end in itself , but a consequence of the policy that most rapidly returns the banking system to health .
It is a heavy cost , but there is no alternative .
If taxpayers own a bank , pretending that they do n't only exacerbates the harm .
This crisis is so huge that seeing beyond it is hard .
Yet even now policymakers need to plan for the future of finance — partly to convince voters that today 's rescue is preparing for a better system ; partly because finance 's shortcomings and the taxpayers ' guarantees make an overhaul of regulation necessary ; and partly because sensible reforms are hard to devise .
Having seen finance wreak havoc , the temptation will be to bind it in a regulatory straitjacket .
Some tighter regulation is in order , especially if it is aimed at making the system more transparent .
But this crisis was born of economic excess as well as financial folly ; given the torrent of capital flowing into America , Britain , Spain and so on , almost any financial system would have gone wrong .
Financial re-regulation is not the only reform — it may not even be the most important .
Yet finance makes the rest of the economy work .
Mr Obama 's prize for remaking finance will be measured in prosperity and jobs .
The work should begin now .

The Barack Obama administration is continuing the neo-conservative agenda of US military domination of the world — albeit with perhaps a kinder - gentler face .
While overt torture is now forbidden for the CIA and Pentagon , and symbolic gestures like the closing of the Guantanamo prison are in evidence , a unilateral military dominance policy , expanding military budget , and wars of occupation and aggression will likely continue unabated .
The military expansionists from within the Reagan , George H. W. Bush , Clinton , G. W. Bush administrations put into place solid support for increased military spending .
Clinton ’s model of supporting the US military industrial complex held steady defense spending and increased foreign weapons sales from 16 % of global orders to over 63 % by the end of his administration .
The neo -conservatives , who dominated the most recent Bush administration , amplified this trend of increased military spending .
The neo-cons laid out their agenda for military global dominance in the 2000 Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) report Rebuilding America ’s Defenses .
The report called for the protection of the American Homeland , the ability to wage simultaneous theater wars , to perform global constabulary roles , and to control space and cyberspace .
The report claimed that in order to maintain a Pax Americana , potential rivals — such as China , Iran , Iraq , and North Korea — needed to be held in check .
This military global dominance agenda required forward deployment of US forces worldwide and increasing defense / war spending well into the 21st century .
The result was a doubling of the US military budget to over $ 700 billion in the last eight years .
The US now spends as much on war / defense as the rest of the world combined , making Americans the highest war - tax payers in the world .
Barack Obama ’s election brought a moment of hope for many .
However , the Obama administration is not calling for decreased military spending , or a reversal of US military global dominance .
Instead , Obama retained Robert Gates , thus making Obama the first president from an opposing party , in US history , to keep in place the outgoing administrations ’
Secretary of Defense / War .
Additionally , Obama is calling for an expanded war in Afghanistan and only minimal long - range reductions in Iraq .
The US military industrial complex is deeply embedded inside the Washington beltway .
According to the most recent reports from OpenSecrets.org , 151 members of Congress in 2006 had up to $ 195.5 million of their personal assets invested in defense companies .
Major defense contractors were seriously involved in the 2008 elections .
Lockheed Martin gave $ 2,612,219 in total political campaign donations , with 49 % to Democrats ( $ 1,285,493 ) and 51 % to Republicans ( $ 1,325,159 ) .
Boeing gave $ 2,225,947 in 2008 with 58 % going to Democrats , and General Dynamics provided $ 1,682,595 to both parties .
Northrop Grumman spent over $ 20 million in 2008 , hiring lobbyists to influence Congress , and Raytheon spent $ 6 million on lobbyists in the same period .
In a revolving door appointment , Obama nominated Raytheon ’s senior vice president for government operations and strategy , William Lynn , for the number two position in the Pentagon .
Lynn was formally the Defense Department ’s comptroller during the Clinton administration .
The International Monetary Fund ’s prediction for global economic growth in 2009 is 0.5 percent — the worst since World War II .
The United Nations ’ International Labor Organization estimates that some 50 million workers will lose their jobs worldwide this year .
There are an estimated 62,000 U.S. companies expected to close in 2009 , and while official unemployment is at 7 percent in the US , when you add people no longer looking for jobs and part - time workers , joblessness is closer to 14 percent .
The military - industrial - political elite are worried about the potential of increasing global insecurity .
The answer inside the Obama Administration is to continue high defense / war spending to insure military control of both domestic and foreign instabilities .
The military , industrial , congressional , and administrative elite profit from defense spending , both financially and ideologically .
Insider profit taking from pentagon spending is widespread in Washington .
But perhaps more important is the belief that this global military machine is seen as necessary for the protection of US corporate interests and the American upper classes in an increasingly destabilized world .
Given that belief , the Obama administration is unlikely to change the defense spending policies of the previous US administrations without significant disruptive pressure from anti-war activists and global empire resisters .
" Minnesota State Sen . Paul Koering , R - Fort Ripley , told KLKS on Friday that he will not vote for the Marriage and Family Protection Act , a bill that would make Minnesota ’s marriage laws gender - neutral , allowing same - sex couples many of the rights currently denied by Minnesota statute .
Koering , who is gay and a Republican , said he would vote against it because the state faces bigger problems .
“ I think some of the gay activists will be upset with me for this , but sometimes I think an agenda is pushed so far and so fast that people have no alternative but to push back , ” Koering told Raw Story at the time .
“ And I think that sometimes you have to move slowly . " ( Minnesota Independent News )
This is a pot of gold for the right wing !
Tell Mr. Koering we have enough enemies opposed to equality and that it's one thing not to bring up the legislation but quite another to vote against it once it comes up for a vote .

Adding Up the Government ’s Total Bailout Tab
Beyond the $ 700 billion bailout known as TARP , which has been used to prop up banks and car companies , the government has created an array of other programs to provide support to the struggling financial system .
Through April 30 , the government has made commitments of about $ 12.2 trillion and spent $ 2.5 trillion — but also has collected more than $ 10 billion in dividends and fees .
Here is an overview , organized by the role the government has assumed in each case .

My flatmate greeted me with an unusually severe expression .
It was 10 pm after another long day at work and I slumped in the armchair .
" You 'd better check the answermachine , " he said .
I walked over and pressed the red button .
A message from a relative in Manchester .
My 65 - year - old father was dead .
Several gulps of whisky later , I plucked up the courage to ring home .
A familiar voice said : " Are you all right ?
You do n't half sound queer . "
It was my father - still very much in this world .
What was going on ?
Sensing an almighty mess brewing , I quickly finished the call and replayed the message .
It was from a man calling himself " uncle " whose first name I did n't recognise .
He had left a number and when the blunt Mancunian tone answered " Ronnie Craddock " , the surname sent my mind spinning back to 1979 .
I was 19 and had found a summer job at Schreiber Furniture on the Trafford Park industrial estate as a welder 's mate .
The welder was a divorcee in his late 30s called Bob Craddock , a swarthy , no - nonsense type who instantly took a shine to me .
In my nervous late - adolescence , I was coming to terms with same - sex attraction .
So , it seems , was Bob .
I found his confident , decisive nature attractive and we began a tempestuous affair , much of which found expression in the darker recesses of the factory building .
One afternoon , after several weeks in the job , we had our first row .
I flung off the overalls .
" Stuff your job and stuff you - I 'm off , " I shouted , fleeing the factory gates .
I hopped on to a passing bus , but five minutes later , a woman sitting next to me prodded me in the ribs .
" There 's a man behind you in a car , " she said , " and I think he wants your attention . "
A metallic blue Ford Cortina had pulled up alongside us , blocking the oncoming traffic .
The bus passengers craned their necks as the car driver leant across and wound down the window .
Without the slightest self - consciousness out came the love that on this occasion dared speak its name : " I need you .
I bloody worship you .
Do n't let it end like this .
Please .
I 'll give you a pay raise .
Just get off the fuckin ' bus ! "
It did n't take long for the bus passengers to realise to whom this volley of passion was directed .
They began barracking and stamping their feet .
" Bum chums , " shouted one .
I jumped straight off the bus and into the Cortina .
A smiling Bob slipped the car into gear and we sped off .
" Well that worked , dinnit ? "
" You stupid bastard , " I responded .
" Everyone on that bus works at the factory .
What are we gonna do tomorrow ? "
His face tensed up .
" I 'll think of summat . "
And sure enough he did .
Heart pounding , the following morning I limped through the factory gates at 7.45 am .
A crowd of workers made up of the previous day 's passengers were waiting for me .
" We 're so sorry for yesterday , " said the unelected spokesman of the crowd .
" We knew he had a son , but we did n't know it was you .
All that ' I love you ' commotion .
We thought you were a couple of ... well , you know . "
They slapped me on the back as Bob looked on with a smug grin .
I asked him to explain what precisely was going on .
" My son was only two years old when the wife and I split up .
I 've never seen him since , nor do I really want to , if the truth be known .
His name was Mark . "
This lie came back to haunt me 10 years later when Bob died in a chip - pan fire in his small flat in Hulme , Manchester .
Still in the closet to his relatives , Bob had told them too that I was his long - lost son .
I went to visit his brother Ronnie , the man who had told me about Bob 's death .
After 10 minutes with him and his wife , Sheila , I could see they had no idea who I really was .
In the middle of the lounge were two cardboard boxes full of photos of Ronnie and me on a holiday in Vienna from 1981 , newspaper articles I had written and tapes of programmes I had made during my career as a journalist .
Our relationship had lasted , on and off , for two years , but Bob had been obsessively tracking my life for more than a decade .
" You took your mum 's maiden name , that 's right , is n't it ? " said Sheila , trustingly .
I took a long gulp and explained that I was merely a " good friend " who Bob had become very close to .
Long incredulous stares .
Where , then , was the real son , they asked .
I shrugged .
" Look , we do n't want him coming to the funeral , " said Ronnie .
" The photos are all of you and Bob .
All the aunties have them .
They all want to meet you . "
Then , after a long pause , " You see , I do n't want them thinking my brother is a liar .
Best if you come , eh ?
The funeral is Friday . "
I was being asked to go and bury my ex-lover , because his family believed that I was his grieving son .
News of Bob 's death circulated around his old workplace and dozens of macho welders saw the chance for a day off .
On the other side of Bob 's universe , several camp queens from Manchester 's gay scene wanted to give " Bacardi Bob " a glorious send - off .
Then , the night before the funeral , came the coup de grace .
I was staying with my parents and my father asked what had brought me to Manchester .
" It 's a bit sad really , " I muttered .
" Funeral . "
" Who 's dead ? " he asked .
" You wo n't remember him , " I said quickly .
" Just a guy I worked with before university . "
I recalled they had briefly shaken hands once after I got a lift home .
Then came the sentence which will be etched in my memory for ever .
" Well I 'm doing nothing tomorrow .
I 'll come with you .
For a bit of company . "
I do n't know how I did n't choke to death .
The more I tried to dissuade him , the more I was in danger of letting the truth out .
My father knew I was gay and was not particularly thrilled , but it's one thing to talk of generalised attraction and another to come clean about carrying on with a man old enough to be my father .
How I got through the next day without calamity is a near miracle .
I appointed my younger brother as a minder , to chaperone Dad and stop him from talking to the relatives .
In the chapel we were shown to our seats by " Uncle " Ronnie .
" Who 's he ?
And what 's he doing here ? " whispered Ronnie , looking towards my father .
When I explained , Ronnie grunted with understatement , " Could be a bit awkward . "
I looked at the crowded pews where drag queens were eyeing up men in overalls and making gestures .
I prayed .
Very hard .
Bob 's fragmented world sang farewell to him to the strains of Lord Of All Hopefulness , and my brother played a blinder , keeping Dad largely separate from the Craddock clan .
The only major danger came when I was standing next to my father and up came a couple of doting aunties .
" Oh , you do have your Dad 's eyes , " one of them said .
Dad smiled and stepped forward .
" Well , thank you very much , " he said .
The aunts looked puzzled , but before disaster unfolded , in stepped my brother and took him for yet another pint .
And so it went on for two hours at the funeral reception .
We ducked and weaved .
And
survived intact .
Several years later , I started to work this farce into a film script .
I 'd come out more to Dad , who had met several of my partners , so in a moment of risky madness I sent him off a copy .
A few days after I had posted it , I spoke to my mother on the phone .
" We 've read your story , " she said .
" But your Dad , he still does n't get it .
I do .
It 's pure Alan Bennett . "
My father died in 2005 .

Finding time to tinker with iShoot over the Christmas break , Nicholas decided to release a free " Lite ” version of his $ 2.99 app , hoping it would be rediscovered by iPhone faithful .
That brilliant decision turned out to be the magic bullet iShoot needed .
" I work a day job at Sun Microsystems , " Nicholas told the iPhone Savior in a short phone interview , " I developed iShoot in my spare time with no updates since it was first released . "
Ethan 's tank combat game originally went live in the App Store back on October 19 , 2008 .
The response from cult of iPhone fanatics was ' just ok ' according to Nicholas .
Soon after its launch , iShoot disappeared into obscurity only after a moderate number of downloads .
The overnight success of iShoot is one of those fantastical stories that causes instant buzz among iPhone developers and fanboys alike .
Developer Ethan Nicholas , is having the kind of success with iShoot that many app creators will hope is contagious .
" iShoot Lite " went live on January 3 , 2009 .
Less than ten days later on January 11 , the original iShoot rocketed out of obscurity as the number one Top Paid App in the iTunes App Store with 16,972 downloads in one day .
It virtually blasted the reigning number one iFart app off its perch overnight .
iShoot simultaneously grabbed the Top Free App number one spot as well .
For an app to reach number one and remain there , some 10,000 plus downloads per day are required .
That 's roughly $ 21,000 a day for this $ 2.99 app after Apple takes its 30 - percent stake .
Nicholas attributes iShoot ’s meteoric rise to the release of his ‘ Lite ’ version , giving millions a free chance to experience the thrill of launching tank artillery .
It ’s important to note that a $ 2.99 price point was no barrier to the ultimate success of iShoot .
[ over $ 600 K net ]
" I 'm still in shock , " Nicholas said , " I 've given my two week notice at Sun Microsystems .
I 'm gonna do this full time now . "
Nicholas admitted that 's he's not a seasoned Mac developer .
In fact , he had no experience with Objective - C programming prior to creating iShoot .
That ’s one revelation that makes his epic success story sound even more unreal .
" iShoot was the first app I developed using Objective - C , " Nicholas said , " It was created on an original MacBook that was in rough shape .
The Wi-Fi was dead and even the Ethernet port had to be jiggled for it to work right . "
I downloaded " iShoot Lite " myself to see what the number one artillery combat game was all about .
I had a tough time putting it down because I love to blow things up .
The concept is simple , man your own tank and then blast the other tanks into oblivion with a plethora of high - powered weapons that instantly rearrange the landscape .
The full version of iShoot includes 25 weapons to choose from .
i Shoot Lite only offers six weapons , but one of those is a Tactical Nuke which makes burying any opponent extremely gratifying .
I 'm hooked !
Ethan told me that he 's been getting dozens of emails from other developers asking him if they should produce a " Lite " version of their own apps .
" Hell yes ! , " Ethan replied , " I put zero marketing dollars into iShoot and had no blog coverage .
I just created a game I actually wanted to play . ”
Now that Ethan Nicholas is planning to collect his iShoot mailbox money while spending afternoons watching Judge Judy , it wo n't be long before we ’ll see his next creation blasting in from out of nowhere .
Can he repeat history and create another number one iPhone app with a bullet ?
I 'm certain he really could n’t care less at the moment .
He 's too busy enjoying his epic tank ride to becoming independently wealthy .
One tactical iShoot download at a time .

I 'll be totally honest : I fucking love Valentine 's Day .
I know .
I know .
You hate it .
Hate it .
Grrr .
You hate it because it 's a Hallmark holiday ; because it 's a shallow , commercialized moneymaker , and because you are extremely cool and tragically brilliant .
Look how cool you are .
You 're an artist .
You know what I find to be the most aggravating thing about Valentine 's Day ?
That every year , at least one person ( but always more ) will say , as soon as the holiday is brought up , " You know Valentine 's Day is just a made up , corporate holiday , right ?
That it 's just designed to make money ?
Did you know that ? "
They say it like it 's some big secret , and only they know the truth because they dared to break off from the herd and question everything .
But , honestly , is there anyone who is n't aware of how commercialized the holiday is ?
Does anyone think they 're honoring a saint or a god or anything when they 're buying chocolates ?
Like smokers knowing that cigarettes might be vaguely dangerous , I think it 's safe to say that , from now on , no one will ever have to enlighten anyone else about how basically meaningless Valentine 's Day is .
No one anywhere thinks they 're celebrating to honor any saints , or anything .

So , do you hate Valentine 's Day because you hate consumerism and Valentine 's Day shamelessly pulls in $ 14 billion a year ?
Fine .
Great , you can totally hate consumerism , that 's terrific .
Just be aware that , when someone is buying somebody else a weepy , overpriced , bastard Hallmark card or a heart - shaped Whitman 's Sampler , they 're not thinking , " Score one more for consumerism ! "
No , they 're thinking , " Hey , a card .
[ Insert Name ] will really love this , " or " Chocolates .
Squatters set up home in Duke of Westminster 's £ 30 million Park Lane mansions
A couple of blindingly obvious clues might have signalled that all was not well yesterday at two of the most prestigious addresses in Britain .
There were those shiny new locks , gleaming in the sunlight against the dusty black paintwork of adjacent front doors .
Then there was the chap playing a busker - style violin solo on the second - floor balcony of number 95 Park Lane , shielded from the intermittent rain by a scruffy leather coat and a tasselled woolly hat .
Luxury : Properties at 94 and 95 Park Lane occupied by squatters
Not forgetting the brown and white dog surveying magnificent views over most of Hyde Park , poking his wet nose out of a window at number 94 and looking for all the world as if he owned the place .
Which , in a sense , he did .
These were some of the squatters who struck it rich to occupy the two most expensive free houses in the land .
And quite how they got away with living here unnoticed for the last two months is a question that all property owners would do well to consider .
The band of 20 or 30 hippies , activists , freeloaders and stragglers took over the £ 30 million pair of empty mansions before Christmas .
The high life : 94 Park Lane and 95 , which is taller than surrounding buildings
Free house : A squatter and dog enter number 95
Since then there have been unfamiliar comings and goings at the six - storey buildings , accompanied by the strumming of guitars , an occasional flute - and the unmistakable sound of the fiddle .
The properties are owned by the billionaire Duke of Westminster , one of Britain 's richest men and its biggest landowner .
Once home to lords , politicians and notables , they are leased to property companies by his Grosvenor Estates and have previously been used as offices .
Neighbours include Madonna .
Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed used a flat down the road as a secret love nest .
V -ery nice place to live : A squatter inside Number 94 Park Lane today
Park life : 20 freeloaders - aged between 21 and 45 - took over the townhouses at numbers 94 and 95 Park Lane after they were left empty for a few weeks
One of the squatters told me yesterday it was discovered the adjoining houses had been empty for up to two years and they simply pushed the doors open to move in .
Note the wording .
If they were found responsible for causing any damage by breaking in , they could have been charged with a criminal offence .
Once in full - time occupation , word of mouth meant the kind of people who prefer to live rent - free in the capital 's most exclusive addresses soon came to join them .
They set up an ' art collective ' and began jamming long into the night .
Yesterday it was suggested that anyone with a heater was likely to be made welcome - not entirely true .
Duke of Westminster : Thought to own the properties in Park Lane
Equipped with an oil - filled electric radiator and a friendly smile , I asked one of the emerging minstrels if I could exchange it for shelter .
' Are you a journalist ? ' he asked .
' Yes , ' I replied , adding that the heater was new , two kilowatts , with a timer .
' Ca n't let you in .
It 's a democracy and there 's no way the others would agree . '
Talking to some of ' the others ' confirmed that the kilowatt output of the National Grid would not be enough to allow the Mail across the threshold .
But peeking through the letterboxes and windows , and chatting to less hostile ' residents ' , at least gives a taste of life inside .
Each house has 12 rooms and a floor space of 12,000 sqft .
It 's a mixture of squalor and fading elegance , with plastic sheeting for curtains and mattresses on the bare floorboards .
Graffiti adorns one wall and many of the fixtures that would normally grace the mostly Georgian architecture seem to have vanished .
Suddenly a young woman comes down the stairs carrying a loo roll .
Apparently the plumbing and waste facilities leave a little to be desired .
' It 's not nearly as good as my last squat , ' says the violinist , 24 .
He was evicted from his previous address and the squatters took him in .
' They 've been good to me .
But it 's not much inside .
There 's no central heating or showers . '
Yesterday the Grosvenor ( Mayfair ) Estate was making legal moves towards reclaiming the property - but it is likely to take some time .
There is no law against squatting .
However , few squatters take advantage of the bright lights .
One , in his 20s , called Zen , says evenings are spent ' being mellow ' , making art and music .
There 's no TV , and the only electrical devices are heaters .
In the background , a young man with tattoos peeks out of the door and slams it shut .
Someone gives a Vsign from a ground - floor window .
The dog takes another free sniff of Hyde Park air .
Where next , I ask one resident ?
' Somewhere disgustingly rich , ' he muses .
' Somewhere that will make a statement .
Somewhere with a bathroom .'
How Stimulus Package Would Help Homeowners
Goal of plan is to lower average homeowner 's mortgage to 31 percent of income .
Feb. 16 , 2009  --
After signing the $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill in Denver , President Obama is scheduled to head to Phoenix Wednesday to unveil his housing plan .
The president is expected to propose anywhere from $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion to help stem the tide of home foreclosures .
One component of the plan would lower the average homeowner 's mortgage payment , which can easily take up 38 percent of a family 's income .
The goal of the plan is to lower most homeowners ' mortgages to 31 percent of their income .
A family with a household income of $ 50,000 will , on average , put $ 19,000 toward their mortgage .
Under the president 's plan they 'd pay $ 15,500 toward their mortgage for a savings of $ 3,500 .
Lenders would also be required to write down a mortgage principal rather than interest rates , with the goal of helping to reduce the chances of default .
The plan would also allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages , but only mortgages closed before the law is enacted are eligible .
Homeowners would also need to inform their lender or loan servicer in advance of their intention to file for bankruptcy protection .
Critics say the plan will push up interest rates on all future mortgages , even for people with excellent credit , and could create more losses for banks .
Phoenix : Housing Crisis Case Study
After years of benefiting from the housing market boom , Phoenix , one of the national capitals of urban sprawl , suddenly finds itself threatened by slow sales , bad mortgages and a rash of foreclosures .
After signing the economic stimulus bill in Denver early this week , President Barack Obama is scheduled to head to the Arizona metropolis Wednesday to try to make the case for the legislation to the American people .
The Sunbelt region has been one of the hardest - hit in the real estate bust .
One in every 182 houses in Arizona received a foreclosure notice last month .
The president is expected to propose anywhere from $ 50 - $ 100 billion to help stem the tide of foreclosures .
Obama is expected to ask banks and borrowers to absorb some of the losses .
Resident Julian Kinsale said his home 's value has dropped more than 50 percent in just two years .
Kinsale said it 's critical that Obama take a long , hard look at the economic disaster sweeping his hometown .
" If there is a natural disaster the president goes .
We are facing a ground zero , and I think it is a good thing for the president to come and see with his own two eyes and see what they are experiencing in Phoenix , " he said .
Arizona and Around the Nation : From Boom to Bust
The economy skyrocketed , based almost solely on the real estate market , which drew tourists , retirees and businesses seeking inexpensive spaces .
" Builders began to believe that they could build almost anything and there would be someone there to buy it , " said Robert Mittelstaedt , dean of Arizona State University 's business school .
" I call it builders gone wild .
So now we have 50,000 to 60,000 empty homes in the Phoenix metropolitan area . "
Subdivisions built as the perfect family neighborhoods now have blocks of empty house and barren streets .
The tough market has made it difficult for homeowners like Leroy Ford to sell their homes .
Ford , who recently lost his job , is trying to offload his four - bedroom home for $ 80,000 .
" I would love to be bailed out , " said Ford , who bought his home two years ago for $ 220,000 .
And the 15,000 people who attended last week 's job fair in Phoenix offered painful proof of the city 's decreasing tax base , which has resulted in a $ 200 million deficit .
Experts predicted the city 's housing recovery will take time , but it 's a luxury Kinsale fears he does n't have .
" If it ends up going down , down , down , my family could end up living on the street , " he said .
Do n’t Work for Assholes
In this series , I ’m recounting work stories to learn from my mistakes .
I call them Things I Learned the Hard Way .
Twelve years ago , I had just set out on my own as a freelance designer .
I met a potential client in South Park .
We sat down at a picnic bench with some sandwiches and he started talking about the project .
Within minutes I just knew : the man was an asshole .
He talked with his mouth full .
He made comments about women at nearby tables .
When I tried to speak , he interrupted me .
When it came to my ( way below market value ) hourly rate , he haggled .
I did n’t like him , but what did I know ?
Maybe this is just how the freelance web design business worked .
I took the gig .
It was , of course , a nightmare .
He belittled my work , but offered no guidance .
He wanted more and more time , but would n’t pay for it .
When I finally stopped working because of his outstanding bill , he called me irate in the middle of the night .
I got a lawyer .
It took months but my lawyer finally got him to pay his bill .
I took his money and used it to have the lawyer to write me a bulletproof contract .
I ’ve used it ever since .
This was my first real freelance web design gig , and probably my worst , but I learned a lot of valuable lessons from it .
Always get some money up front .
Always get a signed contract before you start working .
Always get a clear picture of what the deliverables are .
Always charge what you ’re worth .
But the biggest lesson I learned ?
Do n’t work for assholes .
Nine times out of ten , the first impression someone gives you is exactly who they are .
We choose not to see it because we need the money , or we want the situation to be different .
But if someone rubs you the wrong way at the first meeting , chances are , it ’s only going to get worse .
Years later I met another potential client at a cafe .
We did the usual getting - to - know - you chat in line .
When it was our turn to order , she ordered something very complicated , and then sighed and rolled her eyes when the barista repeated it back to confirm .
When her coffee came back wrong , she lashed out at the barista in a way that made me and everyone else in earshot wince .
I ’d like to say I walked away from that interview right then and there .
I did n’t .
But I did decide at that moment to turn down the gig .
Baby steps .
It can be very intimidating to turn down work , especially in these uncertain economic times .
But the months I spent suffering that fool 12 years ago would have been better spent building my portfolio and hustling to find better clients .
All the time you spend working for an asshole is time you ’re not spending to find a gig that will , in the long run , pay you better , teach you more , and make you happier .
Nowadays , the only asshole I work for is me .

Have you worked for an asshole ?
Tell us all about it .

Via TPM , Theda Skocpol responds to Rep. Barney Frank 's comments made in this video :
The idea that " elites " will " get serious about repairing the safety net " if they are FIRST given billions of dollars of payoffs to shareholders who made bad decisions is the height of naivete .
There are no corporatist institutions in U.S. politics that can enforce this kind of bargain , that can corral all the interests and get them to carry through on mutual promises .
That is why Obama and the Democrats will get for the people in general exactly what they push through right now and will squander opportunities if they give money and leverage to " elites " first !
This is what Ira Magaziner imagined with health care back in 1992 -- that he could get up front understandings with powerful interests by giving them concessions in the Health Security proposals , and they would let it get through Congress later .
( I remember sitting in his office as I took notes for BOOMERANG and having him complain to me that he could not understand why the business roundtable types " lied " to him about what they would do ! )
Of course , they turned on him the moment Congress got ahold of things .
Same thing will happen here .
The banking / Wall Street interests will sucker Obama and Barney Frank into giving them yet more ( unpopular and ineffective and very expensive ) handouts -- and , then , when the improvements to health care , college funding , etc. come up later they will suddenly be fiscally responsible with the public 's money .
And , of course , they will have plenty of blue dogs and small business lobbies and others to hide behind as they make this maneuver .
Mark my words , this is my prediction ....
U.S. institutions frustrate bargains and can only be moved by big pushes of popular leverage at key moments of crisis .
With DRM being the talk of the town for some time now , publishers have become more vocal about piracy .
But publishers ' intent to limit the used game market has come to light in recent months as a by - product of all the DRM talk , and an increasing amount of big - name companies are going on the record with comments regarding the used game industry .
The latest publisher to speak out is Atari , as it has said that used game stores are " extremely painful " for the industry .
Two key Atari executives — CEO David Gardner and president Phil Harrison — spoke this week at an Atari event in London about the ways in which second - hand sales are hurting their games .
" Second hand game sales represent consumer choice and desire , " said Gardner .
" Obviously , it has economically been extremely painful for the industry ... the publishers do n't benefit . "
Harrison continued , reinforcing the stance .
" There 's no doubt that second hand games sales has a macro- economic impact on the industry and a lot of people get miserable about it , " he said .
Gardner went on to point out that games were getting more " network centric , " and post - release content was crucial to getting the most out of a game and helped to mitigate used game sales .
However , Harrison noted that the key was to create games that " do n't get resold , that do n't get traded and that 's perfectly in line with [ Atari 's ] future strategy so we 're not that concerned about it . "
Given the trend toward putting incentives in games to discourage used game sales , one wonders how quickly those " don'ts " become " can'ts " for the end consumer .

Swiss bank accounts .
Just the term brings with it a mysterious , dangerous air .
A place for shadowy assassins to pick up their pay .
International agents collecting on acts of extortion .
Dusty hordes of Nazi treasure .
However , Swiss giant UBS has admitted to something just as illegal , and a good deal more tawdry .
They have been using their operations in the US to lure wealthy Americans into plopping their millions into UBS accounts , where they can evade taxes .
The U.S. government has been probing UBS with help from sources such as a former UBS banker , Bradley Birkenfeld , who last year pleaded guilty to helping a California real estate mogul evade millions of dollars of taxes .
Birkenfeld told investigators that UBS personnel went to elaborate lengths to help U.S. clients stash money in secret Swiss accounts .
UBS is complaining that , shortly after the Bush administration came to town in 2001 , they signed a get out of jail free card with the IRS ; a contract that authorized UBS to hide their clients ' identities as long as UBS promised they would follow the rules .
Now UBS is holding to the principled position of no - takey - backseys .
" The IRS seeks to repudiate its own contract and demands the production of the very account information that the IRS agreed would remain confidential , " wrote UBS lawyers
Even though UBS admits that they might have dented the rules a little .
As many as 60 Swiss - based private bankers who were not licensed to operate in the U.S. traveled to the United States with encrypted laptop computers to maintain client secrecy and got training on how to avoid detection by U.S. authorities , according to the statement filed Feb. 18 .
What would cause UBS to feel that they could operate in such a way ?
And why would the IRS sign an agreement giving them the status to act as a proxy for the government ?
Surely it was n't because the the man who is now the vice chair for investments at UBS was then a Texas Senator , friend and adviser to Bush , and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Phil Gramm .
Let 's wind the tape back a bit .
In 1999 , Gramm pushed through the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which passed on the last day before the Christmas break as an attachment with no debate in either the House or Senate .
That bill destroyed most of the protections that had been put in place after the bank failure of the 1930s .
This act repealed part of the Glass - Steagall Act .
This may sound like a bunch of Congressperson soup , but the gist of it is that Glass - Steagall was put in place in 1933 to control the rampant speculation that had helped cause the collapse of banking at the outset of the Depression , and to prevent such consolidation of the banks that the nation had all its eggs in one fiscal basket .
Gramm - Leach - Bliley reversed those rules , allowing not only more bank mergers , but for banks to become directly involved in the stock market , bonds , and insurance .
The very next year , Gramm was back again with the Commodity Futures Modernization Act .
This bill was passed as an attachment to a " must pass " spending bill on the very last day of the 106th Congress .
That bill earned Gramm the position as one of the key players in deregulating derivatives .
Just days after renewing his public criticism of Warren Buffett 's current investment strategy and situation , the well - known short seller Doug Kass is out with a very bearish outlook for Berkshire Hathaway shares .
And this time he's not just making a short - term prediction as he did last year when he bet against Berkshire 's stock for several months and then covered that bet at a profit .
Today on TheStreet.com , Kass asks , " Is This the End of Warren Buffett ? "
His post includes words like " tentative " and " seems , " so it is not a definitive obituary .
But Kass does answer his headline 's question with a strong ' yes . '
Callifornia State Controller John Chiang announced on January 26 that California 's bills exceed its tax revenues and credit line and that the state is going to print its own money known as IOUs .
The template is already designed .
Instead of receiving their state tax refunds in dollars , California residents will receive IOUs .
Student aid and payments to disabled and needy will also come in the form of IOUs .
California is negotiating with banks to get them to accept the IOUs as deposits .
California is often identified as the world 's eighth largest economy , and it is broke .
A person might think that California 's plight would introduce some realism into Washington , DC , but it has not .
President Obama is taking steps to intensify the war in Afghanistan and , perhaps , to expand it to Pakistan .
Obama has retained the Republican warmongers in the Pentagon , and the US continues to illegally bomb Pakistan and to murder its civilians .
At the World Economic Forum at Davos this week , Pakistan 's prime minister , Y. R. Gilani , said that the American attacks on Pakistan are counterproductive and done without Pakistan 's permission .
In an interview with CNN , Gilani said : " I want to put on record that we do not have any agreement between the government of the United States and the government of Pakistan . "
How long before Washington will be printing money ?
On January 28 Obama announced his $ 825 billion bailout plan .
This comes on top of President Bush 's $ 700 billion bailout of just a few months ago .
Obama says his plan will be more transparent than Bush 's and will do more good for the economy .
As large as the bailouts are - - a total of $ 1.5 trillion in four months -- the amount is small in relation to the reported size of troubled assets that are in the tens of trillions of dollars .
How do we know that by June there wo n't be another bailout , say $ 950 billion ?
Where will the money come from ?
Obama 's bailout plan , added to the FY 2009 budget deficit he has inherited from Bush , opens a gaping expenditure hole of about $ 3 trillion .
Who is going to purchase $ 3 trillion of US Treasury bonds ?
Not the US consumer .
The consumer is out of work and out of money .
Private sector credit market debt is 174 % of GDP .
The personal savings rate is 2 percent .
Ten percent of households are in foreclosure or arrears .
Household debt - service ratio is at an all - time high .
Household net worth has declined at a record rate .
Housing inventories are at record highs .
Not America 's foreign creditors .
At best , the Chinese , Japanese , and Saudis can recycle their trade surpluses with the US into Treasury bonds , but the combined surplus does not approach the size of the US budget deficit .
Perhaps another drop in the stock market will drive Americans ' remaining wealth into " safe " US Treasury bonds .
If not , there 's only the printing press .
The printing press would turn a deflationary depression into an inflationary depression .
Unemployment combined with rising prices would be a killer .
Inflation would kill the dollar as well , leaving the US unable to pay for its imports .
All the Obama regime sees is a " credit problem . "
But the crisis goes far beyond banks ' bad investments .
The United States is busted .
Many of the state governments are busted .
Homeowners are busted .
Consumers are busted .
Jobs are busted .
Companies are busted .
And Obama thinks he has the money to fight wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Except for the superrich and those banksters and CEOs who stole wealth from investors and shareholders , Americans have suffered enormous losses in wealth and income .
The stock market decline has destroyed about 45 % of their IRAs , 401Ks , and other equity investments .
On top of this comes the decline in home prices , lost jobs and health care , lost customers .
The realized gains in mutual funds and investment partnerships , on which Americans paid taxes , have been wiped out .
The government should give those taxes back .
Americans who have seen their retirement savings devastated by complicity of government regulators and lawmakers with financial gangsters should not have to pay any income tax when they draw on their pensions .
The financial damage inflicted on Americans by their own government is as great as would be expected from foreign conquest .
While Washington " protected " us from terrorists by fighting pointless wars abroad , the US economy collapsed .
How can President Obama even think about fighting wars half way around the world while California cannot pay its bills , while Americans are being turned out of their homes , while , as Business Week reports , retirees will work throughout their retirement ( which assumes that there will be jobs ) , while careers are being destroyed and stores and factories shuttered .
Americans are facing tremendous unemployment and hardship .
Obama does n't have another dollar to spend on Bush 's wars .
Taxpayers are busted .
They cannot stand another day of being milked by the military - security complex .
The US government is paying private mercenaries more by the day than the monthly checks it is providing to Social Security retirees .
This is insanity .
The banksters robbed us twice .
First it was our home and stock values .
Then the government rewarded the banksters for their misdeeds by bailing out the banksters , not their victims , and putting the cost on the taxpayers ' books .
The government has also robbed the taxpayers of $ 3 trillion dollars to fight its wars .
About $ 600 billion are out of pocket costs , and the rest is on the taxpayers ' books .
When foreign creditors look at the debt piled on the taxpayers ' books , they do n't see a good credit risk .
Washington is so accustomed to ripping off the taxpayers for the benefit of special interests that the practice is now in the DNA .
While bailouts are being piled upon bailouts , wars are being piled upon wars .
Before Obama gets in any deeper , he must ask his economic team where the money is coming from .
When he finds out , he needs to tell the rest of us .

As a child , I was frightened of A.T.M.s. Specifically , I was frightened of the first A.T.M .
I ever saw , the one outside the imposing headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank , at 1 Queen ’s Road Central , Hong Kong .
This would have been around 1970 , when I was eight .
My father , being an employee of the bank , was an early adopter of the A.T.M. , which stood just to one side of the building ’s iconic bronze lions , but every time I saw him use it I panicked .
What if the machine got its sums wrong and took all our money ?
What if the machine took someone else ’s money by mistake , and my father went to prison ?
What if the machine said it was giving him only ten dollars but actually took much more out of his account — some unimaginably large sum , like fifty or a hundred dollars ?
The freedom with which the machine coughed up its cash , and the invitation to go straight out and spend it , seemed horribly reckless .
The flow of money , from our account out through the machine and then into the world , just seemed too easy .
My dad would stand there grimly tapping in his PIN number while I hung onto his arm and begged him to stop .
My scaredy - cat eight - year - old self was on to something .
The sheer frictionlessness with which money moves around the world is frightening ; it can induce a kind of vertigo .
This can happen when you are reading the financial news and suddenly feel that you have no grip on what the numbers actually mean — what those millions and billions and trillions actually represent , how to get hold of them in your mind .
( Try the following thought experiment , suggested by the mathematician John Allen Paulos , in his book “ Innumeracy ” :
Without doing the calculation , guess how long a million seconds is .
Now try to guess the same for a billion seconds .
Ready ?
A million seconds is less than twelve days ; a billion is almost thirty - two years . )
Or it can happen when you look at a bank statement and contemplate the terrible potency of those strings of digits , their ability to dictate everything from what you eat to where you live — the abstract numerals whose consequences are the least abstract thing in the world .
Or it can happen when the global flow of capital suddenly hits you personally — when your apparently thriving employer goes out of business owing to a problem with credit , or your mortgage payments jump unpayably upward — and you think , Just what is this money stuff , anyway ?
I can see its effects — I can thumb a banknote , flip a coin — but what is it , actually ?
What do these abstract numbers stand for ?
What is the thing that ’s being represented ?
Would n’t it be reassuring if it was more like a physical thing , and less like an idea ?
Would n’t the global financial system be less vertiginous , less bizarre , if your money actually stood for something ?
The answer to that question is no , and we know this because the system was in effect for years and — to borrow a phrase from the subtitle of Liaquat Ahamed ’s new book , “ Lords of Finance ” ( Penguin Press ; $ 32.95 ) — it “ broke the world . ”
The system was the gold standard , and it involved the world ’s major currencies being pegged against gold in a way that was , in theory , redeemable : that is , you could go to the bank and exchange your currency for a specified amount of gold .
In the United States , it was 23.22 grains of gold to the dollar ; in the United Kingdom , it was 113 grains to the pound sterling .
( A grain is based on the notional weight of a grain of wheat : 1/7,000 of a pound . )
By fixing currencies to gold , the gold standard also fixed them to each other .
In addition , the central banks , which had a monopoly on printing and distributing money , were obliged by law to keep the amount of money in circulation linked to the amount of gold in their reserves .
This was not just a local issue but a planetary one .
Even the most vertigo - prone of us , those who are least comfortable with the abstractness of modern money , can begin to spot a problem here : what if the world needs more money ?
What if all the gold is in the wrong place , or there is n’t enough of it ?
These turn out to be good questions .
Liaquat Ahamed ’s book stretches from the beginning of the First World War to the setting up of the Bretton Woods system to regulate the global flows of capital , at the end of the Second .
At the time his story begins , Ahamed estimates that the entire global supply of gold can be stored in a two - story town house .
Most of it is to be found in the vaults of the world ’s central banks , doing the passive work of propping up the respective national currencies .
The men in charge of the gold are the heads of those central banks , and it is they who are the central figures of Ahamed ’s book .
That might make the story sound dry — but it is n’t , not at all .
The central banks turn out to be unexpectedly rickety institutions .
Most of them had an odd semi-private , semi-public status , as privately owned companies with a legal monopoly on printing money .
The oldest of the four central banks that Ahamed writes about , the Bank of England , was founded in 1694 to help pay for the latest installment of the European wars , and it was set up by a group of Protestant merchants , several of them French Huguenot refugees , who made the following offer : the government would get a loan of 1.2 million pounds in perpetuity , at an interest rate of eight per cent .
In return , the bank would be allowed to issue 1.2 million pounds in banknotes , and have the exclusive right to be the government ’s banker .
So the setting up of the central bank was a mutually beneficial deal to create a monopoly — with the faint but perceptible smell of a conspiracy against the public .
This trend was to continue .
America ’s first modern central bank was established in 1913 , in the teeth of strong populist suspicion of bankers .
The men who conceived it were worried about the perception that they were forming a cabal , and so did what you naturally do when you ’re worried about that : they travelled by private train , under pseudonyms , to a top - secret meeting at a private island off the coast of Georgia .
The institution they envisioned became the Federal Reserve , and it was a compromise from the start .
The bankers wanted a single central bank , but opposition in Congress watered the plan down so that it created twelve autonomous regional institutions overseen by a board of governors appointed by the President .
Benjamin Strong , the first head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank — which , it was soon clear , would be the most important of the twelve branches — had been at the island meeting , and supported a single central bank .
Strong argued , in Ahamed ’s words , that the Federal Reserve ’s “ decentralized structure would simply perpetuate the fragmentation and diffusion of authority that had so bedeviled American banking and would only lead to conflict and confusion . ”
Strong was right about that ; he was right about many things , and , of the four central bankers in Ahamed ’s book , he is the one who seemed to have the most flexibility of mind — though he could also be forceful to the point of brutishness .
He died in 1928 , just before the end of the bull run and the subsequent crash ; if he had lived , Ahamed thinks , the United States might have done a much better job of managing its way through the subsequent economic turmoil .
The three other men lived through that turmoil , and did n’t do a great job of trying to alleviate it .
It may not have helped that they all had personalities that teetered on the verge of self - caricature .
The oddest of them was Montagu Norman , the governor of the Bank of England , which at the time of the First World War was , thanks to its age and its place at the center of the British Empire , the most powerful financial institution in the world .
Norman was a clever man , and a world - class flake — a bohemian who cultivated a voluptuous Vandyke beard , preferred the company of artists and designers to that of his colleagues , and usually dressed in a floppy hat and a cloak .
He was a neurotic , an obsessive about secrecy , a manic - depressive , and a sometime Theosophist , who once told a colleague that he could walk through walls .
If he were a children ’s entertainer , you would decide not to employ him after checking out the photo on his Web site .
He travelled under the pseudonym Professor Clarence Skinner , as part of his policy of maximum shiftiness ; when asked by a British government select committee what his reasons were for a particular decision , he tapped his nose three times and said , “ I do n’t have reasons .
I have instincts . ”
Try that one on Henry Waxman .
The climax of Norman ’s career was in 1925 , when he prevailed on Winston Churchill , then Chancellor of the Exchequer , to return Britain to the gold standard — the fixed rate having been abandoned during the war .
Churchill was no financial guru .
He recalled how his father , Randolph , who had also been Chancellor , talked about struggling with decimal points : “ I never could make out what those damned dots meant . ”
In later years , Churchill saw the return to the gold standard as “ the biggest blunder ” of his life : “ I had no special comprehension of the currency problem and therefore fell into the hands of the experts , as I never did later where military matters were concerned . ”
He often ranted about “ that man Skinner . ”
In the short run , though , Norman got the credit for the restoration of the international financial system .
He was a heroic success , before he was a heroic failure — a trajectory common to all four of Ahamed ’s subjects .
The second temporary hero of inter-war finance was Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht .
( His father gave him his first two names , which he did n’t use , in honor of the founding editor of the New York Tribune . )
Schacht was the German central banker who took the credit for rescuing the German currency from the hyperinflation that overtook it after the First World War .
By the early nineteen - twenties , the German economy , damaged by defeat , had become crippled by the attempt to pay the reparations demanded by the victorious European Allies and simultaneously develop a social - welfare state .
The government printed as much money as it could , and inflation was running out of control .
In 1914 , the German mark had stood at 4.2 to the dollar ; by 1922 , it was 190 to the dollar ; by the end of that year , it was 7,600 .
By November , 1923 , a dollar was worth 630 billion marks , a loaf of bread cost 140 billion marks , and Germany was disintegrating under the strain .
Schacht was appointed currency commissioner , and took charge of the project to issue a new currency , the Rentenmark , whose value was underpinned not by gold but by land .
( For a short period , Germany had two legal currencies . )
The Rentenmark held its value , helped by such drastic measures as the firing of a quarter of the government ’s workforce .
Schacht became a national hero .
He seems to have been a spectacularly unpleasant man , whose physical rigidity , starched collars , and stiff gait offer a precise parallel to his prickly , arrogant personality — a man who embodied to full effect negative stereotypes of the petty bureaucrat and the banker .
He struck a contemporary as “ a compound of a Prussian reserve officer and a budding Prussian judge who is trying to copy the officer . ”
In later life , he worked with the Nazis , though he never joined the Party , and eventually became so disillusioned with Hitler that he was involved in conspiracies to overthrow him .
Schacht was tried with leading members of the regime at Nuremberg ( where John Dos Passos described him as looking “ like an angry walrus ” ) , and was acquitted .
After several more trials , and a solitary conviction that was overturned on appeal , he lived in freedom until his death , in 1970 , at the age of ninety - three .
Émile Moreau , the fourth lord of finance , was another hard banker to love , a blunt version of the classic French haut fonctionnaire , preoccupied with questions of national status .
As head of the Banque de France , he had the greatest success of any European central banker in the years after the First World War .
His masterstroke was to hold the value of the franc to a low level .
Germany was crippled by war reparations and inflation , and Britain had gone back to the gold standard at too high a level .
For the British , the postwar years saw a textbook deflationary trap .
Prices were falling , but interest rates were kept high to protect the pound , which in turn made exports too expensive .
The result was rocketing unemployment and a general strike .
In contrast , Moreau , by keeping the franc cheap , presided over a boom in exports .
All those foreigners buying inexpensive French goods meant that France was sucking up money .
The Fed , thanks to the American wartime boom , had most of the world ’s gold ; the Banque de France now had much of the rest .
The analogy would be a poker game in which two players have won nearly all the chips , and no one else can play .
Montagu Norman was one of the people who foresaw disaster but were unable to prevent it .
He wrote to Moreau that “ unless drastic measures are taken to save it , the capitalist system throughout the civilised world will be wrecked within a year . ”
It ’s easy to be reminded , by all this , of more recent events .
It ’s also easy to see history through the eyes of the present , and make people look stupid for not knowing what we know .
Liaquat Ahamed has the imagination not to do that .
While he makes clear the ways in which his protagonists were wrong , he does n’t judge them anachronistically .
He shows just how hard it is to be right when one is confronted with new facts and unfamiliar developments .
He was inspired to write the book by a 1999 issue of Time with the cover line “ The Committee to Save the World , ” featuring a photograph of Alan Greenspan , Robert Rubin , and Lawrence Summers .
The occasion for the piece was the 1997 - 98 meltdown in developing markets , and the ensuing collapse of Long - Term Capital Management , which , by some estimates , risked blowing a trillion - dollar hole in the world economic system .
Ahamed was an investment manager during this period , and his book is informed by an awareness of how unprecedented events look at the time they are being lived through — an awareness that helps to make his book seem timely today .
Would a book about the men in charge of today ’s global financial system be called “ The Committee to Save the World ” ?
Or “ The Bankers Who Broke the World ” ?
It ’s too early to say , though it ’s not too early to ask — and one should bear in mind that the consensus opinion on these things tends to fluctuate .
You may well have been taught in school the same thing I was taught , that the New Deal brought an end to the Great Depression ; but , of a hundred economists surveyed in the mid-nineties , nearly half agreed with the proposition “ Taken as a whole , government policies of the New Deal served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression . ”
The present calamity will probably be the subject of debate for as long as the crash and the Depression have been , and will provide equally rich material .
Consider Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson : the slouchy Jewish academic who , thank God , made a special study of the causes of the Great Depression ; and the aerobicized Christian Scientist former head of Goldman Sachs .
The scenario resembles a movie pitch : Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger — and they ’re twins !
As for Calvin Coolidge , the President who , in Ahamed ’s words , “ elevated inaction to a point of principle ” : not hard to think of a latter - day parallel for him .
And then there ’s the cast of differingly motivated , ideologically disparate foreigners , each trying to build his or her own national life raft : Gordon Brown , Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Perhaps most fascinating of all is the man who was at the center of that Committee to Save the World and who got most of the credit for the boom before it turned into a bust : Alan Greenspan .
The crucial questions in history often turn out to involve things that people at the time simply did not understand .
Sometimes these things were too complicated to be resolved , and sometimes they were so glaringly obvious that they were hidden in plain sight .
Sometimes they were both at the same time : horribly complex , horribly obvious .
In the buildup to the 1929 crash and the subsequent depression , the linked issues of reparations and the gold standard were at once unfixably complicated and so much at the heart of the system that they were hard to see plainly .
The equivalent issue at the heart of the current financial meltdown is that of risk .
For reasons to do with a lack of historical awareness , overconfidence , and faulty mathematical modelling , the entire global financial system was built on mistaken calculations about probability .
Greenspan , who more than anyone else was central to this system , told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 23rd that the crisis was prompted by “ a once - in - a - century credit tsunami , ” which had arisen from the collapse of a “ whole intellectual edifice . ”
“ Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders ’ equity — myself especially — are in a state of shocked disbelief , ” he said .
This failure of self - interest to provide self - regulation was , he said , “ a flaw in the model that I perceived as the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works . ”
It ’s worth dwelling on that phrase : “ the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works . ”
That ’s a hell of a big thing to find a flaw in .
Here ’s another way of describing that flaw : the people in power thought they knew more than they did .
The bankers evidently knew too much math and not enough history — or maybe they did n’t know enough of either .
Montagu Norman , that odd , lonely man who was once the most powerful central banker in the world , came to feel that his life had been largely futile .
Reflecting on his work and that of his friend Ben Strong , of the New York Fed , he wrote , “ As I look back , it now seems that , with all the thought and work and good intentions . . . nothing that I did , and very little that old Ben did , internationally produced any good effect — or indeed any effect at all except that we collected money from a lot of poor devils and gave it over to the four winds . ” ♦

The idea that one needs powerful philosophical theories to settle [ whether there are gods , witches or ghosts ] might be called the “ philosophy fallacy . ”
[ P] eople are particularly prey to it in religious discussions , both theist and atheist alike ; indeed , atheists often get trapped into doing far more , far riskier philosophy than they need ( 247-248 ) .
The post title comes from an essay by Georges Rey [ 1 ] , in which he discusses what he calls the " philosophy fallacy " :
[ T ]he reasons for atheism are obvious , not depending upon some subtle metaphysics , or sophisticated theories of knowledge ( of which , if the truth be known , no remotely adequate examples are available anyway ) .
The errors in the standard arguments for the existence of God are ones that can be easily appreciated by anyone with an average high - school education ( 247 ) . [ 2 ]
In my experience , Rey 's contention bears out .
I 've never encountered a theological argument that ( once I understood it , at least ) did n't strike me as just obviously wrong .
Even in a case where providing an exact diagnosis can be tricky ( e.g. , Anselm 's ontological argument ) , that there is some kind of infirmity is manifest ( in the case of Anselm 's argument , for instance , that it proves too much ) .
And yet risky philosophy abounds in the philosophy of religion .
There are many plausible reasons for its perseverance : Philosophical interest in some kinds of abstract arguments [ 3 ] ; an intellectual need to address all possible , marginal challenges to one 's views ; a psychological need to rationalize one 's current , settled views in the face of such challenges ; a sociological desire to show that one 's views are intellectually defensible ; and so forth .
One thing seems near - certain , though :
It can't reasonably be aimed at changing anyone 's mind .
If you look among the testimonials posted at the Internet Infidels website , for instance , you 'll find the authors cite various forces that moved them to apostatize :
The evils witnessed in combat ( Eric Tallberg ) ; the gradual recognition of the apparent absurdities that abound in the Bible ( Amanda Avellone , Farrell Till ) ; the commonsense musings of general philosophers ( Dan Barker ) ; the plain contradictions between common - sense personal morality and the less - commonly advertised teachings of the Bible ( Mark Vuletic , Ken Daniels , Kenneth Nahigian , Edward T. Babinski , Ian J. Carr , B. Steven Matthies ) ; the dawning appreciation of science and the basic demand for evidence ( Raymond D. Bradley , Robert M. Price , Kendall Hobbs ; Richard Carrier ) ; the apparent conflict between religions ( Clark Davis Adams ) ; personal encounters with friendly , decent atheists ( G. Vincent Runyon ) ; and / or all of the above .
No risky philosophy there .
A similar pattern shows up in the testimonials contained in the Louise Antony volume [ 4 ] : Stewart Shapiro's belief " snapped " when he heard that David Vetter died , having lived all but the final moments of his life entirely deprived of the touch of another human ( 3 ) ; Joseph Levine 's aggregate doubts crystalized during college , when he realized he 'd simply " lost all of [ his ] religious beliefs " ( 19 ) ; Daniel Garber 's encounters with the religious traditions of others that suggested to him the arbitrariness of his own ( 35 ) ; along similar lines , Walter Sinnott - Armstrong was gradually struck by the inherent arbitrariness of the common Biblical narratives ( 72 ) ; key to Edwin Curley 's growing incredulity was the unfairness of his church 's embrace of the doctrine of predestination ( 80 - 81 ) ; Marvin Belzer came to rue the accidental quality of religious belief -- that some will never even hear the stories , and others are constituted so as to find those stories incredible ( 96 ) ; and Louise Antony 's gradual conversion came to a head in her first college philosophy class , a forum that finally allowed her the freedom do ask the sorts of questions she ( and others ) had anxiously suppressed all of her life ( 50 - 51 ) .
Nope , not there either .
What about belief change in the other direction -- in the direction of greater credulity ?
The situation there is even starker .
" Conversion " experiences seem to be entirely driven by emotion , usually stemming from a personal crisis . [ 5 ]
Take a gander at most any website that features testimonials from " born - agains , " and you 'll see what I mean . [ 6 ]
There is very little room in the conversion process for even low - level intellection , and none at all for risky philosophy .
In sum , risky philosophy does not appear ever to have brought about even a quantum of belief change .
You will probably search in vain for a ( de ) conversion testimonial that cites anything like , say , Goedel 's proof , and by the time you are reading Quentin Smith or Alvin Plantinga , your views are either ( 1 ) pretty well settled or else ( 2 ) already on their way to changing without the help of Quentin Smith or Alvin Plantinga .
When minds change , in either direction , it is in view of much more concrete considerations -- the problem of life 's meaning , the problem of death , the problem of suffering , the problem of God 's storied cruelty .
But all that means is that risky philosophy does n't do any persuasive work at the object level .
So how come it's " risky " ?
For an answer to that , you 'll have to read Part II .
Until then ...

2. Parenthetically , Rey addresses a possible objection : " Of course , sophisticated versions of the arguments take sophistication to work through .
But , naturally , the more sophisticated they are , the less likely they play a role in ordinary religious thought " ( 247 ) .

5 . I would exclude from the category of " conversion " a case like that of Antony Flew , not least because the view he currently expresses is a vague form of deism , which share any theological charge or therapeutic aim with mainstream religion .
6 . See here , for example .
It might appear that I 'm loading the dice here by comparing the de-conversion stories of top philosophers with the conversion stories of ( ostensibly less reflective ) lay people .
But the kind of visceral , anintellectual motivations you see described in the referenced site dovetail perfectly well with the conversion experience account of someone like William Lane Craig ( at least as I recall his telling it ; I do n't have a quotation to hand ) .
Besides which , the stats on conversion on their own appear to back up the strong claim that de-conversion is driven by intellection while conversion is driven by personal crisis and emotional need .

Slack Street recycling center employee John Rowe sifts though trash in Charleston , W.Va. , last month looking for recylables , such as plastic bottles and tin cans .
COSTS MORE TO SAVE COSTS MORE TO SAVE Enlarge By Joseph Kaczmarek , AP Dorene Haenick takes recyclables to the curb in Cherry Hill , N.J. Industry insiders worry that if services get cut , residents will get out of the habit .
Recycling may be good for the environment , but right now it 's not very good business .
Plummeting global market prices for such items as aluminum , paper , plastic and steel — some of which have fallen by as much as 80 % — are forcing recycling companies to lay off workers , cut expenses and stop accepting certain materials because of their decreased worth .
Prices started dropping in early fall when the global export market collapsed as a result of the recession , said Ed Skernolis , acting executive director of the National Recycling Coalition in Washington , D.C.
While metal prices had shown some decline earlier because of slowdowns in domestic auto production and construction activity , other commodities dropped sharply when the Asian markets , particularly China , stopped buying , Skernolis said .
" The business side of recycling is heavily influenced by the price of materials brought into the commodity market , " Skernolis said .
" The value chain is intrinsically connected to the global economy . "
According to RecycleNet Corp. , based in Salt Lake City , the national price of aluminum has dropped from $ 2,040 to $ 1,020 per ton since June .
In the same period , the price of steel has dropped from $ 210 to $ 77 a ton , copper from $ 1.58 a pound to 40 cents a pound and cardboard from $ 115 to $ 40 a ton .
In northeastern export areas , material prices have dropped by 80 % in the past three months , and in the central portion of the country by about 60 % or 70 % , said Steve Ragiel , chief executive officer of the Houston - based Greenstar North America , the nation 's largest private processor of recyclables with 18 facilities nationwide .
" This has been the most rapid decline we 've seen , " said Ragiel , who added the down market is expected to last for a year or possibly two .
As the domestic market has become flooded with recyclables , recycling companies have been forced to cut back .
" It hit everybody in the recycling industry , " said Allen Jongsma , vice president of Agri-Plas , based outside of Salem , Ore .
The company , which specializes in agricultural plastics that are shipped to Asia and used in polyester clothing and filler for down coats , has laid off two - thirds of its workforce this year , Jongsma said .
In Missouri , Springfield - based Greenway Recycling is cutting back on some of its services .
" It 's classic supply and demand , " said Jim Von Behren , president of the commercial paper and plastic recycling company .
" Not only is pricing low , the movability of materials to mills is really hard , " Von Behren said .
" It 's a question of can you continue moving or selling what you have at any price . "
Some recycling companies are surviving by adjusting what they pay haulers .
Far West Fibers in Portland , Ore. , lowered its price to haulers three times in October , which the company had never done before , said Jeff Murray , its vice president of business development .
" I 've never seen it anything like this , " said Murray , who said he has been in the recycling industry for 31 years .
In Vermont , the Chittenden Solid Waste District plans to change rates in January and charge haulers $ 20 per ton instead of paying them $ 7 per ton , said Tom Moreau , general manager of the service .
With the low prices for materials , some scrap yards are reporting fewer customers .
" When prices go from the highest in history to a low , the public is holding on to material to wait and sell it at the right time , " said Richard Myers , general manager of Tom - Bar , which is part of Tenenbaum Recycling Group , based in Arkansas .
" A lot of people do this for a living . "
Other industry insiders worry that if recycling facilities cut back on curbside services , residents will get out of the recycling habit .
" A lot of those services are going to be impacted if it stays like this , " said Melinda Caldwell , owner of the recycling brokerage company Via Recyclables , based in Harrison , Ark .
" We do n't want peoples ' habits to change . "

The UN has launched an appeal for $ 613 m to help people affected by Israel 's military offensive in Gaza .
" These needs are massive and multi- faceted , " Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told the World Economic Forum in Davos .
He added that funds would be used to " help overcome at least some measures of this hardship " .
In the region itself , US envoy George Mitchell said the Palestinian Authority should play a part in cementing the Gaza Strip 's shaky truce .
After meeting PA President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank , Mr Mitchell said a " mechanism " was needed to stop arms smuggling into Gaza , and that should be done " with the participation of the Palestinian Authority " .
Gaza visit Mr Ban visited Gaza after the ceasefires - the first world leader to do so since Hamas took over in 2007 and Israel tightened its blockade - and he spoke passionately about what he had seen there .
" More than one - third of the 6,600 deaths and injured were children and women .
As a father of three I was especially troubled by the suffering and trauma that so many families went through , " he said .
" People have lost their families , they have lost their homes , belongings , and livelihoods .
Schools , clinics , factories and businesses have been destroyed , " he said .
GAZA CRISIS
Gaza : Humanitarian situation Counting casualties of Gaza's war Gaza slowly begins rebuilding BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall in Davos says Mr Ban 's appeal was impassioned and hard hitting , and he stressed it was humanitarian rather political in nature .
The appeal aims to cover the requirements of the UN and other aid organisations for the next six to nine months and will provide everything from medical care to clean water .
The Israeli offensive in Gaza killed about 1,300 Palestinians , of whom 412 were children ; 21,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged .
Thirteen Israelis were killed during the three weeks of violence .
Also at Davos , the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs chief John Holms said Israel had to lift its blockade of the Palestinian territory of 1.5 million people .
" We 're asking for the crossing points to be opened fully ...
Otherwise , we wo n't be able to achieve what we want to achieve , " he said at a joint news conference with Mr Ban .
Israel says restrictions on access to Gaza are necessary to prevent the flow of weapons to the Hamas movement .
West Bank visit Mr Mitchell visited the West Bank on Thursday for a meeting with Mr Abbas , whose Fatah movement is at odds with Gaza 's ruling Hamas party .
" To be successful in preventing the illicit traffic of arms into Gaza there must be a mechanism to allow the flow of legal goods , and that should be with the participation of the Palestinian Authority , " Mr Mitchell said .

" Lasting peace is our objective and the United States will sustain an active commitment to reaching the goal of two states living side by side in peace , stability and security . "
On Wednesday , Mr Mitchell met senior Israeli officials in Jerusalem , after beginning his first tour of the region as President Barack Obama 's envoy in Egypt .
Mr Mitchell has no plans to meet representatives of Hamas .
The announcement came amid fears of a collapse of unilateral ceasefires by Israel and the Hamas militant group .
Sporadic violence has erupted since both sides declared tentative ceasefires on 17 and 18 January .
Late on Wednesday , a rocket was fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel .
Israel bombed the area around the border between Gaza and Egypt .
Another rocket was fired on Thursday morning , while Israeli air strikes hit southern Gaza .
Meanwhile , about 40 demonstrators protested outside the BBC offices in Gaza .
Representatives from a dozen intellectual and cultural groups called for a boycott of the BBC , in protest at its refusal to screen on UK television a humanitarian aid appeal for Gaza and for what they describe as " unbalanced reporting " .

Essential Java resources
A comprehensive listing of must - have books , sites , blogs , events , and more
Since its introduction to the programming community as a whole in 1995 , the Java platform has evolved far beyond the " applets everywhere " vision that early Java pundits and evangelists imagined a Java world to be like .
Instead , the Java world rose up to Swing , coalesced around servlets , rode that into J2EE , stumbled on EJB , sidestepped over to Spring and Hibernate , added generics and became more dynamic , then functionalized , and continues to grow in all sorts of interesting directions even as I write this .
Which leaves the Java programmer who did n't grow up along with the language somewhat overwhelmed .
As a speaker , blogger , consultant , and mentor , I am frequently asked by junior and intermediate programmers working in the Java space for resources to help them master this wide , complex , seemingly endless world .
A few years ago , I took a stab at answering the question by posting a Recommended Reading List , but recently the Java editor at developerWorks asked me to put together a broader list of resources , not focused exclusively on books — a good idea considering that the list had grown to a point where a prospective consumer could easily spend the next decade reading them and still not make a dent in the contents .
To avoid the appearance of bias or undue influence , I decided to throw a call to the blogosphere for resources :
Web sites , conferences , books , blogs , tools , anything that seemed like it would be of interest and use to Java developers as they progress in the space and might find helpful in navigating the sheer enormity of what 's available .
The response was enormous ( for which I thank all those who replied ) .
A quick note by way of explanation before we begin :
These resources are not necessarily the most popular , most powerful , or most influential resources in the Java ecosystem — that list might be entirely different ( though I suspect many resources would show up in both places ) ; instead , these are the resources every up - and - coming Java developer should have in their browser , on their bookshelf , or on their calendar to attend .
As with any kind of list of this sort , there is always room for reasonable debate as to what should be included that was n't or what was included that should n't have been .
With no further ceremony , let us proceed .
Web sites and developer Web portals
The Web has clearly changed the nature of shared material and publications ( and it 's not lost on me that you are reading this right now on the Web ) , so it seems reasonable to begin the survey of key Java resources with key Web sites and developer portals that every Java developer should keep an eye on .
In many cases , the value of a Web site and / or developer portal is not just in the resources offered or the articles posted there , but also in the community that surrounds that portal or Web site .
The days of the static Web page and file download are quickly fading into the background behind the more " active " model of forums , threaded articles , and interactive discussion between not only the developers who frequent that site and make up its community but also the community members and the owners of the portal .
Just as technology evolves and developers must evolve to keep up with it , a portal must evolve to keep up with the changing needs of its community ; having an open relationship with its community is a critical component to keeping a portal vibrant .
The list of Web sites ( with URLs ) :
java.sun.com
This is the place from which the JDK originates and is often the first site that Java developers go to download a copy of the JDK and documentation .
But beyond that , it is also a good source for information on the entire Java platform , including a very rich section on the JVM itself ( Hotspot ) , which describes the internals of the JVM to a surprising depth .

InfoQ
Created by Floyd Marinescu , founding editor - in - chief of The ServerSide , InfoQ differs from many of the other resources listed here in that it is explicitly technology - neutral , covering not only Java code but also .NET and Ruby and offering great coverage of agile approaches and insights .
Though the commenting community on InfoQ is n't as large or as diverse as that of TheServerSide , the discussion is usually more tame and less hostile .

TheServerSide
Often called " the the Slashdot of Java , " TheServerSide was the first place that enterprise Java topics were openly questioned , hotly debated , and aggressively pursued .
Some of the earliest thoughts around lightweight containers ( as typified by Spring ) occurred here and many of the individuals now considered to be " thought leaders " in the Java community emerged here .
Although more recently the debates have sometimes taken on the character of shrill shouting matches , TSS will always be the original home of much of what turned into the Java ecosystem we now live within ; as such , it will always be a source of information , historical if nothing else .

DZone
DZone began life as a resource for Java developers , but more recently has begun to branch out into the other technology sectors , including .NET and Ruby , as well as several other topical " zones " of coverage .
As such , while it 's possible for the Java developer to focus entirely on just the Java zone , some cross-pollination does occur and it's the wise developer who will take advantage of that .

If you 're reading this article , then you 've already found dW .
In the interest of full disclosure , I must note that I have contributed articles other than this one to this site , but I can say with integrity that dW stands as a great resource for articles and material on Java coding and the JVM .
In particular , be sure to check out Java theory and practice , a long - running series by Brian Goetz , which includes a three - part description of the JVM garbage collector that introduces the core concepts of GC in a surprisingly approachable way .

Artima
Created by Bill Venners , Artima has evolved into a huge collection of articles , blogs , and interviews , not all of it entirely focused on Java development , and has some of the biggest names in the Java space writing there .
( Check out Bill Joy 's disbelief over the complexity of the Java language after Java 5 was released and the example he uses to justify his worries — Enum <> — as a classic example . )
Well worth visiting .
Note that for many of the above , taking full advantage of the site / portal will require some form of registration .
As of this writing , all of them are essentially free and require a username / password login solely so they can uniquely identify visitors and an e-mail address so they can send periodic topical newsletters or e-mails .
( To the best of my knowledge , all will allow you to opt out of the e-mail , but I have n't tried because I find that every so often , the newsletter tells me something I find interesting and did n't already know about , making them genuinely useful things to get in my Inbox . )
Weblogs
Blogs represent an easy way for developers to stay apprised of thoughts , memes , concepts , ideas , debates , and other intellectual discussions around technology and aware of those " thought leaders " who seem to be influential within the specific technology spheres .
Even better , blogs can be consumed locally via feed readers that pull the articles / entries down locally so that they can be consumed even while offline .
In fact , blogs have become so ubiquitous that specialized devices ( like the Amazon Kindle ) can make it easy to grab the info developers want .
The key is to determine which of the literally millions of blogs to read .
Every developer will have their own preferences over which blogs to read and which not to , but some blogs to consider starting with include :
The Java Posse
The Java Specialists ' Newsletter
Any RSS feeds offered by the Web sites listed in the " Web sites " section
Remember that ( most of ) these are personal opinions ; sometimes the opinions shared there will turn out later to be factually incorrect — never base a production decision solely on the information in a blog entry .
But if used to kick the thought process out of a rut , blogs can be an incredibly powerful skills - enhancing resource .
Packages and / or libraries
Keeping track of all the libraries and packages in the Java ecosystem is a chore , one that can become all too easy for the Java developer to ignore .
As a result , developers will sometimes miss the fact that something they 're writing by hand already exists inside the platform ( if only they 'd stop to discover it ! ) .
What follows is my list of the " Top Ten Java Packages Every Java Developer Should At Least Know Exists ( and Ideally Know How To Use ) " :
java.lang.reflect
So many of Java 's libraries and tools depend on the Reflection package that learning it has almost become a requirement ( if for no other reason than to understand when using it will fail due to security policy or other kinds of infrastructural mismatches ) .
Hand - in - hand with Reflection is also Java 5 Annotations and java.lang.annotation .

javax.
script
With the emphasis on dynamic languages sweeping through the Java ecosystem , knowing how to use scripting languages from within Java code can allow developers to extend their systems without having to go through the expensive compile - link - run - test cycle .

javax .
management and java.lang.management
The management package , also known as Java Management Extensions ( JMX ) , is a powerful tool for monitoring Java applications as they run ; as such , developers should be familiar and comfortable with JMX in order to build software that can actually be used by system administrators .
Do n't forget to look at the jconsole tool that ships with the JDK as an example of an application health dashboard , as both an example of what can be built and a useful tool in its own right .
( Pay close attention to the script demo that builds a jconsole plug - in to enable scripting support inside jconsole , a powerful tool in the hands of any competent system administrator . )

Concurrency is the biggest thing developers will face in the coming decade , and the principal weapon Java developers will wield against concurrency bugs will be the classes in this package and its subpackages ( .atomic and .locks ) .
Learning to use it will be just as critical , if not more so , than learning how to write a class .
Learn it , live it , love it .

java.util
The same is true of the classes in java.util .
These are so frequently brought in , particularly the Collections classes , that it 's arguable java.util . * should be automatically imported like java.lang is .

java .
beans
JavaBeans are , without a doubt , one of the core elements used throughout the Java ecosystem , going under the less marketing -y name of " POJO "s ( plain old Java objects ) .
They 're still based on the JavaBeans code , API , and specification , so spending a little time with the classes in java .
beans can only help write better POJOs .

java.security .*
The Java security APIs , the policy mechanism , and the permissions classes are a core part of what makes the Java environment a safe computing platform , but only if developers know how to take advantage of it .
Steer clear of the crypto APIs — do n't use them until you 've exhausted every other option available to you .
They 're not hard to use but getting crypto right ( meaning without huge flaws ) is something that takes years and a lot of peer reviews from other crypto experts .
Use other mechanisms first , like SSL / TLS and the GuardedObject / SignedObject / SecureObject classes .

javax.xml.parsers .* , javax.xml.bind , and javax.xml.transform .*
XML looms largely in the Java developer 's mindset and being able to parse it ( both directly as via an object - XML library ) and transform it ( using XSLT ) is a powerful skill to have , if not outright necessary .

javax .
sound .*
OK , it 's not a required skill , but knowing how to pop sound effects every so often can help liven up otherwise mundane code .
Besides , sometimes sound can be used to offer signals and feedback on a system when no display is immediately handy .
And beyond that , there 's just something morbidly fun about a machine throwing a stack trace and playing a high - pitched scream from your favorite horror film to let the user know that something bad just happened .
Of course , there are numerous other packages , both inside the JDK and outside the JDK that are worth learning , but mastering these will put you in good standing for most projects , not to mention most job interviews .
Conferences
Conferences continue to play a major role in the education of Java developers , particularly for those topics that have n't yet gathered enough critical mass to have filtered into large training companies ' collections of topics yet .
They also represent a golden opportunity for developers to meet with other developers of all skills and responsibilities , giving the attendee the chance to do something quite powerful ( and entirely necessary ) : vent about how bad it is where you work .
Attending a conference also has a useful side effect ( and one which can be parlayed into bigger and better things if actively massaged ) :
That of building up the attendee 's developer peer group .
Thanks to the widespread ubiquity of e-mail , mailing lists ( such as GoogleGroups or Yahoo Groups ) , and other lightweight groupware communication tools , it becomes easier than ever to keep track of the people met at a conference .
Those friendships struck up over lunch or at the evening parties can last a lifetime and pay off over time , particularly when evaluating new technologies .
Let the words of a 30 - year veteran conference attendee , speaker , organizer , and crasher ( not me , but a friend of mine ) be your guide : " Newbies to conferences go for the sessions ; veterans go for the parties and the people .
The parties help you meet people and the people help you advance your career . "
Conferences include :
No Fluff , Just Stuff
This one I particularly heartily endorse and not just because I 'm a regular speaker there , but because seven of the Top Ten JavaOne 2007 speakers are NoFluffJustStuff speakers ( current or previous ) .
Nowhere else will Java developers find the same intense focus on technical topics at a better price point or held in a more convenient location :
Your hometown .
( At more than 30 shows per year all over the North American continent — and with expansion into Europe and Asia on the horizon — chances are good you can drive to an NFJS show rather than fork out the thousands of dollars required to travel to some far - off city and stay in hotels . )
It 's also no surprise that a number of the books recommended in this article are written by authors who appear at the NoFluff shows , either :
The organizers of NFJS go to great lengths to find the " primary source " on various Java and Agile Development topics .

JavaOne
It 's large , it 's impersonal , it 's always held in San Francisco ( which is either a pro or a con , depending on what your company 's travel budget looks like ) , but no other gathering on Earth brings quite as many key Java movers - and - shakers together into one place like JavaOne does .

JAOO
Not to leave our European Java brethren out in the cold , JAOO is held once a year in Aarhus , Denmark , and has been running solid for close to two decades with no signs of slowing down .
Not only does JAOO attract some top - notch speakers and authors , but it also has the relatively rare distinction of being a cross- technology conference , meaning that an attendee can sit in on a Java session in the morning , chat with some C++ developers over lunch , catch the latest developments on Microsoft 's ®
Silverlight ( or whatever else is new ) in the afternoon , and share some beer with Smalltalkers in the evening .
If you 're looking to stretch your viewpoint , JAOO or its sister conference , QCon ( held in conjunction with the InfoQ folks ) is a great place to start .
And for those of the Java brethren living " Down Under , " JAOO came to Brisbane and Sydney for the first time this year ( 2008 ) ; all indications are that they will be back again in future years .

Devoxx
Formerly JavaPolis , this conference in Antwerp , Belgium , which is busting at the seams with phenomenal growth , is a great way to meet your European counterparts ( and taste some excellent Belgian beer while you 're at it ) .
The speakers are top - notch and focus on cutting - edge topics .
There 's also a good - sized trade - show floor and many opportunities to interact with your fellow developers .

Jazoon
A relatively new conference to the scene , the Jazoon conference opened in Zurich ( Switzerland ) in 2007 .
With names like Martin Odersky ( creator of Scala ) , Neal Gafter , and Simon Phipps ( Sun's Chief Open Source Officer ) on the rolls , Jazoon looks to be gathering an attractive crop of speakers .
Focused entirely on Java topics and sitting right in the smack center of Europe , Jazoon looks to be a good conference for the European Java brethren to mark on their calendars .
Other conferences with a variety of different target audiences are out there , but the above target the Java developer directly .
Developers looking to stretch their view of the world should consider attending an " alternative " technology conference such as the various Perl , Python , Ruby , or even .NET gatherings that happen all across the world ; keeping your mind open to new ideas sometimes requires looking at an entirely new set of problems .
Books
No greater resource available to the developer is as easy to come by as the lowly and traditional book .
Only as far away as your local bookstore ( or if you live in the hinterlands , your Web browser and Amazon ) lies a treasure trove of technical knowledge and experience ... if only you can sort through the myriad " me-too " " Java for Dummies " clones .
These tomes assume the reader already has a working knowledge of the Java language and tool set ; beginning Java books are staggeringly common and pretty much all of them cover the same basic material .
Selecting one becomes a choice of approach , author 's writing style , and even sometimes whether or not the solutions to the exercises ( if exercises are included ) are included with the book 's CD .
Once you 're past the basics , consider these :
Effective Java ( 2nd Ed ) by Joshua Bloch
The first book that should be on every Java developer 's shelf , period , hands - down , bar none .

Better , Faster , Lighter Java by Justin Gehtland and Bruce Tate
This slim read served as the " gateway drug " for many Java developers to take up the " lightweight container " environments , pioneered by Spring and filling a gap left behind by most big - iron EJB servers like WebSphere or other transaction - processing middleware .
The authors do a fantastic job walking through a POJO - based development cycle , pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and how taking a light ( er ) weight approach to building enterprise applications with tools like Spring and Hibernate does n't mean reducing the functionality or the capability of the resulting system .

Seventy - five ways to make sure your enterprise Java applications ( whether they are written with Spring , EJB , Web services , or none of the above ) do n't suck .
Just as Effective Java is not intended for the beginning Java programmer , Effective Enterprise Java is not intended for the developer who is just learning the basics of the " enterprise Java " space .

Release It ! by Michael Nygard
Anyone looking to write software intended for production servers needs to read this book — it is a great insightful look into the things that can go wrong in production and how to deal with potential failures , either by recovering from them or avoiding them entirely .

Either Inside the Java 2 Virtual Machine by Bill Venners or Component Development for the Java Platform by Stuart Halloway
Once the Java developer has learned the language , there comes a time when the underlying platform — the Java Virtual Machine itself , meaning subjects like garbage collection and Reference objects , ClassLoaders , threads and monitors , and so on — becomes the next great frontier to explore .
Either of these books ( or both ) serve as a useful guide to doing just that .
The biggest drawback to each is their relative age : Inside was published back in the Java 1.2 time frame and Component - Based shortly thereafter .
Fortunately , most of the Java Virtual Machine remains unchanged since then , so by the time the reader discovers a detail that 's different from JDK 1.2 , they will be ready to leave the book behind and move on to the next topic .

Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler and Enterprise Integration Patterns by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf
Both of these are patterns books , speaking to design approaches and ideas , and as such assume most readers have read the original " Gang of Four " book , Design Patterns by Gamma , Helm , Johnson , and Vlissides .
Patterns books generally help developers create stronger designs by giving them some basic conceptual building blocks to twist and shift into place but can easily lose their effectiveness when seen as a goal in and of themselves .

Java Power Tools by John Smart
Several people suggested this book , a gentle introduction to a variety of tools available in the Java ecosystem .
Smart also offers a training course ( Java Power Tools Bootcamp ) around the book , but the easiest way most developers will get the info will be through the dead - trees version .

The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
This book should be on every programmer 's desk , regardless of the actual language or platform being used .
This is a book for the ages and one programmers will be citing for decades to come .
Think of it in the same class as Fred Brooks ' classic The Mythical Man-Month .

The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford
This recent release looks to be every bit as classic as Pragmatic Programmer , focusing on the various tips , tricks , and techniques that programmers can use to improve their productivity well beyond what the IDE gives them .

This recent release looks to be every bit as classic as Pragmatic Programmer , focusing on the various tips , tricks , and techniques that programmers can use to improve their productivity well beyond what the IDE gives them .
The Pragmatic Starter Kit
This consists of Pragmatic Unit Testing ( with JUnit ) , Pragmatic Project Automation , and Pragmatic Source Control ( with Subversion ) .
Each one covers the core of each topic in a light , focused discussion that cuts directly to the core of the subject without a lot of distractions .
Project Automation , in particular , is a great appetizer to the Ant in Action book , but also covers the whys and whats of a good build process .

Ant in Action ( 2nd Ed ) by Erik Hatcher and Steve Loughran
Ant is the premiere build utility for the Java platform ( see the next section on tools for more details ) , and this book is by far the best introduction to the vast power that Ant represents .
Along with learning how to use Ant , Ant in Action also demonstrates unit-testing , Continuous Integration , and production deployment practices , all from the perspective of the practical Java developer 's day - to - day practices .
Tools
Just as there 's more to building a house than " grab a hammer and start nailing boards , " there 's more to Java development than " grab your IDE and start slinging code . "
While certainly a good IDE is an enormous help to writing Java code , other tools can offer equal — if not more — value than the IDE .
In no particular order ....
The IDE
Of course , the tools discussion begins with the IDE .
In an effort to steer clear of commercial endorsements , both Eclipse and NetBeans are open source and free and thus offer an attractive " first steps " option .

Unit testing
The perennial favorite here is the original that started the unit testing revolution , JUnit , but a few others have crept into popular usage , including TestNG , and not surprisingly JUnitPerf , among others .

Continuous Integration
A Continuous Integration server constantly checks the code out of source control , builds it , runs the unit tests against it , and reports any build failures to the developers , usually via e-mail .
Several open - source versions are available , but one that has gathered a lot of attention is Hudson , a Continuous Integration server with a lot of plug-ins and high extensibility .
The original is CruiseControl and for that reason alone commands respect .

Static analysis
FindBugs is an open - source static analysis tool that runs over Java code , performs deep n-way analysis to figure out all the possible code paths , and reports all sorts of errors and warnings it finds , based on a set of extensible rules .
Developed by William Pugh ( the same William Pugh who discovered a bug in the Java memory model ) , FindBugs ' biggest claim to fame is its ability to analyze Java code for concurrency bugs , something that every programmer can appreciate .

Network packet tracing
WireShark ( which formerly used to be called Ethereal ) gives programmers a view of what 's traveling across the network , giving them an opportunity to verify that what 's moving across the wire is what 's supposed to be moving across the wire , and that what 's not supposed to be there ( such as sensitive information or passwords in clear text ) , is n't .

Virtualization
A virtualization tool ( or perhaps it is more accurate to call it a platform ) like VMWare , Xen , VirtualBox , or VirtualPC offers programmers the ability to create an environment identical to the one the production machine will be running without losing the productivity of the environment of the host PC .
It also provides a convenient way to have a home for trying " experimental " software without risking the machine that has to stay productive .
Most of these have some kind of free option if they 're not outright open - source projects .
The fact that some of these are commercial tools should n't scare you ; if a tool saves you even just an hour a week , how long before that tool pays for itself ?
And if management does n't buy that argument , a careful accounting of the time that could be saved by a particular tool ( be that developer time or production diagnosis or execution time ) generally goes a long way toward convincing them of the folly of a penny - pinching penny - wise / pound - foolish perspective .

Future trends to watch
Of course , it does Java developers no good to spend all this time studying the technologies of today if , when finished , the technologies of tomorrow have moved in and made everything learned suddenly obsolete .
Keeping an eye on what 's being tossed around as " the wave of the future " can be just as important , if only so that when the CTO of the company happens to be standing next to you in the elevator and asks , " What 's all this I hear about functional languages , anyway ?
Should we be looking into that ? " , you can have a coherent answer .
In no particular order , some of the " futures " around the Java platform include :
Dynamic languages
Languages like Groovy and JRuby have spawned other projects worth watching like Clojure and Fan that experiment with the notion that a less - strongly - typed environment can provide better productivity and offer more options .
This is n't a call to abandon the Java language , however :
The best effects come in the combination of the two .

Functional languages
A trail being blazed by Scala , functional languages have the advantageous property of being implicitly concurrency - friendly due to their general tendency to encourage composable functions and lack of shared state ( although they can definitely sometimes have a syntax that only a mother could love ) .
Jaskell is a Haskell - on - JVM implementation and Clojure ( again ) fits in here , offering a vision of what software transactional memory looks like in production form .

Closures in Java
Adding closure support ( also called lambdas or anonymous methods ) will simplify certain parts of the Java coding experience and are being hotly debated for inclusion in the Java 7 release .
Given how deeply this discussion is dividing the community , it behooves Java programmers to do a little research and see what all the fuss is about .

The DaVinci Machine
A new version of the JVM designed to be friendlier to other languages ( like the dynamic and functional languages mentioned above ) , which may or may not end up being folded back into the mainstream JVM release .
Keeping an eye on this will help understand the pros and cons of running dynamic / scripting languages on the current JVM .

User interface developments
Between Flash / Flex , Silverlight , and JavaFX , the Web browser is about to get a makeover of stunning ( and probably appalling ) proportions .
This does n't even consider new server - side Web frameworks in the Java space or the odd - man - out like Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) .
User interface has always been and continues to be ( and will for the forseeable future remain ) downright sexy .
Knowing one or two , not to mention a " rich client " library like Swing or SWT , will be of huge benefit when trying to build something more interactive than HTML pages can offer .
As with anything " futures " - related , keep in mind that what 's being discussed today may turn out to be a wrong direction , a flash - in - the - pan , a momentary distraction , an influence on the industry , or the Next Big Thing ; keep an open mind and a healthy sense of skepticism in equal doses .
Summary
Please feel free to contribute to this list — it will only yield a better list of resources .
Even the passage of time will change its contents because the ecosystem continues to evolve and change and grow .
This is a good thing ; if we'd had to use the same Java environment we'd been given back in 1995 , we'd have already moved on to something else .
Be active in the ecosystem : contribute patches , suggest enhancements , and if all else fails , go off and build your own better mousetrap .

Hulu 's Hollywood overlords have forced the popular American web TV portal to block fans from watching streaming shows on television sets with Boxee .
Citing pressure from content providers ,
Hulu said the site 's streaming shows will no longer be available through the free and open source media center platform .
A joint ventures between media giants NBC and News Corp. - owners of the Fox TV network - the site is just a day removed from unceremoniously pulling its content from TV.com , calling the matter an issue of " contractual rights . "
While Hulu has been rather curt about the TV.com content yanking , it sounds downright regretful about parting ways with Boxee .
Hulu CEO Jason Kilar wrote in the company 's blog that although the website never had a formal relationship with Boxee , the decision nevertheless " weighed heavily on the Hulu team . "
From Kilar 's blog post :
Our content providers requested that we turn off access to our content via the Boxee product , and we are respecting their wishes .
While we stubbornly believe in this brave new world of media convergence — bumps and all — we are also steadfast in our belief that the best way to achieve our ambitious , never - ending mission of making media easier for users is to work hand in hand with content owners .
Without their content , none of what Hulu does would be possible , including providing you content via Hulu.com and our many distribution partner websites .
Boxee wrote about Hollywood crashing their party as well :
two weeks ago Hulu called and told us their content partners were asking them to remove Hulu from boxee .
we tried ( many times ) to plead the case for keeping Hulu on boxee , but on Friday of this week , in good faith , we will be removing it .
So what 's the motivation of Hulu 's content providers ?
Perhaps they 're worried watching streaming internet content on television will cannibalize their traditional market .
But surely making content more restrictive and less available will only lead to more folks turning to P2P piracy sites – where they can thieve shows commercial free and on any device they desire . ®
Bootnote
Yes , yes , Hulu is only available in the US .
But let 's put on our " big picture hats " before you yell at us in comments .
Imagine a world where the mind has been digitized , where every man , woman and child in the universe has been downloaded into a " cortical stack " that sits in the spine and runs whatever body it 's attached to , whether it be the body a person was born in , a genetically - engineered and boosted custom form -- or someone else 's body entirely .
In the world of Richard K. Morgan 's " Altered Carbon " , Takeshi Kovacs is an ex-envoy ( think well respected super - soldier ) that ends up caught in the web of a massive conspiracy between two ageless members of the upper crust of high technocracy on the cradle world of Earth .
The book is amazing -- part detective thriller , part action and mystery , and all sci- fi , " Altered Carbon " is a masterpiece of vivid and eye - snaring imagery .
Offering everything from the luxurious fighting arenas of the rich and chic to the shanty towns and wrecked landmarks of San Francisco 's future underside , Takeshi Kovacs ' world is well fleshed out , and you can't help but feel like a part of it .
Even the characters are well written -- this book sold the whole author for me .
Richard K. Morgan is a genius .
Do n't be scared by the size of this book though -- weighing in at just over five hundred pages , it can look like a daunting read , but " Altered Carbon " will grab you and keep you locked into it 's pages so firmly you wo n't look up to see what 's going on around you until you 've finished it .
It 's smooth , slick and altogether gritty in a very film noir kind of way , with all the originality and inventiveness we 've come to expect from excellent writers , writers who last through the test of time .
I give this one a solid five stars out of five , even though it deserves at least ten .

Citing the need for a longer period of public review , Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar announced today that he will “ send back to the drawing board ” the last - minute offshore drilling plan proposed by the Bush administration .
Submitted on January 16 , their last day of official business , the Bush plan called for a 60 - day public comment period of its 5 - year offshore drilling plan .
Salazar will add another 180 days to the review process .
More time
[ social_buttons ]
“ To establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information , we need to set aside the Bush Administration ’s midnight timetable for its OCS ( outer continental shelf ) drilling plan and create our own timeline , ” Salazar said today at Department of Interior headquarters .
The Bush plan – that did n’t publish in the Federal Register ( pdf ) until January 21st , the day after he left office – established March 23 , 2009 as the deadline for public comment .
Salazar felt that shortened time frame for public review was insufficient and did not serve the best interests of taxpayers expecting wise decisions on offshore energy development .
Better information
Salazar also cited a unacceptable lack of current information and analysis of the resources available offshore :
“ In the biggest area that the Bush Administration ’s draft OCS plan proposes for oil and gas drilling – the Atlantic seaboard , from Maine to Florida – our data on available resources is very thin , and what little we have is twenty to thirty years old , ” he said .
“ We should n’t make decisions to sell off taxpayer resources based on old information . ”
Incorporating renewable energy development
“ The Bush Administration was so intent on opening new areas for oil and gas offshore that it torpedoed offshore renewable energy efforts , ” Salazar said .
To remedy the “ headlong rush ” to develop oil and gas at the expense of renewable energy development , Salazar says he will “ build a framework ” to incorporate development of wind , wave , and ocean current energy , along with oil and gas , into a comprehensive energy plan .
Oil and gas developers not amused
Not surprisingly , oil and gas interests are upset with Salazar ’s announcement .
Barry Russell , chief executive of the Independent Petroleum Association of America , accused Salazar of imposing an “ unnecessary delay ” .
There is concern amongst some environmental advocacy groups that Salazar has said he will not intervene on the sale of exploration and drilling rights off the Virgina coast , but most have praised Salazar ’s overall approach for extended review on development of the outer continental shelf .
In a press statement , Sierra Club Public Lands Director Athan Manuel said :
“ Energy independence and jobs will be won by investing in clean energy , not by handing over our coasts to the oil industry .
The Obama administration clearly understands that .
President Bush ’s last - minute offshore drilling plan could have been written by oil industry executives .
It was not based on science , was not subject to public review , did not consider the best interest of coastal communities , and ignored clean energy options .
Revising this drilling plan is an important first step in getting our new energy economy on track . ”
Next steps
The U.S. Geological Survey , the Minerals Management Service , and other government scientists are directed to assemble all the information available on both conventional and renewable offshore resources , including the potential impacts of those resources .
The report is due in 45 days .
From there the Interior Department will determine where the information gaps are and create a plan for gathering data to fill those gaps .
The task of gathering and updating information is a formidable one – the Interior Department oversees more than 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf – but it is crucial for building a comprehensive energy plan that “ takes us to the new energy frontier and secures our energy independence , ” Salazar said .
“ We must embrace President Obama ’s vision of energy independence for the sake of our national security , our economic security , and our environmental security . ”

The panel is set to recommend downgrading ecstasy this week
The home secretary has told MPs she was " surprised " and " disappointed " by a drugs adviser likening the dangers of ecstasy to the dangers of horse riding .
Jacqui Smith said Prof David Nutt had " trivialised " the dangers of the drug .
She said she had told him he had gone beyond his role as head of the Advisory Council on Drugs Misuse .
Ms Smith said Prof Nutt had apologised , but he later defended his comparison , saying it had been " useful " in showing the risks associated with taking drugs .
' Not much difference '
The council , which advises the government , is expected later this week to recommend that ecstasy be downgraded from a class A drug to a class B one .
Ministers have outlined their opposition to any such move .
I 'm sure most people would simply not accept the link that he makes up in his article between horse riding and illegal drug taking
Jacqui Smith , home secretary Professor Nutt 's article , published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology last week , said : " Drug harm can be equal to harms in other parts of life .
There is not much difference between horse - riding and ecstasy . "
He said horse - riding accounted for more than 100 deaths a year , and went on : " This attitude raises the critical question of why society tolerates - indeed encourages - certain forms of potentially harmful behaviour but not others such as drug use . "
Ecstasy use is linked to around 30 deaths a year , up from 10 a year in the early 1990s .
Fatalities are caused by massive organ failure from overheating or the effects of drinking too much water .
Speaking during Home Office questions in the House of Commons , Ms Smith said : " I 've spoken to him this morning about his comments .
I 've told him that I was surprised and profoundly disappointed by the article reported . "
She added : " I 'm sure most people would simply not accept the link that he makes up in his article between horse riding and illegal drug taking .
" For me that makes light of a serious problem , trivialises the dangers of drugs , shows insensitivity to the families of victims of ecstasy and sends the wrong message to young people about the dangers of drugs . "
' Wrecks lives '
Ms Smith also said : " I made clear to Professor Nutt that I felt his comments went beyond the scientific advice that I expect of him as the chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
" He apologised to me for his comments and I 've asked him to apologise to the families of the victims of ecstasy . "
However , Prof Nutt later said : " I was doing a statistical comparison .
There is a view - and the home secretary takes this view - that you cannot make a comparison and it is misleading because some things are legal and other things are illegal . "
He added : " I think there are a significant number of people who agree with me as well that these kinds of comparisons are useful . "
The comparison was useful " so people who take drugs can understand what the risks were " , he said .
Prof Nutt added : " I certainly did n't intend to cause offence to the victims of ecstasy or their families .
One death is one too many . "
Conservative MP Laurence Robertson said ecstasy " not only wrecks lives , and ends lives , but also fuels crime " .
He argued that drug use and horse riding were " completely incomparable " and that Prof Nutt was in the " wrong job " .
But , in questions to the House of Commons Speaker , Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris said Prof Nutt was a " distinguished scientist " and asked whether it was " right to criticise him here when he cannot answer back for what is set out in a scientific publication " .
He added : " What 's the future for scientific independence if she [ Ms Smith ] asks that scientists apologise for their views ? "
Speaker Michael Martin replied that it was a " parliamentary privilege " for the home secretary to make such remarks and that " of course " she would be allowed to do so .
The Advisory Council on Drugs Misuse has distanced itself from the comments in Prof Nutt 's article .

Just as Michigan is scrambling to retrain laid - off auto workers , New York City officials have come up with a plan to find new work for the unemployed from one of its core industries : financial services .
Under a program unveiled on Wednesday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , the city wants to invest $ 45 million in government money to retrain investment bankers , traders and others who have lost jobs on Wall Street , as well as provide seed capital and office space for new businesses those laid - off bankers might create .
The plan is intended to stem a potential exodus of banking professionals from the city during the restructuring of the financial services industry , which has been the city ’s economic engine for decades , and to speed the industry ’s recovery , which will take at least several years , officials said .
City officials also plan to try to lure big banks and financial companies from Asia and elsewhere to set up operations in New York , filling some of the void created by the implosion of large American firms like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns .
They hope the federal and state governments will let them use $ 30 million in federal money to attract those companies and other financial firms to Lower Manhattan .
Cryonic Suspension James H. Bedford is the first person known to have been placed in a state of cryonic suspension under controlled conditions .
This event occurred in 1967 after a physician certified his death .
Decades later his body remains in a hypothermic ( supercooled ) condition within a liquid nitrogen cylinder .
Decades from now , perhaps he will be the first person to be resuscitated after this episode of biostasis , or what earlier generations called suspended animation .
This hope is what led Bedford to arrange for cryonic suspension as an alternative to cremation and burial .
Why Cryonic Suspension ?
Through the centuries some people have accepted the inevitability of death while others have devoted themselves to finding ways of prolonging life or , even better , living forever .
These efforts have included bizarre and dangerous practices compounded of superstition and magic , but also increasingly effective public health measures that have resulted in a significant increase in life expectancy throughout much of the world .
The cryonics approach is intended to take another step .
It asks the question : Because biomedical science has already accomplished so much , why should humankind assume that people still have to die and stay dead ?
The case for cryonics made its public debut with Robert C. W. Ettinger 's best - selling book , The Prospect of Immortality ( 1966 ) .
He notes that in the past many people have died of disorders and diseases that have since become treatable .
Medical advances are continuing , which means that people are still being buried or cremated even though their present fatal condition will eventually be healed .
People should therefore give themselves the chance for a renewed and healthy life .
This can be accomplished by immediately taking measures to preserve the " dead " body until such time as a curative procedure has been devised .
The body would then be resuscitated from its state of suspended animation and the restorative procedure would be applied .
From Ettinger 's perspective , it is better to be alive than dead and human beings have the right to self - preservation .
Furthermore , because so many gains have already been made in extending human life , it would be foolish to stop .
The Process of Cryonic Suspension
How it is done has changed somewhat in detail over the years , but still requires the following basic elements :
An adult who has consented to the procedure .
Financial provision for the services to be performed .
A physician and hospital willing to allow the procedure to be done .
Prompt certification of death ( to limit postmortem deterioration ) .
Injection of cryoprotective fluid ( composed of liquid nitrogen ) to replace water and other body fluids .
This fluid is disseminated throughout the body with a heart - lung pump .
Technicians continue to monitor temperature and other signs .
Bathing in a deep cooling bath until the desired temperature ( about – 79 ° centigrade ) is reached .
Placement inside a sealed bag that is then immersed in a storage vessel filled with liquid nitrogen .
The supercooled temperature is maintained indefinitely .
A cure for the individual 's once - fatal disease or condition is discovered by medical science .
The body is removed from storage and carefully warmed .
The condition that had resulted in the person's " death " is healed and life begins anew .
Critical Response Many criticisms have been made regarding the process of cryonic suspension .
There is no dispute about the general proposition that refrigeration and freezing can preserve organic materials .
A variety of industrial , research , and medical procedures rely upon this phenomenon .
There has been some success in thawing out tissues and organs from liquid nitrogen storage .
All of this , though , is a long way from resuscitating a person and , especially , the complex and fragile human brain upon which memory and personality appear to depend .
The engineering and biomedical sciences have not come close enough to inspire confidence that such a feat could be accomplished at any foreseeable point in the future .
In addition to the limited state of success , other significant criticisms include : ( 1 ) Much tissue loss and damage occur whenever there are deviations from the ideal situation ; for example , certification of death is delayed ; medical or other authorities prove uncooperative ; equipment or human failure is involved in carrying out the first crucial procedures ; ( 2 ) ice formation will damage cells and tissues despite protective efforts ; and ( 3 ) additional extensive damage will occur during the attempted resuscitation process .
Many neuroscientists doubt that an intact and functional human brain can survive both the freezing and the rewarming processes , even if the neural structures had not suffered irreversible damage at the time of death .
The reasons for cryonic suspension have been criticized on moral and practical grounds .
Some hold that it is immoral to defy God 's will by reaching back over the life / death border .
Others focus on the prospect of cryonics becoming one more elitist advantage .
While some people barely have the necessities for a hard life , others would enjoy the unfair opportunity to play another round .
A related criticism is that an already overcrowded world would be subject to an increased growth in population .
Additional misgivings are expressed by questions such as :
What will happen to marriage , remarriage , and family structure in general if the dead are not necessarily dead ?
How will people be able to go on with their lives ?
How could loved ones complete — or even begin — their recovery from grief and mourning ?
What formidable problems in adjustment would occur when a " Rip Van Winkle on Ice " returns after many years to a changed society ?
Will people become less motivated and more careless with their " first lives " if they expect to have encore appearances ?
Conclusions
As of 2001 , there have been no known attempts at resuscitation because cryonicists judge that the technology has not yet been perfected .
Since the 1980s there has been a trend to preserve only the head .
The theory behind these " neuro " preparations is that ( a ) this form of storage is less expensive and ( b ) science will eventually make it possible to grow a new body from DNA .
More conservative cryonicists , however , continue to favor the whole - body approach .
Even more recently there have been announcements that future efforts will switch from cryonic storage to vitrification — converting body tissue to a glasslike stone material .
Advocates ( including at least one cryonic suspension organization ) believe vitrification would avoid the tissue damage associated with freezing and resuscitation .
There are no known previous examples of vitrification having been applied above the level of isolated tissues and organs .
Along with the big question — Could cryonic suspension ever work ? — there is also the unanswered question :
Why in America 's high technology society have the cryonic storage vessels received fewer than a hundred people since 1967 ?
At present , cryonic suspension remains a controversial and seldom end - of - life option .
Future prospects are difficult to predict .

I am very , very excited … today the team found something I really hoped they would – a piece of bone from a genuine monster .
Haast ’s eagle ( Harpagornis moorei ) was the largest bird of prey that ever existed on Planet Earth – an enormous raptor with a wingspan pushing 3 metres ( that ’s 10 feet ) and claws the size of a tiger ’s ( around 75 mm or 3 inches long ) .
Actually they were basically flying tigers in a way – top of the food chain predators that hunted and killed another giant New Zealand bird – the moa .
The largest moas were over 3 metres tall and weighed around 250 kg , yet they were easy prey for Haast ’s Eagle – enormous moa pelvis bones have been found with twin sets of claw marks in them – proof that Haast ’s Eagle could take down anything that walked through the forests of New Zealand – including people .
The giant eagles must have terrified the first people to land on these shores , especially since there would have been nothing even remotely like them back in the islands of Polynesia .
Those early settlers must have quite literally not known what hit them .
I found a clip of a BBC documentary called “ Monsters We Met ” on Youtube that paints a pretty vivid picture of what life must have been like sharing a forest with one of these giant predators : Haast ’s Eagle attack
This is a longer version of the clip , which for some reason is dubbed in Spanish and English at the same time – a bit distracting but you get the general idea :
Scary stuff !
We all like to go out into the bush when we can and soak in the beauty and tranquility of New Zealand ’s wilderness , but 700 years ago , when people were living at Wairau Bar , the forest must have had a very different atmosphere – people would probably never go anywhere in the bush by themselves , and must have always felt like any second one of these flying monsters was going to swoop down and smash into them at 80 kilometres an hour with eight razor sharp claws .
Actually there ’s a story about these giant eagles in the Wairau Bar area that has been passed down through the generations of the Rangitane people .
Richard Bradley , the Rangitane representative here at the excavations , told it to me :
When people first arrived in this area , a terrible flying taniwha called Ngarara Huarau began to attack them and carry men women and children off to their deaths .
A chief named Rongoimai Papa was determined to kill the monster , so his people could safely settle in the area .
Rongoimai and a group of his warriors hid in a cave in a small bay just around the coast from here , and enticed the taniwha / giant eagle into landing in the narrow cove .
Once it was on the ground ( presumably feeding on some kind of bait they had left ) the warriors charged out of the cave and Rongaimai broke the taniwha ’s wing with his mere ( club ) .
Once the creature was crippled , it was swiftly beaten to death , and when its belly was slit open all the taonga ( treasures ) of the people it had carried away were revealed .
It ’s feathers were ripped out , and they turned into a special kind of eel found only in this region .
With the dangerous monster vanquished , Rongoimai was able to safely build a pa and people could once more walk around without fear of attack from the sky .
If you ’d never heard of the giant Haast ’s Eagle , you might be tempted to dismiss this story as just a myth , but like many of these old Maori stories , there is no doubt an element of truth to it .
When the first people arrived in New Zealand , around 700 years ago , there WERE flying taniwha that killed and ate people !
And I would think the only way to kill one would be to get it on the ground when it ’s at it ’s most vulnerable .
What makes this story even more amazing is today we found a taniwha bone !
You can imagine that the remains of these flying taniwha were considered valuable items – by possessing the fearsome creature ’s bones , a person would absorb it ’s power and mana .
The bone we found is part of the ulna , or wing bone , which has been deliberately snapped off and begun to be crafted into an awl – a tool for punching holes in things .
Bones like this were found at Wairau Bar during the original excavations in the 1940 ’s , all similarly crafted .
I ’m secretly hoping we ’ll find something like a claw , or even a skull , but I ’m not holding my breath .
Like all large predators such as tigers or Great White sharks , Haast ’s eagle was probably never very common – by one estimate there were only around 1,000 of them when people arrived on these shores , and they only ever lived in the South Island .
Once an even more efficient hunter arrived in New Zealand – the human – and began to compete for the eagle ’s main food , moas , the flying taniwha quickly became extinct , fading from the physical world into a realm of myth and legend .
If you ’re interested in finding out more about Haast ’s Eagle ( and you should be ! ) try here , here and here .
Only three complete skeletons have ever been found , all in natural rather than cultural sites – Te Papa and Otago Museum both have them on display .

PS keep an eye on the TV news tonight – we ’re having a media open day , and there will be crews from TV1 , TV3 , Prime and Maori TV filming at the excavation site .
Here 's a sad one : the Google Maps car took out a baby deer , and it recorded the entire process for all Google Maps users to see .
For shame , Google Maps car !

As you follow the street view scene down Five Points Road in Rush , NY , you can see the deer run out in front of the car , get hit and then see it on the side of the road before the car pulls over .
And that 's the end of the Street View data for Five Points Road .
Google Maps is recording real life , guys .
And yes , the Five Points joke kind of writes itself , does n't it ?

The latest feature release Git v2.0.0 is now available at the
usual places .
We had to delay the final release by a week or so because we found a
few problems in earlier release candidates ( request - pull had a
regression that stopped it from showing the “ tags / ” prefix in
“ Please pull tags / frotz ” when the user asked to compose a request
for frotz to be pulled ; a code path in git - gui to support ancient
versions of Git incorrectly triggered for Git 2.0 ) , which we had to
fix in an extra unplanned release candidate .
Hopefully the next cycle will become shorter , as topics that have
been cooking on the next branch had extra time to mature , so it
all evens out in the end ;-) .
The tarballs are found at :
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/testing/
The following public repositories all have a copy of the v2.0.0
tag and the master branch that the tag points at :

Git v2.0 Release Notes
Backward compatibility notes
When “ git push [ $ there ] ” does not say what to push , we have used the
traditional “ matching ” semantics so far ( all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there ) .
In Git 2.0 , the default is now the “ simple ” semantics ,
which pushes :
only the current branch to the branch with the same name , and only
when the current branch is set to integrate with that remote
branch , if you are pushing to the same remote as you fetch from ; or
only the current branch to the branch with the same name , if you
are pushing to a remote that is not where you usually fetch from .
You can use the configuration variable “ push.default ” to change
this .
If you are an old - timer who wants to keep using the
“ matching ” semantics , you can set the variable to “ matching ” , for
example .
Read the documentation for other possibilities .
When “ git add - u ” and “ git add - A ” are run inside a subdirectory
without specifying which paths to add on the command line , they
operate on the entire tree for consistency with “ git commit - a ” and
other commands ( these commands used to operate only on the current
subdirectory ) .
Say “ git add -u . ” or “ git add - A . ” if you want to
limit the operation to the current directory .
“ git add < path > ” is the same as “ git add - A < path > ” now , so that
“ git add dir / ” will notice paths you removed from the directory and
record the removal .
In older versions of Git , “ git add < path > ” used
to ignore removals .
You can say “ git add –ignore - removal < path > ” to
add only added or modified paths in < path > , if you really want to .
The “ - q ” option to “ git diff - files ” , which does NOT mean “ quiet ” ,
has been removed ( it told Git to ignore deletion , which you can do
with “ git diff - files – diff - filter=d ” ) .
“ git request - pull ” lost a few “ heuristics ” that often led to mistakes .
The default prefix for “ git svn ” has changed in Git 2.0 .
For a long
time , “ git svn ” created its remote - tracking branches directly under
refs / remotes , but it now places them under refs / remotes / origin / unless
it is told otherwise with its “ –prefix ” option .
Updates since v1.9 series
UI , Workflows & Features
The “ multi- mail ” post - receive hook ( in contrib / ) has been updated
to a more recent version from upstream .
The “ remote - hg / bzr ” remote - helper interfaces ( used to be in
contrib / ) are no more .
They are now maintained separately as
third - party plug-ins in their own repositories .
“ git gc –aggressive ” learned “ –depth ” option and
“ gc.aggressiveDepth ” configuration variable to allow use of a less
insane depth than the built - in default value of 250 .
“ git log ” learned the “ –show - linear - break ” option to show where a
single strand - of - pearls is broken in its output .
The “ rev- parse – parseopt ” mechanism used by scripted Porcelains to
parse command - line options and to give help text learned to take
the argv-help ( the placeholder string for an option parameter ,
e.g. “ key - id ” in “ –gpg- sign= < key -id > ” ) .
The pattern to find where the function begins in C/C used in
" diff " and " grep - p " has been updated to improve viewing C
sources .
“ git rebase ” learned to interpret a lone “ - ” as “ @{ - 1} ” , the
branch that we were previously on .
“ git commit – cleanup= < mode > ” learned a new mode , scissors .
“ git tag –list ” output can be sorted using “ version sort ” with
“ –sort=version : refname ” .
Discard the accumulated “ heuristics ” to guess from which branch the
result wants to be pulled from and make sure that what the end user
specified is not second - guessed by “ git request - pull ” , to avoid
mistakes .
When you pushed out your master branch to your public
repository as for - linus , use the new “ master : for - linus ” syntax to
denote the branch to be pulled .
“ git grep ” learned to behave in a way similar to native grep when
“ - h ” ( no header ) and “ - c ” ( count ) options are given .
“ git push ” via transport - helper interface has been updated to
allow forced ref updates in a way similar to the natively
supported transports .
The “ simple ” mode is the default for “ git push ” .
“ git add - u ” and “ git add - A ” , when run without any pathspec , is a
tree - wide operation even when run inside a subdirectory of a
working tree .
“ git add < path > ” is the same as “ git add - A < path > ” now .
“ core.statinfo ” configuration variable , which is a
never - advertised synonym to “ core.checkstat ” , has been removed .
The “ - q ” option to “ git diff - files ” , which does NOT mean
“ quiet ” , has been removed ( it told Git to ignore deletion , which
you can do with “ git diff - files – diff - filter=d ” ) .
Server operators can loosen the “ tips of refs only ” restriction for
the remote archive service with the uploadarchive .
allowUnreachable
configuration option .
The progress indicators from various time - consuming commands have
been marked for i18n /l10n .
“ git notes - C < blob > ” diagnoses as an error an attempt to use an
object that is not a blob .
“ git config ” learned to read from the standard input when “ - ” is
given as the value to its “ –file ” parameter ( attempting an
operation to update the configuration in the standard input is
rejected , of course ) .
Trailing whitespaces in .gitignore files , unless they are quoted
for fnmatch ( 3 ) , e.g. “ path\ “ , are warned and ignored .
Strictly
speaking , this is a backward - incompatible change , but very unlikely
to bite any sane user and adjusting should be obvious and easy .
Many commands that create commits , e.g. “ pull ” and “ rebase ” ,
learned to take the “ –gpg- sign ” option on the command line .
“ git commit ” can be told to always GPG sign the resulting commit
by setting the “ commit.gpgsign ” configuration variable to “ true ”
( the command - line option “ –no - gpg- sign ” should override it ) .
“ git pull ” can be told to only accept fast - forward by setting the
new “ pull.ff ” configuration variable .
“ git reset ” learned the “ - N ” option , which does not reset the index
fully for paths the index knows about but the tree-ish the command
resets to does not ( these paths are kept as intend - to - add entries ) .
Performance , Internal Implementation , etc .
The compilation options to port to AIX and to MSVC have been
updated .
We started using wildmatch ( ) in place of fnmatch ( 3 ) a few releases
ago ; complete the process and stop using fnmatch ( 3 ) .
Uses of curl ’s “ multi ” interface and “ easy ” interface do not mix
well when we attempt to reuse outgoing connections .
Teach the RPC
over HTTP code , used in the smart HTTP transport , not to use the
“ easy ” interface .
The bitmap - index feature from JGit has been ported , which should
significantly improve performance when serving objects from a
repository that uses it .
The way “ git log –cc ” shows a combined diff against multiple
parents has been optimized .
The prefixcmp ( ) and suffixcmp ( ) functions are gone .
Use
starts_with ( ) and ends_with ( ) , and also consider if skip_prefix ( )
suits your needs better when using the former .
Also contains various documentation updates and code clean - ups .
Many
of them came from flurry of activities as GSoC candidate microproject
exercises .
Fixes since v1.9 series
Unless otherwise noted , all the fixes since v1.9 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release ( see the maintenance releases ’
notes for details ) .
“ git p4 ” was broken in 1.9 release to deal with changes in binary
files .
( merge 749b668 cl / p4 - use - diff - tree later to maint ) .
The shell prompt script ( in contrib / ) , when using the PROMPT_COMMAND
interface , used an unsafe construct when showing the branch name in
$ PS1 .
( merge 1e4119c8 rh/ prompt - pcmode - avoid - eval - on - refname later to maint ) .
“ git rebase ” used a POSIX shell construct FreeBSD ’s / bin / sh does not
work well with .
( merge 8cd6596 km / avoid- non-function - return -in-rebase later to maint ) .
zsh prompt ( in contrib / ) leaked unnecessary error messages .
Bash completion ( in contrib / ) did not complete the refs and remotes
correctly given “ git pu< TAB > ” when “ pu ” is aliased to “ push ” .
Some more Unicode code points , defined in Unicode 6.3 as having zero
width , have been taught to our display column counting logic .
( merge d813ab9 tb/unicode - 6.3 - zero- width later to maint ) .
Some tests used shell constructs that did not work well on FreeBSD
( merge ff7a1c6 km / avoid - bs - in - shell - glob later to maint ) .
( merge 00764 ca km / avoid - cp - a later to maint ) .
“ git update - ref – stdin ” did not fail a request to create a ref
when the ref already existed .
( merge b9d56b5 mh/update - ref-batch - create - fix later to maint ) .
“ git diff –no - index - Mq a b ” fell into an infinite loop .
( merge ad1c3 fb jc / fix - diff - no - index - diff - opt - parse later to maint ) .
“ git fetch – prune ” , when the right - hand side of multiple fetch
refspecs overlap ( e.g. storing “ refs/heads / ” to
“ refs/remotes / origin / “ , while storing “ refs / frotz / ” to
“ refs/remotes/origin/ fr / “ ) , aggressively thought that lack of
“ refs / heads / fr/otz ” on the origin site meant we should remove
“ refs/remotes/origin / fr /otz ” from us , without checking their
“ refs / frotz / otz ” first .
Note that such a configuration is inherently unsafe ( think what
should happen when “ refs / heads / fr/otz ” does appear on the origin
site ) , but that is not a reason not to be extra careful .
( merge e6f6371 cn/fetch- prune-overlapping-destination later to maint ) .
“ git status – porcelain – branch ” showed its output with labels
“ ahead / behind / gone ” translated to the user ’s locale .
( merge 7a76c28 mm / status - porcelain - format-i18n-fix later to maint ) .
A stray environment variable $ prefix could have leaked into and
affected the behaviour of the “ subtree ” script ( in contrib / ) .
When it is not necessary to edit a commit log message ( e.g. “ git
commit - m ” is given a message without specifying “ - e ” ) , we used to
disable the spawning of the editor by overriding GIT_EDITOR , but
this means all the uses of the editor , other than to edit the
commit log message , are also affected .
( merge b549be0 bp / commit - p-editor later to maint ) .
“ git mv ” that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to update
its configuration .
( merge fb8a4e8 jk/ mv-submodules - fix later to maint ) .
Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a deep
subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows .
( merge 2f29e0 c mh/ remove - subtree - long - pathname - fix later to maint ) .
The test helper lib-terminal always run an actual test_expect_ *
when included , which screwed up with the use of skil - all that may
have to be done later .
( merge 7e27173 jk/lib- terminal - lazy later to maint ) .
“ git index - pack ” used a wrong variable to name the keep - file in an
error message when the file cannot be written or closed .
( merge de983a0 nd / index - pack - error - message later to maint ) .
“ rebase - i ” produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a commit
happened to contain
( or ended with \c ) due to a careless use
of echo .
( merge cb1aefd us / printf - not - echo later to maint ) .
There were a few instances of git - foo remaining in the
documentation that should have been spelled git foo .
( merge 3c3e6f5 rr/doc - merge - strategies later to maint ) .
Serving objects from a shallow repository needs to write a
new file to hold the temporary shallow boundaries , but it was not
cleaned when we exit due to die ( ) or a signal .
( merge 7839632 jk/ shallow - update - fix later to maint ) .
When “ git stash pop ” stops after failing to apply the stash
( e.g. due to conflicting changes ) , the stash is not dropped .
State
that explicitly in the output to let the users know .
( merge 2d4c993 jc / stash - pop - not - popped later to maint ) .
The labels in “ git status ” output that describe the nature of
conflicts ( e.g. “ both deleted ” ) were limited to 20 bytes , which was
too short for some l10n ( e.g. fr ) .
( merge c7cb333 jn/wt- status later to maint ) .
“ git clean - d pathspec ” did not use the given pathspec correctly
and ended up cleaning too much .
( merge 1f2e108 jk / clean - d- pathspec later to maint ) .
“ git difftool ” misbehaved when the repository is bound to the
working tree with the “ .git file ” mechanism , where a textual file
“ .git ” tells us where it is .
( merge fcfec8 b da / difftool - git - files later to maint ) .
“ git push ” did not pay attention to “ branch .*. pushremote ” if it is
defined earlier than “ remote.pushdefault ” ; the order of these two
variables in the configuration file should not matter , but it did
by mistake .
( merge 98b406 f jk/remote-pushremote-config-reading later to maint ) .
Code paths that parse timestamps in commit objects have been
tightened .
( merge f80d1f9 jk / commit - dates - parsing - fix later to maint ) .
“ git diff – external - diff ” incorrectly fed the submodule directory
in the working tree to the external diff driver when it knew that it
is the same as one of the versions being compared .
( merge aba4727 tr/diff - submodule - no- reuse - worktree later to maint ) .
“ git reset ” needs to refresh the index when working in a working
tree ( it can also be used to match the index to the HEAD in an
otherwise bare repository ) , but it failed to set up the working
tree properly , causing GIT_WORK_TREE to be ignored .
( merge b7756d4 nd/reset- setup - worktree later to maint ) .
“ git check - attr ” when working on a repository with a working tree
did not work well when the working tree was specified via the
“ –work - tree ” ( and obviously with “ –git - dir ” ) option .
( merge cdbf623 jc / check - attr - honor - working - tree later to maint ) .
“ merge - recursive ” was broken in 1.7.7 era and stopped working in
an empty ( temporary ) working tree , when there are renames
involved .
This has been corrected .
( merge 6e2068a bk/ refresh - missing -ok - in-merge-recursive later to maint . )
“ git rev-parse ” was loose in rejecting command - line arguments
that do not make sense , e.g. “ –default ” without the required
value for that option .
( merge a43219 f ds / rev-parse - required - args later to maint . )
“ include.path ” variable ( or any variable that expects a path that
can use \ ~username expansion ) in the configuration file is not a
boolean , but the code failed to check it .
( merge 67beb60 jk / config - path - include - fix later to maint . )
Commands that take pathspecs on the command line misbehaved when
the pathspec is given as an absolute pathname ( which is a
practice not particularly encouraged ) that points at a symbolic
link in the working tree .
( merge 6127 ff6 mw / symlinks later to maint . )
“ git diff –quiet — pathspec1 pathspec2 ” sometimes did not return
the correct status value .
( merge f34b205 nd / diff - quiet - stat - dirty later to maint . )
Attempting to deepen a shallow repository by fetching over smart
HTTP transport failed in the protocol exchange , when the no-done
extension was used .
The fetching side waited for the list of
shallow boundary commits after the sending side stopped talking to
it .
( merge 0232852 nd/http- fetch - shallow - fix later to maint . )
Allow “ git cmd path / ” , when the path is where a submodule is
bound to the top - level working tree , to match path , despite the
extra and unnecessary trailing slash ( such a slash is often
given by command - line completion ) .
( merge 2e70c01 nd/submodule -pathspec -ending - with - slash later to maint . )
Documentation and in - code comments had many instances of mistaken
use of “ nor ” , which have been corrected .
( merge 235e8d5 jl / nor - or - nand - and later to maint ) .
Junio C Hamano wrote on 28 May 2014
Kevin Martin , the Chair of the Federal Communications Commission , called Ars Technica today to let us know that he has revised his proposal to roll out a free ( and smut - free ) wireless broadband service .
In an effort to corral more votes , Martin has already circulated a new version of the plan , one that removes the controversial smut filtering requirement .
Why the change ?
" I 'm saying if this is a problem for people , let 's take it away , " Martin said .
" A lot of public interest advocates have said they would support this , but were concerned about the filter .
Well , now there 's an item in front of the Commissioners and it no longer has the filter .
And I 've already voted for it without the filter now .
So it 's already got one vote . "
" Got anybody else ? " I asked him .
" Not yet , " Martin admitted with a chuckle .
Then he expressed a bit of impatience with his four colleagues .
" This is an item that has been pending at the Commission for several years , that the Commissioners were originally critical of not having moved forward faster , " he said .
" Other Commissioners said , ' We 're overdue ; we 've got to do this . '
But when an actual item is put forth where you have to make a hard decision , they say , ' Well , I 'm not so sure what I want to do anymore ' . "
Lifeline broadband
As we have been reporting for some time , the FCC 's outgoing boss has been championing a proposal to auction off a hefty chunk of the Advanced Wireless Services 3 band ( 2155-2180 M
Hz ) for a free service that ( until now ) was to come complete with smut filtering .
The license winner would be required to offer the service at a minimum 768 Kpbs ; it 's obviously not the fastest rate in town , but it meets the FCC 's new and improved definition of " basic " broadband .
The provider will have to honor a Carterfone - style rule that allows any application or device to connect to the network , and the license will last for ten years , with ten - year renewal periods .
The licensee must roll out coverage to half of the US population within four years and reach 95 percent of the country by the end of the first decade .
What Martin calls a " lifeline broadband service " certainly has its supporters , but it has had plenty of detractors , too , including the wireless industry , the Bush administration , key Republicans in the House of Representatives , and civil liberties advocates who have all but called the scheme government - sanctioned censorship .
But Public Knowledge , Consumers Union , and the Media Access Project , among other groups , have suggested that the basic idea , sans filtering and bolstered by stronger open access requirements , has potential .
" We appreciate the potential of a new service that could provide a genuine alternative to the current wireline cable modem / DSL duopoly , " they have written .
Martin wanted the FCC to vote on this issue at an Open Commission meeting scheduled for December 18 but then bowed to Congressional calls for its cancellation .
The FCC is scheduled to meet via audio conference on Tuesday , but there are no agenda items attached to the event .
That will be Republican Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate 's last meeting .
" Tate was one of the Commissioners who I thought was most likely to be supportive of the filtering concept , " said Martin .
" She 's been very involved in children 's issues and I think that she had spoken favorably in the past of this idea of the filter for children . "
The filter concept is history now .
As for the revised proposal , the agency is scheduling another Open Commission meeting for January 15 .
That may very well be Kevin Martin 's final formal FCC appearance , and we have no word yet on what dockets will come up during the meeting .
" Typically in January all the Commission does is do reports on the status of the industry , " Martin said .
" That 's what we 've done for the last few years , saying ' Here 's what the Commission has been trying to achieve .
Here 's where we are ' . "
But the Commissioners could give the go - ahead to the re-smuttified free broadband plan at any time — assuming Martin gets at least two more votes for his new proposal , and gets them quick .
Barack Obama wo n't be taking the mantle of Zune Brother No. 1 from Bill Gates after all .
In a stunning reaction that suggests the President - elect 's ability to quickly turn around difficult public relations problems , an advisor has officially rejected the earlier suggestion that he used a Zune as his primary music player .
Instead , he clarified Obama 's position as an Apple fan and an owner of an iPod , which he most often uses when working out .
It is a crushing blow to Zune fans everywhere .
Judging by the hosannas of gratification they bestowed upon the President - elect in the hours following the initial report , the jilted fans might end up inconsolable and might need a hand walking the streets .
Some had even suggested that his use of the Microsoft player was the beginning of new era of ' bipodinsanship ' and others were predicting a new rise in the player 's popularity : " Look at what President Reagan did to the sales of jelly beans !
This is great news ! ” said one excited forum commenter .
Linuxlsrjd said in a twitter post : " 2day has been a good day .
I found out Obama n sum1 in my Hist group use a zune . . .
Woot ! "
But in hindsight , the saddest one comes from notorious twitter user MSWindows : " Barack Obama Uses a Zune .
Who is the Maverick now ? "
While news of the Obama response is too new to determine the reaction from the Zune lovers , we still expect it to be healthier than that of the Apple fanboys who needlessly and immediately mocked the President - elect when the initial Zunegate allegations were reported .
Many shocked Apple fans went to their forums and unleashed their customary vitriol , with some of them demanding an apology from the President - elect while others vowed to uncover any other questionable decisions of taste .
Unfortunately , it appears that some of these quests have already proven successful .
Some Apple fans have uncovered fake - looking pictures of Obama buying or endorsing second rate products all over the land .
Check them out after the jump and make your own decision .
As for us , we 're still standing firm behind last year 's Zune Vs. iPod Smackdown decision and think that the President - elect can use whatever he wants as his music player of choice , as long as he beats the economic recession , kicks the car industry in the behind , and occasionally challenges Heads of State to games of twenty - one .

“ The reality is , we ’re seeing conditions in home construction and home finance that are the worst since the Depression , ” said Steve Fritts , associate director of risk management policy at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government agency that insures bank deposits .
Life has been difficult for large publicly traded home - building companies as well , where stock prices have collapsed and construction sharply cut back .
Yet for now , many of the public companies can meet their obligations .
“ They ’re better capitalized and they have cash on hand , ” said Ivy Zelman , a housing analyst .
“ They ’re in a much better position than the private builders . ”
No hard count exists of precisely how many builders have gone out of business since the downturn began .
According to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders , at least 20,000 builders  about a fifth of the total nationwide  have closed up shop in the last two years .
With the industry still owing hundreds of billions of dollars in loans made at the market peak , many more face insolvency in the coming months and years .
“ Probably north of 50 percent will fail , ” Ms. Zelman said .
Much of that borrowed money went to finance land deals that now appear to have been catastrophic miscalculations .
In cities like Phoenix , where housing starts are near record lows , demand for undeveloped land has plummeted , and prices have followed .
As defaults and delinquencies rise , home builders , once prized banking customers , have become pariahs .
Even builders who are up to date on their interest payments or still managing to sell houses are getting trampled , as in the case of Mr. Brown .
Surely you ’ve heard about BPA by now .
It ’s everywhere .
Some 7 billion pounds of it were produced in 2007 .
It ’s in adhesives , dental fillings , and the linings of food and drink cans .
It ’s a building block for polycarbonate , a near - shatterproof plastic used in cell phones , computers , eyeglasses , drinking bottles , medical devices , and CDs and DVDs .
It ’s also in infant - formula cans and many clear plastic baby bottles .
Studies have shown that it can leach into food and drink , especially when containers are heated or damaged .
More than 90 % of Americans have some in their bodies .

BPA is dangerous to human health .
Or it is not .
That ’s according to two government reports in recent months that came to opposite conclusions .
The National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) , which is part of the National Institutes of Health , reported in September 2008 “ some concern ” that BPA harms the human brain and reproductive system , especially in babies and fetuses .
Yet less than a month earlier , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declared that “ at current levels of exposure ” BPA is safe .
Even after the FDA ’s own science board questioned the rigor of this analysis in late October , the agency did n’t change its position .
Let ’s take a moment to ponder this absurd dichotomy .
How could our nation ’s health watchdogs reach such divergent conclusions ?
Are we being unnecessarily scared by the NTP ?
Or could the FDA be sugarcoating things ?
What exactly is going on ?
We went on a journey to find out .
What we learned was shocking .
To some degree , the BPA controversy is a story about a scientific dispute .
But even more , it ’s about a battle to protect a multibillion - dollar market from regulation .
In the United States , industrial chemicals are presumed safe until proven otherwise .
As a result , the vast majority of the 80,000 chemicals registered to be used in products have never undergone a government safety review .
Companies are left largely to police themselves .
Just five companies make BPA in the United States : Bayer , Dow , Hexion Specialty Chemicals , SABIC Innovative Plastics ( formerly GE Plastics ) , and Sunoco .
Together , they bring in more than $ 6 billion a year from the compound .
Each of them referred questions about BPA ’s safety to their Arlington , Virginia — based trade association , the American Chemistry Council .
“ Our view would be , Well , no , there is n’t anything to be concerned about , ” says Steve Hentges , the council ’s point person on BPA .
“ In a sense , you could have ‘ some concern ’ about just about anything . ” Perhaps .
But consider this :
Of the more than 100 independently funded experiments on BPA , about 90 % have found evidence of adverse health effects at levels similar to human exposure .
On the other hand , every single industry - funded study ever conducted — 14 in all — has found no such effects .
Of the more than 100 independently funded experiments on BPA , about 90 % have found evidence of adverse health effects .
On the other hand , every single industry - funded study ever conducted — 14 in all — has found no such effects .
It is the industry - funded studies that have held sway among regulators .
This is thanks largely to a small group of “ product defense ” consultants — also funded by the chemical industry — who have worked to sow doubt about negative effects of BPA by using a playbook that borrows from the wars over tobacco , asbestos , and other public - health controversies .
A secretive Beltway public - relations consultant .
A government contractor funded by the industries it was hired to assess .
A Harvard research center with a history of conflicts of interest .
These have been the key actors in how the science of BPA has been interpreted by the government .
And it is their work , as much as the science itself , that has stymied regulation .

Raging Hormones
There are a few facts about BPA that everyone agrees on .
One is that people are constantly exposed to the compound .
Babies — particularly those fed canned formula via polycarbonate bottles — are at the highest risk from BPA ; their undeveloped digestive systems metabolize it poorly .
It ’s also undisputed that BPA mimics the female sex hormone estrogen , and that some synthetic estrogens can cause infertility and cancer .
What is in dispute is whether the tiny doses of BPA we ’re exposed to are enough to trigger such hormonal effects .
For decades , the assumption was that they did n’t .
This was based on traditional toxicology , which holds that “ the dose makes the poison . ”
In other words , a threshold exists below which a compound is harmless .
This makes intuitive sense .
Consider alcohol :
The more you drink , the drunker you get ; but if you drink just a little — below the threshold — you may not feel anything .
In the 1970s and 1980s , government scientists used standard toxicology to test BPA .
They concluded that , at doses far higher than those found in humans , it may cause organ failure , leukemia , and severe weight loss .
Yet as BPA products have made their way into every part of our lives , biologists have discovered evidence that very low doses may have a completely different set of effects — on the endocrine system , which influences human development , metabolism , and behavior .
At first , these discoveries emerged by accident , when test tubes and petri dishes in laboratories were switched from glass to plastic .
A group of Stanford researchers in 1993 found that breast - cancer cells it was studying reacted with a mysterious estrogen , which it traced to polycarbonate lab flasks .
A few years later , Patricia Hunt , a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University , discovered abnormalities in the chromosomes of her lab mice .
She eventually concluded that damaged polycarbonate cages were at fault .
In 1995 , a developmental biologist named Frederick vom Saal stepped into the picture .
A tenured professor at the University of Missouri — Columbia , with funding from the National Institutes of Health , vom Saal tested BPA to see how it interacted with samples of human blood .
He found that , because it bypassed mechanisms that control the dose of hormones in the body , its estrogenic effects were magnified .
“ We said , ‘ Wow , that ’s bad .
This stuff should be considered a lot more potent than it is , ’ ” vom Saal recalls .
He then fed small amounts of BPA — 25,000 times lower than the EPA ’s toxic threshold — to pregnant mice .
He discovered that the compound enlarged the prostates of the male offspring , signaling potentially serious developmental disorders .
His study was published in 1997 in the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
In the years since , more than 100 experiments have shown BPA to cause permanent harm in lab animals at the low exposure levels found in humans .
In 2000 , Chandra Gupta , a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh , replicated vom Saal ’s prostate study .
Hunt , the geneticist , replicated under controlled conditions her findings of damage to mouse chromosomes .
Others have found impacts on sperm production , testes development , and mammary - gland tissue , as well as behavioral disorders including hyperactivity , aggressiveness , and impaired learning .
Most recently , scientists found a correlation ( though it ’s impossible to determine causation ) between BPA levels and heart disease and diabetes in humans .

If these low - dose findings were counterintuitive to toxicologists , they made perfect sense to developmental biologists .
After all , BPA is a synthetic hormone .
Any physician knows that at small doses , most hormones are extremely powerful in stimulating their target organs , while at higher doses — above a certain threshold — they can paralyze these same organs .
( Testosterone powers the male sex drive , for instance , but at high doses causes impotence . )
What ’s more , BPA is hardly the only chemical to be identified as an “ endocrine disrupter . ”
To date , more than 50 such compounds have been identified .
Dioxins , PCBs , and DDT are some of the more infamous examples .
Some cosmetics and soft plastic toys contain one or more phthalates — a group of chemicals that interfere with testosterone and have been shown to lead to infertility and cancer .
But because BPA is used in so many common products and has shown effects at such low doses , Hunt says , it quickly became the “ poster - child chemical for these endocrine disrupters . ”
Rats in the Lab
As the evidence against BPA has mounted , some 29 studies have found the opposite : that the compound is safe .
While these experiments have been fewer in number , many of them have the advantage of being far larger in sample size — and thus , their backers say , more statistically significant .
Yet the largest of these studies also have another thing in common :
They have been funded by BPA ’s manufacturers .
Sample size , of course , is n’t the only criterion for judging a study .
There ’s also methodology , lab procedures , and interpretation of data .
And a close look at the big industry - funded studies indicates significant flaws .
One of the first such studies , paid for by the trade group Society of the Plastics Industry , was directed by Stuart Cagen of Shell Chemical Co. ; another was conducted by John Ashby , at the AstraZeneca lab in the U.K .
Both were attempts to replicate vom Saal ’s experiment .
Published in 1999 , the Cagen and Ashby studies gave BPA a clean bill of health .
Independent scientists , though , questioned the findings .
In addition to testing BPA , Cagen and Ashby had tested the chemical DES as a “ positive control ” — a lab procedure to determine if a study is conducted properly .
Although DES is known to harm mice , neither study found any effects from it .
By the definition of a positive control , this indicates the experiments were flawed .
( Cagen declined comment ; Ashby has retired and could not be reached . )
The largest and most influential industry studies have been conducted by Rochelle Tyl of the Research Triangle Institute , a private lab in North Carolina .
Tyl ’s first BPA study , published in 2002 at a cost that Tyl puts at around $ 2 million ( also funded by the Society of the Plastics Industry ) , examined three generations of rats and found no adverse effects at low doses .
Yet here , too , there are questions of protocol .
The study used a rat strain called the CD Sprague - Dawley , which has been shown to be insensitive to synthetic estrogens like BPA .
( A Japanese study found that the CD Sprague - Dawley rat can withstand a dose of synthetic estrogen more than 100 times greater than what a female human can tolerate . )
As of early 2007 , of the 29 studies that have shown no harm due to BPA , 13 have used the CD Sprague - Dawley rat .
Nonetheless , when the FDA declared BPA “ safe ” this fall , it relied almost exclusively on Tyl ’s work — a shortcoming that the agency ’s science board publicly criticized in October .
advertisement
To address criticisms of her first study , Tyl recently completed a follow - up , this time with funding from the American Chemistry Council .
“ It does n’t matter who pays for my studies , ” says Tyl , who denies there has been any industry influence over her experiments .
“ It offends the living bejesus out of me , that I ’m going to alter a study design or a result . ”
The follow - up used mice instead of the CD Sprague - Dawley rat and also found no adverse effects from low - dose BPA .
However , the study ’s details indicate that the mice were fed a type of animal chow that has been shown to mask the effects of estrogens like BPA .
Moreover , according to Tyl ’s own data , the prostates in both her experimental and her control mice were enormous , suggesting that her study had , in fact , shown effects from BPA , or that there were significant flaws in her team ’s lab practices .
Harvard to the Rescue With two pools of warring studies , BPA regulation has hinged on scientific reviews that assess and pass judgment on the overall body of research .
In April 2001 , a select group of scientists received a letter emblazoned with the Harvard University crest inviting them to sit on the first such BPA panel .
The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis ( HCRA ) , a program under the Harvard School of Public Health , would assume “ much of the technical writing responsibilities , ” the letter explained .
In exchange for attending three two - day meetings and reviewing drafts of the panel ’s report , the scientists would be paid $ 12,000 apiece plus expenses .
The letter noted that the Society of the Plastics Industry had commissioned the study and that the panel ’s deliberations would be private .
The letter concluded , “ I assure you it will be a stimulating and productive experience . ”
“ I said , ‘ Great !
This is a Harvard center .
They ’re obviously an honorable bunch , ’ ” recalls one accomplished biologist on the panel , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
What he did n’t know at the time , he says , was that the center has a history of conflicts of interest .
Under founder John D. Graham , a Harvard professor and later administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the George W. Bush White House , the center had solicited funding from companies whose business might be affected by its research .
HCRA ’s donors have included more than 100 corporations , including BPA producers Dow , Shell , and Germany - based BASF , as well as industry associations such as the American Chemistry Council .
“ In the past , HCRA has acted very much like a product - defense group , ” says David Michaels , a Clinton - era Energy Department official and author of the book Doubt Is Their Product .
“ In a 2000 study , paid for by AT&T Wireless , HCRA justified letting motorists talk on their cell phones by arguing that the added productivity outweighs the cost of accidents .
Three years later , in a Harvard - funded study , the same researchers found that not to be true . ”
A more recent example :
In 2005 , the center published a study concluding that “ government advisories on fish consumption and mercury may do more harm than good ” ; the lead researcher did n’t disclose that most of the study ’s $ 500,000 in funding was underwritten by the United States Tuna Foundation .
Back in October 1991 , in a letter to Philip Morris ( obtained through the archives of tobacco - industry files released during litigation and maintained by the University of California , San Francisco ) , Graham demonstrated how HCRA could recast opposition to regulation as concern for the greater good .
In the D.C. debate on fuel - efficiency standards , he noted , “ We have urged consideration of the safety risks associated with smaller vehicles . ”
The letter concluded with an appeal for money and an offer of assistance .
In an internal memo , a Philip Morris executive noted , “ Depending on the ‘ vibes ’ you guys get when you meet Graham , I would also be in favor of PM becoming a contributor to the center . ”

When it came to its BPA review , the Harvard center held several meetings of its panel between summer 2001 and 2002 .
But then the report languished for two years , during which time dozens of studies were released that strengthened the case against BPA , including a human study that linked the compound to ovarian cysts ( a cause of infertility ) .
None of those findings made it into the final report .
Instead , the review , published in the journal Human and Ecological Risk Assessment in 2004 , focused on Tyl ’s research and a few other industry studies that downplayed BPA ’s health concerns .
The review concluded that there is “ no consistent affirmative evidence of low - dose BPA effects . ”
Several members of the 12 - person panel did n’t feel comfortable with the conclusions .
Four removed their names from the study .
One of those scientists , Marvin Meistrich , says , “ I disagreed with the way the final report was prepared . ”
After the panel ’s last meeting , the Harvard center selected additional studies to include in its review — “ ones that tended to demonstrate no effects , ” says Meistrich .
One panel member who did sign the report , Claude Hughes , turned around and less than a year later published a paper with vom Saal in Environmental Health Perspectives ( the NIH ’s premier journal ) that refuted the Harvard center ’s conclusions .
In the end , HCRA paid even the scientists who pulled their names from the review .
The published paper ’s acknowledgments thank them by name for their “ helpful comments and guidance . ”
That , in itself , is a score for BPA ’s defenders :
These scientists have rare specialties that would be vitally important if BPA were to wind up in court .
A judge could rule that they had a conflict of interest .
“ It ’s fairly commonplace for companies facing tort suits to corner the market on experts , making it more difficult for the plaintiff to hire witnesses , ” says Peter Nordberg , a toxic - tort lawyer at Berger & Montague in Philadelphia .
Through a spokesperson , George Gray , the acting director of the Harvard center at the time , declined to comment on the study .
( Shortly after the HCRA review appeared , President George W. Bush appointed him assistant administrator of the EPA . )
For its part , the Harvard School of Public Health distances itself from the center ’s controversial past .
“ HCRA is a much different place since John Graham left [ in 2001 ] , ” says assistant dean Robin Herman .
Graham says that industry - funded studies at the center have always been subject to “ rigorous quality - control procedures . ”
You might expect that a compromised review like this would wither away .
Yet the opposite is true .
The plastics industry still uses it as evidence that BPA is safe .
Journalists and consumers who visit bisphenol - a.org , a site created by the American Chemistry Council , can see that none other than Harvard University has weighed in and pronounced BPA harmless .
For a Few Dollars More

In December 2005 , another review of BPA began , this one spurred by the federal government , not industry .
The National Institutes of Health had started the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction ( CERHR ) , an arm of the National Toxicology Program , in 1998 to study chemicals that might be contributing to alarming trends in the developmental health of Americans .
Infertility and birth defects are up .
Sperm counts are down .
Girls reach puberty earlier .
Breast cancer , prostate cancer , and neurobehavioral conditions such as attention - deficit disorder are mounting .
Soon after the center ’s inception , however , its operations were outsourced to a Beltway consultancy called Sciences International .
For a fee of about $ 1 million a year , Sciences ran the evaluation of roughly 20 chemicals in an eight - year period .
On the surface , Sciences International appeared highly qualified for the task .
Its president and founder was Dr. Elizabeth Anderson , a former government toxicologist who had helped establish the EPA .
She conducted the EPA ’s first studies on carcinogens and later spearheaded its Office of Health and Environmental Assessment .
A 10 - person firm , launched in 1993 , Sciences had analyzed the toxicity of dozens of chemicals for the EPA , the FDA , and other government agencies .
Sciences had also built a robust practice helping corporations grapple with lawsuits and regulation .
Among its clients were law firms , trade associations , and oil - , tobacco - , and chemical - industry giants .
Until 2006 , Sciences reported on its
Web site that it had defended MTBE ( a gasoline additive since banned in 25 states ) , TCE ( an industrial solvent in drinking water found highly likely to cause childhood cancer and birth defects ) , and perchlorate ( another toxin in drinking water that California has deemed “ a serious threat to human health ” ) .
Tools of the trade included providing expert testimony in lawsuits and producing scientific papers for publication .
A 2005 investigation in Environmental Health Perspectives raised questions about the boundaries that Anderson and her firm were willing to cross in service of their clients .
The journal focused on Sciences ’ defense of the pesticide phosphine .
In the late 1990s , the EPA proposed stricter standards for phosphine after several people died near fumigated warehouses .
The tobacco industry determined that the restrictions would cost millions and turned to Sciences for help .
Correspondence between Anderson and R.J. Reynolds , obtained from the UC San Francisco tobacco archives , reveals that Anderson lobbied her former colleagues at the EPA to reconsider .
Then , with input from her clients , she drafted a report arguing for the old standards and offered to get it published in a peer - reviewed journal .
“ My experience is that consultant reports funded by those being regulated , and written expressly for the EPA , are easily and frequently ignored , ” she wrote in a memo to Joel Seckar , a toxicologist at R.J. Reynolds .
“ Since I am currently editor - in - chief of the international journal Risk Analysis , perhaps the peer - review process could be expedited . ”
For this , “ Sciences would need an additional $ 35,000 over and above the $ 50,000 provided by the original contract , ” the letter concluded .
When the EPA eventually decided not to change the exposure standard for phosphine , the agency cited the review by Sciences International as justification .
( Risk Analysis ‘s board — which included HCRA ’s George Gray — later tightened its conflict - of - interest standards , after examining the Sciences - phospine episode , but allowed Anderson to remain editor .
Anderson declined to talk with Fast Company about the matter . )
Among the first tasks in Sciences ’ examination of BPA was to draft a review of previous studies .
That draft would serve as a foundation for a panel of scientists who would judge the compound .
According to biologist Pete Myers , chief scientist of the nonprofit Environmental Health Sciences , who analyzed the 330 - page report , it shared flaws with the discredited Harvard review .
“ They contained similar biases , both giving undue weight to flawed industry studies and dismissing a wealth of research funded by the National Institutes of Health , ” he says .
In its own investigation , the Environmental Working Group , a D.C. - based consumer advocate , found that the Sciences draft failed to note which studies were industry funded and ignored details such as Tyl ’s use of the estrogen - resistant CD Sprague - Dawley rat .
A further complication was that the panel of experts brought in to conduct the review itself — while all highly accomplished in their own specialties — included only one person with any experience in BPA research .
Unfamiliar with the thousands of pages of literature , the panel was heavily dependent on the Sciences draft review , says Myers .
In November 2007 , the panel issued a weak warning on BPA : that the research merits “ minimal concern ” for most of the effects studied .

The fact that the National Toxicology Program eventually overruled the panel — strengthening the warning to “ some concern ” — has much to do with outrage in Congress over revelations that Sciences International had a significant conflict of interest .
In February 2007 , another investigation by the Environmental Working Group had revealed that Anthony Scialli , a top Sciences employee whose title was “ principal investigator ” under the 2005 CERHR contract , had coauthored a 2004 study on birth defects from chemicals with a toxicologist from Dow , a manufacturer of BPA .
In response , Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Henry Waxman , both of California , wrote letters upbraiding NIH brass and vowing to keep a close eye on the BPA panel .
The NIH requested an explanation from Sciences , which denied that any conflicts had “ impaired its judgment or objectivity . ”
But Fast Company has learned that Sciences ’ conflicts of interest went even deeper .
The firm had passed its verdict on BPA , under oath , even before it began the government review .
In 2003 , Sciences provided expert testimony for the defense in a lawsuit over BPA .
On an archived page of the firm ’s Web site , the company bragged that , for a private client , it had acted as an expert witness “ challenging the validity ” of the science on BPA ’s health risks .
“ The case was decided in favor of the defendants , ” the site said .
( Anderson , who sold Sciences for $ 5.1 million in 2001 and left for rival Exponent in 2006 , confirmed by email that the testimony happened but declined to provide details .
Herman Gibb , who took over as president of Sciences , says the staff working on the CERHR contract was not aware of the testimony . )
The NIH terminated the Sciences contract in April 2007 , and the firm is now down to four employees .
The Environmental Working Group has since reported that Sciences had client relationships with the makers of nearly every chemical it reviewed under the CERHR contract .
Echoes of Agent Orange
As the Sciences International scandal broke , John D. Dingell , Michigan congressman and then - chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , launched an investigation into the product - defense industry .
“ I have grave concerns that science may be for sale at these consulting firms , ” Dingell told Fast Company .
“ If supposedly reputable scientists are paid to cast doubt on valid scientific data that raise public - health concerns about everyday products , then the public ’s health and safety are being endangered . ”
“ Science may be for sale at these consulting firms , ” says Congressman Dingell .
“ If supposedly reputable scientists are paid to cast doubt on valid data , the public ’s health and safety are being endangered . ”
Dingell ’s probe zeroed in on a 75 - employee Beltway firm called the Weinberg Group ( tagline : “ Science minds over business matters ” ) .
The firm got started in the 1980s defending the carcinogenic defoliant Agent Orange .
According to documents from the tobacco archives , founder Myron Weinberg was a major player in Philip Morris ’s infamous “ whitecoat ” project , under which the company secretly paid dozens of PhDs to challenge the findings that secondhand smoke caused cancer .
More recently , the firm has fought restrictions on drugs such as ephedra and Fen - phen — both since pulled from the market .
On its site , it has noted that when the FDA proposed canceling an unspecified client ’s drug , the Weinberg Group launched a lengthy appeal process that led “ to 10 additional years of sales prior to the ultimate cancellation . ”

An April 2003 marketing letter written by Weinberg vice president P. Terrence Gaffney provides insight into the services the firm offers .
The letter offered DuPont help in defending PFOA , a component of Teflon that has been the subject of lawsuits and EPA enforcement costing the company more than $ 100 million .
“ Manufacturers must be the aggressors , ” the letter urged .
“ We must implement a strategy at the outset which discourages government agencies , the plaintiff ’s bar , and misguided environmental groups from pursuing this matter . ”
Specifically , Gaffney offered to facilitate “ the publication of papers and articles dispelling the alleged … harm . ”
He promised , “ We will harness , focus , and involve the scientific and intellectual capital of our company with one goal in mind — creating the outcome our client desires . ”
According to Dingell ’s investigation , Sunoco is among the manufacturers that hired the Weinberg Group to defend its BPA business .
A spokesperson for Sunoco confirms the company hired Weinberg but says it was only to analyze BPA science .
Weinberg also downplays its role .
“ The Weinberg Group certainly has been involved , ” says spokesman John Kyte , managing director of PR giant Burson - Marsteller .
“ But critics want to attribute to the Weinberg Group this exorbitant influence and this cloak - and - dagger kind of thing .
In the big picture , it ’s not the reason the product is in widespread use . ”
James Lamb , a lawyer and toxicologist , has been a prominent advocate for BPA ’s safety , both as a Weinberg vice president and an independent contractor .
In 1998 , when BPA became a major issue at a scientific conference in Kyoto , Japan , Lamb led press conferences attacking vom Saal ’s studies .
In a 2001 press release publicizing Tyl ’s study using the CD Sprague - Dawley rats , Lamb — identified only as a former NIH scientist , not a consultant to BPA manufacturers — declared that “ the concerns raised by sketchy or incomplete data have now been conclusively addressed .
The results indicate very clearly that there is no risk to human health from these low - dose exposures . ”
The Weinberg Group also sponsors the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology , which has published much of the industry - backed science on BPA .
It published one of Cagen ’s BPA studies , as well as the Ashby experiment that cast doubt on vom Saal ’s prostate findings .
George Gray , formerly of HCRA , is a regular contributor , and many of the studies the Harvard center sent to its expert panel were published here .
Reg Tox Pharm , as the journal is known , is published by the International Society of Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology .
That may sound like a weighty organization , but its annual budget is about $ 50,000 , according to its nonprofit tax return .
The society was headed by its founder , C. Jelleff Carr , until he passed away in 2005 at age 94 .
It is now managed by his wife from her suburban Columbia , Maryland , home .
Every year , the society presents an International Achievement Award , for which “ there are no specific criteria … however , international scientific developments in toxicology are of special interest , ” according to the society ’s Web site .
The 2004 award went to Dr. Lester M. Crawford , who later was appointed FDA commissioner by President Bush but resigned after two months .
The following year , he pleaded guilty to conflict - of - interest charges .
In 2005 , the award went to Jerome H. Heckman , general counsel to the Society of the Plastics Industry since 1954 .
And the 2006 honoree was Elizabeth Anderson of Sciences International .

Watchdogs and Canaries
Where the BPA saga goes from here is unclear .
The dueling government reports ’ effect on business began rippling out as early as last April , when a draft version of the National Toxicology Program decision was made public .
Outraged activists accused the chemical industry of poisoning infants for profit .
Trial lawyers filed class - action suits against bottle manufacturers .
Senator Charles Schumer of New York proposed banning the suspect baby bottles outright .
Wal - Mart , Toys “ R ” Us , and CVS all announced plans to phase out polycarbonate bottles .
Some companies , such as bottle maker Nalgene , have adopted BPA - free plastic .
Yet most businesses stuck with BPA products — at least partly because they do n’t have a good substitute .
Nearly all of the 130 billion food and beverage cans made in the United States each year are still lined with a BPA resin , for example .
There is an alternative called Oleoresin , but it ’s more expensive , has a shorter shelf life , and ca n’t be used for acidic foods like tomatoes .
You might expect the government to start controlling the use of BPA , but the track record suggests otherwise .
The United States has a long tradition of keeping harmful substances — lead , DDT , tobacco , PCBs — on the market for decades after scientists find adverse effects .
The National Toxicology Program report citing “ some concern ” has no regulatory impact , and the FDA has repeatedly deemed BPA “ safe , ” even in the face of criticism .
Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa , who has launched numerous investigations into the agency , contends , “ The FDA has got to be a watchdog , not a business partner with industry . ”
( The agency owes a substantial portion of its budget to fees it collects from companies registering new products . )
What ’s more , the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the outside scientist supervising the FDA ’s latest review , Martin Philbert of the University of Michigan Risk Science Center , failed to disclose a $ 5 million donation from a man named Charles Gelman — a retired medical - device executive and an opponent of BPA regulation .
The government is unlikely to start controlling the use of BPA .
The United States has a long tradition of keeping harmful substances — lead , DDT , tobacco , PCBs — on the market for decades after scientists find adverse effects .
The EPA could theoretically step in , but that ’s unlikely too .
The agency “ has no real program to regulate industrial chemicals , as a result of deep flaws in the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act , ” says Andy Igrejas , environmental - health campaign director for the Pew Charitable Trusts .
Under the act , the EPA needs to show “ substantial evidence ” that a chemical is harmful , and must weigh the costs of restrictions against the economic benefits of keeping the chemical in commerce .
That ’s a byzantine chore and helps explain why the agency has managed to restrict only five chemicals in the law ’s 33 - year history .
Under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act , Congress ordered the agency to screen industrial chemicals to determine if they interfere with the endocrine system , a program that might have flagged BPA .
Nine years after the 1999 deadline , the agency has yet to screen a single chemical .
Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has proposed an overhaul of the whole system .
In May , he introduced the Kid-Safe Chemical Act of 2008 , which would reverse the burden of proof on chemicals , requiring manufacturers to demonstrate their safety in order to keep them in commerce .
The E.U. passed a similar law in 2006 , as did Canada in 1999 .
( Canada has banned BPA in baby bottles . )
Still , even if Lautenberg ’s bill passes , the question remains whether it would be any less vulnerable to product - defense firms gaming the science .

In the meantime , consumers and concerned producers and retailers of BPA products are left with two options :
Trust that the chemical industry has their best interests at heart , or take precautions .
In its report , the NIH ’s National Toxicology Program advised “ concerned parents ” to reduce their use of canned foods ; use BPA - free baby bottles ; and opt for glass , porcelain , or stainless - steel containers , particularly for hot foods and liquids .
Independent scientists applauded , though many of them contend that the advice should have been even more strongly worded — and would have been , were the agency not constrained by the industry - funded science .
“ The U.S. has this disjointed approach to chemicals management that does n’t focus on the inherent hazard of the chemical , ” says Joel Tickner , project director at the Center for Sustainable Production at the University of Massachusetts Lowell .
BPA is far from the only modern - age substance whose effects we do n’t fully understand , and is n’t the only product whose safety record has been twisted .
In that way , perhaps , it may be the canary in the coal mine .
And so the question looms :
In our quest for progress — and profit — are we putting our future at risk ?

Miley Cyrus Has Free Reign
Hannah Montana starwho is FIFTEEN , has been rumored to be dating modelwho is TWENTY .
We must say that he IS very good looking and we can because he 's legal age .
It looks like Miley 's parents are giving her free reign to make her own choices in life .
Miley was on Ryan Seacrest 's radio show and talked pretty freely about her " friend " Justin .
The teen says they are in a good place and he 's been a " great friend more than anything " .
What does more than anything mean to a fifteen year old ?
Ryan asked her if in fact they were an item .
Her response was , " Maybe. Maybe Not " .
Way to keep us guessing Hannah , I mean Miley .
Good thing for Gaston , Billy Ray Cyrus thinks he 's a " good kid " .
We think he meant to say " good man " .
Miley went on to tell Ryan :
" He 's a really great Christian guy .
We have the kind of relationship where we can talk about ( things related to being in the public eye ) and he gets it . "
" My family 's like , whatever happens , happens . "
And the best part of the interview was when Cyrus talked about her parents feelings on the relationship .
Crap ... now we are concerned .
Hopefully they clarified exactly what that meant ... like 'we do n't mean we want to be grandparents NOW ' and so on and so forth .
Hey , our friends over at TMZ have some interesting photos of the Christian " good kid " and it looks like Justin might have lost his way .... at least momentarily .

Taleban fighters in north - west Pakistan 's restive Swat valley have announced a 10 - day ceasefire .
The move came after local officials signed a deal with a militant leader to enforce Islamic law in the district .
The ceasefire halts fighting between Pakistani security forces and Taleban militants in Swat that has raged since November 2007 .
Once one of Pakistan 's most popular holiday destinations , the Swat valley is now mostly under Taleban control .
Hundreds of civilians have died in an increasingly bloody insurgency there , while thousands of others have been forced to migrate .
The Taleban have set up their own system of Islamic justice , as they understand it , and have closed down schools , denying education to tens of thousands of children , says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan , who was recently in Swat .
Pakistani President Asif Zardari has warned that the entire country is fighting for its survival against the Taleban , whose influence he said has spread deep into the country .
In an interview with US TV network CBS , President Asif Zardari said the Taleban had established a presence across " huge parts " of Pakistan .
' Goodwill gesture '
The agreement was signed by Taleban cleric Sufi Mohammad after talks with the North West Frontier Province 's government .
The agreement binds the provincial government to implement Sharia law in the Malakand division , which comprises Swat and its adjoining areas .
Many people in Swat now would favour an early exit by the army as the they have failed to roll back the Taleban or protect the Taleban 's opponents
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan
Swat civilians caught in the crossfire Pakistan ' in fight for survival '
A militant spokesman , Muslim Khan , said the ceasefire was a " goodwill gesture to the ongoing talks between Sufi Mohammad and the government " .
Talks on how Sharia law will be implemented are to continue on Monday between Taleban representatives and officials of the provincial government in the capital of North West Frontier Province , Peshawar , said Reuters news agency .
Details are to be formally announced at that time .
There has been no reaction so far from the Pakistani central government .
The Taleban say they will examine the document thoroughly before announcing a permanent end to hostilities .
Army exit urged A Chinese engineer held hostage for five months had also been released as a sign of good faith , the militants said .
Long Xiaowei , who was captured last August in the Dir region with a Chinese colleague , arrived at China 's embassy in Islamabad earlier on Sunday and was in good health , a Chinese official said .
The colleague escaped in October , the Taleban said at the time .
The people of Swat have been caught between the army and the Taleban , says our correspondent .
More than 1,000 civilians have died in shelling by the army or from beheadings sanctioned by the Taleban .
Thousands more have been displaced .
The Taleban now control the entire countryside of Swat , limiting army control to parts of the valley 's capital , Mingora .
Many people in Swat now would favour an early exit by the army as the they have failed to roll back the Taleban or protect the Taleban 's opponents , says our correspondent .

Up until now , one major issue with the App Cloner was the fact that it was incompatible with WhatsApp .
Thankfully , the developers are now bringing the 1.4.0 update , which addresses particularly this problem , to many fans ’ happiness .
Good changes
If you use several accounts for this service , for example if you have more SIM cards .
Now you do n’t have to do the switch manually ( process that actually causes some further issues with the device ) , you just have to install multiple instances and associate each one of them with an account .
In this way you wo n’t have to worry about missing any notifications during the time you did not sign in on a particular account .
However , WhatsApp is not the only thing that was upgraded .
Before the 1.4.0 version , a couple of apps such as Gmail and Chrome would not work , but thankfully the most recent version brings them some limited functionalities when they are duplicated .
However , neither of them is working directly with the Google account on the installs that are duplicated .
This means that Chrome cannot sync on the duplicated version , and email on Gmail is available only for the external protocols ( such as IMAP and Yahoo ) .
There are also some smaller changes that were included in this version .
For example , you can clone apps from the APK without any previous installation .
Moreover , you can mark the cloned apps in order to update them , tinker with the individual settings for several clones and enjoy some new language options .
If you ’re really bored and want to have some fun , you can use the update in unexpected ways : download the App Cloner from the APK Mirror website and then clone the app itself !
Let us know what happens and if you enjoyed doing so !
Samantha Ronson & Lindsay Lohan : NY Fashion Week ( Photos , Video )
andhave been in New York City to take in Fashion Week .
One of the premiere events for the couple was the Runway Show .
It was at last year 's New York Fashion Week festivities that the pair were first photographed together .
Over the past twelve months we have seen what can best be described as a volatile and rocky relationship .
Samantha and Charlotte are twin sisters and belong to the interesting and ecclectic family Ronson .
The entire group did a photo shoot spoof of the Royal Tenenbaums for the September 2008 issue of Harper 's Bazaar .

Those that were asking for a decisive intervention to halt a financial pandemic certainly got it yesterday .
It was almost too big for shell - shocked markets to assimilate .
Their reaction , in part driven by the mounting sense that this crisis is now international and out of control , was profoundly disappointing .
Yet Britain has produced a well thought - through , bold and comprehensive plan to put its financial system on a sounder footing - well ahead of any other government .
Messrs Brown and Darling for once deserve some congratulation .
There is every chance they will find themselves lionised at the IMF meetings in Washington this week as the one government that has finally risen to the occasion .
Big money is on the table .
I estimated the cost of the package of measures that I recommended in the Crisis Watch column on these pages yesterday as between £ 350bn and £ 400bn , including up to £ 50bn of new capital for the banks - which I thought at the limits of the possible .
The overall price tag on the actual measures is £ 500bn .
The proposed recapitalisation of the eight banks is vital - and it is conspicuous that it goes well beyond what any other government has contemplated .
It will leave British banks as the most solidly capitalised in the world , even if it is a confidence shaker that the deficit in their capital was allowed to grow so big .
The obvious concern is that without a " bad bank " to buy their toxic loans - the one omission from the package and importantly used by Sweden in its 1992 rescue plan , on which this is closely modelled - taxpayers ' money will be immediately used to fund write - offs , so sending the banks back to square one .
And the means of getting capital into the banks - preferred equity - has very little capacity to offer a compensating upside gain for the taxpayer because preferred equity share prices are more or less fixed , unless , like Warren Buffett 's investment in Goldman Sachs , the government has warrants .
A " bad bank " has the merit of both removing the risk of further write - downs against the replenished capital , and also allowing the toxic debt to be partly or even fully recovered in better times - saving the taxpayer cash .
On the other hand if the government succeeds in preventing a bank going bankrupt and the disastrous domino effects that would create , while its other interventions work the amount of toxic debt might stay limited .
The most eye - catching , eye - popping element of all is the up to £ 250bn of government guarantees for lending in the interbank market .
This is targeted at what has emerged as the heartland of the problem - the de facto bank run , in which the big banks had completely lost confidence and stopped lending to each other .
The guarantee is a double whammy .
It will allow them to lend to one another again without fear , and to use guaranteed loans to finance maturing asset - backed securities - and on a huge scale .
Barclays can now comfortably refinance the £ 28bn of its securities falling due next year ; RBS its £ 18bn .
Given all this - along with the doubling in size of the Bank of England 's special liquidity scheme and the coordinated cut in interest rates by Britain , the US and the EU - it is serious that the FTSE 100 closed the day more than 200 points down .
One problem is that it will take time for the guarantee to open the interbank market , where the London interbank offered rate only eased a tiny fraction yesterday .
Another is that the British action has exposed the inadequacy of what is proposed elsewhere - and thus the gigantic scale of both the problem and what has to be done by other governments , confirmed by the sombre pronouncements by the IMF and chair of the US Federal Reserve .
The American decision not to support Lehman Brothers is now turning out to be the fulcrum on which the crisis has turned .
It is not just that Lehman had $ 110bn of senior bonds that are now virtually valueless ; it had written an estimated additional $ 440 bn credit default swaps on top which it cannot honour - a large part of which will come due at the end of this week .
Wall Street is transfixed , as are the Asian markets .
Nobody knows where these losses will end up .
It has suddenly become obvious that the Paulson plan cannot simultaneously handle this together with the fallout of the sub - prime crisis .
And in addition there is the impossible challenge of financing trillions of dollars of asset - backed securities which are maturing when the world 's interbank markets are shut .
Britain may have invented a way to allow its banks to do this , but banks in other countries need the same help , along with the same chance to recapitalise themselves .
This will dominate the discussions at the IMF / World Bank annual meetings this weekend .
Britain has bitten the bullet and partially nationalised its banking system .
Other countries , notably the Americans , need to follow our lead - and to do so fast .
Incredibly , it may have fallen to Gordon Brown to show the world how to avert a slump .

Microsoft had a head start in the smartphone software industry , but companies like Apple ( AAPL ) and Google ( GOOG ) have increasingly made Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Windows Mobile look out of date .
So we 're happy that Microsoft has made some progress in its user interface and Web browser for Windows Mobile 6.5 , which CEO Steve Ballmer showed off today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .
We have n't gotten a chance to see it yet , but Gizmodo says it " looks great . "
You 'll notice a honeycomb home screen , an App Store , better touch gesture controls , some screens that look like a Zune , and a physical " Start " button on all new phones .
We do n't see anything about multi- touch , stellar built - in maps , or any multimedia features that would get someone to buy a Windows phone instead of an iPhone .
But we 'll hold off final judgment until we see a few examples .
This is n't Windows Mobile 7 , the big new version that Motorola ( MOT ) is mostly holding out for .
But if Windows Mobile 6.5 can tide over handset partners like HTC and LG until then -- LG is a making a particularly big bet on Microsoft -- that 's good news for Microsoft .
Windows Mobile had gotten so bad that phone makers like HTC have been going through the trouble of making their own user interfaces so consumers did n't have to use the Windows part as much .
So any progress made on Microsoft 's end is good news .
Why is this so important ?
Smartphones are the main growth area in the mobile industry , and Microsoft is in the beginning of a next - gen platform war with Apple , Nokia , Google , RIM , Palm , and others .
If Microsoft gets left behind , it 's in trouble .
And indeed , Microsoft 's market share has slipped : Windows Mobile had a 11.1 % market share during Q3 ' 08 , down from 12.8 % in Q3 ' 07 , according to Gartner 's most recent stats .
This new version should help .
But it'll also depend on what Apple , Google , RIM , Palm , and others come out with this year .

今日は、ほんとうにこわ～い話をしましょう。
この写真は1月29日に撮った写真です。ここに写っている方々は、東海北陸地方の国立大学の学長さんたちなんです。この写真が撮られた場所は、岐阜グランドホテル。国立大学協会（全国の国立大学長さんの集まり）の東海・北陸地区支部会議というのがあったんですね。この会議は、各大学で困っていることについて、お互いにいろいろと意見を交換をする場なんです。
こわ～い話といっても、残念ながらこの写真に幽霊が写っているとか、そんな話ではありません。
この会議でいろんな事が話しあわれたのですが、その中で、とってもこわ～い話があったんですね。
それは、ある大学の附属病院が約3億円の赤字となり、その補てんを大学本部がしたというのです。3億円と言うと、病院ではあっという間にそのくらいの赤字を作ってしまうことがあるんですが、病院以外の学部や大学院にとっては、つぶれてしまいかねないものすごい大金なんですね。幸い、この大学では積立金があったので、それを病院部門の赤字補てんにあてて、今回はなんとかやりくりをしたとのことです。せっかく教育・研究の高度化のために積み立てたお金を、病院の赤字の補てんに使わなければならないとは、その大学にとってもたいへんつらいことですし、また、こんなことが他の大学でもおこると日本全体の学術の国際競争力の低下につながるので、これはゆゆしき事態だと思います。そして、もし仮に、この大学病院の3億円の赤字が何年か続くと、今の国立大学法人の制度が今後も変わらなければ、大学自体がつぶれることになりかねませんね。
（私は、病院経営の不安定な浮沈が、安定的に供給するべき教育研究サービスに影響を与える現在の法人制度自体が間違っていると考えています。）
実は今、赤字の大学病院はどんどん増えており、42の国立大学の附属病院のうち半数以上が赤字となってしまって、大学本部が赤字を補てんしている大学がけっこうあるんですね。ちなみに私立の大学病院も半数以上が赤字なんですけと。
なぜ、赤字の国立大学病院が増えたのかというと、いくつかの原因の中で最大の原因は、附属病院運営費交付金（以下病院交付金と略します。）を国が激しく削減したからです。国立大学全体の予算としては毎年１％ずつ減らされつづけているのですが、病院交付金はこの４年間で50％以上も減らされたんですね。（約600億円あった病院交付金が現在約300億円に減りました。）これは、ものすごい削減率です。
各病院は一生懸命患者数や手術件数を増やして経営を頑張ってきたのですが、追いつかないんですね。大学病院は、教育・研究・高度医療・地域医療の最後の砦（とりで）という、地域にとってほんとうに大切な役割を果たしてきましたが、その機能が低下しつつあります。たとえば、お金を稼ぐために教員でもある医師の診療の負担が増えて、その分研究時間が少なくなって医学・医療の論文数が減り続け、国際競争力はどんどん低下しています。論文の量が減っただけではなく、質も中国に追いこされる事態になっています。地域への医師供給能も低下して、地域の病院から医師がボロボロ抜けていることも、皆さんよくご存じですね。これには、新医師臨床研修制度の影響も加わっていますけどね。
病院への予算の削減率を最初から1％程度にしておけば、これほどひどいことにはならなかったと思います。今後は、ぜひとも、1％程度の削減率に抑えていただきたいものです。そうでないと、赤字病院は減らず、医学・医療の国際競争力はますます低下し、大学病院の機能低下が進み、地域医療の最後の砦としての役割が果たせなくなります。
今、政府の方では、病院への予算の削減率をゆるくすることを考えていただいているようなのですが、どうも、ある程度高い削減率に設定されるかもしれないんですね。大学病院の医師たちは、他の病院に比べてかなり安い給与で引き続きがんばることになると思いますが、その限界が来て“がんばりバブル”が崩壊すると、今の世界の経済状態のように、大学病院システム（あるいは大学そのもの）と地域医療が一気に崩壊します。これこそ、ほんとうにこわ～い話ということになりますね。
このこわ～い話にならないように、私が一生懸命自分なりに奮闘してきた長い道のりを書いた文章がありますので、興味のある方は挑戦をしてみてください。けっこう長い文章ですけど。（http://cz.biglobe.ne.jp/cl/W0830/1/2201000109/1433760 ）
今後、もし、このこわ～い話が現実のものとなった暁には、今回の大学病院の予算制度を決定することになる政府の人の責任であって、学長の責任ではないということをここに明言しておきます。
大学病院（大学本体も）が弱体化することは、その大学のある地域の死活にかかわることになると思います。ぜひ、地域からも声をあげていただきたいと思います。
Words of a future genius ?
By Paula Dear
BBC News
At the age of nine few children know what they will go on to do with their lives .
But for a scientist involved in one of the most revolutionary medical operations of recent times , his destiny appears to have been spelled out in a letter written 35 years ago , to a BBC children 's programme .
It had been a heck of a year for Professor Anthony Hollander .
In 2008 , after 20 years of research into helping arthritis sufferers he unexpectedly found himself being asked to urgently adapt his skills to help save the life of a woman in Spain .
The groundbreaking treatment , by a team of scientists and surgeons , gave the woman a new windpipe using her own stem cells .
He had helped save a dying woman and the successful operation made headlines around the world .
It was , by any measure , a career high .
Boy to man : Prof Hollander says his child - like enthusiasm remains
After it was all over Mr Hollander got to thinking , and suddenly made a connection .
In 1973 , a nine - year - old Anthony Hollander had written to Blue Peter to tell them he had a " strange " belief that he knew how to " make people or animals alive " .
The letter , which by his own admission today was " eccentric " , went on to ask the programme to help him acquire the necessary materials to carry out these life - saving tasks .
The shopping list included a " model of a heart split in half " and " tools for cutting people open " .
Thousands of children wrote to the programme every week , but each one received a personal letter back , and Anthony was no exception .
The response from then editor , Biddy Baxter , was " fundamental " to his future , he now believes .
She encouraged him to seek information for his idea from the family doctor .
It was not so much the advice itself that left an impression on the boy .
It was that whisper of encouragement that he gleaned from having received a reply at all , and that the letter did not dismiss his idea .
Book choice " If her letter had shown any hint of ridicule or disbelief I might perhaps never have trained to become a medical scientist or been driven to achieve the impossible dream , and really make a difference to a human being 's life , " he says .
Dear Anthony , we were interested to hear that you think you know how to make living people ... your list of necessary items intrigued us !
Biddy Baxter , then editor , Blue Peter
The letters in full Now aged 44 , with three children of his own , Mr Hollander 's realisation of how he had foretold his future prompted him once again to fire off a missive to the BBC - although this time it was an e-mail .
Remarkably , unbeknown to Mr Hollander , Baxter had only recently selected his letter to be published in her book , Dear Blue Peter , which charts the programme 's correspondence over its first 50 years .
She remembered his " funny " letter very well , and the two have recently discussed its significance .
" It was a letter full of enthusiasm which is , of course , the hallmark of the pre-pubescent child - the audience for whom Blue Peter was and still is intended , " she told him .
Reflecting on this unlikely sequence of events , Baxter says : " It was tremendous to find out how Anthony had got on in life .
When I got his e-mail I knew exactly who it was . "
What Baxter could n't have known at the time was that it had all started with a stricken bird .
' Sickly child '
One day in 1973 Anthony - a " sickly child " - was off school and at home with his mother , when he found a fatally injured bird in the paved area of their garden in north London .
Biddy Baxter kept hold of all correspondence from the viewers " It was in some distress , " he recalls today .
" My mum was too squeamish to deal with it , so I put it out of its misery .
For a nine - year - old it was hard to have to do that . "
As he remembers it he got to thinking , about death , and about how he might be able to keep people alive .
" So I did what all sensible children do when in need of practical help with an idea .
I wrote to Blue Peter , " he said .
" I can vaguely remember I was thinking about re-routing the blood out of the heart and recirculating it .
Then they could fix up the heart and it would be alright again .
I just did n't want that death stuff to happen . "
An intensely curious child , Anthony says he was obsessed with the world around him .
But school exams did n't go as well as he'd hoped and it was n't until he was ensconced in the world of academia that he really flourished .
A lack of sufficient grades had meant he could n't study medicine , but he went on to gain a first class degree in pharmacology .
His childlike notion of dreaming that every part of the body was fixable has never really left him , he says .
Mr Hollander 's colleagues at the University of Bristol 's School of Medical Sciences , would probably recognise his adult self in the Blue Peter letter - not least his poor spelling - he says , and he expects a " ribbing " about it .
Claudia Castillo , whose windpipe was rebuilt with the help of Mr Hollander
Windpipe transplant breakthrough " As adults we can tend to lose the capacity to dream and think big .
Children will dream unselfconsciously .
I still do that - I still go around telling people ' these are the things I want to do ' .
I do n't have time for any kind of scepticism . "
Last week the professor - who is to be honoured with a Blue Peter gold badge - told Baxter : " I remember being thrilled at the time to have been taken seriously .
Actually , even nowadays I am thrilled when people take my ideas seriously .
I know that might sound strange to you .
But my way of doing science is to think up a hundred theories , however mad , and work through them until I find one that fits the data . "
He added : " If you had failed to reply , or had treated my letter as a joke ( as perhaps others might have done ) it could well have altered the course of my life .
" You had a very precious role to play in dealing with the many and varied child - minds presented to you and that important work is now being continued . "

What a brilliant tale of enthusiasm , passion and encouragement in these otherwise dark times .
Small , seemingly insignificant things we adults do or say to children can have such a far - reaching impact .
As adults we have a duty to encourage , not disparage children .
Helen , Bedale , Yorkshire
What a fantastic story .
It must bring a smile to every reader 's face , and a warm feeling to go back in time and dwell on that place we all shared as children , devoted to Blue Peter Our programme that was serious telly for kids .
Enormous congratulations to Professor Hollander , and massive thanks and respect to Biddy Baxter for all that she did and brought to several generations .
Martin Giblin , Formby , Liverpool , UK
What a beautiful story , so inspiring .
It made me think of how impressionable children are and that if all of us were to look back on our lives there would have been someone who inspired us at some point .
I do hope that with all the PC forced onto teachers and alike that we do n't forget to ' think outside the box ' and empower children to turn their dreams into reality .
Nicola Weaver , Basingstoke , England A great story .
One that serves to remind us that you should n't stop dreaming .
You 've just brightened my day .
Jonathan , Edinburgh Great article .
It really shows just how important it is to encourage children to follow their dreams and ideas .
We should all take note .
Mark , Chelmsford
It comes as no surprise that Mr Hollander expressed his desire to go into medicine at so young an age .
I was five when I told a family friend that I wanted to do something in music when I grew up and 12 when I informed my cello teacher that I wanted to teach the cello .
I came from a working class , non-musical family and am doing just what I said I would .
K Tucker , Horsham Great story indeed .
I have an old junior school essay ( written when I was around eight or nine ) that states " when I grow up I want to be an artist " .
I 'm now 46 and have been a graphic designer all my working career .
Steve Edwards , Hampton , UK Amazing .
It is amazing what a little direction and positive encouragement of a child can do .
Perhaps it 's not Professor Hollander saving lives , but the ethos of Blue Peter .
It is so good to hear some good news for once about children 's TV .
Grant , Bristol
What a superb and heart warming account .
It goes to show how a little encouragement and belief goes such a very long way .
Parents and employers take note .
Anne -Marie , Dorset
What a wonderful inspiring letter - It reminds us that often the small things we do can have an enormous impact on others .
Thank goodness for Biddy .

SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - Millions of people and cattle in north China face shortages of drinking water because of a severe drought , the government said on Saturday , promising to speed up disbursement of billions of dollars of subsidies to farmers .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
State television quoted disaster relief officials as saying 4.4 million people and 2.1 million cattle lacked adequate drinking water .
Official media have described the drought as north China ’s worst in half a century .
The Ministry of Finance said it would accelerate disbursement of 86.7 billion yuan ( $ 12.7 billion ) of annual subsidies for farmers to assist grain production and minimize the impact of the drought on rural incomes .
The government is particularly anxious to avoid a drop in rural incomes because of the threat of social unrest as millions of migrant workers , laid off from urban jobs during China ’s economic slump , return to the countryside .
Instead of distributing the farm subsidies evenly over this year as it did in the past , the finance ministry said it was immediately disbursing the entire 15.1 billion yuan earmarked to supplement the incomes of grain farmers .
It is also immediately disbursing part of a 71.6 billion yuan sum earmarked to aid capital spending by farmers .
The ministry called on provincial governments to deliver that money into the hands of farmers in the worst - hit areas within a month .
However , meteorological officials said there were signs that better rainfall in coming weeks would ease the crisis .
Rainfall is forecast for the next 10 days , the official Xinhua news agency quoted the China Meteorological Administration as saying .
Xiao Ziniu , director of China ’s National Climate Center , was quoted as saying most of north China ’s wheat belt was expected to receive slightly less than or nearly normal rainfall in March .
Xiao said earlier in the week that losses in China ’s winter wheat fields could be limited to just 2.5 percent if farmers moved quickly enough to irrigate their fields .
The drought is hitting eight provinces which contain about half of China ’s wheat - growing areas .
As of Friday , 10.7 million hectares of wheat - growing fields had been affected in those provinces , the Ministry of Agriculture said .
Of that area , 4.5 million hectares were seriously damaged and 420,000 hectares suffered destruction of wheat shoots , the ministry said .
Just over half of the total affected area had been irrigated so far .

For the last nine months , Apple has refused to get into specifics about the well - being of its chief executive , Steven P. Jobs , even as he said last month that he was taking a six - month leave of absence to deal with health problems .
On Wednesday , the company ’s shareholders had their chance to press for more information  but they did not get far .
At its annual shareholder meeting here on Apple ’s corporate campus , run by the chief operating officer , Timothy D. Cook , the company responded to inquiries about Mr. Jobs by saying that he still planned to return to the company in June .
“ He is deeply involved in all strategic matters and has delegated day - to - day authority to Tim Cook and his team , ” said Arthur D. Levinson , a co-lead director of Apple and the chief executive of Genentech .
“ That ’s where it stands . ”
Drogba goes through one of the most difficult periods of his career .
The Chelsea star was injured most of the time in the last six months and Nicholas Anelka took advantage of the situation .
Since then Anelka had emerged as the club leading attacker .
The Ivorian international was banned for three matches at his return against Burnley in Carling Cup after trowing back coins at supporters .
Despite all of this Drogba is one of the most hunted attackers with Inter , Barcelona and Real Madrid after him .
The favorites to lure him away from Stamford Bridge are the Italian champions who are ready to sacrifice no less than three of their best attackers in order to raise funds for Chelsea star .
There are good chances of success given the very good relations between Drogba and Mourinho .
Also the Ivorian is not any more that apreciated at Stamford Bridge after declaring few times this summer that he wants to leave the club .
If Chelsea decide to let him go then Scolari will remain with only two attackers available .
A good replacement for him could be Michael Owen from Newcastle United who is in the last year of contract .

World economists predicted today that the UK would be hit harder than any other developed nation by the worst recession in more than 60 years .
The International Monetary Fund's ( IMF ) grim outlook showed the economy shrinking by 2.8 per cent this year , more than twice as bad as it previously thought and well above the 2 per cent average for advanced countries .
It came as another independent body warned £ 20 billion of tax rises or spending cuts would be needed to get the national finances back on track .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) also predicted that , even then , swollen levels of public sector debt would not return to pre-crisis levels for more than 20 years .
Opposition parties greeted the latest assessments of the problems facing Britain as proof that Government policies were failing and Labour 's " lie " that the UK was better protected than most .
" This is the day when the British people were confronted with the true cost of Gordon Brown 's failures , " shadow chancellor George Osborne said .
" It may be a bad day for him but sadly it is an even worse day for the country . "
Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Vince Cable said : " This report exposes Gordon Brown 's lie that Britain is well placed to deal with the recession .
" Huge levels of personal debt and an over - reliance on the financial sector has made this country particularly vulnerable . "
But Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister remained " absolutely confident " that the Government was taking the right action to get Britain through the global recession .
Countries such as Japan and Italy were predicted to suffer deeper and longer recessions that the UK over the 2008 to 2010 period , his spokesman said .

He added : " Obviously those countries that are going to be hit particularly hard will be countries with large financial sectors .
But the question is what do you do about that ?
" The Prime Minister is absolutely confident ... that the Government 's plan for stability and recovery ... is the right approach , the right plan , and it is in line with the approach of every other major economy . "
In an update to its November report , the IMF said global growth was expected to fall to 0.5 per cent this year as the " scale and scope of the current financial crisis have taken the global economy into uncharted waters " .
Unless the problems were " forcefully addressed , the pernicious feedback loop between real activity and financial markets will intensify , leading to even more toxic effects on global growth , " the report said .
It predicted the US would suffer a 1.6 per cent contraction in its economy in 2009 , Germany 2.5 per cent and Japan 2.6 per cent and revised the UK prediction from 1.3 per cent to 2.8 per cent .
Earlier the IFS , in its annual Green Budget , said the fresh tax increases or spending cuts would be needed by the end of the next Parliament , in around 2015 , to raise the money needed .
It added that , without additional intervention , public sector net debt would balloon to 60 per cent of national income and take decades to ease back .
The think tank gave a more gloomy outlook for the UK economy than that given by the Treasury in its Pre-Budget Report ( PBR ) last autumn , saying the recession would be longer and deeper than the Government first thought .
However , research by Morgan Stanley for the report suggests that taxpayers are likely to see only minimal losses from the Government 's bank rescue efforts - and may even see a profit .
In another set of heated exchanges over the economy at Prime Minister 's question time - shortly before the publication of the IMF figures - Tory leader David Cameron said the PM appeared " extraordinarily complacent " .
" In the last week we 've discovered that Britain is facing the deepest recession in a generation .
We 've had the worst manufacturing figures since 1975 and this morning the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the country 's debt burden will take a whole generation to pay off , " he said .
" How deeply will the economy have to contract before you finally admit there is indeed an economic bust ? "
Mr Brown accused the Opposition of being alone in wanting to do " nothing " to resolve the crisis and said the IFS had concluded that his approach was working .
" Can I just quote from the IFS green budget ... ' our central forecast is that the UK will avoid deep and prolonged recession thanks to the enormous monetary and substantial fiscal stimulus already agreed ' , " he said .
" If we had taken your advice and done nothing it would have been a deeper recession . "
He went on : " I 'm afraid the Conservatives are living in a dream world if they believe that : one , this is purely a British problem ; and two , they believe that the answer to it is doing nothing . "
Mr Osborne said the IMF figures showed a fresh approach was vital .
He said : " Gordon Brown cannot answer the simplest question of all : if Britain is well prepared as he claims , why are we facing the worst recession in the world ?
" Let us hope these forecasts are wrong .
But if they are not , Britain is set to endure the worst downturn of any major country and the worst year for the economy since 1948 .
" Without a change of direction we will be living with Labour 's debt crisis for a generation . "
The founder of a Buffalo Muslim TV station established to portray Muslims in a good light has been charged with murder after his wife was beheaded .
Muzzammil Hassan , 44 , arrived at a police station in surburban Orchard Park , N.Y. , on Thursday night to say his wife , Aasiya Hassan , 37 , was dead .
Police found her body at the offices of Bridges TV , founded in 2004 by Muzzammil Hassan who was inspired by his wife 's post - 9/11 distress at hearing a radio report she thought portrayed Muslims negatively .
He was charged with second - degree murder .
No weapon was found but " the investigation is ongoing , " Orchard Park police said .
Aasiya Hassan recently filed for divorce , authorities said .
According to Buffalo
News reports , she obtained an order of protection on Feb. 6 , barring her husband from their home in Orchard Park .
Under sharia law followed by Muslims , a woman can ask for a divorce , but only a man can grant the request , and he can refuse , according to a book on sharia published last month , Cruel and Usual Punishment , by Egyptian - born American author Nonie Darwish .
Under Islamic law , crimes such as apostasy ( leaving Islam ) , adultery , theft or drinking alcohol are punishable by beheading , stoning , amputation of limbs or flogging , the book says .

Muzzammil Hassan arrived in the United States from Pakistan in 1979 , news reports from 2004 say .
They do not say whether his wife arrived with him .
He became a successful Buffalo banker .
He has said that his wife was offended by a report she heard shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks on the United States .
" She was seven months ' pregnant , " he told Reuters news Agency in 2004 .
" She did n't want her kids growing up in this environment . "
In response , he founded Bridges TV partly with the stated aim of helping non-Muslims overcome negative images they might have of Muslims and Islam .
" I had no background in television , " Muzzammil Hassan told Voice of America at the time .

When the 111th Congress convenes , Coleman may be out of an office .
Coleman may lose office until election is decided
When the 111th Congress convenes on Tuesday , Norm Coleman may be out of an office , even though his Senate race remains far from settled .
Coleman ’s first term officially expires at noon on Saturday , and he is locked in one of the closest Senate races in history , with Democrat Al Franken clinging to a 49 - vote lead out of nearly 3 million votes cast .

Since he has not been certified a winner in the race , Coleman may have to give up his privileges as a senator , including his desk on the floor , his personal office and his right to vote on legislation , according to Democratic aides familiar with the rules .
Some of his staff members could continue to get paid for up to 60 days if they do not find new employment , but each eligible aide would need to return every two weeks and sign an affidavit to certify he or she has not found new work .
Coleman still would be able to enter the Senate chambers and meet with his colleagues on the floor , since former members are granted floor privileges so long as they are not registered lobbyists .
It is possible , however , that all of Coleman 's privileges may remain intact should the two parties reach an accommodation , and aides signaled that talks were occurring on the matter through Friday .
“ We are still reviewing the situation , ” said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) .
" Norm Coleman should respect the conclusions of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board . "
The situation leaves the 111th Congress with two sticky situations starting Tuesday , with Democrats threatening to prevent Roland Burris from claiming the Illinois Senate seat — either through the rules or by the Capitol Police — and Republicans vowing to block any attempt by Franken to take the Minnesota seat before lawsuits are considered .
Minnesota Gov.
Tim Pawlenty has considered appointing a temporary replacement , but Democrats say the seat would have to be officially declared vacant before such a move could be allowed .
Attorneys for Coleman ’s campaign referred questions about Coleman ’s immediate future to his Senate office , and LeRoy Coleman , a spokesman , did not return several inquiries seeking comment .
The state canvassing board is expected to certify a winner next week , and it ’s unclear whether either Franken or Coleman would try to claim the seat following that certification .
Doing so would spark a backlash since the fight over the election returns will ultimately land in court — and perhaps the Senate , which has a constitutional role in resolving election disputes .
Sen . John Cornyn of Texas , the chief GOP campaign strategist , said he would block any attempt to seat Franken in the Senate until litigation is resolved and a winner is certified .
Jess McIntosh , a spokeswoman for the Franken campaign , said the former comedian had not made a decision on whether to make the trek to Capitol Hill next week , saying he would take it “ one step at a time . ”
Vancouver – Len Garis , the fire chief in Surrey , B.C. , has this to say about grow - op fires and hazards , “ If [ only ] we can separate the product [ marijuana ] and the situation . ”
We can ( Seeing Pot Through Benign Soft Lens Ignores Hard Realities Of Grow Ops – Feb. 7 ) .
The dangers of grow ops only exist because marijuana is illegal , which means plants have to be grown clandestinely with no safety or health regulations .
Marijuana can be separated from hazardous grow - op situations simply by ending marijuana prohibition .
Consider alcohol prohibition : Homemade basement booze distilleries were popping up everywhere to supply demand , but they caused fires and explosions , attracted gang violence and created other problems akin to what we ’re seeing under marijuana prohibition .
Legalizing and regulating the safe production of marijuana in greenhouses or outdoors , like most flowers and produce , would eliminate grow ops from homes and neighbourhoods .
– Article from the Globe & Mail on February 9 , 2009 .
The basic proposition behind the science of climate change is so firmly rooted in the laws of physics that no reasonable person can dispute it .
All other things being equal , adding carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) to the atmosphere — by , for example , burning millions of tons of oil , coal and natural gas — will make it warm up .
That , as the Nobel Prize–winning chemist Svante Arrhenius first explained in 1896 , is because CO 2 is relatively transparent to visible light from the sun , which heats the planet during the day .
But it is relatively opaque to infrared , which the earth tries to reradiate back into space at night .
If the planet were a featureless , monochromatic billiard ball without mountains , oceans , vegetation and polar ice caps , a steadily rising concentration of CO 2 would mean a steadily warming earth .
Period .
But the earth is not a billiard ball .
It is an extraordinarily complex , messy geophysical system with dozens of variables , most of which change in response to one another .
Oceans absorb vast amounts of heat , slowing the warm - up of the atmosphere , yet they also absorb excess CO 2 .
Vegetation soaks up CO 2 as well but eventually re­releases the gas as plants rot or burn — or , in a much longer - term scenario — drift to the bottom of the ocean to form sedimentary rock such as limestone .
Warmer temperatures drive more evaporation from the oceans ; the water vapor itself is a heat - trapping gas , whereas the clouds it forms block some of the sun ’s warming rays .
Volcanoes belch CO 2 , but they also spew particulates that diffuse the sun ’s rays .
And that ’s just a partial list .
Because including all these factors in calculations about the effects of CO 2 increase is hugely difficult , it is no surprise that climate scientists are still struggling to understand how it all will likely turn out .
It is also no surprise , given his track record as something of a climate change agitator , that James Hansen , director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has been circulating a preprint of a journal paper saying that the outcome is likely to turn out worse than most people think .
The most recent major report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 projects a temperature rise of three degrees Celsius , plus or minus 1.5 degrees — enough to trigger serious impacts on human life from rising sea level , widespread drought , changes in weather patterns , and the like .
But according to Hansen and his nine co-authors , who have submitted their paper to Open Atmospheric Science Journal , the correct figure is closer to six degrees C. “ That ’s the equilibrium level , ” he says .
“ We wo n’t get there for a while .
But that ’s where we ’re aiming . ”
And although the full impact of this temperature increase will not be felt until the end of this century or even later , Hansen says , the point at which major climate disruption is inevitable is already upon us .
“ If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted , ” the paper states , “ CO 2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm [ parts per million ] to at most 350 ppm . ”
The situation , he says , “ is much more sensitive than we had implicitly been assuming . ”
As with many of Hansen ’s assertions , this one pushes the science further than some of his colleagues would be willing to go .
Back in 1998 , for example , Hansen was arguing that the human impact on climate was unquestionable , even as other leading climate scientists continued to question it .
He was subsequently proved right , not only about the human influence but about the approximate pace of future temperature rise .
But just as in 1998 , the underlying motivation for his claims , if not all of his conclusions , is shared pretty much universally .
The problem is that conventional projections for how warm things will get come out of a calculation everyone knows is wrong .
Called the Charney sensitivity , it estimates how much the global mean temperature will rise if atmospheric CO 2 is doubled from its preindustrial levels , before people began burning coal and oil on a grand scale .
In the mid-1800s carbon dioxide concentrations stood at about 280 ppm .
Double that to 560 ppm , and the Charney sensitivity calculation tells you that temperatures should rise about three degrees C .
But the Charney sensitivity , though not quite as stripped down as the billiard ball model , is still an oversimplification .
The calculation does take into account some feedback mechanisms that can modify the effects of increasing temperatures on short time­scales — changes in water vapor , clouds and sea ice , for example .
But for the sake of simplicity , it assumes no change in other , longer - term factors , including changes in glaciation and vegetation ; in particulates , such as dust ; and in the ability of the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide , which diminishes as sea temperature rises .
Climate Models Struggle with Reality
“ Many people , ourselves included , have tended to take [ the Charney sensitivity ] and apply it to the real world , ” says Gavin Schmidt , who is also a climatologist at Goddard ( though not a co-author on the new paper ) .
“ But the real world is n’t a model where a few things can change while others stay fixed . ”
At some point , Schmidt says , “ we have to talk about the real climate . ”
That ’s what Hansen has attempted to do .
He is n’t the first : other scientists , including Stephen H. Schneider of Stanford University , have talked for years about bringing additional real - world factors to standard climate models .
The difficulty is that to add those factors , you have to come up with a reasonable way to weight them .
Like other climate scientists , Hansen and his co-authors use evidence from the deep past to sort out these feedback mechanisms .
Over the past 800,000 years , for example , we know that the climate has oscillated between long ice ages and much shorter periods of interglacial warmth — much like the conditions we are in now .
The relation between air temperature and CO 2 is pretty well understood for that period , thanks largely to air bubbles trapped in ancient ice cores that have been drilled in Greenland and Antarctica ( the CO 2 concentration inside them can be measured directly ; the global mean temperature can be calculated from the relative abundances of two different oxygen isotopes , which vary with how warm it gets ) .
But Hansen points out that the record contains other clues .
“ We also know how sea level changed over that period , ” he says , from studies tracing the height of ancient shorelines .
Because sea level rises and falls as continental ice sheets retreat and advance , you have a measure of what fraction of the earth was covered with a bright white , heat - reflecting coating .
As ice retreats in a warming world , more dark surface is exposed to absorb solar radiation , which makes the world even warmer , melting even more of the ice .
Conversely , a cooling world gets cold faster as ice sheets advance .
This is one of the key feedback mechanisms left out of the Charney sensitivity calculation , partly because it is thought to happen only over hundreds of years , and , Hansen says , partly because “ it just had n’t sunk in that the paleoclimate record is a remarkable source of info on climate sensitivity . ”
Using that record , for example , Hansen concludes that even if the human race could maintain today ’s level of atmospheric CO 2 , which stands at 385 ppm — not even halfway to the atmospheric doubling we are headed for — sea level would rise several meters thanks to the disintegration of continental ice sheets .
Moreover , he thinks disintegration may happen much faster than one might naively expect .
“ We did n’t have convincing data on this until we had the gravity satellites , ” he says , referring to GRACE , a pair of orbiters that can detect tiny local changes in the earth ’s gravitational field .
“ Greenland has gone from stable mass in 1990 to increasing ice loss .
Another big surprise is West Antarctica , where despite little actual warming , the ice shelves are melting . ”
As those partially floating ice shelves melt , land - based glaciers are free to slide more rapidly to the sea .
In Greenland , meltwater from the top of the glaciers is evidently pouring down through cracks to lubricate the underside of the ice sheets , easing their flow out to the ocean .
Warming temperatures , Hansen says , not only increase the amount of meltwater on the surface of the ice but also increase rainfall .
“ Ice - sheet growth , ” he says , “ is a dry process .
Disintegration is a wet process , so it goes a lot faster . ”
If today ’s CO 2 levels would lead to several meters of sea - level rise — putting many coastal areas , housing hundreds of millions of people , completely underwater — then letting CO 2 rise to 560 ppm could lead to a disaster of unimaginable proportions .
Even a rise to 450 ppm could be catastrophic , according to Hansen ’s team ’s analysis .
Before about 35 million years ago , the planet was completely ice free , so warm - water alligators and lush redwood forests thrived above the Arctic Circle .
The transition to large - scale glaciation in Antarctica began , the researchers estimate , when CO 2 dropped to 425 ppm , plus or minus 75 ppm .
Most of the ice should therefore disappear again if we reach that point — and if all of Antarctica ’s and Greenland ’s glaciers were to melt , sea level would rise many tens of meters .
The only way to keep CO 2 concentrations as low as that , Schneider says , is to have the entire world adopt California ’s strictest - in - the - nation proposals for limiting carbon emissions — something that is hard to imagine even the other U.S. states agreeing to , let alone developing ­nations such as India and China .
That ’s only taking the feedback from melting glaciers into account .
“ Changes in vegetation , in atmospheric and ocean chemistry , and in aerosols and dust in the atmosphere all appear to be positive feedbacks on temperature changes , ” Schmidt says .
“ If global average temperatures change for any reason , those other elements will amplify the change . ”
Other positive feedbacks include the release of CO 2 dissolved in the oceans , which will happen as they warm up , and the accelerated release of other greenhouse gases — methane , for example , from biomass that will begin rotting as permafrost melts in the Arctic .
Given Hansen ’s eminence as a climate scientist , one might expect that his analysis would have triggered a general panic .
And it has — but not among scientists .
“ This month may have been the most important yet in the two - decade history of the fight against global warming , ” wrote journalist and author Bill McKibben in the Washington Post this past December , shortly after Hansen spoke about his new calculations at a conference : “ [ 350 ppm is ] the number that may define our future . ”
McKibben has even created an organization he calls 350.org to spread the word .
Other activists and bloggers have reacted with similar alarm .
Most climate experts turn out to be much less exercised , even though they take the danger of global warming very seriously .
The reason : Hansen and his colleagues base their new estimate of climate sensitivity and of the various tipping points represented by different feedback mechanisms on a record of ancient conditions that are not really well understood .
“ The problem , ” Schmidt says , “ is that the further back you go , the less you really know .
The error bars get very large . ”
The planet ’s ice - free periods are , he admits , “ very interesting — they ’re like the periods we think we ’re heading for , and in principle they can tell us a lot about the climate sensitivity to CO 2 changes . ”
And although you can infer atmospheric CO 2 levels indirectly , from changes in the acidity of ocean sediments , for instance , Schmidt notes that this involves assumptions that might be wrong .
“ People generally think CO 2 was higher then , but you ca n’t get a precise number or a precise time series .
Jim would say that the true climate sensitivity is twice the Charney sensitivity , but it could be three times , it could be one . ”
Similar uncertainties surround the ebb and flow of continental ice sheets .
“ It ’s quite possible , ” Schmidt says , “ that the ice sheets across North America might have been more sensitive than those in Greenland , which would explain why Greenland ’s have persisted . ”
That appears to be a widespread consensus .
“ Jim ’s analysis is very shrewd , ” says Michael Oppenheimer , a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University .
“ It ’s something we all should be thinking about , but the uncertainties are so large that it ’s a weak point . ”
Schneider , too , offers praise overall but caution about specifics .
“ Jim ’s doing great work , ” he says , “ but I wish he ’d get off absolute numbers .
It ’s not as though the world is okay with 1.8 degrees of warming but turns into a pumpkin at 2.2 or something . ”
Seeking a Workable Solution
Indeed , although few climate scientists are ready to buy Hansen ’s argument in detail , they agree that the changes already observed are ominous .
“ Where I ’ve come down on this , ” says Fred Krupp , president of the Environmental Defense Fund , “ not sparked by Jim Hansen but by watching coral reefs die and Antarctic ice sheets break off sooner than we ever expected , is that we need to stabilize CO 2 at current levels or below . ”
Lurking behind this general tone of caution is the sense that reducing the growth of CO 2 emissions is a daunting enough prospect by itself , given that the world ’s population continues to grow and that countries such as India and China are determined to catch up to the developed world economically .
Halting that growth entirely would be even more difficult , and actually drawing down the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere seems largely inconceivable .
Nevertheless , Hansen and his co-authors lay out a possible strategy .
“ The only way I can see of doing it , ” Hansen says , “ is , first of all , to cut off emissions from coal entirely by 2030 . ”
Coal , he points out , is the single biggest fossil - fuel reservoir of carbon , and because it is only burned in power plants , not as transportation fuel , “ it can be captured at just a few sources rather than millions of tailpipes . ”
To push coal - based carbon emissions down to zero , he and his colleagues suggest , the world has to agree that , starting right away , no new plants will be built unless they have the capability to capture waste CO 2 before it leaves the smokestack .
At the same time , existing plants will either have to be retrofitted with capture technology or phased out by 2030 .
A second major effort , the authors say , would involve massive reforestation of areas that have been denuded of trees .
“ Deforestation contributed a net emission of 60 ± 30 ppm over the past few hundred years , ” they write , “ of which ~ 20 ppm CO 2 remains in the air today . ”
Regrowing forests , they argue , could absorb all of that excess and more .
And finally , they favor the use of “ biochar , ” or charcoal made from agricultural waste and other biomass .
If burned or left to decay , this biomass releases CO 2 .
When converted to charcoal and tilled into the soil , it does two things .
First , it is exceptionally stable , so it keeps carbon sequestered for centuries , at least .
Second , it increases soil fertility , because it adsorbs nutrients and keeps them available for new crops .
“ Replacing slash - and - burn agriculture with slash - and - char , ” they write , “ could provide a CO 2 drawdown of ~ 8 ppm in half a century . ”
More speculative technologies might also eventually be able to draw CO 2 out of the atmosphere and lock it up in minerals , although their potential scale and expense are still guesswork .
But possibility and plausibility are two different things .
Hansen and his colleagues have produced a road map ; getting all the biggest carbon emitters to go along will be tough .
The scheme would take decades to implement even if every nation agreed to it today .
The task , the scientists admit , “ is Herculean yet feasible when compared with the efforts that went into World War II . ”
Schneider , though just as concerned as Hansen about the dangers posed by increasing atmospheric carbon , has a less optimistic view .
“ It has no chance in hell , ” he says .
“ None . Zero .
The best thing we can do is to overshoot , reach 450 or 550 parts per million , then come back as quickly as possible on the back end . ”
And even that , given the political barriers to quick and effective action , will be difficult .

The flag was the centrepiece of an agreement - signing ceremony
The government has said it regrets displaying the Union flag upside down at the signing of a trade agreement .
A plastic flag was flown incorrectly for a ceremony involving Gordon Brown , Chinese premier Wen Jiabao and Trade Secretary Lord Mandelson .
The Flag Institute said it was " concerned " about the mistake and Tory MP Andrew Rosindell called it " an unbelievable flaw in protocol " .
BBC
News website readers got in touch to point out the error .
The Union flag - more commonly described as the Union Jack - has been in use since the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland came into force in 1801 .
Complaints
There is a specific way of hanging it , with the thick white parts of the diagonal cross nearest the flagpole being placed above the thinner white parts .
But , at the treaty - signing ceremony in Downing Street on Monday , a flag was displayed upside down .
Close - up view of the flag as displayed by Downing Street Mike Kearsley , director general of the Flag Institute , said : " My first reaction is ' here we go again ' .
" One part of me is concerned that we do n't recognise and understand our own flag but another part of me is amused that it 's a terribly British thing to do .
" You would think people in Downing Street would recognise it because they see the flag so often .
Many places in government these days have people working from overseas and maybe they do n't understand .
The flag as it should be displayed " If we had flown the Chinese flag upside down it could have been quite a diplomatic problem . "
Mr Kearsley added : " I 'm surprised that people of the calibre of Mandelson and the prime minister could allow such as mistake .
" They were just little plastic flags on wooden sticks , which you could easily take off and put back the right way up .
" In some parts of Europe you will see four flags flying from public buildings - the national , EU , district and town flags .
They seem to get it right .
So should we . "
The term Union Jack specifically refers to the flag flown at the front of Royal Navy ships when in port .
' Distress '
But it has become synonymous with the Union flag , with many experts now regarding the terms as interchangeable .
Mr Kearsley said : " Having the flag upside down historically was a sign of distress .
You might have put it up on a fort to warn those in the know - other British forces - that there was trouble from the enemy .
" Forces from other nations would n't have noticed .
It was like a sort of code . "
Mr Rosindell , MP for Romford and chairman of the Commons all - party flag group , said : " It 's an unbelievable flaw in protocol by Number 10 .
" You would think they would know which way the flag was flown .
Whoever is responsible for this should know better . "
In a statement , Downing Street said : " It is regrettable that , on this occasion , the Union flag was not displayed correctly .
" We have looked into how this happened and have taken steps to ensure it is correctly displayed at all times in the future . "

I ’ll be given a punishment of one year in prison .
I do n’t agree with the law but that is what it is .
I ca n’t pretend that nothing is happening , i ca n’t write about food .
When government can , thanks to new camera technology , suddenly gather and compile extensive private information about us from our activities in public space , then the old rule of thumb – that surveillance of our public activities violates no “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” simply because those acts happen in the open , where anyone can observe them – no longer works to protect the underlying principles behind Fourth Amendment privacy protection .
Why is this bad ?
It ’s more about who ’s got good hair , and who ’s got bad hair ( like all these freaky people , rivaling Sanjaya ’s insane mohawk ) .
Who looked most absurd ?
FUCK YALL lol
That ’s why celebrities are on the neverending quest to find the most exclusive , hard to get items their money can buy .
It ’s a mutual feeling .
The way I look at it anyway .
It is a new era and a new chapter in American politics .
Wishing for more regulation might give you a real supprise .
The fundamental problem is simply not being addressed – businesses , public sector workers and others continue to be subject to incessant Government interference .
It also means not being afraid of popular anger .
I ’m about to fill you in on a little secret .
If you have ever suffered from the dreaded ring of perspiration under your arms when you are n’t working out in the gym , then keep reading this secret .
People are all very polite , because they ’re all related to each other .
Okay , to be honest , the whole time , I was trying to steer it towards Kevin Bacon , but it never got there 🙂
I maybe could have done it if I sacrificed what mild coherence I managed to salvage .
I actually went about two paragraphs farther , but it did n’t even resemble coherence ; just random quotes from celebrity and movie gossip sites .
By the end I was cheating outright to guide the pseudo - random walk , but it ’s just too damn hard to find people talking about A Few Good Men when you ’re limited to google results from one sentence .

The U.S. average price for regular unleaded gasoline rose by nearly 12 cents in the past three weeks , marking the first increase in six months , according to a national survey released Sunday .
" It is the first rise since July 11 last year when prices hit their all - time high , " said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the survey .
The average price of self - serve regular unleaded gasoline is $ 1.78 , according to the Lundberg Survey , which is based on responses from more than 5,000 service stations nationwide .
The latest survey looked at prices January 9 .
" The price had to hit bottom sometime , " Lundberg said .
She said part of the reason for the price spike is recent indications of production cuts among OPEC members , which are aimed at driving up oil prices during a time of year when there is a decreased demand for gasoline .
" January historically is the lowest gasoline usage month , " Lundberg said .
Despite the increase , gas prices are still $ 1.29 lower than they were on January 11 , 2008 , she said .
Drivers in Billings , Montana , had the cheapest gas on average , paying $ 1.34 .
Motorists in Anchorage , Alaska , paid the most , at $ 2.32 .

The award for band you 're least likely to have heard before ( but should check out this minute ) goes to The Lost Fingers , a Quebec City acoustic trio whose album , Lost in the 80's , is comprised of gypsy - style renditions of songs like Tainted Love and Pump Up The Jam .
They were nominated for Album of the Year and the Juno Fan Choice Award .
Their inclusion was one of few surprises , as the major categories were dominated by previous winners and nominees .
" This year it seems the trend is going back in time , with nominees like Bryan Adams and k.d. lang , " said Ben Rispin of Burlington , Ontario pop-punk group Saint Alvia , who were nominated for Video of the Year for their song Blonde Kryptonite .
" My grandma 's going to be really excited , " said Liam Cormier of hardcore band Cancer Bats , who were nominated for New Group of the Year despite the fact they 've been together since 2004 .

Chris McKhool , doing his own PR in a room where publicists probably formed the majority , earned his first Juno nomination for his fourth children 's album , Fiddle Fire !
" I did n't really believe it until I saw my name on the screen . "
Veteran MC D-Sisive also scored his first - ever Juno nomination for Rap Recording of the Year for his album The Book , which was his first release in seven years .
" It was a bit of a frightening record to put out , " he said , adding he debated whether to even release the album .
" To go from not doing anything , and then here I am , a Juno nominee , it feels pretty cool . "
The most hotly contested category may prove to be Contemporary Jazz Album of the Year .
Brothers Michael and Roberto Occhipinti are up against each other for the Juno .
" I 'd be very , very happy if his record won , " said Roberto .
" But I would n't mind if I won , either . "
The 2009 Juno Awards take place March 29 in Vancouver , B.C. , " one of those cities , " quipped Peters , " where you can pretty much have a good time without a Juno . "

It has been awhile since I updated my blog .
I attribute it to work –the never ending stream of things to do kind of weights me down and I lose interest in all things technical from time to time .
I ’m on a new project at work now , and I ’m quite keen for it .
It ’s still the same old low level C / Assembly firmware development , but I get to work with serial RapidIO technology and that has been quite interesting .
3.125 Gbps links !
I like this better than the former project working on MAC - layer software for a communication protocol .
I either want to be working at the PHY level directly accessing or working with the hardware , or I want to be up higher on the application level solving interesting problems .
Speaking of the application level , in late December I picked up my Erlang studies again , and I ’m making good progress in understanding how to use it .
I ’m implementing a simple chat server so I can wrap my mind around Erlang processes , file I/O and TCP sockets .
Having programmed a server in C/ C++ before I can really appreciate how great Erlang is for network computing .
The code is so much more concise than the multithreaded C++ server I wrote in the past .
I ’m not using the Erlang OTP libraries yet , I ’m working with the gen_tcp library since it is familiar to BSD - style socket programming .
I ’ve even dabled in a some Python scripts for testing the server .
Like how Perl has become my tool of choice for “ glueing ” things together , I can see myself using Python more often for testing in the future .
Progress has been good , but I feel really shaky with strings at the moment .
Manipulating text is something any software has to do , but I find that the first thing that pops to my mind is the C++ STL string library , so I go searching for a similar library in the Erlang man pages .
I suppose that this must be expected –I just do n’t know which libraries to use yet and it will take time to get the hang of them .
It took me awhile to master the use of the C++ STL string library and its algorithms , and I ’m just going to have to figure out which Erlang libraries have the functions I need .
Perhaps I ’ll draft a tutorial on Erlang string processing if I learn enough ?
The good news is that my confidence with the language is increasing , tail recursion does n’t seem that awkward , and immutable variables make complete sense now .
I wo n’t be using Erlang at work any time soon ( not the right problem domain ) , but for personal enrichment and for learning new ways of doing things I ’m quite pleased with Erlang .
If I ever get into application network programming ( or network services ) , I know what tool I ’ll be choosing .

Who would not love to see mechanics of zombie and zombie 15 ’ which is combined to bring up the Left 4 Dead themed shooter video game ?
Having in mind that we are calling the abominations and fatties “ Tanks ” and “ Boomers ” .
It is also a surprise that we have never had a set of survivors who are matching on the L4D teams .
But then it may also be as a result of the mechanics of the Left 4 Dead and the zombie design that is so close to L4D securing the L4D crew which would infringe on IP for Valve to sue .
Hence you can get both sets of the special infected and the sets of survivors .
Wait no more buy an officially licensed Left 4 Dead and enjoy the game !

Valve shooters have a common tremendous sense of forwarding momentum .
This includes sweet music , a combination of level design and also a narrative agency .
The L4D3 has an AL director who will either plant the lone zombies along its paths and or sweep up in the tied of the dead .
This makes this shooter video game enticing and the Duties of Al directors guide you on wards .

After a period of time Valve launched steam which accounted at least half the digital PC game sales .
Later Valve employed about 250 people who enabled Valve enters the game hardware market that sold Steam Machine .
Some build the gaming PC ’s which also run Valve ’s Steam OS .

Valve is a cooperation which is considered one among the best influential companies in the game industries .
The invention of the Steam and also reception of games has made Valve to be the top game developers and it is still the most powerful in the PC gaming .

DETROIT  After General Motors won a $ 13.4 billion lifeline from the Treasury Department in December , it focused on meeting a deadline , set for next Tuesday , to produce a plan to show it would be a viable business over the long term .
But , with less than a week to go , the person whom the company needs to impress most with its plan  a federal car czar  has not been appointed .
G.M. is not waiting to take the more drastic steps it deems necessary to reorganize and shrink .
The automaker said on Tuesday that it would cut 10,000 salaried jobs , or 14 percent of its white - collar work force , by the end of this year .
These are the first large cuts in staff in its vast international operations .
The move follows a recent buyout offer to all of G.M. ’s hourly workers in the United States .
The company is also studying options for possibly selling its Hummer and Saab divisions , and either eliminating or significantly downsizing its Saturn and Pontiac brands .
Army recruiting to pause amid tales of nightmare job Army recruiters describe nightmare of job

Staff Sgt. Daren Stewart remembers driving down a rural road in Arkansas and thinking how easy it would be to jerk the wheel and flip his car into a ditch .
The 27 - year - old Iraq war veteran says he was n’t suicidal .
He just figured that injuring himself was the only way he could get any time off from his job as an Army recruiter .
“ I would rather spend three years straight in Iraq , without coming home , without a break , than ever be a recruiter again , ” said Stewart , who recruited in Hot Springs , Ark. , from 2005 to 2008 .
Five - hundred miles away in Houston , the suicides of four Army recruiters from a single battalion have focused lawmakers and veterans advocates on the enormous stress endured by soldiers tasked with refilling the ranks of the all - volunteer military during wartime .
In response to the deaths , the Army will suspend all recruiting nationwide Friday to focus on leadership training , suicide prevention and the health of its 8,900 recruiters .
The Army Inspector General also is examining working conditions throughout U.S. Army Recruiting Command .
In interviews with the Houston Chronicle , current and former recruiters and their relatives from 10 of the Army ’s 38 recruiting battalions detailed their own experiences in a job long considered one of the military ’s toughest .
They said the exhausting hours , degrading treatment and toxic command climate reported in Houston were not isolated incidents , but deep - rooted , widespread problems that have affected recruiters across the country for years .
Lt. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley of U.S. Army Accessions Command said soldiers have a right to complain , but in visits to recruiting stations , he has encountered a very positive , sensitive command climate .
“ I ’m not going to ask for anecdotal information because I ’ve been in the Army 33 years and if I walk into a unit and ask what is wrong , I get an earful , but when I ask what is good , I get balance , ” said Freakley , whose command oversees USAREC .
At the strip mall in Hot Springs where Daren Stewart worked , however , most of the recruiters were on antidepressants or antianxiety medication .
They worked 12 - to 14 - hour shifts , six or seven days a week , Stewart said .
Commanders cursed , humiliated and screamed at soldiers who fell short of monthly quotas , threatening to ruin their careers or withhold time off with loved ones , he said .
Stewart turned to alcohol to cope with stress so severe it destroyed his marriage and made his hair fall out .
Sgt. 1st Class Henry Patrick said fellow recruiters in the Hot Springs station were told to shift conversations with potential recruits away from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That did n’t sit right with him .
“ I ’d tell them they had a 50 - 50 chance , ” said Patrick , 43 .
“ For the few people I did put in , they liked the fact that I was honest with them . ”
Life - or - death situation
Staff Sgt. Wade Bozeman , another Hot Springs recruiter , said he also hated the tacit expectation that he should compromise his ethics to meet recruiting goals , whether it meant falsifying records or lying to recruits .
Deeply depressed , the 37 - year - old gained 50 pounds and started suffering from insomnia , blackouts and panic attacks .
His wife , Jill Bozeman , asked his commanders for help , to no avail .
One morning in May 2008 , Bozeman showed up at his home disoriented , fearful and angry .
When he left , his wife panicked .
“ I knew he ’d lost it , ” she said .
“ I picked up the phone , and I was shaking because I ’m seeing him shoot a bunch of people or run his car into oncoming traffic or something . ”
She called his station commander and told him he had two hours to help or she was going to call battalion headquarters and the local media .
Bozeman credits his wife for saving his life .
Later that morning , he drove to Little Rock Air Force Base to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and checked himself into a mental hospital for four days .
His therapist said he would likely suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder once he left recruiting .
The irony is that he was a good recruiter , Bozeman said .
He won awards and was even asked to consider a future as a station commander .
“ Eventually the system takes down whoever ’s in it , ” he said .
“ You either become part of it , or you go mad .
I guess I did both . ”
In Watertown , N.Y. , Army recruiter Derrick Meadows ’ rage and frustration nearly shattered his family , said his wife , Alison Meadows .
When the Afghanistan veteran struggled to meet quota , his commanders threatened to kick him out of the Army , she said .
“ They ’d tell him he sucks , tell him he ’s not worth anything , tell him he does n’t deserve to be a soldier , ” she said .
The staff sergeant who had served in the military for 18 of his 37 years felt like a failure , she said .
At home , his insecurity translated into anger .
“ He just changed into a completely different person , ” Alison said .
“ He was all the time mad .
He was very frustrated .
He would cry . ”
In November , Derrick left recruiting and returned to a regular Army unit in Texas .
His wife says she ’s relieved , but still bitter .
“ That ’s all that matters , numbers and getting people in the Army , ” she said .
“ Individual soldiers do n’t matter .
Families do n’t matter . ”
A hope for change
Steve Round , 38 , was a top recruiter in Texas before becoming a recruiter trainer for the Salt Lake City battalion in the 1990s .
His work took him to recruiting stations in seven states .
He remembers a recruiter who almost jumped off a bridge in Twin Falls , Idaho , and another who showed up at the station buck naked and ended up in a mental hospital .
Another attempted suicide in Roy , Utah , he said .
“ It ’s the way it ’s been from 1980 to the present day , ” Round said .
“ If you do n’t put in your two people come hell or high water , you go from hero to zero very fast . ”
Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Collins is optimistic USAREC can change .
He recruited in Houston from 2006 to 2008 before becoming a station commander in Kokomo , Ind. , where conditions are better .
In the aftermath of the suicides in Houston , he said , USAREC announced shorter work hours for all recruiters .

Now that you have watched the video , has your opinion about her decision changed ?
Theres a lot of weird stuff about my granddad .
Theres too much to explain and so I wo n't tell it all right now but theres been suspicions and too many people thinking the same way for it to just be a coincedence .
Theres been a lot of unnormal things about me and it all started when my mom was gonna be homeless and kicked out by Dave ( my dad ) and so she had to move in with her parents .
I will cut at that point that Granddad had a hidden life but she found out only by breaking the law , I wo n't say too much because I do n't wanna be arrested but hes done so much illegal stuff and is a big time criminal but he always puts this perfect act and the only way you can find out his true self is by reading his personal emails , searching his floppy disks ( which my grandma did ) and they found a lot of imcriminating stuff he was doing that she never knew .
but the law always defends the satanists , and perfectionists thats why I hate cops a lot now back to the story .
I , my mom , my grandma , my aunt , and probably others think my granddad did stuff to them , my grandma got a sexually transmitted disease that ate her colon , I think I was molested because after I went through puberty sometime after I went through weird stuff like being obcessed with using hand sanitizer , and I have been having temper tantrums from two years old till this day .
I even feel fearful of myself that I will keep throwing temper tantrums till the day I die and it all surronds my granddad .
He grew legal drug plants that were from the mint family and were worser then LSD , and he even talked about this drug with us at a later time which I thought was weird .
I am now thinking that I was molested either once of multiple times by him but I can't remember anything about that .
My aunt too can't even remember her childhood and she was a straight girl and she never had sex with women but at some point as an adult when grandma wanted to leave granddad aunt loretta became a big time meanie and a lesbian and she defends granddad till the end .
and not just my aunt , everybody turned against my grandma and me and my mom for sticking with my grandparents .
She did her best as a mother and everyone attacked her .
My aunts lover even threw a football at my private parts and laughed at me and my aunt was laughing but my private hurted throughout the night .
from discoveries , he owns a Satanic bible , he does n't believe in Jesus , and so does my cousin Nick after granddad was through with him .
He was also into hypnosis and he knew a lot about the computer and yet he needed help a bunch of times and acted like a idiot .
That bible I found out because hes giving my mom a satanic bible and so it 's like he wants her to be a satanist and he wants me to do the same .
It seems like he brings a lot of demon attacks and I 'm afraid if this man .
Thats what I feel like .
Theres a lot of weird stuff about him and his mother and him was obsessed with the occult .
They even had trinkets of the occult .
Most of the only ways to find out about his double life is illegal and very few ways are legal but he tries to cover it up .
He is into a lot of deep evil stuff and wo n't tell anybody about it while exercises it to harm the entire family , give my grandma a disease that eats up her colon , I can't get rid of the temper tantrums , not even psychotic drugs or help can help me .
He complains about the government and yet him and his buddies gains over $ 300,000 and works for money and steals from my grandma and put her in debt and so hes got a s*** load of money in a hidden account my grandma tried to snoop to find .
He also writes reports about the drugs his coworkers do , and writes all the illegal stuff they do and then he threatens to report them unless they help him cheat the government .
Hes like apart of the secret blackops mafia and nobody can doi a thing to fight him or they might end up in prison and he looks like a Saint .
He gives me very creepy feelings and me and my both feel weird about him and yet fooled my grandma for over 45 years .
I wonder if I need to flee from this scary man who claims to be my grandfather .
I wonder if I should get away from him ?
How can I get away from a occult mafia member ?
How do I get away from a true manipulative satanist ?
Google and a group of partners have released a set of tools designed to help broadband customers and researchers measure performance of Internet connections .
The set of tools , at MeasurementLab.net , includes a network diagnostic tool , a network path diagnostic tool and a tool to measure whether the user 's broadband provider is slowing BitTorrent peer - to - peer ( P - to - P ) traffic .
Coming soon to the M - Lab applications is a tool to determine whether a broadband provider is giving some traffic a lower priority than other traffic , and a tool to determine whether a provider is degrading certain users or applications .
" Transparency is our goal , " said Vint Cerf , chief Internet evangelist at Google and a co-developer of TCP / IP .
" Our intent is to make more [ information ] visible for all who are interested in the way the network is functioning at all layers . "
The tools will not only allow broadband customers to test their Internet connections , but also allow security and other researchers to work on ways to improve the Internet , Cerf said .
Current Internet performance tools " are geeky to the extreme , " he said during a Washington , D.C. , forum on the M - Lab tools .
The M - Lab project , launched Wednesday , comes after controversy over network management practices by Comcast and other broadband providers .
Earlier this month , two officials at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission questioned why Comcast , the largest cable modem provider in the U.S. , was exempting its own VoIP ( voice over Internet protocol ) from traffic congestion slowdowns , but not offering the same protections to competing VoIP services .
The FCC letter to Comcast came after commissioners ruled in August that the broadband provider 's decision to slow some P - to - P traffic violated the agency 's network neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from blocking or slowing Internet traffic or applications .
News reports in late 2007 unveiled Comcast 's practice of slowing some BitTorrent traffic .
Comcast later said it was slowing traffic only at times of peak congestion , but the FCC and other groups disputed that the traffic management was limited .
Comcast declined to comment on the M - Labs effort .
The set of tools will allow broadband customers to measure their providers ' performance , said Michael Calabrese , director of the Wireless Future Program at the New America Foundation , a think tank involved in the M - Lab project .
Consumers " deserve to be well - informed " about their broadband performance , he said .
Some of the M - Lab tools have already been released , but participants in the project plan to further develop the tools and host them on servers around the world , added Sascha Meinrath , research director at the Wireless Future Program .
All the M - Lab tools will be released under open - source licenses , allowing others to modify and improve them , he said .
People on either side of a debate on whether the FCC or U.S. Congress should develop network neutrality rules should welcome the tools , said Ed Felten , director of the Center for Information Policy and a computer science and public policy professor at Princeton University .
It took months for policymakers to gather solid information on Comcast 's network management practices , but net neutrality advocates can use the tools if they suspect broadband providers of interfering with traffic .
" If you believe that network neutrality government regulation is not needed , if you believe that the market will handle this ... then you should also welcome Measurement Labs , " Felten said .
" What you are appealing to is a process of public discussion ... in which consumers move to the ISP [ Internet service provider ] that gives them the best performance .
It 's a market that 's facilitated by better information . "
However , one ISP industry source , who asked not to be identified , questioned whether the tools would accurately point to the cause of broadband problems .
Spyware or malware on computers can affect browser performance , and problems with the wider Internet can cause slowdowns , the source said .
The M - Labs partners seemed to bypass broadband providers when putting together their tools , the source added .
" It may appear that issues that are occurring off an ISP 's network may be the ISP 's problem , " the source said of the tools .
" It 's important for groups like this to collaborate , not only among themselves , but also with ISPs . "
EXCLUSIVE :
Eric H. Holder Jr. ’s confirmation as attorney general is speeding toward approval thanks in part to his private assurances to a key Republican senator that he does not intend to prosecute intelligence agency interrogators for their actions during the prior administration .
The assurances , reported by Sen. Christopher S. Bond , Missouri Republican , to The Washington Times on Wednesday , went beyond Mr. Holder ’s earlier public testimony in which he said he could not prejudge his actions regarding cases he had not seen .
“ I believe [ Mr. Holder ] will look forward to keep the nation safe and not look backwards to prosecute intelligence operators who were fighting terror and kept our country safe since 9/11 , ” Mr. Bond said in the interview .
However , an aide to Mr. Holder who requested anonymity because the nominee has not been confirmed , disputed this version of events .
“ Eric Holder has not made any commitments about who would or would not be prosecuted , ” the aide said .
“ He explained his position to Senator Bond as he did in the public hearing and in his responses to written questions . ”
Still , Mr. Holder ’s private comments to Mr. Bond were important to moving his nomination forward .
Mr. Bond was strongly considering blocking Mr. Holder ’s confirmation based on questions arising from some of Mr. Holder ’s public statements , a senior aide to Mr. Bond said .
But after meeting with Mr. Holder twice over the past week and having received assurances that he was not intent on pursuing intelligence officials who acted in good faith with proper authorization in the conduct of interrogations , Mr. Bond decided to support the nominee , the aide added .
On Wednesday , the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 17 - 2 to favorably recommend Mr. Holder , 58 , for the post .
The full Senate is expected to confirm Mr. Holder soon as the nation ’s first black attorney general .
The full Senate continued to fill out President Obama ’s national security team Wednesday , confirming by voice vote retired Adm. Dennis Blair to be director of national intelligence .
Mr. Blair last Thursday hinted strongly that he would forgo dealing with intelligence community interrogators through the courts .
During his confirmation hearings Mr. Blair said he did not intend to reopen those cases of those officers who acted within their duties , in response to a question about water - boarding from Sen. Carl Levin , Michigan Democrat .
The Bush administration said the practice , widely denounced as torture , was used on three individuals , including 9 - 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Mr. Blair said , I ’m hesitating to set a standard here which will put in jeopardy some of the dedicated intelligence officers who checked to see that what they were doing was legal and then did what they were told to do .
Also Wednesday , the ACLU announced that it would seek the declassification of some 41 memos from the Bush administrations Office of Legal Counsel dealing with surveillance and interrogation policies .
These documents have been sought by some Democrats in Congress .
ACLU legislative director , Caroline Fredrickson , said the disclosure of the memos could force the Justice Department to begin investigations into some Bush - era policymakers .
As a result of this flurry of activity , the exact content of the conversation between Mr. Bond and Mr. Holder is important to partisans on both sides of the aisle .
Sen . Russ Feingold , a Wisconsin Democrat who favors prosecution of former Bush officials for practicing what President Bush called “ enhanced interrogation ” and which critics deemed torture , said Wednesday that Mr. Holder “ signaled a new direction ” for the Justice Department with two statements he made during his confirmation hearing : “ Waterboarding is torture ” and “ No one is above the law . ”
“ With these simple words , Eric Holder reassured the nation that the Department of Justice will be run by someone who believes in the rule of law and in impartial justice , ” Mr. Feingold said .
“ It is sad , of course , that this is something remarkable .
But that is where the last eight years have left us . ”
But Mr. Bond read something else in Mr. Holder ’s private words to him .
“ I made it clear that trying to prosecute political leaders would generate a political firestorm the Obama administration does n’t need , ” Mr. Bond said he told Mr. Holder .
“ I was concerned about previous statements he made and others had made , ” Mr. Bond said .
“ He gave me assurances that he would not take those steps that would cause major disruptions in our intelligence system or cause political warfare .
We do n’t need that kind of political warfare .
He gave me assurances he is looking forward . ”
Mr. Holder gave similar assurances last week in a little - noticed written response to questions from Republican Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas .
Mr. Holder indicated that he would not prosecute any intelligence officers who participated in the interrogation program and who had followed Justice Department guidance .
“ Prosecutorial and investigative judgments must depend on the facts and no one is above the law , ” Mr. Holder wrote .
“ But where it is clear that a government agent has acted in ‘ reasonable and good faith reliance on Justice Department legal opinions ’ authoritatively permitting his conduct , I would find it difficult to justify commencing a full - blown criminal investigation , let alone a prosecution . ”
Mr. Bond told The Times that Mr. Holder also pledged in a private meeting Tuesday not to reopen the issue of immunity from civil lawsuits for telecommunications companies that cooperated with the National Security Agency after the Sept. 11 attacks - another potential obstacle to the nomination among Republican senators .
Ms. Fredrickson contacted Democratic senators after news of Mr. Bond ’s conversation and was told that Mr. Holder “ had not committed to withholding or pursuing prosecutions of any particular case involving torture allegations . ”
She added , “ It ’s vital to the rule of law that we have the facts before decisions regarding prosecutions occur .
We ’re pleased that Mr. Holder , as a nominee to be the nation ’s top law enforcement agent , appears to agree . ”
Mr. Holder testified for nearly eight hours last week , but Republicans said afterward that they were still unsure about whether he would seek to prosecute soldiers and intelligence officials who practiced or ordered harsh interrogation techniques .
Mr. Holder received an important boost Tuesday when Sen. Arlen Specter , Pennsylvania Republican and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , announced he would support the nomination .
Mr. Specter called “ satisfactory ” Mr. Holder ’s statements that interrogation techniques authorized by legal opinions would provide a strong cover from prosecutions .
Mr. Specter said Mr. Holder could not make any more explicit statements without knowing the facts of specific cases .
Mr. Holder is all but certain to be confirmed by the Democrat - controlled Senate .
A vote on his nomination has not been scheduled , though a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , said the chamber could vote as early as Thursday .

This month , the company ’s top product developer and co-founder , Andreas von Bechtolsheim , left as chief architect to become chairman and chief development officer at a start - up company .
And the global financial crisis is pounding the company as Wall Street and telecommunications customers , which make up an estimated 40 percent of Sun ’s sales , have collapsed or curtailed technology spending .
Image Jonathan I. Schwartz , Sun Microsystems  chief executive , says weakness in the broader economy is hurting his company .
Credit ... Kimberly White / Reuters
Sun ’s results were announced after the market close .
Shares closed at $ 5.29 in regular trading Thursday , up nearly 10 percent , giving the company a market value of about $ 4 billion despite annual sales of about $ 14 billion .
The low market capitalization , combined with Sun ’s vast intellectual property portfolio and $ 2 billion in cash , suggest to some observers that Sun needs to do something drastic to bring out its shareholder value .
Options include going private with the help of supportive investors or selling its old - line server business to its partner , Fujitsu .
Sun moved Thursday to placate Wall Street by disclosing more information than usual about its various product lines , showing strong growth with some of its more radical server designs and traditionally slow - selling storage products .
It also hinted at impending layoffs .
It is unclear if that is enough to satisfy some of Sun ’s largest investors .
“ They need to cut , ” said Chris Whitmore , an analyst with Deutsche Bank .
Over the last few months , Southeastern Asset Management , a Memphis investment firm run by O. Mason Hawkins , has acquired more than 20 percent of the company .
Southeastern has said it expects to actively engage in discussions with Sun ’s management and third parties about the company ’s future .
In a rare public comment , Jason E. Dunn , a vice president at Southeastern , said Thursday that “ competitors and bears ” have highlighted Sun ’s low stock price , while ignoring its cash , the value of Sun ’s technology assets and its chances to cut costs .
“ We are seeking the best ways to capitalize on Sun ’s large intrinsic value , ” Mr. Dunn said .
Sun ’s woes stem in part from declining sales of servers that run the Unix operating system  a long - shrinking market dominated by Sun , I.B.M. and Hewlett - Packard .
Sun has poured billions of dollars into new products meant to offset these losses , but many of the products are a year or more late to market .
( CNN ) -- Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales spoke to CNN's Campbell Brown on Tuesday about his record at the Justice Department , including the firing of nine U.S. attorneys , allegedly for political reasons .
Here are excerpts of the interview :
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says the new administration will make mistakes , too .
Alberto Gonzales :
Well , I hope history will reflect the fact that during my tenure both at the White House and at the Department of Justice we did a tremendous job in protecting our country and also as attorney general we focused on protecting our kids from sexual predators , we focused on making our neighborhoods safe from guns and drugs .
The level of prosecutions with respect to public corruption far exceeded what the previous administration did and so many people are focused on the little negatives that occurred .
Campbell Brown : But ...
Gonzales :
As soon as mistakes were made .
But a lot was accomplished .
Brown :
These were not little negatives .
And we can go through the list , but let 's talk about -- let 's start by talking about how politicized the Justice Department became .
An inspector general found that .
There is nothing partisan about that .
Your office fired nine U.S. attorneys for political reasons .
There has been no disagreement about that .
I mean , how could you let that happen ?
Gonzales : Campbell , Campbell , Campbell .
I disagree with that .
You said that nine U.S. attorneys were fired for partisan political reasons .
That 's not what the report said .
Quite the opposite .
The report clearly found that there were performance related reasons for the removal of most of these U.S. attorneys and with respect to the remainder , they did n't have enough information to draw definite conclusions .
Now I clearly will acknowledge that there were political considerations taken with respect to the hiring decisions made by some of the staff within the Department of Justice .
It 's something that I condemn and it should n't have happened .
Brown :
Well , the inspector general 's report that was issued , of course , during the Bush administration , I mean , found that you had been , quote , " remarkably unengaged " in the process and you quote , " abdicated your responsibility to safeguard the integrity and independence of the Justice Department . "
' No Bias , No Bull '
Get the latest on the day 's main events .

Gonzales :
Well , again , I take issue with some of the things that were in that report .
I 've already testified , as I 've indicated before and spoken to the American public about wishing that I had done things differently with respect to the removal of the U.S. attorneys .
But I think you need to look at the overall record of the department during my tenure and the good things that we accomplished
Brown : OK .
I 've got to ask you about something else .
I mean , in addition to what happened with the firing of those people , you have been vilified for something else and that was for the visit that you and Andy Card [ then chief of staff for President Bush ] paid to then - Attorney General John Ashcroft when he was in the hospital .
This is when you were White House counsel .
You went to demand that Ashcroft expand the government 's ability to spy on Americans without a warrant .
And this man is lying in a hospital bed , he had just had surgery , his aide had to come in to intervene to stop you and Andy Card from doing this .
Many just saw this as being beyond the bounds of decency .
Honestly , what were you thinking when you did that ?
Gonzales : Campbell , you described this visit as a visit to go demand something from General Ashcroft .
Andy Card and I were sent on behalf of the president of the United States to talk to General Ashcroft .
It was an announced visit .
We were sent there on behalf of the president to inform the attorney general of a very important meeting that we had just had at the White House with congressional leadership about probably the most important intelligence collection program for the United States government .
Andy and I never had any intention of taking advantage of a sick man .
We were there , sent on behalf of the president , to deliver information that everyone believed was vital to the national security interests of our country .
Brown :
Let me move on and ask you about waterboarding , which was a subject that got an enormous amount of attention when you were attorney general .
Everybody from [ Arizona Republican Sen . ]
John McCain , who was tortured , to Mike McConnell , President Bush 's intelligence chief , have said that waterboarding is in fact torture .
If you look at public opinion polls , the public believes it is by a wide margin .
But you 've never been able to say or you 've never been willing to say whether it is or not .
Why not ?
Why can't you answer that question ?
Gonzales : I 'll answer that question by saying that judgments about legal issues often produce disagreements .
Clearly there is no disagreement about the principle of not torturing .
That is something that President Bush announced that his administration would follow that principle , which we tried to do .
The issue of coercive interrogation to gather information from dangerous crim -- dangerous terrorists to help protect our country is one that we clearly wrestled with .
It is an issue that this administration is going to wrestle with .
I 'll conclude by simply saying that I wish the best of luck to this administration in gathering information to protect our country , not in the abstract , but in the real world of fighting a global war on terror .
Brown :
Well , what have you learned ?
I mean , take a step back and put this in perspective for me .
A bigger picture here .
What regrets do you have ?
What did you learn from this experience ?
Gonzales :
Well , what I learned is that at this level you 're going to make mistakes .
And if you believe that Eric Holder is n't going to make a mistake or that the next president is not going to make a mistake , then just sadly mistaken about the kinds of issues that we have to deal with every day .
Issue after issue after issue .
You can not be paralyzed by criticism .
You can not be paralyzed by the notion that you 're going to make a mistake .
You have to do the very best you can in making judgments .
If you make a mistake , you identify those mistakes .
You correct them if you can .
I 've also learned that , quite frankly , people are simply going to criticize you and that 's just part of being in these kinds of positions and I accept that .
I think some of the criticism is unfair and unwarranted , but nonetheless that comes with being the attorney general .
Brown :
You 've had trouble finding a job since you left public office .
Most people would leave public service with many opportunities .
Why not you ?
Gonzales :
With respect to employment , listen , I can understand in a very tough economy , some employers are going to be very hesitant about bringing someone like me on when you have ongoing investigation .
That is why I am working as hard as I can with my legal team to try to get these investigations completed as quickly as possible , because I am anxious to move on to the next phase of my life .
I feel like I still have a lot to contribute to our community and to our country and I want to do so .
Brown : Judge Gonzales , we appreciate you taking the time to talk to us .
Thank you very much .
Gonzales : Thank you , Campbell .

The UK is finally in disarray , GBP continues to be sold off .
The nail in the coffin has come from the dovish comments from BOE ’s Blanchflower , sating that ‘ the UK recession may intensify significantly and it ’s too early to gauge when the economy will start to recover .
This is not the bottom ; I expect the 1stQ to be worse than the 4th , probably significantly worse .
I do n’t see any signs of green shoots at the moment . ’
The US $ is weaker the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US housing data above anything else remains consistent .
Another dismal print was achieved despite falling prices .
Sales of previously owned US homes unexpectedly declined - 5.3 % to an annual rate of +4.49 m units , the lowest print in a dozen years .
This is once again strong evidence that the US housing slump is probably a long way from bottoming out .
More disturbing is that the median prices have now declined 15 % y/y to 6 - year low .
Interestingly distressed properties accounted for 45 % of all sales .
Analysts believe that investors may have been waiting for details of the US governments plans aimed at stemming foreclosures and declining home values .
ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s initiatives to aid the housing problems and the economy may lift home re-sales by about +900 k units according to some analysts .
This of course would reduce the massive inventory issue and help prices , but , with the US unemployment rate expected to edge higher will remain the biggest threat to this scenario .
With such a large inventory issue , prices can only go south for foreseeable future .
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR +0.22 % , GBP +0.31 % , CHF +0.23 % and higher against JPY - 0.19 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.05 % and AUD +0.26 % .
As predicted oil settlement day on Tuesday was the ideal opportunity to sell the loonie .
Risk aversion trading strategies dominated the CAD dollars downfall yesterday .
The currency retreated - 1.5 % vs. its southern partner as investors sought sanctuary in the greenback after the release of the dismal US home re-sales data .
Already this week Canadian retail sales fell at a pace that was double the expected decline in Dec .
It was down - 5.4 % m/m , which translate to a - 6.4 % decline y/y ( this is the largest contraction in 20 - years and consistently widespread across all industries ) .
Analysts are now embracing themselves for a larger hit to next weeks 4th Q GDP numbers .
On the other hand these numbers provide further proof for Governor Carney at the BOC to justify slashing rates another 50 bps on Mar. 3rd ( 1 % ) as the Canadian economy deteriorates at a quickening pace .
All we need is to see a consistent rally in stocks to get investors interested in Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœrisk tradesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ once again .
The Australasian currencies advanced in the O/N session as equity markets rallied after Obama and the Fed eased concerns that the government may nationalize certain financial institutions .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that both currencies , AUD and NZD , are trading near the highest levels in over a month vs. JPY on the back of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports plunged 46 % last month , thus widening its trade deficit .
The AUD ( 0.6496 ) also got support after 4th Q wage growth surprised to the upside ( + 1.2 % q/ q ) , thus boosting the case for the RBA to slow the pace of interest - rate cuts ( 3.50 % ) .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 43.10 up +60 c ) .
Crude aggressively advanced yesterday as US gas demand is now increasing .
The black - stuff managed to peak at a 3 - week high after the weekly report showed that US gas inventories fell as demand strengthened and refineries cut operating rates .
Inventories plummeted – 3.32 m barrels to +215.3 m last week .
More importantly consumption averaged +9 m barrels a day over the last month , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s up +1.7 % y/y. Refineries are operating at 81.4 % of capacity , down - 0.9 % w/w .
Analysts also noted that many refineries had been shutting units for maintenance as demand slackened , now that demand is once again rising , units will have to be reopened .
With gas prices so low it has only encouraged increased consumption .
Historically oil companies often shut refinery units for maintenance in the first 2 - months of the year as attention shifts away from heating oil and before gas use rises .
Not unexpected , crude inventories rose +717 k barrels to +351.3 m vs. an expected + 1.25 m barrels .
Year - to - date , crude is down 16 % , for the past month speculators had bought into the theory that the substantial cuts undertaken by OPEC this year ( who represent 40 % of global supply ) will eventually curb these surplus global inventories and bolster prices even further .
US policy makers seem to be making an impact on the gold market ; the yellow metal has managed to fall for a 3rd consecutive as investors become reassured that the recession will not be as deep or as long as previously thought , thus eroding the appeal of the commodity as an alternative investment ( $ 946 ) .
The Nikkei closed 7,457 down - 3 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 3,885 up +39 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,908 up +58 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields backed up 14 bp yesterday ( 2.93 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Finally yesterday traders aggressively cheapened the US yield curve as the US government sold a record $ 32 b 5 - year notes and are preparing to issue another $ 22 b 7 - year notes today .
They needed higher rates for investors to absorb so many products .

What are the immediate observable impacts of currency devaluation ( this may also be relevant for the U.S. soon ) :
1. Speeds up asset quality deterioration and write - downs as unhedged corporate and retail customers that have borrowed in foreign currency face a relative increase in their debt burden .
2. Borrowers may chose to withdraw local currency savings to transfer them into a more stable foreign currency , which would shrink banks ' funding base .
3 . The capital ratio of banks with large foreign currency exposure will fall as a consequence of currency devaluation - related issues .
So as the vicious cycle of risk aversion accelerates in more countries , it results in domestic economies becoming worse off , thereby making traditional international commerce impossible , and impacting larger beneficiaries of globalization such as the G7 .
But that is not all : in addition to sovereign risk , external investors also have creditor , liquidity and cash repatriation risk .
The is because many West European banks acquired East European banks in the course of of privatization of state - owned banks during the transition from planned to market economies .
According to the Bank for International Settlements , claims of West European banks on Eastern Europe amounted to € 1.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2008 , which depending on the degree of contraction and asset write - downs could be significantly impaired .
As the chart below shows , the countries that stand to be impacted worst by Eastern European bank deterioration ( by being domiciles to investing banks ) are Austria , France , Italy , Belgium , Germany and Sweden , as banks in these countries account for 84 % of Eastern European bank claims .
And of these , Austria is most on the hook , as E.E. banks account for half of Austria 's global bank claims .
Specific bank names that have the most exposure include Raiffeisen Bank , Erste Bank , Soc Gen , Unicredit and KBC .
This presents the case for the unwind of globalization , which is worthy of a much more indepth analysis .
Over the past 10 years , as the globalization and credit bubble went hand in hand , we will inevitably see the ripple effects of a globalization in reverse , marked by constrained trade relations and minimized international commerce , in addition to the expected problems of how to deal with a widespread increase of domestic corporate and sovereign defaults , and spiking f/x rates and deflation .
The true shape of the global economic problem is only now starting to take gradual shape .
Indicatively , the CDS levels of some Eastern European countries have been the biggest underperformers in recent days , and some are presented below .
When Canada 's do - not - call list was launched last September , two outcomes were easy to predict .
The first was that the list would prove enormously popular with millions of phone numbers registered in a matter of months .
The second was that Canadians would ultimately be left disappointed with little reduction in unwanted telemarketing calls , and concerns about the ability of the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission to enforce the law .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Four months later , the do - not - call list contains roughly six million registered phone numbers and , as expected , there are a growing number of Canadians -- including Industry Minister Tony Clement -- who are expressing misgivings about the potential for abuse .
Three big problems
The problems associated with the do - not - call list fall into three categories .
The first , which was readily apparent years before the list became operational , is that there are far too many exceptions that allow for the majority of telemarketing calls to continue unhindered .
With exceptions for survey companies , political parties , charities , newspapers , and businesses with a prior relationship , some estimate that 80 per cent of telemarketing calls are not covered by the do - not - call legislation .
The second problem revolves around the technical structure of the do - not - call list .
As has been well reported , the list -- all six million numbers -- is available to any telemarketer .
With numerous reports of abuse , the danger of making the numbers available to the very organizations precluded from calling those same numbers is now readily apparent .
The third problem is tied to enforcement .
The do - not - call legislation includes provisions for significant penalties , but it falls to the CRTC to investigate complaints and pursue penalties .
There have been many complaints filed with the CRTC , but to date , no penalties .
Some of the enforcement problems are linked to jurisdiction -- the CRTC 's jurisdictional mandate ends at the border and its ability to levy penalties against an out - of - country organization is very limited -- but there is also mounting evidence that Canadian companies are disregarding the CRTC's own rulings and effectively daring the commission to bring actions .
For example , last summer the CRTC ruled that do - not - call requests registered through third - party services such as iOptOut.ca ( a site I founded ) were valid and should be honoured .
IOptout.ca has generated nearly eight million opt - out requests .
However , there have been several online reports that blue - chip companies such as Bell Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia are refusing to accept the opt - out requests , in direct contravention of the CRTC ruling .
How to save the list
With many more do - not - call registrations likely on the way and Clement vowing to take action , can the do - not - call list be saved ?
The short answer is yes , though reversing the do - not - call disaster will require action from both the government and the CRTC .
The government should start by paring back the current overbroad exceptions .
A do - not - call list that exempts the majority of telemarketing calls is bound to disappoint and the only way to address that issue is to return to the bill as it was originally presented in the House of Commons : without exceptions .
Further , Clement should open talks with the United States to address some of the jurisdictional limitations of the do - not - call list .
Given that the U.S. faces some of the same concerns , a mutual recognition approach that would establish a North - America - wide do - not - call list is a logical next step .
Meanwhile , the CRTC must also step up to the plate .
It bears responsibility for enforcing the law and it needs to send a strong signal that it is fully prepared to investigate complaints and to levy tough penalties for non-compliance .
In that regard , the commission should target high - profile organizations to send the message that no one is above the law .
Given its remarkable popularity , doing away with the do - not - call list is not an option .
The government bought it , then broke it , and now it must fix it .

Tyee stories :
Revenues have taken a dip and copying may be complicit in this but piracy can produce some benefits , and business knows it .
More importantly , a significant number of users participate in the downloading , sharing and copying of computer files , and the network and mobile technologies that make this possible cannot be uninvented ' .
The most common myths attached to the notion of copyright piracy are that the music , film and software industry profits are fatally compromised by P2P networks and MP3 downloads , that each unit distributed in this way results in an equivalent loss for the industries concerned , and that there is never a gain for the copyright holders in the illicit distribution of their products .
One does n't have to approve of illegal copying to realise that this definition covers a multitude of sins , some of which , paradoxically , work to the advantage of the owners of the copyright , and some of which reflect changing cultural perceptions of the ownership of ideas .
While pirates were once seafaring robbers , these days the more common definition is " one who infringes another 's copyright or business rights or who broadcasts without authorisation " selling software , music or computer game CDs from a market stall in the East End or via P2P across the Internet .
Pirated music payoff
Any PR consultant , advertising hack , tabloid journalist or Britney Spears will tell you that exposure is what sells a product .
For instance , in the music industry , marketing is predicated on the knowledge that word of mouth and airplay increase sales so everything is oriented towards getting more airplay .
Copied tapes and downloaded MP3s have the same effect .
They advertise the final product , raise the profile of the artist , and sell more factory - wrapped CDs .
This is especially true in an age when radio play is increasingly confined to golden oldies and industry - designated playlists .
Many well - established artists gained their current status with minimum assistance from record companies , by word of mouth and mix tapes .
It is doubtful if any music fan has not , at some time in their lives , copied , lent or borrowed cassette tapes of music seldom heard on the radio , which has ultimately promoted the final product and increased the revenues of relatively unknown artists and their record companies .
In more recent times , tapes and word of mouth has been replaced by viral marketing through the likes of FaceBook , MySpace and mailing lists - a method that has created high profile success for artists such as Lily Allen and The Arctic Monkeys .
Unauthorised copying of a product can and does increase revenue and sales .
The ability to sample something before you buy it makes it more likely , not less likely , that you will buy the product .
And on to software
The proprietary software industry faces similar problems .
The manufacturers of Eastern Europe and South East Asia , which mass - produce identikit copies of products and packaging in total imitation of the original , may represent a threat to the proprietary software companies .
Still , the reduced prices at which these are sold may actually have the effect of increasing the market , rather than reducing it .
There are plenty of studies by economists that argue that wide dispersal of pirated copies of software has the effect of promoting the pirated product and , paradoxically , increasing sales .
Ireland to Abolish Murphy 's Law ?
( ACPA - Dublin ) Calls are growing across Ireland for the abolition of Murphy 's Law following a series of mass arrests by the authorities .
The chorus of complaints followed early morning raids yesterday when hundreds of Irish citizens were arrested and charged with violations of the ancient Celtic law , simply because they were fortunate enough to have had nothing go wrong .
Slavish adherence to Murphy 's Law by Ireland 's ruling authorities predates the arrival of St Patrick and Catholicism to the Emerald Isle and over the centuries the Irish people have been bitterly oppressed by this legal heritage .
From the Viking destruction of the " Land of Saints and Scholars " , to potato famine and failed rebellions , Murphy has been invoked time and time again raining misery on the unfortunate natives .
The dominant Catholic Church quietly supports the law , believing it is in their best interest to have anguish poured on the people on a regular basis .
" If we can keep people miserable for long enough , they will always eventually turn to the Church for support , " said Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin in defense of the law .
The sorrow continues today with the hope and optimism of Ireland 's " Celtic Tiger " economic miracle replaced with recession , rising unemployment and traffic that would make a condemned man stay in his cell .
There is hope !
Amnesty International has declared all those arrested to be " Prisoners of Conscience " .
The famed international human rights group is calling for their immediate release and the total repeal of Murphy 's Law .
" Murphy 's Law must be abolished , " insisted their director of campaigns at a protest march in Dublin .
Meanwhile defense lawyers intend to argue a case that Murphy 's Law became obsolete after Ireland joined the European Union .
If YOU want to help get the prisoners released from Dublin 's decrepit Mountjoy prison and have this awful law abolished please write a letter to :

The best we can say about last night 's ratings for Dollhouse and Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ?
I think I 'm going to go with " Well , it could 've been worse . "
Not such good news , I 'm afraid .

While Terminator stayed relatively stable - essentially staying at the same ratings as last week , although this is a good thing only insofar that they did n't fall any further ; last week 's ratings were worryingly low , and this week CBS was airing re-runs as opposed to new programming - Dollhouse 's second episode dropped 15 % .
While this is , according to the Hollywood Reporter 's Live Feed blog , " an almost - typical second - episode slip , " it comes on top of a relatively unimpressive premiere , and was , again , up against re-runs on CBS .
It 's too early to claim Dollhouse as an early fatality , although these numbers do n't suggest that it 'll be sticking around too much , but barring a Terminator : Salvation bump ( or an unusually protective Fox ) , you may want to start preparing for an end to The Sarah Connor Chronicles sooner rather than later .

No , the trailer was n't bad at all , but it was n't shown !
What were the BBC up to ?
Anyway , after Eastenders , itbroadcast , half an hour late , but was n't it terribly exciting !
I got it wrong , of course , that we had already seen the trailer , but we had not .
They said that the one we saw before was going to be the one tonight , but we saw a brand new sparkly one .
It had so many clips that we had not seen before , as well as old ones , like quite a few from the Children In Need preview .
We saw everything , except for the Cyber King , which still remains shrouded in mystery .
The clips were cut and edited very well , giving some dramatic parts , as well as the Cybermen theme behind .
You can see the trailer on the official site here .
But without further ado , here is the trailer .
If I 'm up for it , I may do another post talking about it tonight , but we 'll see .

Some divorce lawyers say a kidney is not a marital asset to be divided A US man divorcing his wife is demanding that she return the kidney he donated to her or pay him $ 1.5 m ( £ 1 m ) in compensation .
Dr Richard Batista told reporters that he decided to go public because he was frustrated at the slow pace of divorce negotiations with his estranged wife .
He said he had not only given his heart to his wife , Dawnell , but donated his kidney to save her life .
But divorce lawyers say a donated organ is not a marital asset to be divided .
Dr Batista married Dawnell in 1990 and donated the kidney to her in 2001 .
She filed for divorce in 2005 and a settlement has still not been reached .
' Betrayal '
He told reporters at his lawyer 's office in Long Island , New York , that going public was a last resort .
I felt humiliated , betrayed , disrespected and disregarded
Dr Richard Batista
" There is no deeper pain that you can ever express than betrayal from somebody who you love and devoted your life to , " he said .
He said he had been prevented from seeing their three children for extended periods .
" I felt humiliated , betrayed , disrespected and disregarded for me as a person , as a man , as a husband , as a father . "
Dr Batista 's lawyer , Dominic Barbara , said his client was " asking for the value of the kidney " that he gave his wife .
A lawyer for Mrs Batista said : " The facts are n't as represented by Dr Batista .
We will be addressing the issues before the judge within the next few days . "

Top Democrat introduces bill to investigate Bush war powers John Byrne
Published : Thursday January 8 , 2009
Print This Email This
In a little - noticed move Tuesday , House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. introduced legislation aimed at creating a commission to investigate the " broad range " of " unreviewable war powers " enacted under the presidency of George W. Bush .
While providing few details in his press release , Conyers said the bill would " establish a Blue Ribbon Commission comprised of experts outside government service to investigate the broad range of policies of the Bush administration that were undertaken by the Bush administration under claims of unreviewable war powers . "
The 79 - year - old Michigan Democrat has been a staunch critic of Bush Administration policies .
The bill to consider Bush 's war powers was among five others he announced earlier this week , and was first reported on The Public Record .
Conyers filed a measure to investigate Bush 's impeachment in 2005 and issued a report entitled " The Constitution in Crisis : The Downing Street Minutes and Deception , Manipulation , Torture , Retribution and Coverups in the Iraq War . "
At times , his comments appear to have suggested impeachment as a viable course of action , though he tempered his stance after Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 .
The report found that " there is substantial evidence the President , the Vice - President and other high ranking members of the Bush Administration misled Congress and the American people regarding the decision to go to war in Iraq ; misstated and manipulated intelligence information regarding the justification for such war ; countenanced torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment in Iraq ; and permitted inappropriate retaliation against critics of their Administration , " Conyers wrote in December 2005 .
" The Report concludes that a number of these actions amount to prima facie evidence ( evidence sufficiently strong to presume the allegations are true ) that federal criminal laws have been violated , " he added .
" Legal violations span from false statements to Congress to whistleblower laws . "
" The Report also concludes that these charges clearly rise to the level of impeachable conduct , " Conyers continued .
" However , because the Administration has failed to respond to requests for information about these charges , it is not yet possible to conclude that an impeachment inquiry or articles of impeachment are warranted . "
Last year , after liberal Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) introduced resolutions to consider impeachment , Conyers said , " We 're not doing impeachment , but he can talk about it . "
WASHINGTON — Michael Steele , who was recently elected chairman of the Republican National Committee , paid a Maryland company run by his sister more than $ 37,000 for work related to his 2006 Senate campaign , a payment that Mr. Steele ’s spokesman said Saturday was entirely appropriate .
The spokesman issued a statement in response to an accusation included in a confidential federal court document that Mr. Steele ’s sister had done no work to earn the payment .
Vickie E. LeDuc , a spokeswoman for the United States attorney ’s office in Maryland , said Saturday that the office had unintentionally given the document to The Washington Post , which first reported the accusation .
Ms. LeDuc would not say if Mr. Steele or his sister was the subject of an investigation .
Mr. Steele did not dispute that his sister ’s company , Brown Sugar Unlimited , of Bethesda , Md. , had been paid $ 37,262 by his Senate campaign in February 2007 , as federal election records show .
The word wicked depicts a particular nature .
It speaks of evil or mischievousness .
On the other hand , the word righteous also describes the nature of a specific person , that quality can be one of virtue and moral uprightness in a person .
A wicked is an evil or mischievous person , while a righteous person is an upright person .
Now , why do the wicked prosper , and the righteous suffer ?
When you ask the question , why do the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer , in a social gathering , it raises a lot of dust .
The religious sects believe that the prosperity of the wicked is only for a short while and that the end will be destruction .
Others are of the view that we live in an unfair world , and that bad things happen to good people .
However , the fact remains that the wicked prosper because of the price they have paid .

Wrong Beliefs About Prosperity
Over the years , the word prosperity seems to refer to only money .
It is not a lie ; however , it is also not the complete truth , as prosperity cuts across various areas of life .
It ranges from good health to even having a good family .
However , economists will strongly disagree with this fact , as they solely believe that money is the only indicator of prosperity .
As we continue , you will find out that it is a wrong belief .
The fact is that a lot of things have to be in place before you can say a man is genuinely prosperous .
Good health is another essential factor in prosperity , apart from money .
A billionaire with stage three cancer of the brain cannot survive it , even with the money .
As a result , you can say that he is a failure in health , yet he has so much money .
A man or a woman with a broken home tends to suffer a lot of emotional trauma , even if they manage to hide it , but deep within it will be consuming them .
Even the religious sect will agree that a man that cannot keep his family is a failure , and he is not fit to be a voice in society .
As much as the money is essential for you to be a prosperous person , keeping a healthy family is vital , too , because once you lack in this area , it tends to ruin you publicly .
Psychologist proved that true happiness that will last for a lifetime is not from money , but it ’s from within a man ’s mind .
Once a man can be able to find peace within him , it ’s almost impossible to make that man unhappy .
In the world today , there is an increasing number of suicides by even prosperous people , now the question is why a wealthy man would kill himself .
It could be a result of loneliness , emptiness , and sadness , which leads to depression .
There are a couple of rich people going into drugs and suicide because of depression , so you can see if money could fill people up ; these people should not act in such acts .
Real prosperity is not just about having all the money in the world , but it ’s in experiencing wholeness .
One can set that a man with money is prosperous if all things are in place in his life , from family life to good health .
The laws of prosperity :
In this section , we ’ll focus on the economic view of prosperity , which is money .
There are laws to acquire wealth .
Whether you are good , bad , or ugly , this law will work if you apply them to your daily life .
In everyday life , some rules or regulations guide our actions .
Thus , once we do anything , we get a reward based on our activities .
For Instance , it is a rule that when you pay the electric bill , you get something in return , which is light .
Once you pay , it becomes the responsibility of the company to give you light by all means because you have done your part .
The same rule applies when you are paying water bills and every other bill , once you follow that simple rule ; you get the required result .
The law of consistency
Consistently , doing something pays off .
During the process of doing that particular thing , you are also gaining mastery in that area .
There is a famous saying that diligence pays off at the end of the day .
It is a saying carved out from the scriptures Proverbs 22:29 .
The scripture states that a diligent man will stand before great kings .
The Bible passage is trying to say that a man with experience and skills from years or months of consistent work will position himself among great people .
It is even viable in today ’s reality as nobody will hire a man without experience on the job .
The law of giving
A lot of people in this world conclude that the universe operates in a dimension of exchange , and it gives what you give to it .
The law of giving sees money as a river flowing , and it must keep flowing , so when you give out money , the universe looks for a way to channel that money back to you .
Many Christians and non-Christians believe in the law of giving .
We find out that in recent times , we have more philanthropists giving out money to the less privileged and helping out the poor .
You tend to see that they keep getting more money and grow financially .
The law does n’t just apply to finance , as it also works in other aspects of life .
In essence , if you want love , you have to give love .
In the same manner , if you desire joy , you must be a joy giver , etc .
The law of problem - solving
Many things are going wrong in the world today , from poverty , sickness , war , corruption to many other things that you are aware of , or you may be experiencing personally .
The man that found the solution to the problem of communication in the world and brought about Facebook is one of the richest men in the world today .
Also , there is a man that brought the solution for easy transportation , that even when he is not alive , his children can never be poor .
That man is Henry Ford .
There are a good number of people that brought solutions to various areas of life , and today , they are multimillionaires that it is almost impossible for them to be poor in life .
Thus , you can see that the law of problem - solving stands that anyone that brings a solution to a problem will always get the reward of that , and most times , the compensation is monetary .
The Christian Beliefs About Suffering
Suffering is a term generally used when referring to pain and hardship .
Christians believe that suffering is temporal and only for a time .
Thus , when that time comes , you have to bear it and wait till it passes away .
The Christians believe that suffering is the night time of the life of Christians when things are not working well for you , but that joy will come in the morning time .
They also believe that there is hope after suffering .
Some of these beliefs are :
Suffering Is For The Believer ’s Sake
Generally , Christians believe that once you enter a season of suffering in your life , it is an indicator that there is victory ahead .
The belief reflects in the life of many Bible characters as once they pass through hard times ; they tend to come out victoriously .
Some examples are Job , Sarah , Paul the Apostle , and several other Bible characters that passed through pains and hardship for a while and were victorious at the end .
Longsuffering Is A Fruit Of The Spirit
Christians believe in the ability within them to endure hardness and pain for a long time , without losing hope .
The Greek meaning of longsuffering is “ long ” and “ temper . ”
Christians tend to see pain as gain and not just pain to them because it shows that they indeed have the ability that the Bible said they have in Galatians 5:22 .
They believe that suffering is an indicator that you have the fruit of the Spirit within you .
Conclusion
Prosperity majors in the wholeness of an individual .
It not just centers on the financial worth of the person .
To answer the question , why do the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer , we realize that the wicked are not prospering in every sense as the wicked have their evil , hateful and mischievous nature to give to the world .
You will also discover that they always have evil things around them because of the law of giving , which is both a universal law and a spiritual law for the Christians .
You can still be wicked and prosper financially .
Also , the righteous can suffer , but it ’s for a while as joy comes at an appointed time , and they are more likely to enjoy all - round prosperity at the end .
However , it ’s unwise to say righteous people suffer for their righteousness , and the wicked prosper because of their wickedness .

I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
And luck was all we had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
I tried to join but no one liked
The side I ’m fighting for

And let ’s drink to when we meet
I ’ll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street
You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
And you ’re tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
I guess that makes us equal
But I want to march with you
An extra in the sequel

So please do n’t ask me when
I know the burden ’s heavy
As you bear it through the night
Some people say it ’s empty
But that does n’t mean it ’s light
So let ’s drink to when it ’s over
And let ’s drink to when we meet
I ’ll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street
It ’s going to be September now
For many years to come
Every heart adjusting
To that strict September drum
I see the Ghost of Culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salute some new conclusion
Which all of us have missed
So let ’s drink to when it ’s over
And let ’s drink to when we meet
I ’ll be standing on this corner

Sullivan is a conservative who is furious with the corruption of the Bush / Republican administration .
He points out how spending has increased faster than at any time since FDR .
The debt has ballooned to $ 43 trillion .
There are now twice as many lobbyists than there were in .
Because the Republicans control of all government institutions , any corrupt businessman flocks to the Republican party to offer bribes .
Habeas corpus , the key civil liberty has been trampled .
America has been torturing people by the tens of thousands .
Sullivan points out other conservatives such as George F. Will and William F. Buckley concur .
Conservatives believe in reduced government , pay as you go and civil liberties .
They want the government out of your wallet and out of your bedroom .
The Bush Republicans have provided the very opposite .
Sullivan calls on all conservatives to vote Democrat or abstain to sweep these crooks out of office .
Sullivan explains the continued support by the religious right given all the outrageous behaviour is motivated by a desire to cling to power and to keep the flow of corrupt money flowing .

As Barack Obama marched towards the White House and the economy plunged , more Americans ditched newspapers for the internet .
For the first time , more Americans are getting their news online than from traditional ink and paper , although the popularity of television still eclipses all other forms of media .
In an apparently sharp shift in habits , the Washington - based Pew Research Centre found that the number of consumers using the web as a main news source surged from 24 % to 40 % in a year , overtaking the 35 % who rely on newspapers .
Television slipped from 74 % to 70 % .
The change is yet another blow to the newspaper industry .
Papers across the US are cutting jobs , closing bureaux and trimming costs as they try to adjust to a collapse in advertising revenue .
Experts say that media economics is up in the air .
Sree Sreenivasan , a new media professor at Columbia Journalism School in New York , said : " The problem is that advertising dollars from newspapers are being replaced by digital pennies . "
Younger people are migrating towards the web quickly .
Among the under - 29s , the web leaped from 34 % to 59 % as the leading source of news , tying with television , with newspapers lagging at 28 % .
Sreenivasan added : " Keep in mind that most online news people read still uses a lot of newspaper - sourced copy that has been put on line .
It 's still a lot of traditional media that 's feeding this . "
Many fear for newspapers .
One of the US 's biggest publishers , Tribune , filed for bankruptcy this month as it struggled with $ 13bn of debt .
Its titles include the Los Angeles Times .
Sales of US papers dropped by 4.6 % in the six months to September , said the Audit Bureau of Circulations .
Economic events have sparked interest among readers .
The Pew Centre found that America 's dip towards a recession was the most popular story of the year , with 70 % following it " very closely " .
The presidential election was relegated to fourth .

Venezuelans yesterday voted to abolish term limits for elected officials , boosting Hugo Chávez 's ambition to rule the country for decades .
Electoral authorities said 54 % of voters in the referendum backed a constitutional amendment allowing indefinite re-election , with 46 % rejecting it – a margin of almost 1 million voters .
An exultant Chávez appeared on the balcony of the presidential palace in Caracas to address cheering supporters after the result was announced .
" It is a clear victory for the people , " he said .
" It is a clear victory for the revolution . "
The result will boost his effort to transform the Opec country into a socialist state and burnish his leadership of Latin America 's " pink tide " of leftwing governments .
The president 's mentor and ally Fidel Castro sent congratulations from his sickbed in Cuba .
The US made no immediate comment , but the Obama administration will be dismayed at the prospect of an emboldened foe in Caracas .
Chávez , a 54 - year - old former tank commander , has been in power for a decade and plans to run for election again when his term ends in 2013 .
He has spoken of ruling beyond 2030 .
However , plunging oil revenues are expected to hit the Venezuelan economy and the petro- fuelled Chavez diplomacy soon .
Some analysts predict stagflation and devaluation of the bolivar currency – the kind of grim cycle that undid previous Venezuelan leaders – and there was speculation that Chávez had rushed through the referendum before the crisis hit .
The unexpectedly wide margin of victory prompted rapturous celebrations among " chavistas " , who credit their charismatic leader for poverty - alleviating social programmes , notably free health care and discounted food .
" We did it , we won – this is a great night , " Freddy Ramirez , a 48 - year - old security guard , said .
Fireworks lit up the night sky and cars filled with flag - waving supporters drove around the capital .
However , not everybody celebrated .
" Chavez has screwed this country enough already , " Ricardo Torres , a 56 - year - old courier , said .
He blamed the president for crumbling infrastructure and high crime and inflation .
Voters had narrowly rejected a referendum to abolish presidential term limits in December 2007 .
Chávez learned lessons from that defeat , this time widening the terms of the referendum to allow mayors and governors to run indefinitely , giving them an incentive to mobilise support .
The government 's " red machine " waged a formidable campaign .
Posters urging a " yes " vote saturated the country , state TV networks cheered for the " si " and civil servants were sent out to canvass .
A flyer gave 10 reasons for voting yes .
Number one said : " Chávez loves us and love is repaid with love " , and the second stated : " Chávez is incapable of doing us harm " .
The opposition , a fragmented coalition of small political parties and university students , accepted defeat but complained that the government had hijacked state resources and hobbled the " no " campaign .
" There was an abuse of power , " David Smolanksy , a student leader , said .
Analysts said Venezuela 's vote could embolden leaders in countries such as Bolivia , Colombia and Ecuador to seek indefinite re-election , a return of the " big man " syndrome of charismatic autocrats that marked much of the region 's 20th - century history .
" Many who are worried about unlimited executive power will be dispirited by the results .
The record of such indefinite re-election in the region has been very unhappy , " Michael Shifter , of the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank , said .
At a news conference on Saturday , Chávez sought to allay such concerns and said staying in office for more than a decade was not unusual .
He cited examples including the US president Franklin Roosevelt .
A 200 - pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford , Conn. , Monday viciously mauled a woman he had known for years , leaving her critically injured with much of her face torn away , the authorities said .
The animal was shot dead by the police after he assaulted an officer in his car .
The woman , Charla Nash , 55 , a friend of the chimpanzee ’s owner , was being treated at Stamford Hospital and might not survive , the authorities said .
“ I ’ve been doing this a long time and have never seen anything this dramatic on a living patient , ” said the head of the paramedic crew that treated her , Capt .
Bill Ackley of Stamford Emergency Medical Service .
The attack , in the driveway of a sprawling home in a densely wooded neighborhood on the north side of Stamford , also brought a brutal end to the life of the chimpanzee , Travis , 14 , a popular figure in town who had appeared in television commercials and often posed for photographs at the towing shop operated by his owners .
He had escaped before , and in 2003 playfully held up traffic at a busy intersection for several hours , but had no history of violence , the authorities said .
Travis ’s social skills included drinking wine from a stemmed glass , dressing and bathing himself and using a computer .
November 17 , 2008  --
One of Obama 's top transition team members , Thomas Donilon , oversaw an aggressive , backdoor lobbying campaign by mortgage giant Fannie Mae to undermine the credibility of a probe into the firm 's accounting irregularities , according to a 2006 government report on the company .
The effort -- which reportedly included attacks on the funding for the oversight agency , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , and an attempt to launch a separate investigation into OFHEO itself -- was ultimately unsuccessful , and regulators eventually discovered top Fannie Mae executives had been manipulating the company 's financial reporting to maximize their bonuses .
Facing accusations of misstating its earnings from 1998 to 2004 , Fannie Mae settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $ 400 million in 2006 , although it did not admit any wrongdoing .
Obama transition advisor and ex-Fannie Mae executive Donilon has not been accused of participating in the accounting irregularities .
But he did oversee its lobbying , and helped paint a rosy picture of Fannie 's financial health to the company 's board , OFHEO investigators concluded , a picture that was ultimately proven false .
Donilon declined to comment for this article .
President - elect Obama has pledged to change the culture of coziness between officials , lobbyists and lawmakers in Washington .
But the role of Donilon in the Fannie Mae scandal raises questions about just how much of a break the Obama administration will be from business as usual inside the Beltway .
When asked about Donilon 's place in the Obama transition team , Obama spokesperson Tommy Vietor said in a statement that " Mr. Donilon is volunteering his time and more than 30 years of accomplishment to help prepare the State Department for an efficient transition to the President - elect , who is taking office at a time of war and when we are confronting a complex and challenging international environment .
Mr. Donilon 's experience in foreign affairs as Assistant Secretary of State and Chief of Staff at the State Department is critical to this review process . "
Donilon 's Rise at Fannie
A former top aide to Secretary of State Warren Christopher , Donilon joined Fannie as general counsel in 2000 .
A year later he was promoted to executive vice president for law and policy and corporate secretary , where he oversaw the company 's sizeable legal and government affairs divisions .
Fannie 's coziness with lawmakers was well established before Donilon joined the company 's ranks .
As former Chief Operating Officer Daniel Mudd told CEO Franklin Raines in a November 2004 memo , " [t ] he old political reality was that we always won , we took no prisoners , and we faced little organized political opposition , " according to the 2006 report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight .
Donilon was no rookie to politics either .
A veteran of the Carter administration , he was a top strategist for both Walter Mondale and Joseph Biden 's failed presidential bids .
And under Donilon 's watch , these efforts continued .
" The goal of senior management was straightforward : to force OFHEO to rely on the Enterprise for information and expertise to such a degree that Fannie Mae would essentially regulate itself , " the report stated .
Fannie Mae 's accounting came under scrutiny in late 2003 , after its sister organization , Freddie Mac , disclosed it had misstated its accounting .
Seeing the problems , OFHEO stepped up its monitoring of Fannie Mae and in a preliminary report in 2004 alleged the company had improperly used reserves to smooth its earnings .
Fannie
Mae executives began pushing back hard against the increasing oversight .
Its lobbyists -- overseen by Donilon -- pushed U.S. lawmakers to limit OFHEO 's budget , and make it subject to annual approval .
" [ W ] ith the knowledge and support of senior management , " Fannie Mae 's lobbyists " used their longstanding relationships with Congressional staff to attempt to interfere with OFHEO 's special examination , " according to the report .
They also tried to get OFHEO investigated .
Email trails show that Fannie Mae lobbyists drafted legislation which required a probe into how the agency spent its money .
And Fannie Mae 's head lobbyist at the time , Duane Duncan , told OFHEO investigators that Fannie Mae lobbyists had " generated the request " from a congressman for the probe into OFHEO that looked into allegations that the agency had improperly leaked information about Fannie during its probe of the mortgage giant .
While that effort was " conceived and executed " by the government relations team , it was " well known by many members of senior management " including Donilon , " the report stated .
Duncan reported directly to Donilon , and OFHEO concluded Donilon was aware of his team 's efforts .
According to the report , the two met at the end of each day for " Donilon to manage the implementation of the decisions . "
During weekly strategy meetings , the report said , Raines and Donilon were " deciding what positions Fannie Mae would take on any given issue . "
Donilon is n't the only member of the Obama team who has worked for one of the government - backed housing enterprises .
Wendy Sherman , who is working with Donilon the State Department agency review team , served on the board of Fannie 's charity .
And Rahm Emmanuel , who will be Obama 's chief of staff , served on the board of Freddie Mac , which also restated its earnings .

So I guess the Oscar bitchfest was begun by my colleague so I have no choice , absolutely no choice , but to weigh in with my two cents .
But since Quaid beat me to the punch on looking at the Best Picture nominees and slights , I ’ll take a walk through some other categories and see if I can’t single out a significant snub or two .
And here ….we….go :
Best Song
Probably the most criminal act of snubbery in this Oscar season was the lack of recognition for Bruce Springsteen ’s song , “ The Wrestler , ” which ends the film of same name .
I ’m a Springsteen fan , so I ’m a bit biased , but I know non-fans who feel like this snub is truly ridiculous .
The song is simply breathtaking –a meditative , elegiac piece of soul .
Springsteen tracks the spiritual deterioration of Mickey Rourke ’s protagonist , a wrestler whose only sense of identity comes from his bouts in the ring , brought to life by the lyric “ my only faith in the broken bones and bruises I display . ”
I know Springsteen already has an Oscar ( he won in 1993 for the song “ Streets of Philadelphia , ” from Jonathan Demme ’s film Philadelphia ) but still , it is n’t illegal to give rock icons more than one Oscar .
True , the presentation of the song in the film ( playing over the end credits ) may not stand up very well against the Bollywood dance sequence at the end of Slumbdog Millionaire , but it is my recollection that the best material should be nominated , not the most impressively displayed material .
I mean , there are usually five nominations –why dole out only three this year ?
Is there a built - in prejudice against rock songs by big acts being played on the Oscar telecast ?
A travesty similar to Springsteen ’s occured in 2003 when the Academy failed to recognize Pearl Jam ’s magnificant original song “ Man of the Hour ” which they composed for the film Big Fish .
Are they nervous that it will look like they are pandering to the musical tastes of the audience ?
Oh well , Springsteen will just have to live with the one trophy on the shelf for now , but it really is a shame that such a good piece of songwriting was n’t recognized .
It makes the whole Best Song category feel like a sham , and I would think the Academy would be trying to bring some credibility back to the category after nominating three songs from Enchanted last year .
Best Supporting Actor
This one was n’t so much of a tragedy since the dude got nominated in another category , but I thought Brad Pitt was so outlandishly funny as the clownish gym trainer in The Coen Brothers ’
Burn After Reading that a nomination for that film , instead of for the insipid , overrated The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , would have been well deserved .
Pitt has n’t been this amusing in a film for a long time –if ever ( I ’m thinking of 12 Monkeys , but he was pretty scary in that film too ) .
With shagged - out blond hair , constant dance moves , and the curiosity of an overgrown twelve - year - old , he essays the role of Chad , a gym employee and coworker of Frances McDormand who , after finding a computer disc filled with what he thinks are valuable CIA spy secrets , tries to blackmail the government agent ( John Malkovich ) that the disc belongs to .
The result is uproariously funny .
It ’s one of the more underrated and enjoyable films of the year ( the Coens are being punished for having so much success with No Country for Old Men ; how dare they make a comedy right after ! )
It would have been nice to see Pitt nominated for the right movie .
I ’ve never seen him create anything quite like Chad before , and it is a shame to see such a good performance go by the boards .
I guess with Robert Downey , Jr. being nominated for another outrageous comic turn in Tropic Thunder , the Academy felt like they had used up their one comedy nomination for a significant category .
Best Actor
Also , nominating Pitt for Burn After Reading would have freed up a spot in the Best Actor category , which saw Colin Farrell get snubbed for his outstanding work in a film that far too few people saw , In Bruges .
Farrell is simply outstanding in the film as Ray , a young hitman who accidentally kills a young boy during a hit in London and is made to hang out in Bruges , Belgium with his partner , Ken ( Brendon Gleeson ) to wait for instructions .
Farrell turns a corner in the film , presenting us with a genuine baffoon who both acts out his angst about his crime but also fully understands the implications of it .
At first glance , his work is brilliantly funny , but is also an exploration of the character ’s guilt and self - loathing .
I also ca n’t remember a time when a dramatic film placed at its center a true baffoon with such heart .
I was happy to see In Bruges at least acknowledged ( it received a screenplay nomination ) but I felt bad that Farrell was n’t recognized for his outstanding work .
Hopefully , this performance is a harbinger of more significant work from him .

Okay , The Dark Knight did not get nominated for Best Picture this year .
I have come to terms with that .
Even though I think it is the best film of the year , its exclusion from that category , while dismaying , was forseable .
It was one of those situations where , after seeing that it was n’t nominated , I automatically knew all of the reasons why .
Comic book movie .
Too mainstream .
Not close enough to the course of action that the Academy have taken over the past few years with their nominations , which seem to go more to indies and dramatic studio fare with big - name , serious actors .
At the end of the day , it was probably just too much of an event film .
But the fact that neither Christopher Nolan ’s direction nor the screenplay by Nolan and his brother , Jonathan , were nominated is an absolute travesty .
All of the signs were there for The Dark Knight .
It was acknowledged by the Producers , Writers , and Directors Guild nominations this year .
Yet the Academy saw fit to ignore it when doling out nominations in what many consider the second and third most important categories .
I suppose they felt that a nomination for Heath Ledger in the Supporting Actor category was enough .
But I was seriously let down to see Nolan snubbed for his direction and the Nolan brothers snubbed for their screenplay , both of which were easily among the best of the year if not the best .
The Dark Knight was the monumental achievement of the year ; I have rarely seen a film that pushed the medium to its limits the way that film did .
I can understand why they did n’t want to put it among the best movies , but he Academy should acknowledge it ’s qualities by nominating it in some other significant categories .
It speaks very low of the Academy that they ca n’t even bring themselves to acknowledge the quality of a comic book movie on that level .
Bitching , for now , is concluded .
Modern web design is not possible without Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) .

I hope those of you in the US are enjoying your President ’s Day Holiday , ( assuming you get the day off ) .
When we get back into the office tomorrow , we ’ll be amping up our Killzone 2 coverage , featuring a look inside the new Killzone.com , live chats with developer Guerrilla Games , and even a contest or two .
From reading the comments , we gathered that some of you were n’t able to track down a Helghast soldier in Home yesterday to request a Killzone 2 demo code .
Fortunately , I was able to get ahold of a few ( hundred ) more to distribute via our PlayStation Twitter account .
If you ’re already following our account , all you ’ve got to do is send us an “ @reply ” and ask .
We ’ll direct message you the code when we get into the office tomorrow ( Tuesday , Pacific time ) .
If you ’re new to Twitter , or have n’t yet joined , I suppose we owe you a bit of an explanation .
To get our attention , just type “ @sonyplaystation ” into a Tweet and ask for the demo ( see pic below as an example ) .
You ’ll also need to be following us , or we ca n’t send you a direct message with the demo code .
This part ’s easy – just click on “ Follow ” underneath our logo in the upper right corner of the page .
Enjoy the rest of the long weekend , and we ’ll see you tomorrow !
UPDATE : Thanks for all the KZ tweets , we ’ve definitely gotten all that we can handle .
Just about to start sending out codes . . .
Once upon a time , when everything was black and white and the Russians had horns and tails , someone printed an ad asking kids to call Santa Claus using a very wrong telephone number .
Advertisement
The time was 1955 .
The place , Colorado Springs .
The ad was printed by Sears , and the number ... well , the number was n't Santa 's phone at the North Pole .
It was n't even the gold and glitter phone at his secret bachelor pad in Las Vegas .
Someone at Sears ' ad department made a mistake , so the phone number printed in the ad was n't the one that the Colorado Springs store had set up to take note of the children 's wishes .

It was the hotline for the Continental Air Defense 's Director of Operations , Colonel Harry Shoup .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The CONAD boss was n't amused when he got his first call .
Instead of a report on missiles falling over Wichita or a Soviet submarine surfacing on the San Francisco bay , what he got was a six - year old telling him what he wanted - probably his own nuclear missiles and a nuclear submarine .
However , instead of telling the kid to go visit the elves tied to the warhead of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile , he did something else :
After the second boy called - and after realizing what was happening - he told his staff to start giving Santa 's polar coordinates to every children calling that line .
In 1958 , CONAD became the North American Aerospace Defense Command , a joint operation between the United States and Canada .
By then , the event was already being covered by the media , and kids were calling NORAD 's phone number like crazy .
That Christmas Eve , hundreds of volunteers at Cheyenne Mountain and Peterson Air Force base spent part of their night answering the phone and telling kids where Santa was .

The rest , as it usually goes , is history .
This year marks the 50th anniversary of NORAD 's Santa Tracking System , which in 1997 got into the Web - much to the relief of NORAD volunteers .

Welcome to our introduction to atlatls !
This is a quick introduction to atlatls for absolute newbies .
Atlatls are devices used to throw darts ( spears ) .
These devices were developed throughout the world by such civilizations as the Aztecs , Aborigines of Australia and Indonesia , the Incas , Inuits and many more .
It is unknown exactly where the atlatl originated but archeological evidence shows that it has been in use for at least fifteen thousand years .
It is possible that it was invented and reinvented many times over hundreds of thousands of years by countless cultures .
The atlatl is a device that is used to lengthen the arm , adding a greater mechanical advantage than throwing a spear with one ’s bare hands , which makes the darts able to fly much faster and with much more force , with less power provided by the thrower .
Above is a picture of Robert Berg demonstrating the use of the atlatl .
The atlatl is usually about 15 ″ to 30 ″ long , and on one end has a hook of some sort , and the other end has some sort of hand hold .
The hook on the end of the atlatl is typically made out of bone , wood or horn , and is designed to connect to the back end of the dart .
Each dart has a small dimple at the end that fits the hook .
The dart lays parallel to the atlatl , and at the handle end it is held in place by the fore finger and thumb .
Some atlatls , such as the one in the picture above have rests for the dart , others do n’t .
The varieties and types of atlatls are almost endless , and each has different features .
The atlatl is held in the thrower ’s preferred hand , with the dart parallel to the atlatl .
The thrower points the dart at the intended target , steps into the direction of the shot , while the end of the atlatl swings around in a flipping motion , pushing the dart forward .
As soon as the cast is started , the dart is released by the fingers holding it , while the atlatl itself is retained in the hand .
Centrifugal force keeps the spur in contact with the knock dimple .
Then , it is simply a matter of following through until the dart leaves the atlatl .
Many different types of throwing styles have been developed by different atlatlists but they all are something like this .
Atlatls and darts vary in size , shape , material and quality .
There are as many styles of atlatls and darts as there are atlatlists .
The equipment of atlatlists varies from the simplest stick - like atlatls to elaborate , decorated atlatls that are pieces of art as well as deadly weapons .
Weights are often used both to decorate atlatls and to improve their stability , balance , and accuracy .
No atlatl is complete without a good set of matchinng darts .
Darts range from 5 feet to 8 feet , but average about six feet long .
Competition and hunting darts tend to be longer .
Usually , the longer the dart , the more accurate it is — but the longer it is , the shorter the distance is that it can be cast .
Atlatls , darts and parts to them have been made from many different kinds of materials including , wood , metal , stone , bone and cane .
( Check out Thunderbird ’s many different designs )
Each has its purpose , form following the function of each of the various designs .
Atlatls are used by many enthusiasts for both target shooting and hunting .
Atlatl hunting is legal in several states , including Missouri , Alabama , Nebraska and Alaska , but the majority of states do not yet allow it .
Wild Boars are most often hunted , but many animals , from Fallow Deer to Caribou have been killed by the atlatl in recent times .
Many Atlatl enthusiasts are lobbying their state governments to legalize atlatl hunting and fishing just like bow and firearm hunting is allowed .
If you live in a place where atlatl hunting is illegal , contact your local state legislature and voice your support for legalizing atlatl hunting and fishing .
For those of you who are not into the hunting or fishing aspects of the atlatl , there are dozens of atlatl contests held throughout the world ( See the shows section ) .
There also is a World Atlatl Association , which we encourage you to join .
Among the many benefits of the World Atlatl Association is the news letter that will help keep you abreast of the latest information about atlatls and events in the world .
They also keep track of the top atlatl scores throughout the world in a contest called the International Standard Accuracy Contest ( ISAC ) that measures the skill level of each contestant , relitive to all the other contestants .
With more and more atlatlists taking their first throws every day , and ever increasing interest being expressed , the sport is one of the fastest growing pastimes around .
Thank you for reading this introduction to atlatls !

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Trump Entertainment Resorts
Inc , the casino operator named for Donald Trump , filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday as recession and declining gambling revenues battered the company and its rivals .
The Chapter 11 filing marks the third plunge into bankruptcy for the company , which was created out of a restructuring in 2005 .
It also underscores the struggles facing the casino business as recession squeezes casino gambling .
Trump Entertainment owns and operates three casino hotels in hard - hit Atlantic City , New Jersey , including the Trump Taj Mahal , Trump Plaza and Trump Marina .
The company did not request debtor - in - possession financing to operate during its restructuring and said it would continue to run as normal .
“ This filing will result in no immediate change in our daily operations , and we expect to make no changes regarding our operating structure or philosophy , ” Trump Chief Executive Mark Juliano said in a statement .
Nine affiliates of the casino operator including Trump Plaza Associates , Trump Plaza Associates , Trump Marina Associates and Trump Taj Mahal Associates simultaneously sought protection , according to the filing .
Trump had assets of about $ 2.1 billion and total debts of about $ 1.74 billion on December 31 , 2008 , it said in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey .
The company , eager to conserve cash , missed a $ 53.1 million bond interest payment due on December 1 as a sharp downturn in consumer spending hit casino revenue , prompting bondholders to push for bankruptcy .
WIDELY EXPECTED
Experts had been looking for a Chapter 11 filing from Trump since it missed the December 1 bond interest payment .
“ It had been moving in this direction for two months , ” said KeyBanc gaming industry analyst Dennis Forst .
“ I think ( restructuring ) could take a while , ” he said .
“ Obviously , they were n’t able to restructure it with the debt holders in the two months they had . ”
The filing comes days after the casino operator ’s namesake founder said he would resign from the board over disagreements with bondholders who wanted the company to file for bankruptcy .
Friday ’s statement did not say when Trump ’s resignation would be offered or take effect .
His daughter Ivanka Trump also said she was resigning .
Trump , a very public and flamboyant figure in an industry filled with colorful , headstrong executives , said the company represents less than 1 percent of his net worth , and that “ my investment in it is worthless to me now . ”
No stranger to bankruptcy , Trump Entertainment Resort Holdings went into Chapter 11 in 2004 , from which it emerged a year later with Trump having relinquished the position of CEO .
Casino companies have been hurt in the last year as the gambling boom fizzled and tight credit markets stifled growth plans .
Meanwhile , the Chinese government has made efforts to slow down the Macau gambling market .
The sector now faces a wave of restructurings .
In May , the privately held casino operator Tropicana Entertainment LLC filed for Chapter 11 .
The Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Index has fallen some 83 percent since its lifetime high reached in October 2007 .

After doing a quick Google Search I realized that everyone might not know about a great way to do URL validation in Rails .
The secret is a little - known method of the URI class , regexp .
It lets you generate a regular expression for matching URLs based on an array of accepted protocols .
What ’s even better , it can be plugged directly into Rails ’s validates_format_of .
It ’s this easy :
class User validates_format_of : website , : with => URI : : regexp ( %w( http https ) ) end 1 class User validates_format_of : website , : with =& gt ; URI :: regexp ( % w ( http https ) )

Please understand that , while e-voting seriously sucks , this particular protracted fight would have been happening even if the paper ballots had been publicly hand - counted first off without any e-tabulation ... it 's the GOP doing this , not Coleman per se , and it's all about keeping another Democratic candidate from being seated in the Senate .
Thus the GOP is willing to finance Coleman 's many lawyers , pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into any possible or impossible legal challenge , just to keep Franken from being
seated for even one day more .
It 's a terrible waste of dwindling GOP funds ... so just let them be

ZapKitty , I love you .
But we part ways .
If the ballots were publicly hand counted with public oversight , a clear winner would have been officially announced .
If you want to get into how chain of custody got compromised .
Then you want to get into an argument for keeping electronic vote tabulation devices forever .
With all these people unemployed .
Certainly the man ( and woman ) power is available to hold a freaking election with no problems .
The argument for cost is becoming mute - IMO
The Cost is HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS , THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STOOD FOR , AND A REAL POSSIBILITY NOW THAT WITH A BOND MARKET CRASH , THE DEATH OF OUR GOVERNMENT ITSELF .
Played honest ?
Got a Pension ?

Phil and ZapKitty , I love you both .
But I 'll have to side with Zap on this one .
Happily , there were no electronic " ballots " ( as cast on DREs ) in this election to contend with .
It was all paper , even if " counted " the first time by flawed electronic tabulators .
The hand - count was rather pristine ( at least in its transparency ) , thanks to MN 's law and SoS Ritchie 's oversight of it .
Questions of chain of custody issues ( at least legitimate ones , and at least as far as the voted , versus unvoted ballots are concerned ) , has not come into play here during the contest .
The questions being raised , as Zap points out , would have been raised no matter what by a set of attorneys insisting on hiding behind the legitimate legal system to make their political hay .
The court sides with Zap this time !
( gavel bang , bang . )
Sorry , Phil .

Well , I do n't know who I 'm siding with , here , because , while zap has an impeccable point , I can't help but think machines had to have been responsible for the race ending up this close .
MN is a BLUE state , and it voted its head off for Obama .
How can so many Democrats have been happy enough with Coleman 's shit to hold Franken 's comedic history against him to the point where they 'd choose that pig over the funny guy ?
It does n't make sense to me .
Of course , very little in politics makes sense to me , but , really , I think we 're letting this monster " controversy " and our happiness about MN's Secretary of State distract us from the underlying fishiness of Colemen getting that close to Franken in the count , and the recount .
It 's just too stupid .

After practicing law for 31 years , I find myself fortunate enough to have gone into a state of semi-retirement .
While I am still winding down the last of several very large cases , I have had the luxury to watch the last few days of the Coleman / Franken proceedings at Uptake.org
It is fairly clear that Coleman 's attorney 's know full - well that they cannot possibly prevail before the three - judge panel .
Most of their exhibits are being excluded as irrelevant given the content of the panel 's prior ruling that absentee ballots that were not lawfully cast cannot be counted .
Most of the exhibits they do get in are accepted by the court only in support of Coleman 's " offer of proof " -- meaning that these are only coming in to set up an appeal , and on numerous occasions , Franken 's attorneys have shown that the ballots Coleman now wants open are the very same ballots which were not counted because team Coleman had objected to them .
The Coleman " fatally flawed " argument is based on a contention that he is being denied equal protection because the election boards previously counted some absentee ballots that would not meet the criteria delineated by the 3 judge panel as not being lawfully cast for the ballots Coleman now wants opened .
But Coleman cannot show this to be a systemic problem , and a ruling in his favor on this issue would essentially mean that the entire U.S. system of county - by - county systems with differing results violates equal protection - - a major stretch , though I must say , until the SCOTUS delivered its decision in Bush v Gore , I had thought the Bush legal argument a stretch .
Regardless of outcome , it seems clear team Coleman is trying to delay the addition of a 59th Democratic Senator as long as possible .

Have there been any recent polls in Minnesota asking how people would vote today in a Coleman vs. Franken race ?
I 'm guessing that Franken would poll much more strongly than he did in November .
If that is so , then maybe the move for a re-vote should be embraced as a perhaps quicker way to resolve this issue .
COMMENT # 19 [ Permalink ]
... cann4ing said on 2/18/2009 @ 7:04 pm PT ...
It did n't change my mind , Agent 99 , in the sense that because of the SCOTUS decision I concluded that the Bush arguments were indeed correct .
To the contrary , I think the Bush v. Gore decision was probably the worst SCOTUS decision since Dred Scott .
It simply reminded me that the outcome of litigation is not always predictable .
As a litigator , attorneys learn early on that being right does not always equate to prevailing in an individual case .
Dr. Rickles , the issue is not whether Franken would prevail in a new election , though there is no doubt that Coleman would love to get a do - over .
Its that Franken already prevailed in the last one .
The three judge panel has made it clear that its role is to confirm who received the most votes of the votes lawfully cast .
It is exceedingly likely that it will find that Franken is the winner .
The only question then will be whether Franken will be sworn in pending an appeal or whether Coleman , having lost both the recount and the contest , will be permitted to delay the seating of a 2d U.S. Senator from MN while he pursues an appeal first before the MN Sup.
Ct. and then before the SCOTUS .

Coleman lost ,
He needs to give up and let the Democrats fix the problems that the Republicans made , once again .
I do agree though the election process is flawed , electronic voting is a sham !
We need to get rid of electronic vetoing till the process can be verified .
The way the process should work is you vote and you get a receipt w/ specific number linked with your choice .
The companies that engineered the voting machines also make ATMs so the idea of a receipt is not beyond the technology , if we were all given a receipt with a specific number a recount would be rather simple compared to today , you simply go back to the place you voted input the number on your receipt , than the information is posted on - line / book / paper so all can read and verify that there number is correctly tied to the candidate that they voted for .
Since the numbers will be a random , publishing the numbers will not divulge your identity and / or who you voted for .
This makes the process trustworthy , verifiable and anonymous .
What do you think ???

That 's when I lost my cool completely .
I do n't have that much experience with Supreme Court rulings , but I do n't think they can do that , and yet everyone went right along as though they can .
It was clearly an attempt to keep crappy precedent off the books while installing the crappy president of their choice , and I thought the whole purpose of maintaining the Supremes was to provide solid precedent , period .

" this particular protracted fight would have been happening even if the paper ballots had been publicly hand - counted first off without any e-tabulation "
That premise requires that the e-voting results match what would have happened with paper counting .
If someone tried to steal an election , paper certainly would NOT match electronic .
Hence , we need to get rid of electronic all together , because we know for a _fact_ that they are very prone to problems that cause their reported results to be something very different than the voter 's intent .
What I find amazing about this whole thing is the absolute hypocrisy of the right - wing .
They win , and it's all but proved they cheat , and they say " you 're just mad because we won , just deal with it " .
They lose , and there 's nothing to support allegations of cheating , so they cry " we want a do over ! " .
What happened to " you lost , just deal with it " ?

Yes .
That was from the climactic final scene of HBO 's documentary " Hacking Democracy " , showing the first known hack of a paper ballot election using an electronic tabulator .
You can watch the scene right here ( about 10 amazing minutes ) .

Brad , it 's refreshing to see that you take the time to read comments and respond to them .
I think it important that your readers understand that the current dispute is not about either E-voting or the accuracy of the recount .
While your blog , over the past several years , has provided perhaps the best documentation of the unreliability of E-voting , the Coleman " contest " underscores the care that voters must exercise if they seek to by - pass E-voting via the absentee ballot .
The three - judge panel ruling delineates a myriad of ways in which a MN voter can err in the submission of an absentee ballot preventing one 's vote from ever being counted , such as a failure to sign , either by the voter or the witness , failure to list a complete address , failure to submit to the correct precinct , etc .
While the panel ruling applying strict standards for absentee ballot acceptance favors Franken in this particular election , it is vital that those choosing to vote by absentee ballot understand the care required to meet their state 's standards when choosing that method of voting .

The three judge panel 's 2/18/09 ruling rejecting his right to call an expert witness on his equal protection argument pretty much sums up the near certainty that Coleman will lose his contest .
The court said : " The only question that can be decided in an election contest is which party received the highest number of legally cast votes , and therefore is entitled to receive the certificate of election .
Minn. Stat. § 209.12 .
The Court will be reviewing all ballots presented according to the uniform standard contained in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 203B .
It is irrelevant whether there were irregularities between the counties in applying Minnesota Statutes § 203B .

You want fatally flawed ?
Fatally flawed was when Paul Wellstone was murdered in 2002 - days before the election - and Coleman took his Senate seat .
Coleman and the RNC are not used to failing in their schemes .
Coleman lost because more people voted for Al Franken .
Probably more than their rigged machines actually tallied .
And he lost because Al Franken stayed away from small private airplanes .
It 's over .
It 's time for Coleman to crawl back into the woodwork .

Technology news that you want to see
Sophie Waller had an extreme phobia of dentists , the inquest was told A girl who starved to death after having eight teeth removed had a deep fear of dentists which went unnoticed by authorities , a coroner has said .
Sophie Waller , of St Dennis , Cornwall , died in December 2005 of renal failure caused by starvation and dehydration .
She suffered an apparent extreme dental phobia and refused to eat , sleep or drink after her milk teeth came loose .
She underwent an operation in hospital to remove the teeth but this failed to cure the problem , the hearing was told .
Sophie 's parents , Richard and Janet Waller , told the inquest at Truro City Hall she had been scared of dentists and had refused to eat or talk when a milk tooth became loose .
The only justification for Sophie 's death is that procedures have and will be changed and will hopefully save another child 's life
Richard and Janet Waller
Young dentists put children first
She was sent to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in November 2005 to have the teeth taken out under general anaesthetic .
Following the operation however , she would not open her mouth to eat or talk and was given a feeding tube on the ward .
She left hospital on 17 November and was taken home on the understanding a bed would still be waiting for her in hospital .
After she seemed to respond positively at home and after a physical and psychological assessment on 21 November she was officially discharged .
But her notes were then sent to the wrong GP and she was not seen by another medical professional before she died , the hearing was told .
She was found dead in her bed at home on 2 December .
She lost 11kg ( 23lbs ) in the month before she died .
Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon , who recorded a narrative verdict , said the severity of her condition had not been realised and this had " prevented her from receiving the medical support that could have prevented her death " .
Procedures changed
After the verdict , the hospital apologised to the family .
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals
Trust said : " Everyone involved in Sophie 's care was deeply saddened by her death and we offer our apologies and most sincere condolences to her family .
" Care around any child is a multi-agency and multi- disciplinary process , working closely with the whole family .
" With hindsight it can be seen that there were shortcomings in communication between health organisations and with Sophie 's parents , for which we apologise . "
The trust said a clinical review was carried out after her death and that recommendations it had made had been implemented .
A family friend , Elaine Panks , read a statement on behalf of the family .
It said : " It has been a very emotional and distressing time .
No words can express how we have felt and still feel .
" The only justification for Sophie 's death is that procedures have and will be changed and will hopefully save another child 's life . "
Dr Carlyon said she was " pleased " all the agencies involved had made changes after their own independent reviews .

We all too often focus only on negative developments , and while it is understandable for people to keep their eyes on impending calamities , obsessing about the bad sometimes causes us to miss good news .
We see a lot of that even with regard to the US .
For instance , there has been a 23 % decline in violent crime over the past twenty years in the US , but people who watch a lot of television ( especially , I presume , police procedurals ) tell pollsters they think crime has gotten worse .
I see significant positive stories in the Muslim world in 2008 that do n’t get a lot of press in the US , but which will be important for the incoming Obama administration .

Last February , the Pakistani public gave the largest number of seats in parliament to the left of center , secular Pakistan People ’s Party .
The fundamentalist religious parties took a bath at the polls .
In August , the elected parliament initiated impeachment proceedings against Musharraf , who resigned .
A civilian president , Asaf Ali Zardari , was elected .
George W. Bush is reported to have been the last man in Washington to relinquish support for Musharraf , who had rampaged around sacking supreme court justices , censoring the press , and imprisoning political enemies on a whim .
Pakistan faces an insurgency in the northwestern tribal areas , and problems of terrorism rooted in past military training of guerrillas to fight India in Kashmir .
But the civilian parties have a much better chance of curbing such military excesses than does a leader dependent solely on the military for support .
True , the new political leadership is widely viewed as corrupt , but South Korean politics was corrupt and that country nevertheless made progress .
Besides , after Madoff / Blagojevich , who are we to talk ?
The triumph of parliamentary democracy over military dictatorship in Pakistan during the past year is good news that Washington - centered US media seldom could appreciate because of Bush ’s narrative about military dictatorship equalling stability and a reliable ally in the war on terror .
In reality ?
Not so much .
2 . The Iraqi government succeeded in imposing on the Bush administration a military withdrawal from Iraq by 2011 .
The hard negotiations showed a new confidence on the part of the Iraqi political class that they can stand on their own feet militarily .
The relative success of PM Nuri al - Maliki ’s Basra campaign last spring was part of the mix here .
But so too was the absolute insistence by Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani that any Status of Forces Agreement not infringe on Iraqi sovereignty .
The Sadr Movement resorted to street politics , aiming to thwart any agreement at all , thus providing cover to al - Maliki as he pushed back against Bush ’s imperial demands .
The Iraqi success in getting a withdrawal agreement has paved the way for President - elect Obama to fulfill his pledge to withdraw from Iraq on a short timetable .
3. Syria has secretly been conducting peace negotiations with Israel , using the Turkish Prime Minister Rejep Tayyip Erdogan as the intermediary .
There are few more fraught relationships between countries in the world than the Israel - Syrian divide , but obviously Bashar al - Asad and Ehud Olmert felt that there were things they could fruitfully talk about .
Ironically , the clueless George W. Bush went to Israel last spring and condemned talking to the enemy as a form of appeasement .
While he got polite applause , the Israeli mainstream is far more realistic than the silly Neocons who write Bush ’s speeches , and Olmert went on talking to al - Asad .
Unfortunately , the Israeli attack on Gaza has caused Syria to call off the talks for now .
It should be a high priority of the Obama administration to start them back up .
4 . There has been a “ near strategic defeat for al - Qaeda in Saudi Arabia . ”
“ Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ” conducted numerous bombings and shootings in the period 2003 - 2006 , during which the Saudi authorities got serious about taking it on .
Saudi Arabia produces on the order of 11 percent of the world ’s petroleum , and instability there threatens the whole world .
The dramatic subsiding of terrorism there in 2008 is good news for every one .
Opinion polls show support for al - Qaeda in Saudi Arabia plummeting , and determination to fight terrorism is overwhelming .
In polling , a solid majority of Saudis say they want better relations with the United States .
Yes .
The Wahhabis are saying that .
And their number one prerequisite for better relations ?
A US withdrawal from Iraq .
( See above ) .
5 . The crisis of state in Lebanon was patched up late last spring by the Doha agreement .
Qatar ’s King Hamad Al - Thani showed himself a canny negotiator .
Hizbullah came into the government and received support as a national guard for the south as long as it pledged not to drag the country into any more wars unilaterally .
Lebanese politics is always fragile , but this is the best things have been for years .
Lebanese economic conservatism allowed its banks and real estate to avoid the global crash , and hotel occupancy rates are up 25 % over 2007 , with a 2008 economic growth rate of 6 % .
The new president , Michel Suleiman , has also pursued responsible diplomacy with Syria , and the two countries are normalizing relations after years of bitterness .
For all the potential dangers ahead , 2008 was a success story of major proportions in Lebanon .
6. [ pdf ]
Indonesia ’s transition to democracy that began in 1998 has been ‘ consolidated ’ and it has regained its economic health , paying back $ 43 billion in loans to the International Monetary Fund .
Indonesia is the world fourth most populous country and the world ’s largest Muslim country , comprising something like 16 percent or more of all Muslims .
It faces many challenges , as do all young democracies , but when 245 million Muslims have kept democracy going for 10 years , the thesis that Islam is somehow incompatible with democracy is clearly fallacious .
7 . Turkey avoided a major constitutional crisis in 2008 when the constitutional court declined to find the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) guilty of undermining the official ideology of secularism .
AKP is mildly Muslim in orientation , in contrast to the militantly secular military .
The verdict gave Turks an opportunity to work on bridging the secular - religious divide .
Turkey , a country of 70 million the size of Texas , is a linchpin of stability in the Middle East , and it survived a crisis here .
8. Major Arab pop singers jointly performed an anti-war opera that called for co-existence among the region ’s Christians , Muslims and Jews and an end to the senseless slaughter .
It ran on 15 Arab satellite channels , and one satellite channel ran it nonstop for days .
It was the Woodstock of this generation in the Arab world and it got no international press at all .
9. King Abdullah II of Jordan pledged an end to press censorship in Jordan .
Tim Sebastian reports ,
‘ The man at the center of this event was King Abdullah of Jordan , who last month gathered together the chief editors of Jordan ’s main newspapers and told them that from now on there would be big changes in the country ’s media environment .
Specifically , no more jailing of reporters for writing the wrong thing and a new mechanism would be created to protect the rights of journalists , including their access to information .
“ Detention of journalists is prohibited , ” he said .
“ I do not see a reason for detaining a journalist because he / she wrote something or for expressing a view . ” ‘
It is legitimate to take all this with a grain of salt , to be skeptical , to wait and see .
But Sebastian is right that if the king means it , it is big news for Jordan and the Middle East , and the court in Amman should be pressured to stand by the new procedures .
10 . The United Arab Emirates is creating the first carbon - free city , “ Masdar , ” as a demonstration project .
That the Oil Gulf , a major source of the fossil fuels that , when burned , are causing climate change and rising sea levels , has become concerned about these problems , it is a very good sign .

Claim : Nine people died in a beer flood in 1814 .
Status : True .
Origins :
The ongoing spate of Internet
reports of unusual deaths , both real and fictional , might lead some to believe extraordinary modes of demise are a recent phenomenon .
Nothing could be further from the truth — the Grim Reaper has always found incredible methods of ending human life .
One such instance took place in 1814 in London .
On October 17 of that year , a rupture in a brewery tank containing 3,500 barrels of beer caused a flood of fatal proportions in the London parish of St. Giles .
The wave of beer swept victims off their feet , dashed them against walls , and buried them under debris .
Two houses were demolished in the sea of beer suddenly loosed upon town , and nine people lost their lives in the flood of suds .
America endured a comparable disaster in January 1919 when a rupture in a molasses tank unleashed a flood of goo that killed twenty - one Bostonians .

Iran puts satellite
into Earth orbit
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 3 , 2009 ;
Updated with more details
Iran launched its first satellite into orbit Monday using a modified homemade long - range missile , thrusting the Islamic republic into an elite club of space - faring nations , state media reported .
The small Omid communications satellite was launched Monday evening aboard a Safir 2 rocket , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
Launch was likely around 1830 GMT , or around 10 p.m.
Iran time , according to Jonathan McDowell , an astrophysicist who provides satellite data on the Internet .
Iran did not release the launch time in state news reports .
The 72 - foot - tall Safir 2 rocket probably blasted off from a launch site in Iran 's Semnan province in the north - central part of the country .
The launcher flew southeast over the Indian Ocean to avoid flying over neighboring countries , according to Charles Vick , senior fellow at GlobalSecurity.org , a Washington - based military think tank .
Two objects from the launch , likely the Omid satellite and part of its booster , are circling Earth in oval - shaped orbits .
The orbits range in altitude from low points of 153 miles to high points of 235 miles and 273 miles .
The orbital inclination is 55.5 degrees , according to U.S. military tracking data .
Iran joins a small group of countries with the ability to build and launch their own satellites into orbit .
The former Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 , in October 1957 .
The United States followed with the successful launch of Explorer 1 in January 1958 .
France , Japan , China , the United Kingdom , India and Israel later developed and successfully flew their own space launchers .
Iran is the first new space - faring nation since Israel joined the club in 1988 .
The launch was timed to occur during a 10 - day celebration of the 30th anniversary of Iran 's Islamic revolution , official news reports said .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ordered Monday 's launch and said the satellite was a " step toward justice and peace , " according to state media .
" Iran 's official presence in space has been added to the pages of history , " Ahmadinejad said .
Iran constructed Omid and planned the launch under strict U.N. economic sanctions due to international suspicions of Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The sanctions limit the international trade of goods that could be used on military projects , including programs related to satellite and rocket development .
U.S. officials said Monday 's launch was a step in the wrong direction in Iran 's relationship with the West .
" This action does not convince us that Iran is acting responsibly to advance stability or security in the region , " said Robert Gibbs , White House press secretary .
The development of space technology has far - reaching implications for Iran 's missile program , according to U.S. officials .
State Department spokesman Robert Wood expressed " grave concern " over the launch .
" Developing a space launch vehicle that can put a satellite into orbit could possibly lead to the development of a ballistic missile system , " Wood said .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the satellite program is for " purely peaceful purposes , " the Fars news agency reported .
Iran orbited its first satellite in 2005 on a Russian rocket , but Monday 's launch was the country 's first to use a homemade rocket launched from Iranian territory .
Omid , which means hope in Persian , carries experimental control systems , communications equipment , and a small remote sensing payload , Iranian news reports said .
Previous versions of the Safir rocket have completed several suborbital tests , including a mysterious flight last August that some believe may have been a failed satellite launch attempt .
Iranian news reports in August reported the Safir had successfully reached orbit , but Western intelligence officials said the rocket suffered a dramatic failure during the launch .
Observers believe the Safir rocket is based on Iran 's Shahab 3 ballistic missile .
Iran plans several more satellites over the next few years to bolster disaster management programs and strengthen communications networks inside the country .
A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. “ truth commission ” should investigate Bush administration policies including the promotion of war in Iraq , detainee treatment and wiretapping without a warrant , an influential senator proposed on Monday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , urged a commission as a way to heal what he called sharp political divides under former President George W. Bush and to prevent future abuses .
He compared it to other truth commissions , such as one in South Africa that investigated the apartheid era .
“ We need to come to a shared understanding of the failures of the recent past , ” Leahy said in a speech at Georgetown University .
“ Rather than vengeance , we need a fair - minded pursuit of what actually happened , ” the Vermont senator said .
“ And we do that to make sure it never happens again . ”
Some Republicans and intelligence officials have resisted any suggestion of broad inquiries into accusations against the Bush administration , saying it would be a distraction or weaken morale in the fight against terrorism .
“ If every administration started to re-examine what every prior administration did , there would be no end to it .
This is not Latin America , ” the Judiciary committee ’s top- ranking Republican , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , told reporters last month .
President Barack Obama , who suggested shortly before he took office in January that he did not favor prosecuting Bush administration officials over their counterterrorism policies , said on Monday his administration would seek to uphold “ our traditions of rule of law and due process . ”
“ Nobody ’s above the law and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing ... people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen , ” Obama told a news conference , his first since taking office .
“ I will take a look at Senator Leahy ’s proposal ... but my general orientation is to say let ’s get it right moving forward , ” he said .
Bush spokesman Rob Saliterman said only , “ We ’re not going to respond to every call for more investigations . ”
Leahy said he had not begun to promote the truth commission idea with the Obama administration or with the Democratic - controlled Congress .
But he suggested it could be formed by both Congress and the White House , and said the panel must have credibility across the political spectrum .
Issues to investigate would include the Justice Department ’s firings of several U.S. attorneys , which Leahy said may have been motivated by a White House aim to influence elections , policies on the treatment of terrorism suspects and other areas “ where ( congressional ) committees were lied to . ”
That included the war in Iraq , he said .
“ There were lies told to the American people all the way through . ”
Bush has acknowledged that intelligence on Iraqi weapons programs was wrong , but said he never lied to the public about the war .
Leahy said he wanted the Defense Department investigated for filming Iraq - war protesters , which he said came “ shockingly close ” to the FBI ’s Vietnam War-era Cointelpro operation to investigate domestic war protesters .
“ We fought a revolution in this country so we could protest the actions of our government , ” he said .
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE :
THE DIRECT WAY TO FIX THE CREDIT CRISIS
Letter to the bank �
Dear Sirs ,
In light of recent developments , when you returned my check marked �insufficient funds , � were you referring to my funds or yours ?
Economist John Kenneth Galbraith famously said , � The process by which banks create money is so simple that the mind is repelled .��
If banks can create money , why are we suffering from a �credit crunch� ?
Why can�t banks create all the money they can find borrowers for ?
Last fall , Congress committed an unprecedented $ 700 billion in taxpayer money to reversing the credit crisis , and the Federal Reserve has already fanned that into $ 8.5 trillion in loans and commitments .
1 �
But the bank bailout has proven to be no more than a boondoggle for a handful of lucky Wall Street banks , without getting credit flowing again .
To understand the real cause of the credit crisis and how it can be reversed , we first need to understand credit itself � what it is , where it comes from , and what the real tourniquet is that has limited its flow .
Banks actually create credit ; and if private banks can do it , so could public banks or public treasuries .
The crisis is not one of �liquidity � but of �solvency .�
It has been caused , not by the banks � inability to get credit ( something they can create with accounting entries ) , but by their inability to meet the capital requirement imposed by the Bank for International Settlements , the private foreign head of the international banking system .
That inability , in turn , has been caused by the derivatives virus ; and only a few big banks are seriously infected with it .
By bailing out these big banks , the government is actually spreading the virus by furnishing the funds for them to take over smaller regional banks .
A more effective alternative than trying to patch up the hopelessly imperiled derivatives positions of these few Wall Street banks would be to simply create another credit system with a pristine set of books .
We don�t need to fix the Wall Street disease ; we can bypass the whole problem and create a new , healthy , parallel system .
A network of public banks ( federal and state ) could create �credit� just as private banks do now .
This credit could be extended at low interest rates to consumers and at very low interest to local governments , drastically reducing the cost of public projects by reducing the cost of funding them .
That is not a radical proposal .
� It is what private banks themselves do every day .
But bankers will dispute it , and most people have trouble believing it .
So to make a compelling case for this solution , the first thing that needs to be established is that . . .
Banks Create the Money They Lend
Bankers will tell you that they do not create money .
At a 10 % reserve requirement , they simply lend out 90 % of their deposits .
The catch is that their �deposits � include the money they have written into their customers � accounts as loans .
That is how loans are made : numbers are simply written into the accounts of borrowers , as many reputable authorities have attested .
Here are two of them , dating back to when officials were either more aware of what was going on or more open about it :
� [ W ] hen a bank makes a loan , it simply adds to the borrower�s deposit account in the bank by the amount of the loan .
The money is not taken from anyone else�s deposit ; it was not previously paid in to the bank by anyone .
It �s new money , created by the bank for the use of the borrower . �
� Robert B. Anderson , Treasury Secretary under Eisenhower , in an interview reported in the August 31 , 1959 issue of U.S. News and World Report
� Do private banks issue money today ?
Yes .
Although banks no longer have the right to issue bank notes , they can create money in the form of bank deposits when they lend money to businesses , or buy securities .
. . .
The important thing to remember is that when banks lend money they don�t necessarily take it from anyone else to lend .
Thus they �create� it .�
� Congressman Wright Patman , Money Facts ( House Committee on Banking and Currency , 1964 )
The process by which banks create money was detailed in a revealing booklet put out by the Chicago Federal Reserve titled Modern Money Mechanics .2
The booklet was periodically revised until 1992 , when it had reached 50 pages long .
It is written in somewhat difficult prose , but here are a few relevant passages : �
� The actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks . � [ p3 ]
Translation : banks create money .
� In the absence of legal reserve requirements , banks can build up deposits by increasing loans and investments so long as they keep enough currency on hand to redeem whatever amounts the holders of deposits want to convert into currency . � [ p3 ]
Translation : banks can create as much money as they want by writing loans into their borrowers � accounts , limited only by ( a ) legal reserve requirements ( money that must be held in reserve � traditionally about 10 % of outstanding deposits and loans ) or ( b ) the amount of money they will need to keep on hand to pay any depositors who might come for their money ( also traditionally about 10 % ) .
� Banks may increase the balances in their reserve accounts by depositing checks and proceeds from electronic funds transfers as well as currency . � [ p4 ]
Translation : the �reserves� that count toward the reserve requirement include currency , deposited checks , and electronic funds transfers .
( Note that the �deposits � created as loans are excluded from this list of allowable reserves : the bank cannot just keep bootstrapping loans on top of loans but must have money from external sources backing up its liabilities equal to about 10 % of its loans and deposits . )
� The money - creation process takes place principally through transaction accounts [ accounts that can be drawn on without restriction ] . � [ p2 ]
� With a uniform 10 percent reserve requirement , a $ 1 increase in reserves would support $ 10 of additional transaction accounts . � [ p49 ]
Translation : $ 1 deposited by a customer can be fanned into $ 10 in loans .
� In the real world , a bank�s lending is not normally constrained by the amount of excess reserves it has at any given moment .
Rather , loans are made , or not made , depending on the bank�s credit policies and its expectations about its ability to obtain the funds necessary to pay its customers � checks and maintain required reserves in a timely fashion . �
Translation :
In practice , banks issue loans without worrying too much about whether they have the reserves to cover them .
If they come up short , they can just borrow them :
� [ Since ] the individual bank does not know today precisely what its reserve position will be at the time the proceeds of today�s loans are paid out .
. . . many banks turn to the money market - borrowing funds to cover deficits or lending temporary surpluses . � [ p50 ]
� [ A ] bank may [ also ] borrow reserves temporarily from its Reserve Bank . . . .
[ However ] , banks are discouraged from borrowing [ Reserve Bank ] adjustment credit too frequently or for extended time periods . � [ p29 ]
Translation :
If the bank finds at the end of the accounting period that its reserves do not come to the required 10 % of its outstanding loans and deposits , it can simply borrow the reserves it needs from the money market or its Federal Reserve Bank .
A 2002 article posted on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that today , few banks are constrained by reserve requirements at all :
� Since the beginning of the last decade , required reserve balances have fallen dramatically .
The decline stems in part from regulatory action : the Federal Reserve eliminated reserve requirements on large time deposits in 1990 and lowered the requirements on transaction accounts in 1992 .
But a far more important source of the decline in required reserves has been the growth of sweep accounts .
In the most common form of sweeping , funds in bank customers � retail checking accounts are shifted overnight into savings accounts exempt from reserve requirements and then returned to customers � checking accounts the next business day .
Largely as a result of this practice , today only 30 percent of banks are bound by a reserve balance requirement .�3
Even without official reserve requirements , however , banks must keep enough money on hand to meet withdrawals or checks written against the accounts of their depositors ; and that generally means about 10 % of outstanding deposits and loans , as moneylenders discovered centuries ago .
But if the banks come up short , they can borrow this money from the money market or the Federal Reserve ; and if the Fed comes up short , it can create new reserves . 4
� So why the current credit crunch ?
What is limiting bank lending ?
One answer is that borrowers are simply �tapped out � and not in a position to take out as many loans as they used to .
When housing and the stock market crashed , consumers no longer had home or stock equity to borrow against .5
But to the extent that the blockage is with the banks themselves , it is not caused by the reserve requirement .
Something else is putting the squeeze on credit . . . .
The Real Tourniquet :
Capital Adequacy and the Mark - to - Market Rule
What actually constrains bank lending is the capital adequacy requirement , something that is imposed not by our own central bank but by the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) .
Called � the central bankers � central bank , � the BIS pulls the strings of the private international banking system from Basel , Switzerland .
How the capital requirement is determined is even more complicated than the reserve requirement , but it needs to be understood to understand why banks with the power to create money are going bankrupt .
So here is a simplified version .
A bank�s �capital� consists of its assets minus its liabilities .
Under the capital adequacy rule imposed by the Basel Accords , assets are �risk - weighted , � with some being considered riskier than others . �
Ordinary loans have a �risk weighting� of 1 .
The capital adequacy rule requires that the ratio of a bank�s capital to its assets with a risk - weighting of 1 be at least 8 % .
That means the bank must have $ 8 in capital for every $ 100 in ordinary loans .
Federal bonds have a risk - weighting of zero : they are considered to be as safe as dollars and don�t need any extra capital backing them .
Mortgage loans ( which are secured by real estate ) have a risk weighting of .5 .
That means they need only $ 4 of capital per $ 100 of loans .
Other bank exposures given risk weightings include such things as derivatives and foreign exchange contracts .
6
( Interestingly , the $ 700 billion committed by Congress to bailing out the financial system is approximately 8 % of the $ 8.5 trillion the Fed has now promised in loans and commitments .
Even the Federal Reserve evidently feels constrained by the BIS capital requirement . )
A very controversial accounting rule imposed on banks for their capital ratio calculations is the �mark to market� rule .
This rule requires banks to revalue all of their assets each day as if the assets had to be sold that day .
Capital calculations thus fluctuate with the market ; and in today�s volatile market , all asset classes have plunged at the same time .
Since assets get marked to market but liabilities don�t , a bank may suddenly find that its assets are insufficient to support its liabilities , rendering it insolvent and unable to make new loans .
Banks have gotten around the capital adequacy requirement by reducing risk on their balance sheets with a form of private bet known as �derivatives .�
At least , they thought they had gotten around the rule .
But this unregulated form of insurance proved to be based on faulty mathematical models .
( See Ellen Brown , ��Credit Default Swaps : Derivative Disaster Du Jour , � and � It�s the Derivatives , Stupid ! , � www.webofdebt.com/articles.)
� Credit default swaps� ( CDS ) are a form of derivative widely sold as insurance against default .
When AIG , the world�s largest insurance company , ventured into CDS in the late 1990s , the presumption was that �housing always goes up � and that the risk of default was so remote that selling �credit protection� was virtually � free money �.7
But this free money turned into a serious liability to the protection sellers when the �remote� actually happened and a flood of defaults struck .
The value of the derivatives protecting securitized mortgages became so questionable that they were unmarketable at any price .
Banks counting them as assets on their books then had to �mark them to market � effectively at zero , reducing the banks � capital below the levels called for in the Basel Accords and rendering the banks officially insolvent .
When AIG went broke in September 2008 , banks heavily involved in derivatives faced double jeopardy : not only would they have to write down the derivative protection they had sold to others and counted as assets on their books , but they could no longer count on the derivative insurance they had bought to minimize the risk of default on their other assets .
AIG got a massive bailout from the Fed in return for most of its equity , but even that bailout money is not expected to be enough to get it out of its derivative nightmare and keep it afloat .
Derivatives have introduced a lack of transparency into bank portfolios , creating fear and uncertainty on the part of lenders , depositors and investors alike .
This uncertainty has prevented banks from raising capital by selling stock , or meeting reserve requirements by getting interbank loans ; and it has discouraged investors from investing in the money market .
Banks don�t know whether the money they lend to each other will be repaid , since they don�t have a clear view of the value of the assets carried on bank balance sheets .
The result is a crisis of confidence : the players are all eying each other suspiciously and holding their cards close to the chest .
Going Local
Fortunately , according to a recent study using the Treasury Department�s own data , the banking crisis is not widespread but is limited to only �a few big , vocal banks .
�8 � The real credit problem lies with the financial institutions with significant derivative exposure , and most of this liability is carried by only a handful of Wall Street giants .
In early 2008 , outstanding derivatives on the books of U.S. banks exceeded $ 180 trillion .
However , $ 90 trillion of this was carried on the books of JPMorgan Chase alone , while Citibank and Bank of America each had $ 38 trillion on their books .
9
Needless to say , these are also the banks that are first in line for the Treasury�s bailout money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Rather than excising the relatively contained derivative tumor , the Treasury and the Fed are feeding it with trillions in taxpayer money ; and this money is being used , not to unfreeze credit by making loans , but to buy up smaller banks .
10 � That means the derivative cancer , rather than being excised , is liable to spread .
We the people and our representatives in Congress have allowed Wall Street to call the shots because we think we are dependent on their credit system , but we aren�t .
There are other ways to get credit -- ways that are fair , efficient , transparent , and don�t encourage greed .
Public credit could be generated by a system of public banks .
Precedent for this solution is to be found in the state - owned Bank of North Dakota , which has been generating credit for North Dakota since 1919 , keeping the state fiscally sound when other states are floundering .
( See Ellen Brown , � Sustainable Government : Banking for a � New � New Deal , � webofdebt.com / articles , December 8 , 2008 . )
The credit crunch could be avoided by �going local� not just in the United States but around the world .
Countries that have been seduced or coerced into funneling their productive assets into serving foreign markets and foreign investors could become self - sustaining , using their own credit and their own resources to feed and serve their own people .
There is much more to be said on this subject , but it will be saved for future articles .
Stay tuned .

In the last 24 hours , two power producers ordered up a gigawatt of solar power .
That 's twice the total solar capacity the United States had installed in 2007 .
PG&E , a California utility , and NRG , a national independent power producer , announced plans to build 500 megawatts of solar power each .
NRG is partnering with Google.org - backed eSolar , a startup incubated by the legendary venture capital firm , Idealab , that is pursuing solar thermal power which uses mirrors to turn liquid into steam that drives a turbine .
Meanwhile PG&E will be investing in photovoltaics , which directly convert light into electricity .
The Solar Electric Power Association particularly celebrated the latter move , which they said heralded a new era for solar energy in which utilities , not individual consumers , would be the " most important customer " for the industry .
The original bailout bill , passed last year and filled with energy provisions , changed the law so that utilities like PG&E became eligible to receive the 30 percent investment tax credit for solar projects .
Five utilities from New Jersey 's PSE&G to San Diego Gas & Electric have now announced plans for utility - owned solar projects .
" Utility companies around the U.S. are exploring ownership of solar projects now that they have access to the [ tax credit ] , " said Julia Hamm , the Solar Electric Power Association 's executive director .
The two announcements highlight the ongoing strength of renewable energy , despite the tough economic times .
With most industries falling apart , tax incentives and the risk of carbon legislation continue to push renewable energy forward , even as some individual projects and companies experience trouble .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Frustrated with some of his Western allies , in particular the United States , Afghan President Hamid Karzai has begun to reach out to Afghanistan ’s giant northern neighbour Russia .

U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to make Afghanistan his top foreign policy priority and will be unlikely to give Karzai an easy ride , having accused him in the past of failing to get “ out of the bunker ” and rule effectively .
Karzai , once the darling of the West , is no longer assured of the unwavering support he enjoyed from former President George W. Bush , and European leaders have joined the chorus continually calling for good governance -- more implied criticism of Karzai .
“ When Karzai sees his former allies are not in power and the rest criticise him , instead of helping him , then he looks for new allies , ” said Shukriya Barakzai , a prominent parliamentarian .
The new allies , she said , were led by Russia , and included neighbours Iran and China who have economic interests in Afghanistan , but also reservations about the presence of foreign troops .
Russian diplomats have said the West was making the same mistakes the Soviet Union made during its ill - fated 10 - year occupation of Afghanistan .
On the eve of President Barack Obama ’s inauguration , Karzai ’s office released a statement saying Moscow had accepted his request for providing defence aid to Afghanistan .
Karzai ’s chief spokesman played down the importance of the move , saying despite Karzai ’s call , Afghanistan was committed to its ties with NATO and the United States , which have nearly 70,000 troops fighting Taliban - led insurgents in the country .
The request by Karzai , facing elections in August , was made last November and the timing of the release of the news of Moscow ’s acceptance could be no more than just a coincidence .
However , the next day in parliament , just hours before Obama took office , Karzai , who has led Afghanistan with Western military and financial support since the Taliban ’s 2001 overthrow , spoke apparently for the first time of his desire for closer ties with Russia .
Days later , as the U.S. ambassador and U.S. commander of NATO troops looked on , Karzai told an army graduation ceremony Afghanistan needed to acquire planes and tanks from anywhere it could after failing to get them from NATO and the United States .
“ We told America and the world to give us planes soon and if you do not , we will get them from another place , ” Karzai said .
“ We told them we have become impatient and we can not live without planes . ”
RECRIMINATION
Seven years after swiftly dispatching the Taliban government , Western forces are struggling against insurgent attacks that rose by a third last year and a campaign of suicide bombing that has heightened the sense of insecurity and eroded public trust in the ability of both Karzai ’s government and NATO to bring security .
Mutual recrimination , though often muted and diplomatically coded , has risen accordingly .
Karzai has repeatedly hit back at Western criticism of his government , endemic official corruption and lack of rule of law , with stinging attacks on the U.S. and NATO record of accidentally killing hundreds of civilians in air strikes .
Last week Karzai warned he would call a national assembly of tribal chiefs and elders to discuss civilian casualties and house searches by foreign troops if NATO failed to reply positively within a month to a draft agreement with his government he sent to the alliance , state newspapers said .
The draft agreement largely wants control over where and how foreign troops are deployed , an end to house raids and coordination at the “ highest level ” on the use of air power .
In an election year , Karzai may well want to distance himself from foreign forces and Western allies and shift the blame for the failures and missed opportunities of the last seven years .
Seeking regional allies is just part of that shift .
“ The Russians may have more supporters in Afghanistan than the Americans since they know Afghanistan much better and Iran is also its major ally , ” said Waheed Mozhdah , an analyst who served under the Taliban government .

As an alumni of the University of California , Berkeley , I was saddened to learn that they employ a war criminal as a professor .
John
Yoo is the author of the infamous torture memos that used very poor legal theories to authorize the horrendous treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and other sites .
John
Yoo has even advocated the use of torture against children !
Salon columnist Glen Greenwald has written an excellent article that explains exactly what John Yoo has done , and Keith Olbermann also does a better job of explaining John Yoo 's actions then I ever could :
Despite the fact that John
Yoo is a well - known war criminal , and despite the fact that John Yoo 's jurisprudence in justifying torture is ridiculous and unconstitutional , the University of California continues to employ John Yoo .
Here is what the Dean of Berkeley School of Law ( Boalt ) has to say .
In contrast , Georgetown University terminated their contract with Doug Feith ( another war criminal ) in response to student and alumni pressure .
I 'm sick and tired of the continued illegal acts of the Bush administration .
But there is n't much I can do about that .
But one thing I can do is to not support Cal with donations while John Yoo is employed there .
It 's a small act , and maybe it 's being petty , but I need to make some stand , even just a small one , saying that the behavior of these people in unacceptable .
Because of John
Yoo 's continued employment at Cal , I have written the following letter to the UC Regents : I am a proud alum of the University of California , Berkeley .
For years now I have encouraged prospective students to attend Cal , and have sung its praises to coworkers and friends alike .
I believe that Cal is a great university worthy of support from its alumni .
However , in light of the Regents ' decision to continue to employ John
Yoo as a law professor , I will be unable to make any donations or provide any financial support to Cal .
While I fully respect and celebrate Cal 's commitment to respecting different points of view , John Yoo 's actions in defense of torture , human rights abuses , denial of habeus corpus , illegal warrantless searches , and denial of basic constitutional rights go beyond ' opinions ' and ' debate ' into the realm of criminal actions .
The Cal I know is a place where human rights and dignities are respected .
The Cal I know is a place where the rule of law is respected .
John
Yoo 's unconstitutional actions and opinions constitute treason against the United States , and war crimes against those injured by his unlawful legal opinions .
The fact that you would willingly provide a platform for such a man to continue to defend his horrific human rights abuses is simply disgraceful and make me question whether Cal still cares about human rights .
Beyond the issue of the human rights abuses enabled by his opinions , Mr. Yoo has shown that he is simply not competent as a constitutional scholar .
His assertion that the President is above the law shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the separation of powers principle that our constitution was founded upon .
A quick read of the landmark Supreme Court decision of Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer clearly shows that the President is not empowered to take the sort of actions John Yoo feels are acceptable .
The Youngstown decision is taught in every Constitutional Law I class and any 1L is able to understand why John Yoo is wrong in his jurisprudence .
The fact that John Yoo is currently employed as a constitutional law professor at Cal makes me doubt that the University maintains the same commitment to scholarly excellence that they had while I was a student .
While I love Cal , I love America more .
John
Yoo 's actions in defense of clearly criminal acts have disgraced America and compromised the integrity of the U.S. Constitution .
The man is at best a poor constitutional scholar and at worst a war criminal .
Although I respect the Regents ' decisions on how to run their university , I cannot support Cal with my donations as long as I know that Mr. Yoo is employed at Boalt .
If you feel the same about Cal as I do , please help me with this letter writing campaign .

The new 2010 Ford Taurus is not only back but it is back Fo-SHO .
That ’s right , the Ford Taurus SHO is back and it brings with it a performance history that many of us older automotive aficionados can relate too .
Some of the younger crowds have no clue as to the performance statement that the Ford Taurus SHO made back in 1989 .
A lot of people think the Nissan Maxima was the benchmark for a front – wheel - drive performance sedan but in actuality it had an American contender that did not back down easily .
Introduced at this year ’s Chicago Auto Show is the 2010 Ford Taurus SHO ( Super High Output ) 4 - door performance legend that is here to run with the big dogs .
The SHO was such as hit in its hay - day that one of our good friends , Jeremy Prine , also associated with Warehouse motors in Jacksonville , FL , introduced one of the fastest Ford Taurus SHO ’s around with a 13 second run time in the quarter mile turbo charged SHO .
Enough about the 90’s lets chat briefly about the new SHO that is a SHO - nuff hit when it comes to an American performance sedan that does not break the bank account .
Maybe the guys at Ford were listening when people complained that the outgoing Taurus models were just too underpowered for the executive - throw - around car .
I mean really , this is n’t a police car ( Crown Vic ) by any means and even for it to be used in RoboCop the movie was a far enough stretch back in the day .
Now the new 2010 Ford Taurus SHO will sport a twin - turbocharged EcoBoost V6 with 365 hp and all - wheel - drive .
Talking about a big step - up while Ford moves on up to the eastside leaving the other 2 of the big three in the dust .
The performance does not stop at 365 hp .
Hennessey Performance knows when they see a good foundation to work on and that is just what they found in the new 2010 Ford Taurus SHO with new plans to offer an upgrade for the new SHO .
We know with Hennessey ’s previous projects with the new 705 hp Chevy Corvette ZR700 and Camaro HPE700 that any upgrade from them will be packing a serious punch and the Taurus will be yet another serious ride FoSHO !
Below is the official press release of the new 2010 Ford Taurus SHO .
PRESS RELEASE
TAURUS SHO RETURNS WITH 365HP ECOBOOST V-6 , PLUS ALL - WHEEL DRIVE , PADDLE - SHIFT SIX - SPEED GEARBOX
The Taurus SHO returns as the sporty version of Ford ’s new flagship introducing a new generation of premium performance and fuel economy with the 3.5 - liter EcoBoost ™ V - 6 .
This engine delivers V - 8 levels of power – with an estimated 365 horsepower – without compromising its V - 6 fuel economy .
The 2010 Taurus SHO features an enhanced SelectShift® six -speed automatic transmission with control paddles mounted on the steering wheel , in combination with a sophisticated torque sensing all - wheel drive system , a sportier SHO interior , subtle exterior design cues and myriad technologies and features offered on Taurus .
Taurus SHO will be available this summer , starting at $ 37,995 , including destination fees .
CHICAGO , Feb. 11 , 2009 – One of America ’s favorite “ sleeper ” performance cars returns to the Ford lineup , powered by a Super High Output ( SHO ) EcoBoost twin turbocharged engine .
The Taurus SHO joins Ford ’s growing lineup of performance vehicles for the 2010 model year , building on the legacy of the original , which earned a spot on the Car and Driver 10 Best list four years running .
“ The new Taurus SHO delivers on the authentic sleeper sedan formula but adds all - new luxury - appointments , convenience features and technologies to an unsurpassed balance of power and fuel economy , ” said Mark Fields , Ford ’s president of The Americas .
“ This new sport derivative answers enthusiasts ’ calls for a premium Ford flagship sedan with even more attitude . ”
Introduced in 1989 , Taurus SHO was conceived as a discreet performance - oriented sports sedan , ideally suited to the automotive enthusiast needing the room and capability of a four - door full - size car .
Produced through 1999 , more than 100,000 were sold .
The original Taurus SHO generated a loyal following of owners and enthusiasts , with an active club more than 1,000 members strong , an online forum with more than 10,000 registered users and a Web site ( bringbackthesho.com ) specifically devoted to convincing Ford to resurrect the SHO .
The 2010 Taurus product development team spent significant time listening to SHO enthusiasts .
EcoBoost™ Twin-Turbocharged Power
The foundation of the new 2010 Taurus SHO is a 3.5 - liter twin- turbocharged EcoBoost V - 6 engine .
This advanced powerplant generates an estimated 365 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 350 ft.-lbs. of torque at 3,500 rpm , resulting in significantly improved power , torque and fuel economy compared with larger , normally aspirated engines .
This also is Ford ’s most powerful EcoBoost engine .
A key feature of this EcoBoost engine is gasoline direct injection .
The direct injection of fuel into the cylinder during the intake stroke , as opposed to port - style injection to an externally mounted intake , produces a well - mixed air - fuel charge .
Fuel vaporization during the intake stroke cools the incoming air , improving volumetric efficiency and lowers the likelihood of knock .
The results are improved throttle response , reduced cold start emissions characteristics and improved fuel economy .
The cooled charge enables an increased compression ratio , improving efficiency at partial load , while the higher compression ratio allows for better volumetric efficiency under full load engine behavior .
Customers will experience normally aspirated V - 8 power , without compromising V - 6 fuel economy .
The 3.5 - liter EcoBoost V - 6 also uses twin turbochargers , as opposed to a single unit .
The reduced size of each turbocharger results in reduced internal inertia , allowing this advanced engine to avoid the “ turbo lag ” often prevalent in earlier - generation turbocharged applications .
From the driver ’s seat , the rewarding result is linear power delivery across a broad torque band from 1,500 through 5,500 rpm .
Peak torque building quickly off idle ensures responsive acceleration from a standing start .
SelectShift with paddle controls and All - Wheel Drive
The new Taurus SHO driveline combines a high - capacity six - speed 6F55 SelectShift transmission with a sophisticated torque - sensing All - Wheel Drive System .
These components work in harmony to deliver ample traction when putting EcoBoost power on the road .
The six - speed transmission offers a wide array of gears to enable spirited acceleration , yet comfortable high - speed cruising , through a 2.77 to 1 final drive ratio .
SelectShift provides conventional automatic operation or a manual shift mode that gives the driver complete control over gear selection .
For performance - minded drivers , paddle controls allow “ match - rev ” downshifts and will hold manually selected gears for precise control .
Intuitively operated , a squeeze on either paddle will deliver an economical upshift under acceleration , while a gentle push forward brings a smooth downshift , synchronizing the engine and transmission speeds for responsive and positive engagement .
The Taurus SHO driveline is contemporized with the incorporation of a sophisticated All - Wheel Drive System that engages automatically and unobtrusively .
The unit contains an advanced array of internal electromechanical clutches to efficiently distribute torque to the wheels with optimum traction .
Standard all - wheel drive allows the Taurus SHO to efficiently deliver its high performance to the pavement under a wide variety of conditions .
“ Taurus SHO suspension and steering have been sport - tuned to provide discriminating drivers with precise control , confident handling , communicative feedback and a compliant ride , ” said Pete Reyes , Taurus chief engineer .
Taurus SHO features an advanced electronic power - assisted steering ( EPAS ) system , providing responsive road feel and enhanced on - center balance while offering the additional benefit of increased fuel economy .
SHO also features a sport - tuned suspension with unique shock absorbers , springs , stabilizer bars and strut mount bushings specifically developed and harmonized to deliver the highest level of Ford DNA road holding , cornering agility and steering responsiveness available in a Blue Oval full - size sedan .
Taurus SHO takes full advantage of the multi-link SR1 rear suspension design .
Named for the 1:1 shock absorber ratio , this configuration provides an inherently stable baseline for the SHO development team to fine tune for enhanced driver control and agility .
In addition , the SR1 rear suspension geometry provides increased travel , while enabling the use of 19 - and 20 - inch wheels and tires .
For the discriminating automotive enthusiast , Taurus SHO offers an available SHO Performance Package consisting of upgraded brake pads , recalibrated EPAS for even more responsiveness , a “ Sport Mode ” setting for the standard AdvanceTrac® Electronic Stability Control and a shorter 3.16 to 1 final drive ratio for faster acceleration .
Summer - compound 20 - inch Goodyear Eagle F1 performance tires on premium painted wheels also are included .
SHO Specific Subtlety
A key element of the authentic SHO formula is the subtlety of its unique exterior design cues .
Features include sporty premium painted wheels , wrapped in standard low - profile 19 - inch Goodyear Eagle or optional 20 - inch Michelin high - performance tires , a decklid - mounted spoiler and twin chrome exhaust tips .
SHO also features a uniquely finished interpretation of the Ford signature three - bar grille with SHO - specific parking lamp bezels .
“ Taurus SHO was always a stealth high - performance car , ” said Earl Lucas , exterior design manager .
“ The new SHO builds on the expressive design of the 2010 Taurus , adding subtle cues that set it apart . ”
The 2010 SHO is available in a wide range of new Taurus colors including Atlantis Green Metallic , a unique SHO color inspired by the iconic Deep Emerald Green hue appearing in 1991 .
The new Taurus SHO interior encourages performance driving .
Leather - trimmed seats with Miko Suede inserts , made from recycled post - consumer yarns from plastic soft drink bottles , are comfortable and luxurious .
A perforated leather - wrapped steering wheel puts the driver in smooth touch with the road .
Front seats are 10 - way power adjustable .
SHO accelerator and brake pedals are trimmed in aluminum .
The console , instrument and door panels feature SHO - specific authentic aluminum appliqués .
SHO branding appears on the unique floor mats , and on the passenger side of the instrument panel .

For all those who missed the excellent BBC documentary on Peak Oil and it ’s potential impact on farming broadcast , last night , Friday 20th called A Farm for the Future .
It will be repeated tomorrow , on Sunday 22nd February .
Presenter and co-producer Rebecca Hosking explores the importance of oil in farming and the potential impact of peak oil .
The film has a passionate narrative centred on Rebecca ’s small family farm in South West England and how it can manage the transition away from a fossil fuel economy .
Colin Campbell and Richard Heinberg contribute , permaculture , biofuels , biodiversity , forest gardens , gardening vs farming , industrial farming and no -till farming are all covered .
Present methods cannot go on feeding the U.K. ( and many other countries around the globe ) as they are highly dependent on fossil - fuel .
The film concentrates on the necessity to find a new way to feed the nation .
If you are unable to watch the film , Rebecca has provided a feature length article for the UK’s Mail on Sunday newspaper .
“ What we can say without any shadow of doubt is that petroleum man is just about extinct by the end of the century .
That poses the thorny , difficult question , will Homo sapiens be as wise as his name implies and figure out a way to live without oil which is the bloodstream of virtually everything . ”
Colin Campbell .
Above all , the presentation comes from the heart .
It is sure to capture the imagination of many people who , not least due to the deepening recession , are primed for new ideas like never before .
Within the BBC , the Natural History Unit is one of the most conservative and it is amazing that the film ever got made .
The producers had to fight very hard to get the film made at all with many top executives at the BBC calling it “ messed up propaganda ” .
The hope is that with the Natural History Unit producing a film with peak oil at its heart , the gates are now open to all the other departments such as News at Ten , Panorama , Horizon etc. to cover peak oil .
There is knowledge and understanding of peak oil within the BBC but also nervousness about reporting .

Hackage , Haskell ’s central library achive site , went live 2 years ago during the 2007 Haskell Hackathon in Oxford .
Here we are two years later , on the verge of 1000 open source Haskell applications , libraries and tools ( 993 at the time of writing ) , all swinging around cabal and cabal - install .
Is the Haskell community getting any better at the production of code ?
To work this out , I made a 28 day sliding average of the daily releases to Hackage , and there ’s a clear upwards trend .
More people are releasing more Haskell than ever before :
The two spikes correspond to the yearly GHC major releases , where a whole suite of libraries get updated .
We can break Hackage down by category too , to see what areas Haskell is being used in :
Half of all libraries ( just over 500 ) are devoted to data structures , text handling and parsing , system interactions , control structures and abstractions , graphics , and development tools .
Nothing terribly category - theoretic there :-)
Following closely are network , web , math , sound and database programming .
( Breakdown of the top 30 categories ) .
The release of new code also mirrors the growth in community participation .
Here , the growth in the Haskell IRC channel over the last 7 years :
It seems we ’re seeing an obvious correlation between community input ( new programmers ) and output ( project releases ) .
Join in : the lambdas are hot !

Without any fanfare , pharmaceutical companies have been raising the prices of many of their drugs by 100 percent or more , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Minnesota .
The researchers investigated cases in which drugs had their prices increased by 100 percent or more in a single cost adjustment , finding that drug companies had done so for 26 products in 2006 .
Questcor Pharmaceuticals , for example , increased the price of its drug Acthar ( used to treat spasms in infants ) by 1,424 percent , from $ 1,650 per vial to a whopping $ 23,000 .
The practice seems to be getting more common .
In 2004 , only 15 drugs had their prices so drastically increased .
By only the first half of 2008 , however , already the prices of 17 drugs had at least doubled .
“ There ’s no simple explanation , ” said Stephen Schondelmeyer of the University of Minnesota .
“ Some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it . ”
The trend has started to draw legal attention , however .
Recently , Abbot Pharmaceuticals settled a lawsuit over its 400 percent price hike for Norvir , an HIV / AIDS drug .
The company agreed to pay as much as $ 27.5 million in compensation , but not to lower the price of the drug .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Charles Schumer have called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate the price increases .
In addition , Klobuchar has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Ovation Pharmaceuticals for drastically raising the prices of four drugs in 2006 .
In one case , the price of the tumor drug Cosmegen increased from $ 16.79 per dose to $ 593.75 per dose , or 3,436 percent .
“ This does drive up the price of health care , ” said Alan Goldbloom , president of Children ’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota .
“ Hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers , so you and I are paying it in increased premiums . ”

Israeli human rights group B'Tselem claimed that a Palestinian woman in Gaza was killed by IDF fire Tuesday despite waving a white flag .
The IDF has denied the report .
B'Tselem quoted eyewitnesses as saying that during the early hours of Tuesday morning IDF forces began leveling Palestinian homes in the town of Huza'ah , located east of Khan Younis .
At around 8 am , the witnesses said , a 50 - year - old Palestinian woman left the home of a relative while waving a white flag to allow the rest of her family to leave the home safely .
According to the eyewitnesses , Ravhiya al - Najar was shot at just as she stepped out of the house and immediately fell to the ground .
She continued to wave the white flag to indicate that there were no armed men in the area , but then one of the bullets struck her head and killed her , they said .
An ambulance driver who arrived at the scene said the woman lay dead at the side of the road , but added that he was forced to backtrack after IDF forces opened fire in his direction .
" The gunfire was meant to kill , not as a warning , " he said .
" With the help of the Red Cross , we tried to coordinate our arrival at the scene with the IDF , but they granted us permission to evacuate the woman only after several attempts ; this was at 8 pm , more than 12 hours after the incident . "
Residents of Huza'ah reported of a similar incident that occurred in the afternoon hours , when , according to them , IDF forces opened fire at group of some 30 civilians who were waving white flags .
They said three members of the same family were killed in the incident , including an 80 - year - old man .
The IDF said in response to the B'Tselem report " we have no knowledge of these incidents .
The army is targeting Hamas gunmen who are operating out of populated areas and using civilians as human shields .
The civilian population in Gaza is not being targeted . "

Invoking Obama , House Judiciary Chairman subpoenas Rove John Byrne
Published : Monday January 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Update : Rove lawyer comments Invoking President Barack Obama , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) has subpoenaed former Bush Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove about his alleged involved in the political prosecution of an Alabama governor and the firings of nine US Attorneys .
The subpoena , approved by an earlier vote of the House , was issued pursuant to " authority granted in H.R. 5 ( 111th Congress ) , and calls for Mr. Rove to appear at deposition on Monday , February 2 , 2009 . "
Specifically , it enjoins Rove " to testify regarding his role in the Bush Administrations politicization of the Department of Justice , including the US Attorney firings and the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman . "
Rove 's Washington , D.C. lawyer , Robert Luskin , did not return initial email and telephone requests for comment from The Washington Post .
But in a statement published early Tuesday morning , he said , " It 's generally agreed that former presidents retain executive privilege as to matters occurring during their term .
We 'll solicit the views of the new White House counsel and , if there is a disagreement , assume that the matter will be resolved among the courts , the president and the former president . "
" Mr. Rove has previously refused to appear in response to a Judiciary Committee subpoena , claiming that even former presidential advisers cannot be compelled to testify before Congress , " Conyers ' office wrote in a release .
" That ' absolute immunity ' position was supported by then - President Bush , but it has been rejected by U.S. District Judge John Bates and President Obama has previously dismissed the claim as ' completely misguided . ' "
This is the second time Conyers has subpoenaed Rove .
It 's uncertain whether Rove will be compelled to testify , as Obama 's attorney general has not yet been confirmed .
 I have said many times that I will carry this investigation forward to its conclusion , whether in Congress or in court , and todays action is an important step along the way ,  Conyers said in a release .
 Change has come to Washington , and I hope Karl Rove is ready for it .
After two years of stonewalling , it s time for him to talk . 
The subpoena delegates authority to US marshals to enforce , like any Congressional subpoena , and was copied to Rove 's Washington , D.C. attorney .
Conyers ' Judiciary Committee sued for information regarding the firing of the US Attorneys last year , and his case was passed to the District of Columbia 's Court of Appeals after a federal judge refused President Bush 's claim of " absolute " executive immunity .
" Justice Department lawyers must file their latest position in the case with the appeals court by Feb. 18 , " according to the Post ; " that document is being anticipated as offering a hint for how broadly Obama will interpret executive authority and whether he will change course . "

The lightbulb .

If you ’re a specialist in your field , there are two ways to become a household name : create something new …or claim it can never be done .
If you want to be remembered on the Internet , choose the second one …
Here are 9 examples of breakthroughs , inventions and innovations the experts got wrong .
1. The Electric Lightbulb
… good enough for our transatlantic friends … but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men .
British Parliamentary Committee , referring to Edison ’s light bulb , 1878 .
Everyone acquainted with the subject will recognize it as a conspicuous failure .
Henry Morton , president of the Stevens Institute of Technology , on Edison ’s light bulb , 1880 .
The Brits get sniffy about American innovation ( not for the first time ) – and miss the invention of the century .
Now our light bulbs comes in all shapes and sizes , and we ’re eco-innovating faster than ever .
Not too shabby for a conspicuous failure .
2. The A/C
Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time .
Nobody will use it , ever .
Thomas Edison , 1889 .
Oh Tom , you were doing so well .
Edison enjoyed sniping at the efforts of his rival George Westinghouse ( who bought the patent for a / c transmission from Nikola Tesla ) , and look where it got him .
Fact is , it ’s easier and far more efficient to distribute power with a / c than with Edison ’s darling direct current .
Oh , and apparently Edison was actually a bit of a jerk .
Oh well .
3. The Personal Computer
We have reached the limits of what is possible with computers .
John Von Neumann , 1949
Somewhat wide of the mark .
Along came the integrated circuit ( better known as the microchip ) , and things went crazy .
Computers have allowed our species to really connect .
We can even study and regulate our own planet – and there ’s still no computing limits in sight .
4. The Microchip
But what … is it good for ?
An engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM , commenting on the microchip in 1968 .
Hardly anything – well , apart from virtually every piece of electronic equipment in gadgets , vehicles , computer networks , power stations , homes , offices and every other conceivable part of everyday life for this century and probably the next .
But otherwise , yes – utterly useless .
5. Data Transmission
Before man reaches the moon , your mail will be delivered within hours from New York to Australia by guided missiles .
We stand on the threshold of rocket mail .
Arthur Summerfield , U.S. Postmaster General under Eisenhower , 1959 .
Transmission of documents via telephone wires is possible in principle , but the apparatus required is so expensive that it will never become a practical proposition .
Dennis Gabor , Hungarian - British physicist , 1962 .
A brilliant scientist , Gabor received the Nobel Prize for inventing holography – but entirely failed to anticipate e-mail and the modem .
( To be fair , so did everyone else ) .
Nowadays , entire bookshelves can be transmitted for a few cents in the blink of an eye , making scientific collaboration a truly global enterprise .
And all without rockets .
6. Online Shopping
Remote shopping , while entirely feasible , will flop – because women like to get out of the house , like to handle merchandise , like to be able to change their minds .
TIME , 1966 .
It ’s true that both sexes like the tactile experience of shopping in person .
But e-commerce ?
As PayPal ‘s proft margins will attest , remote shopping is here to stay – and helps get money to where it ’s most needed .
7 . The Automobile
The ordinary “ horseless carriage ” is at present a luxury for the wealthy ; and although its price will probably fall in the future , it will never , of course , come into as common use as the bicycle .
Literary Digest , 1899 .
8. The Television
While theoretically and technically television may be feasible , commercially and financially it is an impossibility , a development of which we need waste little time dreaming .
Lee DeForest , American radio pioneer and inventor of the vacuum tube , 1926 .
Dream on .
There are currently around 220 million “ impossibilities ” in the United States alone .
TV is everywhere .
It ’s just a shame the old types are full of lead – but every year sees a cleaner version , like the new Philips Eco FlatTV here .
9. Possibility
Image : Andres Rueda
Everything that can be invented has been invented .
Supposedly said by Charles H. Duell , Commissioner , U.S. Office of Patents , 1899 – except he probably did n’t .
So the last word goes to actor and humorist Peter Ustinov :
If the world should blow itself up , the last audible voice would be that of an expert saying it ca n’t be done .
In green tech , there are some truly audacious ideas that plenty of “ experts ” have been quick to write off – and no doubt some will fail as expected , as is the nature of innovation .
But not all .
If the history of technology offers any lesson , it ’s that today ’s most cynical eco experts could very well end up with egg on their faces .

The nonlocality of our physical world follows from a combination of a theorem proved by John S. Bell in 1964 and experimental results obtained since the early 1980s .
His theorem builds on the puzzle about entangled particles pointed out by Einstein , Podolsky and Rosen in 1935 .
The EPR argument assumes that nature is local so that in particular a measurement ( by , say , Alice ) on one particle of a widely separated entangled pair cannot instantaneously alter the physical state of the faraway partner particle ( which , say , Buzz can measure ) .
They conclude that Buzz ’s particle must already have determinate values for spins in every direction .
Thus , quantum mechanics must be incomplete because it does not determine those values except to guarantee they will be consistent with whatever result Alice gets when she measures her particle .
Bell asked : supposing that Alice ’s and Buzz ’s entangled particles have determinate values , can such particles reproduce the results predicted by quantum mechanics for all the ways that Alice and Buzz might measure their particles ?
Recall that for particles with entangled spins , Alice and Buzz must each choose an axis to measure the spin along .
Bell proved mathematically that if Alice and Buzz chose to measure along axes at angles such as 45 and 90 degrees from each other , their measurements from numerous runs of the experiment would produce a statistical distribution of results that disagreed with that predicted by quantum mechanics — no matter what distribution of determinate values the particles had .
Researchers carried out experiments using entangled photons instead of electrons ( which alters the angles to use but makes the experiment technically much less difficult ) and found results that conformed with quantum mechanics ’s predictions .
And so by Bell ’s theorem there must not be any determinate values carried by those photons .
And because that contradicts EPR ’s conclusion , the assumption that nature is local is also wrong .
And so the universe we live in can not be local .

Israeli troops and tanks were engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas militants last night after Israel followed up its eight - day air assault on Gaza with a ground offensive .
The attack , backed by military helicopters , had been preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment .
Columns of tanks , some firing their weapons , crossed the boundary fence from three directions into northern Gaza under darkness .
TV networks showed troops , marching in single file , crossing into Gaza , and gun battles could be heard .
Several hours into the armoured offensive , Israeli tanks had moved just over a mile into northern Gaza , according to witnesses , taking up positions in an area frequently used by militants to fire rockets across the border .
A Palestinian petrol station along the invasion route was engulfed in flames after being hit by a tank shell .
A spokesman for the Israeli forces predicted that the operation would take " many long days " .
Tens of thousands of reservists have been called up .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The move was almost immediately met with largely unanimous international condemnation , with the United Nations hastily arranging an overnight emergency session and Secretary - General Ban Ki Moon calling for " an immediate end " to the operation .
The United States also warned Israel in a statement that while it blamed Hamas for the tension , it had grown " deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation " in Gaza as the tanks rolled in .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack added : " We have expressed our concerns to the Israeli government that any military action needs to be mindful of the potential consequences to civilians ...
It is obvious a ceasefire should take place . "
In Europe there was hurried diplomacy .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : " Unfolding events show the urgent need for the immediate ceasefire that we have called for . "
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said : " The Israeli ground offensive in Gaza , while widely anticipated , will be greeted with horror around the world . "
The Israeli land attack began after heavy artillery was used in an urban area – for the first time in two years – to clear the way for its forces ; the practice had been stopped after 18 members of a single family died in a barrage in November 2006 .
Yesterday 10 people were killed when shells hit a mosque packed with 200 people in the northern town of Beit Lahiya during evening prayers .
The Israeli military confirmed last night that " large numbers of forces " had entered Gaza at " several points " , and a correspondent of the Arabic satellite channel Al - Jazeera reported that ground troops backed by artillery had mounted a series of incursions , from the disused airport close to Rafa in the south to the town of Beit Lahiya in the north .
Major Avital Leibovich , an Israeli military spokeswoman , said the aim was to seize areas from where Hamas was launching rocket attacks on southern Israel .
Israeli media quoted unconfirmed witness reports suggesting there were incursions under way elsewhere in Gaza .
A Hamas spokesman in Damascus , Mohammad Nazzal , said several Israeli soldiers had been killed in fighting in eastern Gaza , but gave no further details .
Israeli forces said they were unaware of any casualties among their soldiers .
Khalil Abu Shamala , the director of a human rights organisation , spoke to The Independent on Sunday from his home in Gaza City .
" The city is totally paralysed , " he said .
" Nobody is leaving their houses or can move from one place to another .
There is no electricity , so everyone who has a radio is listening and waiting ... for an announcement from the Israelis .
From what I understand we are being bombed by F - 16s , and tanks are entering from the north and east of the city .
I hear they plan to divide Gaza into three sections to weaken communications .
They may also enter from the Egypt border and from the Mediterranean . "
More than 10,000 Israeli troops and columns of armour had been massing on the Gaza border for days waiting for the order to go ahead .
Israel 's Defence Minister , Ehud Barak , said : " The campaign wo n't be easy and it wo n't be short , " emphasising that the operation entails risking Israeli lives .
" I know well the dangers that come with an offensive , and what the heavy price will be .
I do n't want to fool anyone .
The residents of southern Israel will also undergo some tough times . "
Mr Barak also acknowledged publicly for the first time that Israel was braced against a second front being opened by Hizbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon launching supportive rocket attacks .
" We hope that the northern front will remain calm , but we are prepared for any possibility , " he said .
Mr Barak is facing political as well as military risks by authorising the long - debated ground offensive in Gaza .
A poll last week showed that while 53 per cent of Israelis favoured continuation of the air attacks , only 19 per cent supported the use of ground troops .
The incursions , and last night 's destruction of a mosque , are also likely further to inflame opinion across the Muslim world , which has seen violent demonstrations , leaving 400 dead and more than 2,500 injured .
Witnesses said the Ibrahim al - Maqadna mosque was hit by up to three Israeli shells .
One of the wounded worshippers , Salah Mustafa , told Al - Jazeera from a hospital that the mosque was packed .
Another survivor , Mohammed Raheem , described " a huge noise and then people screaming , covered in blood " .
The Israeli military said last night they were still checking what led to the deaths .
In yesterday 's air strikes , Israeli warplanes destroyed large parts of an American school in north - west Gaza in which one person was reported to have been killed and around a dozen injured .
Four others , including Abu Zakaria al - Zamal , a senior commander of Hamas 's military wing , died from wounds .
He was the second Hamas leader killed in three days .
Earlier Israeli diplomatic sources said they " were not holding their breath " that a visit by the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy tomorrow , would lead to a solution .
They said that draft peace proposals being put together by the European Union do not make adequate provisions for monitoring Hamas attacks .
Khaled Meshaal , the exiled Hamas leader in Damascus , had given a warning that any ground assault would lead Israel to " a black destiny of dead and wounded " .
But he added that Hamas was " ready to co-operate with any effort leading to an end to the Israeli offensive against Gaza , lifting the siege and opening all crossings " .
Mr Meshaal did not mention earlier Hamas demands for the ceasefire to be extended to the West Bank .
The US has signalled that it will be playing a more active role in the drive to achieve a ceasefire .
One theory is that although the Americans had given tacit approval to the air strikes , they had warned Israel against a land offensive .
The President of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , and several Arab foreign ministers are flying to New York over the weekend to urge the UN Security Council to adopt a draft resolution that would condemn Israel and demand a halt to its bombing campaign .
The US has dismissed it as " unacceptable " and " unbalanced " because it makes no mention of halting the Hamas rocket attacks .
Late last week we ran a story on how the Google Chrome team had decided to use Gtk+ as the graphical toolkit for the Linux version of the Chrome web browser .
It was a story that caused some serious debate on a variety of aspects , but in this short editorial , I want to focus on one aspect that came forward : the longing for consistency .
Several people in the thread stated they were happy with Google ’s choice for purely selfish reasons : they use only Gtk+ applications on their GNOME desktops .
Several people chimed in to say that Qt integrates nicely in a Gtk+ environment .
While that may be true from a graphical point of view , that really is n’t my problem with mixing toolkits .
The issue goes a lot deeper than that .
Qt does a pretty good job of making sure its applications do not stand out graphically – or better put , it makes sure Gtk+ applications do not stand out in a Qt environment .
It ’s trivial to make sure Gtk+ and Qt applications mingle nicely without offending one another too much .
The problem , however , is that beauty is only skin deep .
When I state that I do not like to mingle toolkits in Linux it has less to do with the graphical side of the coin – the behavioural part is far more important .
Consistency in a graphical user interface is n’t merely a matter of using the same theme ; it has much more to do with behaviour and layout .
And this is where the problems occur .
In general , GNOME developers design the user interfaces of their Gtk+ applications different than how KDE developers design their Qt interfaces .
KDE developers value choice , configurability , tweakability , whereas GNOME developers tend to work towards providing the necessities , and leaving out options that they deem confusing or pointless .
This is of course a gross oversimplificiation , but the point remains .
I ’m not trying to say either approach is better – I ’m just stating that they are different .
This difference in approach leads to differences in user interfaces .
I can tell a Qt application apart from a Gtk + one from three miles away – even if they replicated each other ’s looks perfectly .
They arrange their widgets differently , put common options in different places , use different widgets for similar options , and so on , and so forth .
The end result is that I have to think about where to find stuff , and I do n’t like that .
When I ’m using a KDE environment , Gtk+ applications annoy me because they do not behave like the Qt applications I ’m currently using .
When I ’m in a GNOME environment , it ’s vice versa ; it are the Qt applications that annoy me .
This has nothing to do with placing blame or about what toolkit is better ; when using environment A , I have certain expectations about where to find stuff – add in applications from environment B , and these expectations are of no use anymore .
I find that frustrating .
I can already see several people firing up the comment box , ready to start off about how the situation on Windows is n’t much better – and they ’d be right .
However , that ’s not a valid argument , and it ’s totally irrelevant to this discussion .
I find this problem just as annoying on Windows as I do on Linux , but at least Linux gives me the ability to stick to one toolkit and have a consistent desktop – whether that be Qt or Gtk + .
Windows being a mess in this regard does not negate my problem .
Some people see the competing toolkits as a problem , but I really do n’t .
People who like consistency and the KDE approach , can stick to a strict Qt desktop , and people who like consistency and the GNOME approach can stick to a strict Gtk+ desktop .
People who just do n’t give a rat ’s bum can use whatever they want .
Everybody is happy !
Consistency is a concept that goes deeper than mere looks .
Between all the new digital cameras pooped out before the upcoming PMA show and the crazy cameras buried inside cellphones at MWC , it 's a good time to go over why more megapixels is n't necessarily better .
Advertisement
So , the nutshell explanation of how a digital camera works is that light lands on a sensor , which converts the light into electrical charges .
Depending on the kind of camera you 're using , how the light reaches the sensor may seem different — honkin ' digital SLRs house a complicated pentaprism and mirror system that swings out of the way , while the inside of a compact point - and - shoot is mechanically far simpler .
At the heart , though , the sensor fundamentals stay the same .
The sensor is where most of the megapixel machismo comes from .
When you squeeze the shutter button , the sensor ( like film in old - school cameras ) is exposed to light for however long you have the exposure time set for .
The most common metaphor to talk about how a sensor works is that it 's like an array of buckets ( the pixels ) that collect light , and the amount collected is turned into an electrical charge , which is converted into data .
We talked a bit about the differences between the two major types of sensors , CCD and APS ( CMOS ) earlier .
Advertisement
Generally , the more pixels packed onto a sensor , the higher the resolution of the images it can produce .
( Image resolution is somewhat confusingly also measured in pixels , but the term pixels does n't always refer to the exact same thing . )
A megapixel is 1 million pixels , so a 12 - megapixel photo has a resolution of about 12 million pixels .
Sounds like a lot , till you consider gigapixel photos , which have over a billion pixels in them .
By comparison , a 30 - inch monitor with a 2560x1600 display resolution amounts to a measly four megapixels , and even the best high - definition video currently is around two megapixels , no matter how large the TV .
The most recent crop of $ 250ish point - and - shoot digital cameras from Canon and Nikon seem to establish 10 - 12 megapixels as the new norm for everyday pocket cams , and hell , Sony Ericsson crammed a 12 - megapixel into their tiny Idou cellphone — the same as Canon 's entry - level XSi DSLR and Nikon 's $ 3000 D700 pro DSLR .
Uh , what the hell ?
Advertisement
Obviously , there 's a world of difference between the image quality you 're going to get out each of those .
Most of it comes down to the size of the sensor and the pixels .
You can fit a much bigger sensor inside of a DSLR than you can inside of a cellphone , which not only means you can fit more pixels on the sensor , you can fit much bigger ones — imagine bigger buckets to catch the light .
Sure enough , the sensors inside of DSLRs are huge compared to the ones in compacts as DPReview 's detailed size chart shows .
They also explain how to the read the sizes — which actually refer to the size of the tube around the sensor , not the sensor itself .
Sensor sizes are referenced against 35 mm film as a standard — cameras with sensors equivalent in size to 35 mm film are called full - frame , though right now that 's limited to pricey semi-pro level DSLRs .
Advertisement
To get really high - resolution smaller cameras and phones , manufacturers pack as many teeny pixels as tightly as they can onto tiny sensors .
The pixels in standard point - and - shoots are n't the same kind of high - quality pixels found on DSLRs — and generally speaking , bargain bin cameras will offer lower quality pixels than higher - end shooters of the same class — which results crappier color accuracy and usually lower dynamic range too .
The other problem is noise .
When you pack in pixels like delicious cows headed for slaughter , you create a lot of heat , which is one of the ways noise is generated — the rainbow colored random grain you see sometimes on digital photos .
Noise gets worse as you crank the ISO , amplifying the sensor 's sensitivity to light .
In newer point and shoots , it 's really noticeable around a sensitivity of ISO 800 , though the D700 and 5D Mark II DSLRs can be jacked up to 3200 ISO and produce acceptable images ( we 've used some on Giz ) .

So , on a given sensor size , a lower megapixel count with bigger pixels will produce cleaner images — hence the D3 only rocking 12 megapixels .
Most cameras mitigate noise with fancy noise reduction algorithms that are getting better all the time — Canon 's 5D Mark II manages to balance delivering 21 megapixels with images about as clean as the D700's at higher ISOs — but for the most part , we 're happier to see bigger sensors and fewer pixels .
One disadvantage of the bigger " buckets " in DSLRs is that you do need more light to fill them up , meaning you might need longer exposure times .

And when it comes to print quality — that old argument for extra megapixels — for most of the shooting the average person does , 6 megapixels is just fine , as David Pogue shows ( and Ken Rockwell has more on ) , since you can make ginormous prints from it , and a clear , noise - free 8x10 looks better than a crappy one when its framed and hung on the wall .
As Douglas Sterling told us via email , pros crave the extra detail of ginormous megapixel images , but when it comes down to buying cameras for regular people , just keep in mind that more megapixels is n't necessarily more better .
It 's how good those pixels are that matters .

“ If you think Richard Dawkins is too easy on religion , go down to that end of the room , ” I said , indicating the steps up to the bookstore .
“ And if you … ”
“ Careful … ” someone said .
And I was .
There were several believers - in - God present – the exact number depending on your definition – and I did n’t want to make a joke that might be taken the wrong way .
“ If you ’re , uh … very theistic , go down to the other end , ” I finished , indicating the fireplace .
“ And if you ’re somewhere in between , go somewhere in between . ”
This was part of an icebreaker at the first night of a retreat on “ Nontheism among Friends ” ( Quakers ) I co-facilitated last weekend , at the wonderful Powell House conference center in upstate New York .
After everyone distributed themselves along the length of the room , we added a second axis : “ If you ’re totally closeted , move towards that wall , and if everyone knows exactly what you believe , move towards this wall . ”
When we finished , we looked around and realized we had become diffused throughout the entire room .
There was a special quality to that silent moment , and then someone said something to the effect of ( if I recall ) , This is a good group , I trust you all .
Just prior to this , my co-facilitator Robin Alpern had led us in a similar exercise , about one ’s length and intensity of Quaker involvement , with similarly diffuse results .
These were both her idea , as she had used them at a previous version of the same retreat two years ago .
I like them because they not only break the social ice ( you have to chat with people to decide where to go ) , but also disrupt the possible assumption that “ nontheist Friends , ” or “ theistic Friends ” for that matter , are a monolithic group .
In a similar vein , we spent the first night and morning giving extended introductions , about 10 - 15 minutes each .
The idea was to get to know each other as people , each with our own histories and journeys , before talking about the issues more abstractly .
Which we began to do after lunch on Saturday .
The first afternoon session we planned as a kind of “ orientation ” to many of the existing concerns and activities of the NTF community – FGC , publishing , minutes of inclusion [ Update : see comments ] , unity with other Friends , and so on .
We probably should ’ve started with some basic definitions , however , since that ’s what many people wanted to talk about .
What is “ nontheism ” ?
“ Atheism ” ?
What , really , does “ God ” mean ?
There are no definitive answers to these questions , but going over some common NTF definitions of nontheism would ’ve been a good idea .
After a bit , we broke up into interest groups .
The one I went to was “ nontheism in the broader culture , ” where the younger people among us reported that high school - age people , at least in the northeast , seem pretty ferociously ( and unreflectively , they thought ) anti-religious .
One participant talked a bit about Stuart Kauffman ‘s book Reinventing the Sacred , and shortly before we had to return to the larger group , I posed the question of how much people sympathized with the motivations of the “ neo-atheists , ” i.e. alarm at the creationist movement or militant Islam .
( I ca n’t actually remember what the other two interest groups were !
I think they may have been “ unity with theistic Friends ” and “ language . ” )
After dinner , we got physically re-energized by a game of Big Wind Blows ( of which I am the master , only being in the middle twice ) , and had a full - group discussion of nontheism and spirituality .
One theme we kept coming back to was spirituality as connection – a sense of connection with the people and the environment around us .
Sunday morning we had a traditional meeting for worship , followed by sharing about what Quaker worship meant for us , and what we were “ doing ” during the hour of silence .
In the final session , we asked people to share what they might to do as a result of this weekend , and several ( three I believe ) said they now felt clear to join their local meetings .
One person cried ( and brought some of us to tears ) , and a number of others seemed moved .
Afterward , Rik ’s blog post about his positive experience was good to read as well .
Reflections
I too found the weekend moving – not so much because of the topic , which after all Robin and I were officially the experts on , but because it was the first time I ’ve felt connected ( that word again ) to a close Quaker community in a long time .
I have n’t felt very connected to my local meeting , where I ’ve been attending for two years , partly because it ’s large and hard to get to know people , and partly because I have n’t tried as hard as I could .
I also find myself wondering if Quaker nontheism is becoming mainstream enough that it ’s time for me to focus on other concerns , at least after this summer , when Robin and I will be facilitating a workshop at FGC in Blacksburg .
Lately I have felt led to focus more on my professional life and less on Quaker activities ; even within Quakerism I have other concerns that may deserve more attention – the accessibility of historical and contemporary information , outreach and growth , class and race , gender and sexuality , and how our practices can better foster community and spiritual growth .
( Note : Robin and I will hopefully have a debriefing call next week , and we also will get the evaluations next week .
So we may have additional thoughts later this month )
MOSCOW  Fedor Emelianenko has been described as superhuman : as the No. 1 mixed martial arts fighter in the world , he has never been knocked out , and he often defeats opponents in a matter of minutes with a hale of thundering punches , never breaking his stony , stoic air .
Nicknamed the Last Emperor , Emelianenko has thousands of fans across Europe , North America and Japan .
YouTube has more than 1,000 videos of him pummeling opponents from Orange County to Osaka in a sport that combines the spectacle of professional wresting with the violence of a barroom brawl .
Each clip has tens of thousands of views , and many have gone viral , topping a million .
Emelianenko will fight Saturday night at the Honda Center in Anaheim , Calif. , in Affliction ’s Day of Reckoning , a pay - per- view event sponsored by the Affliction clothing company and Donald Trump .
Yet , in Emelianenko ’s native Russia , a country that honors athletic heroes almost as highly as its greatest wartime generals , few will probably be watching .
“ Emelianenko is a huge star , on par with Sharapova and Ovechkin , ” said Pavel Lysenkov , a journalist with Sovietsky Sport , Russia ’s premier sports newspaper , referring to the tennis star Maria Sharapova and the N.H.L. star Alexander Ovechkin .
( Comparisons with Mike Tyson of the 1980s also abound . )

Matt Drudge seems to be cheering the call for a ‘ Tea Party ’ and other civil disobedience in opposition to Obama ’s proposed mortgage plan .
ABCNews describes the plan as “ help [ for ] up to 9 million homeowners facing foreclosure or struggling to make their mortgage payments . ”
The plan seeks to help two groups of people as described by ABCNews :
First , some 4 million to 5 million families who have seen their home values drop , but are not at risk of foreclosure , would now be able to refinance into new mortgages .
The other group , 3 million to 4 million homeowners with adjustable - rate mortgages , would be able to temporarily have their loans modified to a lower interest rate – for at least five years .
In order to accomplish this , Obama is proposing that $ 100 billion be given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to allow these groups to refinance the loans for those whose home values have dropped below what they owe .
For the second group , Obama is propsing that $ 75 billion be used to help those with predatory loans temporarily modified to a lower rate .
That ’s a total of $ 175 billion .
The plan does n’t yet have a complete budget , but these are the basics and the largest elements .
The response being promoted by Drudge and CNBC :
My emphases above .
Am I the only one who finds it incredible that CNBC and financial traders are talking about civil disobedience and moral hazard and “ losers ” as soon as Obama proposes a $ 175 billion plan to directly help about 9 million Americans ?
Yet these same people assured us that bailing out the banks to the tune of $ 700 billion was necessary for financial stability – and that plan directly helped how many ?
What the fuck is wrong with these people ?
Edit : Apparently , the trader explained that “ The trading floor is a pretty good cross section of America ” as part of his justification .
And of course , it ’s better to help this “ pretty good cross section ” of rich America than to help an actual cross section of the population .
Edit again : A commenter over at reddit says that the particular CNBC host in the clip has actually been calling on mobs to go after any CEOs who take the TARP bailout money too .
That removes the charge of hypocrisy from him , although not from those others who supported the bailout out to Wall Street but complain about any funds being used to fix the mortgage situation .
And it still leaves the CNBC anchor , Dylan Ratigan , open to charges of pure stupidity .

Arkansas considers allowing concealed weapons in churches Muriel Kane
Published : Saturday February 14 , 2009
Print This Email
This A bill moving through the Arkansas state legislature would allow worshippers to bring concealed weapons into churches if the church has approved that as its policy .
At present , holders of concealed weapons permits cannot bring guns into bars , schools , government facilities , athletic events , or houses of worship .
The controversial legislation , which passed the Arkansas House this week and is now pending before a Senate committee , was introduced by Rep. Beverly Pyle in response to several recent church shootings .
However , its most active supporters insist that their primary concern is upholding the separation of church and state and that the state does not have the constitutional right to prevent churches from setting their own rules .
The bill 's strongest opponents appear to be the pastors themselves , One minister , Ken Burton , suggested there were political motivations behind the legislation , telling the Baxter Bulletin that " hes aware of staunch political affiliations between candidates for public office , elected officials and the National Rifle Associations pro-gun platform . "
Several ministers are concerned about the negative effect that concealed guns could have on the peace and tranquility of church services .
Pastor Ron Rector suggested , " Some places still need to be sacred , and that is one place I hope would remain sacred . "
Rev. Mark Lenneville similarly noted , " It s not in line with what we believe theologically and has not been the tradition for Christianity through the centuries .
Often , the church is viewed as a sanctuary where the government does not have power and authority , a place where people could seek sanctuary from the government and other outsiders . "
Law enforcement officials are already permitted to bring weapons into places of worship , and Rev. Jim Freeman , in an op - ed for the Arkansas Times , suggested , " If the safety of those attending worship is the real issue , then uniformed security personnel -- armed or not -- would be a far greater deterrent to violence than the possibility that someone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon might actually have done so at any given service of worship .
Further , if there were to be an incident inside a place of worship , what would someone with a concealed weapon do ?
A confrontation between armed individuals could put bystanders at far greater risk . "
Pastor John Phillips , who was shot in the back 23 years ago by a relative of a parishioner , agreees that the carrying of guns by parishioners would not necessary be helpful in that kind of situation .
He stated to the Associated Press , " People are not going to react the way they think they 're going to react in the heat of the moment .
It was utter chaos when I was shot . "
Freeman concluded his op - ed by noting that " Christians worship a God who , in the person of Jesus Christ , died a horrific death for the sake of the world .
For this reason , Christians are called to live lives of greater vulnerability to the world , not greater safety from it .
As long as anyone is at risk from gun violence -- students , teachers , doctors , law enforcement officials , elected leaders , cultural or ethnic minorities -- the church has a share in that risk and an obligation to demonstrate the resolve for love over violence . "
DALLAS – Defense attorneys for five men accused of illegally routing millions of dollars to Hamas rested their case Thursday after hearing from a former diplomat who questioned government claims that a series of Palestinian charities were controlled by the terrorist group .
Edward Abington , a former consul general at the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem , said he met with members of the charities , known as zakat committees , in Hebron , Ramallah , Nablus , Jenin , Gaza from 1993 - 97 .
Though he was briefed by U.S. government officials , he was never told of any Hamas connection .
Abington said his office received " very strict instructions " from the U.S. government that consulate officials were not to have any interaction with Hamas .
But " I had no information as consul general that Hamas controlled any zakat committees , " he said .
There was no official policy restricting communication with the committees .
That assertion is at odds with the heart of the government 's case – that the men , in running the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) routed millions of dollars to Hamas through the committees .
But under cross examination , Abington acknowledged he was unaware of information being gathered by criminal investigators and even the Palestinian Authority .
Earlier in the trial , prosecutors presented a former HLF fundraiser who told jurors he was certain his donations to HLF would help Hamas .
Abington 's interactions with the committees were part of a wide range of meetings with Palestinian government officials , members of charities and nongovernmental organizations to assess local views on U.S. policies and " see if the Israeli - Palestinian peace process was working , " Abington said .
He routinely reported on what he learned to the State Department .
During their case , prosecutors presented evidence showing active Hamas members and activists served on the zakat committee governing boards .
An Israeli Security Agency lawyer testified that the connections were well known among Palestinians in the West Bank .
Under cross examination , federal prosecutor James Jacks asked Abington if he " received briefings from the U.S. government before visiting the charities ? "
Abington said he " asked whether I would run into Hamas people there and I was told ‘ No , they are fine . ' "
In his view , " there is a difference between having a member of Hamas on the zakat committee and the zakat committees being controlled by Hamas . "
Jacks contended that Abington 's positive perception of the charities stemmed from the fact that Abington was working from just the information made " available " to him .
He was not privy to government intelligence documents and other information that confirmed Hamas links to the charities .
" You were not privy to ongoing investigations [ regarding zakat committees ] ? "
Jacks asked .
" Yes , that 's correct , " Abington replied .
Abington also testified that he found information from Israeli intelligence agencies of " questionable reliability . "
Additionally , Abington was asked about a document prepared by the Palestinian Authority titled " Who is Financing Hamas . "
Abington identified the signature on the document to be that of Yasser Arafat , leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization .
Under the section " Hamas Financial Resources Worldwide , " the document lists the Islamic Association for Palestine , Holy Land Fund ( HLF ) , and the United Association for Studies and Research .
All three entities were listed as members of a Palestine Committee created by the Muslim Brotherhood to advance the Hamas cause in America .
Earlier , defense attorney Nancy Hollander asked Abington what he knew about HLF during his time as a representative of the U.S. in Jerusalem .
Abington described the HLF as a " very large Palestinian American charitable organization " that had a " good reputation . "
During cross examination , Abington could not remember the names of zakat committee officials with whom he met , saying it had been 15 years since his visits to zakat committees in Ramallah , Nablus , Jenin , Hebron , and Gaza .
Jacks then showed him a December 2001 letter from the Director of Operations of the Palestinian Intelligence Service , Major Khalid Abu - Yaman , on the Palestinian Authority letterhead .
The letter said : " Officials and members of this [ Ramallah ] committee are associated with the Hamas Movement and some of them are activists in the Movement . "
While he denied Hamas links for the charities in Hebron , Ramallah , Jenin , and Nablus , Abington agreed there were some charities run by Hamas .
Asked to name some , Abington could only come up with one : The Al - Salah Society located in Gaza .
Jacks noted that Abington worked as lobbyist for the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) for seven years after retiring from the State Department .
His company , Bannerman and Associates , was paid $ 750,000 the first year and $ 600,000 per year for the subsequent years for representing the PLO , which led the Authority .
Abington said he was the one who signed the PA as a client , which generated some criticism that he may have been too close to the Authority during his time in the consulate .
Jacks pointed to a close , personal relationship Abington shared with Arafat , including during his term as consul general .
Jacks then asked about financial corruption within the PA as one of the reasons " for difficulties in the Palestinian territories . "
Arafat 's personal net worth was estimated at $ 300 million by Fortune magazine , he said , asking Abington : " Was the PA perceived to be corrupt ? "
" I do n't think so , " Abington said .
Jacks then countered that " part of the attraction of people to Hamas was that they were clean " leading Abington to concede : " I think that 's one of the factors that led to the support for Hamas . "
Jacks asked Abington if Arafat was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Abington replied yes .
Prosecutors are expected to present a short rebuttal case Monday before closing arguments begin .
An independent committee that advises ministers on drug classification is poised to recommend the controversial downgrading of ecstasy to a class B drug .
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) is expected to call for ecstasy , a drug blamed for the deaths of at least 30 people a year , to be changed from its top- rated class A category when it reports later this month .
The proposal will bring the council into direct conflict with the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith ( below ) , who is expected to veto any such move , and propel the Government into a row over its treatment of expert bodies charged with advising ministers on key issues .
The controversy comes just months after the Home Office ignored ACMD opposition to the decision to move cannabis from class C to class B .
Senior Home Office sources said they " fully expected " the ACMD to call for the relaxation of ecstasy 's classification .
Professor David Nutt , chairman of the committee , which is reviewing ecstasy at the request of MPs , has suggested it is less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco , and stated that it is " probably too highly classified " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Downgrading the drug , which is popular with clubbers , to class B would reduce the maximum prison sentence for possession from seven years to five , while the maximum prison sentence for dealers would fall from life in prison to 14 years .
It shares its current classification with drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine .
Anti-drug campaigners have attacked any move to downgrade ecstasy .
The shadow Home Secretary , Dominic Grieve , said : " Drugs wreck lives and destroy communities .
Ecstasy is a drug that is very damaging . "
Critics have also called into question the ACMD 's fitness to advise ministers .
David Raynes , a member of the National Drug Prevention Alliance , said the ACMD should be " an impartial centre of expertise carefully weighing evidence and public good " .
He added : " Recent behaviour leads me to believe it is being controlled by a few ideologues , pursuing a broadly liberal and pro-drug , legalisation agenda . "
Mary Brett , spokesperson for Europe Against Drugs , said : " The present ACMD includes few members who take a definite drug- prevention stance .
It is imperative that a committee of this importance needs to be properly balanced . "
Professor Andy Parrott , an experton ecstasy , said he was concerned that there were insufficient scientists on the committee .
" It is quite an odd committee .
It is not very scientific .
This issue should not just be about opinions – it should be about the actual effects this drug has on people 's brains and bodies .
I have conducted years of research into ecstasy and I can tell them that it is not possible to take this drug without being damaged by it . "
In a critical report on drugs policy in 2006 , MPs on the Science and Technology Select Committee accused the ACMD of a " dereliction of duty " over its failure to alert the Home Office to serious doubts about the system 's effectiveness .
The MPs also expressed " surprise and disappointment " that the ACMD had never reviewed the evidence for ecstasy 's class A status .
A Home Office spokeswoman said the ecstasy review was " hugely unwelcome " .
She added : " Ecstasy can and does kill unpredictably ; there is no such thing as a ' safe dose ' .
The Government firmly believes that ecstasy should remain a class A drug . "
According to sources familiar with the matter , General Motors is unable to find buyers for Saab .
GM put Saab under strategic review last month as a part of its recovery plan submitted to Congress .
Fritz Henderson , GM ” s vice chairman and chief operating officer , previously said that GM is looking to sell Saab as soon as possible .
Sources say that GM has been quietly shopping Saab around for some time now but has been unable to find a buyer .
According to Automotive News , insiders say that GM is also unable to find a buyer for Hummer which was out under “ strategic review ” in June .
Apart from the $ 13.4 billion in loans that GM received from President George W. Bush last month , the Swedish government has approved a $ 3.4 billion package for its struggling auto industry .
Saab and Volvo are expected to get the biggest chunk of the loan .

Over the past 12 months , half a dozen studies published by Rui Hai Liu , Cornell associate professor of food science and a member of Cornell 's Institute for Comparative and Environmental Toxicology , show apples fight cancer .
Dr. Liu 's research adds to a mounting body of data that apples , as well as other fruits and vegetables , are powerful ways to help prevent breast cancer .
In a study just published in the , Dr. Liu found fresh apple extracts significantly inhibited the size of mammary tumors in rats .
In fact , the more extracts they gave the animals , the more breast tumors were inhibited .
This research backs up earlier findings of another study conducted by Dr. Liu in rats that was published in 2007 .
In his new study , Dr. Liu found that a highly malignant type of breast cancer called an adenocarcinoma developed in 81 percent in the control animals .
However , it developed only in 57 percent , 50 percent and 23 percent of the animals that received a diet supplemented by low , middle and high doses of apple extracts ( the equivalent of one , three and six apples a day in humans ) , respectively , during the 6 month study .
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed invasive cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. women .
The anti-cancer property of apples is particularly important because adenocarcinoma is the main cause of death of breast - cancer patients , as well as of animals with mammary cancer .
" That reflects potent anti-proliferative [ rapid decrease ] activity , " Dr. Liu said in a statement to the media .
" We not only observed that the treated animals had fewer tumors , but the tumors were smaller , less malignant and grew more slowly compared with the tumors in the untreated rats .
" The Cornell studies emphasize the valuable , health - protecting role of phytochemicals , such as phenolics or flavonoids , found in apples as well as other fruits and veggies .
In additional research published in the same edition of , Dr. Liu announced a variety of new phenolic compounds he has discovered in apple peelings that also have " potent antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities " on tumors .
In still another Cornell study published in the same journal , Dr. Liu reported on his research group 's discovery of the specific modulation effects that apple extracts have on cell cycles .
What 's more , Liu and his colleagues have also uncovered the fact phytochemicals in apples inhibit an important inflammation pathway ( technically known as NFkB ) in human breast cancer cells .

For kids , altruism comes naturally , psychologist says
L.A. Cicero Psychologist Michael Tomasello , who delivered the 2008 Tanner Lectures in Human Values last week on campus , speaks at a discussion session Oct. 30 .
Harvard psychologist Elizabeth Spelke , right , was a respondent .
Drop something in front of a 2 - year - old , and she 's likely to pick it up for you .
Ca n't get into a cabinet because your hands are full ?
Count on the watchful toddler to wander over and open the door .
And that stapler you were using a few minutes ago — where did it go again ?
Oh , yes — over there , right where she 's pointing .
They all may be cute gestures by a child otherwise preoccupied with toilet training .
But when Michael Tomasello watches young children in the experiments he 's designed , he sees acts of altruism and cooperation — along with more examples of what sets humans apart from other species .
" From when they first begin to walk and talk and become truly cultural beings , young human children are naturally cooperative and helpful in many — though obviously not all — situations , " Tomasello said during one of two lectures about the origins of human cooperation .
" And they do not get this from adults ; it comes naturally . "
Tomasello , co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , delivered the 2008 Tanner Lectures in Human Values on Oct. 29 and 30 , each of which was followed by lengthy discussion sessions .
The psychologist 's research focuses on processes of social cognition , social learning and communication , and language in human children and great apes .
Armed with data and several video clips of his experiments , Tomasello repeatedly showed during his two lectures that young children can be as selfless as they are adorable .
Lest you think he 's asserting there is no such thing as the " terrible twos , " Tomasello made clear the cooperative behavior he studies is " relative to nonhuman primates . "
In other words , kids are quite altruistic when compared to apes .
They gesture to communicate that something is out of place .
They empathize with those they sense have been wronged .
They have an almost reflexive desire to help , inform and share .
And they do so without expectation or desire for reward , Tomasello said .
" There is very little evidence in any of these cases that children 's altruism is created by parents or any other form of socialization , " Tomasello said of his experiments .
But as they grow , children 's spirit of cooperation is shaped by how they judge their surroundings and perceive what others think of them .
They become more aware of what 's around them , and worry more about what it 's like and what it means to be a member of a group , Tomasello said .
" They arrive at the process with a predisposition for helpfulness and cooperation , " he said .
" But then they learn to be selective about whom to help , inform and share with , and they also learn to manage the impression they are making on others — their public reputation and self — as a way of influencing the actions of those others toward themselves . "
Apes , on the other hand , are in it for themselves .
Put through similar experiments as the children , apes demonstrate an ability to work together and share but choose not to .
While a child 's initial reaction — or sense of guilt or shame — might guide his decision to share some candy with the other child who helped him get it , a chimpanzee has no problem working with another ape to get a piece of food but will keep the spoils to himself .
Humans create a sense of shared intentionality — a sense of " we , " Tomasello said .
That bond helps explain even the simplest social norms , like why it 's rude and socially unacceptable for someone to simply walk away from an activity involving another person with no warning .
" This sense that we are doing something together — which creates mutual expectations , and even rights and obligations — is arguably uniquely human even in this simple case , " Tomasello said .
The Tanner Lectures are held annually at Stanford , Harvard , Yale and Princeton ; the universities of California , Michigan and Utah ; and in England at Cambridge and Oxford universities .
Established in 1978 by Obert Clark Tanner , an industrialist , legal scholar and philosopher , the lectures are meant to advance and reflect upon the scholarly and scientific learning relating to human values .
The Tanner Lectures are sponsored by the President 's Office and the Center for Ethics in Society .
Have you seen “ The Most Famous Chart in Computer Science Education ? ”
The exact numbers and data sources vary , but the curve always looks similar :
I used data from college bound seniors who indicated on their SAT that they intended to major in “ Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services . ”
The curve tends peak between 1999 and 2001 and then you see a huge decline that has just begun to bottom out to numbers less than half their peak value .
Some people like to explain away this drop on another curve :
Although there was a correlation of computer science enrollment and the stock market , you ’ll see that the curves diverge around 2003 .
A popular belief is that the bursting dot - com bubble scared some potential students , but then by 2003 parents thought most software jobs were being offshored and encouraged their kids to pick a different field .
Some jobs did go to Bangalore , but the total number of jobs actually grew in the US , even beyond their 1999 levels .
There are still excellent job prospects for the long term .
Even in hard times like the 1970 ’s recession , companies like Apple and Microsoft were founded .
In 10 years , we ’ll know of a several great companies that got their start in the current financial crisis .
It ’s unfortunate how students and their parents have been misled about the reality .
We ’re faced with a pipeline problem .
The fresh - outs you ’ll be looking to hire in 10 years are in middle school right now .
Are you doing anything to woo them to a career in computing ?
What do you say to a bright young girl to at least consider looking at computer science ?
I could start with my story .
As a kid , I was captivated by how I could think of an idea for a program and then have a computer execute it exactly .
It was as if I could put part of my mind inside the computer .
My parents and friends thought this was magic .
It was magic , but it was a magic I could understand .
There ’s always cool new things being computed .
It was magical to see how Deep Blue beat Kasparov long before I began to understand the beauty of how it worked .
Every day I listen to MP3s that were created by a compression algorithm that gets rid of sound that my ear ca n’t hear .
Companies like Walmart sift terabytes of data to predict market demand so they can send extra strawberry Pop - Tarts when hurricanes are approaching .
On a personal level , new algorithms predict with a high accuracy what types of movies we ’ll like .
But that ’s just one tiny sliver of what ’s out there .
Each person can have their own unique experience .
There ’s a lot of great computing going on and the demand is only increasing .
Sometimes you ’ll hear honest hesitations about a career in computing because of fears that they ’ll “ sit in front of a computer all day . ”
The sad irony is that this thinking causes people to go into fields like accounting , graphic design , marketing , or hundreds of other fields where they spend just as much time in front of a computer .
The difference is that they ’ll spend most of their time using applications like Outlook , Word , or Excel and often have less fun than the software developers that are creating these programs .
Moreover , working in the computing fields will give someone a chance to create future interfaces that do n’t have everyone in front of giant screens all day .
This is n’t to say that there are n’t boring software development jobs , but there are also plenty of great jobs .
It ’s a great career .
I sometime feel a little guilty that I can work in a field that I enjoy .
As a field , we create software that powers business communications and connects you with friends .
Software will be a pivotal role in gene sequencing and analyzing that will usher in customized medical treatments and drugs .
Software will drive many great innovations of the future .
It ’s sad that kids are n’t even given a chance to see the breadth and excitement of our field .
I do n’t blame them .
On the whole , we ’re doing a terrible job broadcasting our image .
Professors often teach computer science as if it is some sterile thing with nothing new in it .
This is just not true ; we ’re in our adolescence .
Sure , we bumble around and do silly things at times , but it also means we ’re growing .
We ’re in an incredible time .
Mehran Sahami captured this well at the conclusion of his intro class at Stanford :
“ Think about the time that you ’re living in .
Don Knuth , who is considered the father of Computer Science is still alive and he ’s in this department .
It ’s sort of like you ’re geometers and you ’re living in the time of Euclid …
It ’s all happening now .
Do n’t think of this stuff as dead people who did this stuff and it just happened and now you ’re forced to do it .
You ’re living in it . ”
Mehran is one of the few teachers that do a great job of sharing the new and exciting possibilities of computer science .
Too often you see teachers that claim that computer science is some small box that is exactly what they ’re teaching .
When I ’ve had the honor of having conversations with computing pioneers like Alan Kay , I often hear how their teachers in the 60’s would admit that they did n’t understand the full possibilities of computing , and they wanted their students do better .
The early ARPA community with J.C.R.
Licklider at the helm is a great example of this style .
Licklider encouraged and funded wild and imaginative ideas that caused a huge boom in computer science back in the 60’s and early 70’s .
Unfortunately , this slowed down in the 1980s as funders became more conservative , took fewer risks , and as a result got more incremental improvements rather than something big .
I think this is why Alan Kay has difficulty finding significant new inventions in computing since 1980 .
Alan ’s statement sounds crazy until you see just how much of what we use was started before 1980 .
Some will point to the web and the browser as a huge new invention , but even Marc Andreessen , speaking on how he was able to create the first graphical web browser revealed :
“ I was able to do it so quickly because it was the icing on the cake that had been baking for 30 years . ”
Indeed he had .
In the mid-60 ’s , some of the baking started when Licklider funded Doug Englebart ’s amazing oN - Line System that amazingly had hypertext links and was operated by a mouse .
Len Kleinrock ’s Ph.D. proposal on packet theory in 1961 gave him a great start that ultimately led to his team sending the first message over ARPAnet in 1969 .
Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn had already published a paper on TCP / IP , the bedrock of the Internet protocols , by 1974 .
All of these technologies were well refined and in production by the time Tim Berners - Lee created HTTP in the early 90’s to which Andreessen would add a graphical front end .
Are we willing to fund long - term “ wild ” and “ crazy ” ideas today to create Internet - sized future results ?
We ’ve been too focused on short term results .
It ’s not just academia ; most companies focus on short - terms results that dismiss the fact that computing is a young field and miss what really matters :
“ Many HR departments have n’t figured this out yet , but in reality , It ’s less important to know Java , Ruby , .NET , or the iPhone SDK .
There ’s always going to be a new technology or a new version of an existing technology to be learned .
The technology itself is n’t as important ; it ’s the constant learning that counts . ” - Pragmatic Thinking and Learning , p.145
Bummer , Now What ?
Last March , I was given the opportunity to be on a design team to start tackling some of these problems .
We knew that we could n’t change the whole field and that some people would want to keep it the way it is .
But we also knew that we had to do something ; we did n’t want to settle for the status quo .
Our primary task was to plan a “ summit ” of the best people from academia , government , and industry and get them all in one room so that we could get a good sample of the entire field .
We did n’t want to let people have the chance to point fingers outside and say it was somebody else ’s problem .
After working on the basic concept for the summit , we needed to give it a name .
I had enjoyed many side discussions of the great days of Licklider , PARC , and the early culture that accomplished great things .
Sort of as a joke , I thought that we needed to “ reboot ” computer science to get rid of the cruft that had accumulated over time and get back to the excitement when the field was brand new .
After some discussion , we decided to change “ computer science ” to a broader field of “ computing ” and use the “ magic and beauty ” of computer science to be the driver of the “ rebooting . ”
Only later would I realize the rebooting metaphor could be stretched a bit further .
We can “ reboot ” the field without throwing away the good parts just as an operating system can reboot and depend on its valuable non-volatile memory being preserved .
Rebooting does n’t mean that we ’ll go down the same crufty path ( e.g. perhaps we have better “ drivers ” now ) .
Most importantly , the domain name was available so we ran with it .
After nine months of planning and inviting over 220 people , we had our summit in January at the Computer History Museum .
It was the first time that such a broad representation of the computing field came to work together in the same room .
The summit was guided by the Appreciative Inquiry process .
It ’s a technique that has you work in small teams to discover a positive core of what ’s giving the field life and then uses that to start dreaming of a better future .
As the three days unraveled , we made it to the “ design ” phase where we kicked off several projects that fell into three rough categories :
Education
K - 8 Fundamentals ( Creating engaging introductions of computing fundamentals at the elementary level )
Project / Problem Based Learning for Grades 7-14
CS in K - 12 : Essential Subject ( Determining a path to get computing essentials introduced in the K - 12 curriculum )
Recruiting CS
Teachers ( Significantly increase the number of computer science teachers )
National Curriculum for Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration
International Educational Repository ( that would include classroom activities and ideas for the K - 16 level )
Outreach
LabRats ( Build learning communities that include after school activities focused on areas like computer science )
Recruiting Women & Minorities into CS
Image of Computing ( Sort of like a marketing campaign to show how computing is changing the world )
Tools for Fun and Beauty ( Providing software tools for people sharing the fun and beauty of computing )
Relevant Computer Science Intersecting with Socially Relevant Projects ( e.g. providing infrastructure in third world countries or disaster response scenarios )
Defining Future Computing Requirements for IT Service Verticals ( e.g. Health Care , Financial , Government )
Internal Growth
Parallel Worlds Initiative ( Leverage the boom in multi-core to drive new areas of thinking in computing )
Open Artifacts ( e.g. create hardware and software systems that can easily be inspected , understood , assembled , disassembled and reused in new ways to allow for exploration )
Rediscovering Computing “ Gems ” ( Revisit ideas from the past that might have been previously abandoned because they were infeasible but now might be possible )
Computing Field Guide ( Create a resource to show the breadth of computing to both novices and experts )
I joined the Computing Field Guide team .
I think it ’ll be fun to see if we can come up with a way to leverage many of the great existing resources out there and learn some of the breadth of the field as a result .
In the end , the three day summit was just the beginning of a long journey .
It was a bit chaotic and some were disappointed we did n’t fix everything right then or do more , but I think the summit gave a good context for the issues our field faces .
My best memories include all of the great people that I met and being able to engage in some great conversations .
Steve Jobs said “ you ca n’t connect the dots looking forward ; you can only connect them looking backwards . ”
I think that holds true for this summit .
There are still a lot of dots between here and there ; wherever “ there ” might be .
With a lot of hard work , I ’m confident that the dots will connect somehow .
There ’s an interesting road ahead and I want to be a part of it .
We need to start baking cakes for future generations to ice .

NASHVILLE , Tennessee ( Reuters ) - Voters in Nashville on Thursday rejected a proposal that would have made the country music capital the largest U.S. city to make English the official language of local government .
Returns showed the proposition lost by 41,752 votes to 32,144 , local media reported .
The Nashville Tennessean had urged defeat of the measure , saying in an editorial on Thursday that it was discriminatory and would damage the city .
It would “ exclude and marginalize ” non-English speakers , it said , asking : “ How can they assimilate if they cannot first get basic services -- deeds , permits , driver ’s licenses , police and fire protection ? ”
U.S. English Inc , which has promoted and keeps track of such language proposals , said 30 states had passed official English legislation , which applies in varying degrees to state government activities but not local ones .
In the past 2 1 / 2 years , it added , a number of smaller towns had passed such measures .
Nashville , with a population of about 600,000 , would have been the largest U.S. city by far to have approved such a step had it passed .
It marked the third time the proposal had been considered in the Tennessee capital .
Local elected officials approved such a measure in 2007 , but then - Mayor Bill Purcell vetoed it .
A technical issue killed it on another attempt as a charter amendment .
The current mayor , Karl Dean , opposed the latest version .
Backers said it would have required city boards , commissions and council meetings to be in English only , would have encouraged immigrants to learn English and saved an estimated $ 150,000 yearly on translation services .
They found that rejected chimps raised lovingly by human carers are cleverer than the average human baby up to the age of nine months .
And they said the findings were a “ stark warning ” that children needed love as well as physical care or they risked growing up “ maladjusted , unhappy and under- achieving ” .
The study is the first to compare the effects of the way chimp and human babies are raised .
Professor Kim Bard , of the Centre for the Study of Emotion at the University of Portsmouth , studied the care records of 46 baby chimps at risk of death through neglect by their mothers .
A group of 17 given “ responsive care ” had human carers looking after them 20 hours a week .
They tended to their physical and emotional needs , grooming , feeding and interacting with them .
Professor Bard then looked at a second group of 29 given standard care catering only for physical needs .

Let the peasants drink boxed wine .
My favorite mayor ( Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoë ) auctioned off an incredible wine collection that was started years ago when Chirac had been mayor .
Michelin restaurants would have loved having such a lavish collection but Delanoë thought it was silly for a mayor ’s office to buy and maintain such a collection and then the wines are much too precious to serve at official events .
Chirac was less than happy with the auction but even in a nation of wine lovers , Delanoë easily won the debate .
" Revolutionary Road , " based on Richard Yates 's 1961 novel of the same name , is the latest entry in a long stream of art that portrays the American suburbs as the physical correlative to spiritual and mental death .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc paid its financial advisers millions of dollars last year to defend the Internet company against Microsoft Corp ’s unsolicited buyout offer , according to a filing .
Yahoo spent $ 79 million on outside advisers hired to advise it on Microsoft ’s offer to buy all or part of the company , the pursuit of “ other strategic alternatives , including the Google agreement , ” the proxy fight and litigation costs , the company said .
Goldman Sachs and Lehman Bros , whose investment banking arm is now part of Barclays Capital Plc , were Yahoo ’s main financial advisers .
In the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Yahoo also said five separate stockholder lawsuits were filed against the company last year relating to the Microsoft proposal .
Microsoft made its $ 44.6 billion buyout offer for Yahoo public last February and later sweetened it to $ 47.5 billion before walking away in May .
Yahoo sought an alternative search advertising partnership with archrival Google Inc and also held talks with Time Warner Inc ’s AOL unit about a potential combination .
Google backed out of the deal later on under regulatory scrutiny , and talks with AOL have not progressed toward a deal after Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang said he would step down as chief executive .
In January , Yahoo hired Carol Bartz as its new CEO and the company is undergoing a major management reorganization currently .
GAZA  Israeli mortar shells killed as many as 40 Palestinians , among them women and children , outside a United Nations school in Gaza on Tuesday where they were taking refuge in the 11th day of the conflict .
The Israeli military contended that Hamas fighters had fired mortars from the school compound , and United Nations officials called for an independent inquiry into the episode .
The rising civilian death toll in crowded Gaza heightened international urgency to end the combat .
American and European diplomats said it was highly likely that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel would travel to Egypt on Wednesday to discuss a cease - fire .
Israel has said it will not end the operation until it has crushed Hamas ’s ability to fire rockets into its civilian areas .
Meanwhile , Hamas continued to fire rockets , despite the large numbers of Israeli troops on the fourth day of the ground operation in Gaza .
One rocket reached farther than ever into Israeli territory , only 20 miles from Tel Aviv , and wounded an infant .
With another day of gory news reports inflaming the Arab world , Israel contended that the deaths at the school , at the Jabaliya refugee camp north of Gaza City , demonstrated Hamas ’s callousness toward the lives of Palestinian civilians .

The New South Wales Police are asking people to contact them if they see retailers selling World of Warcraft or other massively multiplayer online games .

Both the police and the attorney general 's office in New South Wales say that the New South Wales Classification Enforcement
Act prohibits publishers and retailers from selling unclassified computer games with penalties for individuals breaking the law ranging from $ 1,100 to $ 11,000 and up to a year in jail .
For corporations , the fines roughly double .
And games like World of Warcraft , Age of Conan , Warhammer Online and Pirates of the Burning Sea are all sold without classification .

Something that the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia does n't believe is true .
They claim that games without single player components do n't need to be classified .
But they 're not the ones making and enforcing the laws are they ?
To make things more interesting , a spokesman for the New South Wales police minister told The Sydney Morning Herald that if people see a store selling these games they should file a complaint with the police so they can take action .
The one sticking point seems to be the definition of computer game , which as of this writing does n't include a " bulletin board . "
Obviously the definition is a bit outdated , making it , perhaps , tricky to settle on an interpretation .
Of course if you have both the police and prosecutors agreeing , than it 's going to be an uphill battle for anyone cited .

Sounds like they need to rewrite that definition .
Calls and emails to Blizzard and Activision for comment went unanswered today .

トータルで見てもチャットレディのお仕事はメリットだらけです。他の職業にはないメリットが多数あるので、是非興味を持った方はチャットレディとして働いてみてはいかがでしょうか。
Democratic officials sketched out several situations that could keep Mr. Burris from becoming a member of the Senate .
For example , while the Senate delays admitting him , Mr. Blagojevich would be removed as governor after a vote next week by the Illinois House , and then a trial in the State Senate ; Lt. Gov.
Pat Quinn would become governor ; and Mr. Quinn would appoint a Senate replacement  all before Mr. Burris was allowed to take the seat .
The impeachment committee will invite Mr. Burris to testify before it , Illinois House officials said Friday , though a time and day has yet to be named .
Under the developing strategy in the Senate , Democrats intend to prevent Mr. Burris from making his case on the Senate floor or to steer the appointment to the Rules Committee for an inquiry in the hope that Mr. Blagojevich leaves or is forced from office before any showdown .
To reach that point , Democrats plan to enforce a rule requiring that credentials presented by incoming senators be countersigned by both a state ’s governor and secretary of state .
The Illinois secretary of state , Jesse White , has said he will not sign the document , and Mr. Burris is seeking a court order requiring him to do so .
That matter is awaiting a ruling in the Illinois Supreme Court , where an answer , legal experts said , seemed unlikely until at least the middle of next week .
If Mr. Burris were able to get his credentials countersigned , he could by Senate custom be allowed to go on to the floor and seek to be sworn in along with the other incoming senators .
But at the point that his swearing - in is imminent , Democrats currently plan to raise an objection and seek to have the question of Mr. Burris ’s qualifications referred to the Rules Committee for up to 90 days or some defined period .
Mr. Burris ’s case is also spilling over into the still - unsettled results of the Minnesota election .
With legal proceedings continuing in the race for the seat now held by Norm Coleman , a Republican , officials of both parties say it is unlikely that Democrats would try to seat their candidate , Al Franken , without final paperwork at the same time that they are trying to deny a seat to Mr. Burris on those grounds .
Environmentalists who hope a slowing global economy will mean big falls in greenhouse gas emissions are likely to be disappointed .
Because despite a gloomy economic forecast for 2009 , the annual growth in emissions of 3 % is only likely to slow modestly , and may even rise over the long term because of the downturn 's impact on global climate talks and the funding of renewable energy projects .
Figures from the UK's Committee for Climate Change suggest even a 1.6 % fall in UK GDP - a serious dip - would result in a saving of just 200,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2009 .
That is a tiny fraction of the UK 's projected total of 533 m tonnes .
Andrew Simms , policy director of the New Economics Foundation , explains : " There 's a strong lockstep between GDP and emissions ...
You would n't get more than a 1 % change in emissions unless you had something really dramatic happening , like closing a whole industry down . "
Developed countries anticipate the largest falls in emmissions , according to analysts .
Deutsche Bank this month predicted 2009 emissions covered by the European carbon trading scheme would drop 10 % compared with 2007 levels .
US emissions arealso expected to slow next year .
But falls in the developed world are expected to be short - lived .
Deutsche Bank 's report notes European emissions are likely to rise again in 2010 .
And Bert Metz , a fellow at the European Climate Foundation and former IPCC co-chair has said : " The recession is not of much significance to the climate problem or how we need to deal with it : it 's a small blip . " .
Healthy developing world economies are also likely to offset any shrinking from developed economies , according to Abyd Karmali , Merrill Lynch 's global head of carbon emissions : " I do n't think we 'll see a reduction in emissions ...
We talk about global recession but the truth is economies in places like China and India are still growing . "
Most economists and scientists do agree however that fast - changing economic data makes short - term emissions hard to predict .
" The economists do n't know what 's going on , so why would people looking at emissions know ? " says Metz .
Predictions are complicated by unexpected increases in emissions .
" Because of the recession , perversely , fuel prices have gone down a lot and that might cancel out some of the savings expected in that sector , " says Simms .
Alessandro Vitelli , director of IDEAcarbon , has also suggested similar unplanned rises may occur in the developing world .
Newly jobless workers in Brazil , for example , may turn to subsistence farming , increasing the slashing and burning of rainforest .
The economic impact on renewable energy projects could also cancel some anticipated CO2 savings in the next five years .
The low price of carbon on trading markets and the low price of coal may combine with a lack of credit and debt - averse developers to halt new wind farms and other green - energy developments .
" What you 'll find now is that projects already near completion will probably still come onstream as planned , but those in the planning process are not going to get off the ground for the next two years , " says Deutsche Bank 's Mark Lewis .
Some hope however may still lie in government policy , which may insulate some cleantech projects from the worst ravages of a global downturn according to Samuel Fankhauser , an author for the Climate Change Committee report .
And poor economic growth may mean less adherence to carbon - cutting rules .
One of the downturn 's biggest long - term effects on emissions may be its influence on internationally - agreed carbon cuts .
The poor economic outlook won some European countries concessions on emissions cuts at the EU summit last week , and others may seek the same at ongoing UN talks working to deliver an international deal .
And while those who support a UN - backed green new deal suggest economic and emissions problems could be solved by a silver bullet - a green energy revolution - such a deal is considered politically unlikely by Simms , Vitelli and others .
In short , as the UN's head of the climate secretariat Yvo de Boer said recently : " It would be a pretty depressing way to make progress - to find that recession was helping the world kick an addiction to burning fossil fuels . "
The male stars of He 's Just Not That Into You have put out a call to men everywhere .
Their message : it 's OK for guys to go and see their film .
In a five - minute video , fast becoming a YouTube hit , Kevin Connolly , Justin Long and Bradley Cooper pre-empt the knee - jerk reaction they believe most men might have to a romantic comedy based on a self - help dating guide , itself a spin - off from an episode of Sex and the City .
" I know what you guys out there are thinking – ' Oh fantastic , another chick - flick .
This is just what I need .
I just started dating this girl , she 's gonna drag me to see it ... this sucks ! ' "
But it 's OK , they reassure , because He 's Just Not That Into You is not a typical chick - flick .
It 's " safe " for guys to watch because it avoids many of the tiresome tropes of the genre .
To demonstrate this , the trio act out – hilariously – the 10 chick - flick clichés you wo n't find in the film .
There 's no makeover montage , no last - minute airport dash , and no sassy best friend .
( " He plays the didgeridoo ?
My advice ? Didgeri - don't . " )
Viewers wo n't be subjected to a scene where , in a madcap moment of sisterhood , characters spontaneously start singing into random objects .
And they wo n't have to listen , cringing , while a guy moonily lists all the little things he loves about a girl ( " I love your laugh .
I love the gap in your teeth .
I love how you smile at homeless people ... " ) .
As marketing ploys go , it 's very funny .
It does , though , omit to mention that while there may not be a soft - focus , soppy falling - in - love medley , He 's Just Not That Into
You still features a quintet of female protagonists who are , variously , desperate to get married , desperate for a date , desperate to steal another woman 's husband , desperately addicted to cyber - stalking , and desperate to get her kitchen redecorated .
Not to mention the chick - flick staples of bridesmaid dress fittings , yoga class , awkward blind dates , bitchy gay best friends and Sex and the City - style talking heads offering " real life " relationship advice ( " Girlfriend , go grab yo'self a tub of ice cream , you have been dumped ! " ) .

Nevertheless , I decide to test out Connolly and co's assertion that men can " safely " watch this movie , " and , hey , might even enjoy it . "
But first I must find my guinea pig .
Not easy on a Friday night with two hours ' notice .
While one potential escort states flatly that he has something far more fun to do , other ( ultimately negative ) responses reveal an encouraging and hitherto unexpressed appetite for romcom trash among my male friends .
I note this for future use .
Eventually my housemate , Ed , steps manfully into the breach – without , I think , signing me up for washing - up duties for the next month .
Result .
It 's 8.30 pm , and the Empire on Leicester Square in London is abuzz with excited females .
Maybe
Ed stands out a little , but he is 6ft 2in tall , has his right arm in plaster ( sporting injury ) and is wearing an eccentric green and white bobble hat , so gender may not be the issue here .
Inside Screen 1 , it 's a 70 per cent - female audience who laugh , coo , boo , tut and whoop in all the right places .
Ed laughs a lot too , though he utterly fails to see one of the climactic romantic gestures coming while every woman in the audience is flapping her hands happily in anticipation a good three minutes before it happens .
Clearly not a chick - flick pro .
At the end , there 's a burst of applause .
Ed does n't join in , but I put this down to the plaster cast .
" I really enjoyed it , " he says .
" I liked the insight into how we , as humans , deal with the failure of our hopes . "
Gosh , maybe it's not your typical chick - flick , after all .
He also makes the valid point that though the women in the film are far from beacons of the feminist ideal , the men get an equally rough ride , exposed as lily - livered liars , repressed romantics and , in one case , a clingy , crazed fool .
I thought most men would act like that around Scarlett Johansson , but maybe I 'm stereotyping .
Chris Drummond , a 27 - year - old accountant from Reading , was also coerced , by his girlfriend , into seeing the film .
He took issue with its fairy - tale morality .
" The unwavering positivity of chick flicks was hammered home by the unlikely premise that all the hopeless but nice characters ended up happily loved - up , whereas the sexy or mean characters implausibly ended up alone . "
The fact is that chick flicks are getting harder to avoid .
They have been a cinema and DVD dead cert for years , but after Mamma Mia ! and Sex and the City – respectively the biggest and fifth - biggest films of last year , with combined takings of £ 97 m at the UK box - office – chick flicks have become a blockbuster route to big bucks .
He 's Just Not That Into
You has topped the US box - office for the last two weeks with $ 28 m in takings , and entered the UK top 10 at No 2 with £ 1.9 m .
Hoping to emulate Sex and the City 's success in the coming months are Confessions of a Shopaholic ; All About Steve ( Sandra Bullock meets her " soulmate " on a blind date and proceeds to stalk him from state to state ) ; Ghosts of Girlfriends Past ( a chick - flickised Christmas Carol starring Matthew McConaughey .
Really ) ; and Marley and Me ( Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson adopt a dog to see if they 're ready to raise children ) .
Why women love or hate these films has been much debated , and their portrayals of the female sex endlessly dissected by women .
But is there a chance that men , less au fait with chick - flick conventions , might believe that they offer an insight into the workings of the female mind ?
" No more than action movies give an insight into men , " says James Mason , a 28 - year - old actuary from Bristol .
" Most chick flicks are an exaggeration of reality in order to achieve an enjoyable escapism . "
Alex Knights , 29 , a commissioning editor , thinks the traditional male aversion to chick flicks is a question of quality .
" I like to be challenged when I go the cinema .
I can't stand being able to feel the cogs of a feeble plot turning .
I feel soiled at having consented to have my emotional strings pulled so blatantly .
Richard Curtis films generally make my blood boil . "
Having said that , he was persuaded to watch Bridget Jones 's Diary .
" Actually , that was OK .
It was mitigated by a sense of humour and it felt like a reasonably original film . "
It 's time for Hollywood to shake off its rigid perceptions of gender .
And though Hollywood advertises it in a far less strident way , men have been going to see the male equivalent of chick flicks for years .
" Guy - cry films " are a quietly burgeoning market : a recent poll in Entertainment Weekly drew up a list – including The Shawshank Redemption , Gladiator , Jerry Maguire and Field of Dreams – of the best classic movies to induce tears and male bonding in equal measure .
What women ( and men ) want are high - quality , original films .
As Connolly , Cooper and Long satirise so brilliantly in their YouTube clip , Hollywood has relied for too long on tired clichés , cookie - cutter characters – and makeover montages .
The current fiasco over the Main Street Plaza is n't the first time a Mormon City Council decided to ban free speech in the name of a " public nuisance . "
This happened before in Nauvoo and ultimately led to Smith 's death .
In the city of Nauvoo , the Mormon City Council was apalled that a newspaper ( The Nauvoo Expositor ) had exposed Smith 's revelation and practice of polygamy .
For this , Mayor Joseph Smith called the City Council together to declare the paper a " public nuisance " in order to have the press destroyed .
Much of the rhetoric then sounds familiar to what the church says now over free speech on the Main Street Plaza !
Here 's how John Tayor , a member on the City Council , explained that fateful council meeting :
" ... the apostate ' Mormons ' , associated with others , commenced the publication of a libelous paper in Nauvoo , called the Nauvoo Expositor ...
It was , however , no sooner put in circulation than the indignation of the whole community was aroused ...
As it was among us , under these circumstances , it was thought best to convene the city council to take into consideration the adoption of some measures for its removal , as it was deemed better that this should be done legally than illegally .
Joseph Smith , therefore , who was mayor , convened the city council for that purpose ; the paper was introduced and read , and the subject examined . "
" All , or nearly all present , expressed their indignation at the course taken by the Expositor , which was owned by some of the aforesaid apostates , associated with one or two others ...
Various attempts had heretofore been made by the party to annoy and irritate the citizens of Nauvoo ... "
" Being a member of the city council , I well remember the feeling of responsibility that seemed to rest upon all present ; nor shall I soon forget the bold , manly , independent expressions of Joseph Smith on that occasion in relation to this matter .
He exhibited in glowing colors the meanness , corruption and ultimate designs of the anti-' Mormons ' ; their despicable characters and ungodly influences , especially of those who were in our midst .
He ( Smith ) told of the responsibility that rested upon us , as guardians of the public interest , to stand up in the defense of the injured and oppressed , to stem the current of corruption , and as men and saints , to put a stop to this flagrant outrage upon this people 's rights . "
" He ( Smith ) stated that no man was a stronger advocate for the liberty of speech and of the press than himself ; yet , when this noble gift is utterly prostituted and abused , as in the present instance , it loses all claim to our respect , and becomes as great an agent for evil as it can possibly be for good ; and notwithstanding the apparent advantage we should give our enemies by this act , yet it behooved us , as men , to act independent of all secondary influences , to perform the part of men of enlarged minds , and boldly and fearlessly to discharge the duties devolving upon us by declaring as a nuisance , and removing this filthy , libelous , and seditious sheet from our midst . "
" The subject was discussed in various forms , and after the remarks made by the mayor , every one seemed to be waiting for some one else to speak .
After a considerable pause , I arose and expressed my feelings frankly , as Joseph had done , and numbers of others followed in the same strain ; and I think , but am not certain , that I made a motion for the removal of that press as a nuisance .
This motion was finally put , and carried by all but one ; and he conceded that the measure was just , but abstained through fear . "
- Brigham Young , History of the Church , Vol. 7 , p.62-63
Mayor Joseph Smith lied about polygamy during the City Council Meeting
From the official minutes of the City Council meeting :
" CITY COUNCIL , REGULAR SESSION , June 8th , 1844 .
Councilor Hyrum Smith proceeded to show the falsehood of Austin Cowles in the Expositor , in relation to the revelation ( on polygamy ) referred to .
Mayor ( Smith ) said he had never preached the revelation ( on polygamy ) in private ; but he had public .
Had not taught to the anointed in the Church in private , which statement many present confirmed ; that on inquiring concerning the passage on the resurrection concerning " they neither marry nor are given in marriage , " &c. , he received for answer , " Man in this life must marry in view of eternity , otherwise they must remain as angels , or be single in heaven , " which was the doctrine of the revelation referred to ; and the Mayor spoke at considerable length in explanation of this principle .
and was willing , for one , to subscribe his name to declare the Expositor and whole establishment a nuisance . "
- Joseph Smith , History of the Church , Vol. 6 , p.442
( Hyrum Smith told the City Council that Smith 's 1843 polygamy revelation pertained to ancient polygamy only and not to modern times . )
The next City Council meeting described by Joseph Smith in his personal diary :
" Monday , June 10 , 1844 .
I was in the City Council from 10 a. m. , to l:20 p. m. , and from 2:20 p. m. to 6:30 p.m. investigating the merits of the Nauvoo Expositor ...
An ordinance was passed concerning libels .
The Council passed an ordinance declaring the Nauvoo Expositor a nuisance , and also issued an order to me to abate the said nuisance .
I immediately ordered the Marshal to destroy it without delay , and at the same time issued an order to Jonathan Dunham , acting Major - General of the Nauvoo Legion , to assist the Marshal with the Legion , if called upon so to do . "
" About 8 p. m. , the Marshal returned and reported that he had removed the press , type , printed paper , and fixtures into the street , and destroyed them .
This was done because of the libelous and slanderous character of the paper ..
The posse accompanied by some hundreds of the citizens , returned with the Marshal to the front of the Mansion , when I gave them a short address , and told them they had done right and that not a hair of their heads should be hurt for it ; that they had executed the orders which were given me by the City Council ; that I would never submit to have another libelous publication established in the city ; that I did not care how many papers were printed in the city , if they would print the truth : but would submit to no libels or slanders from them .
I then blessed them in the name of the Lord .
This speech was loudly greeted by the assembly with three - times - three cheers .
The posse and assembly then dispersed all in good order . "
- Joseph Smith , History of the Church , Vol. 6 , p.432
Joseph Smith 's official account of the destruction of the press
" Nauvoo , June 14th , 1844 .
Dear Sir , I write you this morning briefly to inform you of the facts relative to the removal of the press and fixtures of the Nauvoo Expositor as a nuisance . "
" The 8th and 10th instant were spent by the city council of Nauvoo in receiving testimony concerning the character of the Expositor , and the character and designs of the proprietors . "
" In the investigation it appeared evident to the council that the proprietors were a set of unprincipled , lawless ebauches , counterfeiters , bogus - makers , gamblers , peace - disturbers , and that the grand object of said proprietors was to destroy our constitutional rights and chartered privileges ; to overthrow all good and wholesome regulations in society ; to strengthen themselves against the municipality ; to fortify themselves against the church of which I am a member , and destroy all our religious rights and privileges by libels , slanders , falsehoods , perjury , etc. and sticking at no corruption to accomplish their hellish purposes ; and that said paper of itself was libelous of the deepest dye , and very injurious as a vehicle of defamation , tending to corrupt the morals , and disturb the peace , tranquility , and happiness of the whole community , and especially that of Nauvoo . "
" After a long and patient investigation of the character of the Expositor , and the characters and designs of its proprietors , the Constitution , the Charter , and all the best authorities on the subject , the city council decided that it was necessary for the ' peace , benefit , good order , and regulations ' of said city , ' and for the protection of the property ' , and for ' the happiness and prosperity of the citizens of Nauvoo ' , that said Expositor should be removed ; and declaring said Expositor a nuisance , ordered the mayor to cause them to be removed without delay , which order was committed to the marshal by due process , and by him executed the same day , by removing the paper , press , and fixtures into the streets , and burning the same ; all which was done without riot , noise , tumult , or confusion , as has already been proved before the municipality of the city ; and the particulars of the whole transaction may be expected in our next Nauvoo Neighbor .... [ signed ] Joseph Smith "

Has the Mormon Church ever liked free speech ?
Why can't they handle criticism ?
Rethinking Circumcision
Imagine a couple walking into a U.S. hospital with their newborn baby girl and asking a doctor to surgically remove her clitoral foreskin .
Hospital
staff would surely decline this request because female genital mutilation is illegal .
The procedure is medically unnecessary .
And it is just plain cruel .
The procedure would - and should -- appall most people .
Yet , our culture routinely circumcises 60 percent of infant boys without thinking twice about
it .
Some will argue that male and female circumcision are very different .
But are they ?
Neither are medically necessary .
They are simply accepted cultural practices .
And both subject infants to excruciating pain .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently revised its position on routine male circumcision stating that it does not have to be done .
While this is a far cry from the position anti-circumcision advocates would like them to take , it is a tremendous step forward in helping parents make informed choices about the health and well - being of their sons .
The risks associated with infant male circumcision justify a rigorous public education program aimed at new and expecting parents .
Most Americans think circumcision offers health benefits to their sons .
In fact , quite the opposite is true .
With circumcision , boys are placed at risk of excessive bleeding , infection , complications from anesthesia , loss of glans penis , and even death .
The medical community has long known that boys will not bond with their mothers or breast - feed for several days after circumcision , and circumcised males tend to be more aggressive than other boys .
Parents deserve to know this before they make the decision to circumcise .
Many good parents have their sons circumcised , and are later very upset that doctors did not fully explain the risks associated with the procedure .
Because circumcision is so common , some parents in the United States even believe an infant male must be circumcised .
For many years , good and ethical doctors followed the lead of the American Academy of Pediatrics and routinely circumcised their newborn male patients .
But now the pediatric community knows better .
And we owe it to parents to give them the facts about circumcision .
Most parents believe that their sons should be circumcised to avoid penile infection .
True , the uncircumcised human penis does need more attention in terms of hygiene .
But ears gets dirty too and we do n't chop them off .
We simply clean them .
Teeth need to be brushed twice a day and flossed daily - a high maintenance body part , indeed .
Should we have all of our teeth extracted ?
Of course not .
Yet this is the very same logic that supports circumcision to prevent infection .
Fathers often say they want their sons circumcised so they can look like them .
Okay , I just have to ask - how much time do these guys intend to spend
comparing penises with their sons ?!
If similar appearance is so important to these fathers , will they also insist their infant boys grow beards ?
Guys , people look different .
Mutilating your sons so you can have matching penises is an act of narcissism and cruelty .
Finally , many anti-circumcision advocates are charged with anti-Semitism because the practice began as a Jewish rite of passage .
My good friend , who is both Jewish and a passionate opponent of circumcision , is among a growing cadre of Jewish people rethinking the covenant between God and Abraham .
As she says , " Folks , I guarantee you , God does not want your son 's foreskins , but I assure you your sons do . "
Many Jewish families are now hosting circumcision - free brises for their sons , a humane way to preserve the religious tradition .
Many people say that because of anesthesia , infants do not feel pain when they are circumcised .
Or , worse yet , they say the infant 's neurological system is not fully developed , therefore they cannot feel the pain of the procedure .
As a pediatric nurse , I can say with some authority that both counts are absolutely false .
When I was a nursing student , a pediatrician asked me to assist him in a circumcision and it was an experience I will never forget .
We had to strap down the infant to a molded board specially designed for circumcision .
At that point he began crying .
The doctor injected anesthesia to numb the penis , an experience which in itself was traumatic .
During the procedure , the child cried uncontrollably and was obviously in excruciating pain .
It was a horrific procedure - one that scarred my soul forever .
" Never do this to your son , " the doctor said when he was finished .
And I knew I never would .
As a culture , it is time we rethink male circumcision .
While we once believed there were medical benefits that justified the practice , science in its ever - evolving wisdom has proven us wrong .
Now that the world 's largest and most respected authority on pediatrics has claimed that male circumcision is not medically necessary , we must work to eliminate the practice with the same zeal we worked to outlaw female genital mutilation .

BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES BROUGHT POLICE STATE TO AMERICA
By Mary Starrett
Constitution Party Communications Director
The word “ fascism ” has been used for decades to deride political ideologies of both the right and left .
Fact is , fascism has come to America and we have allowed it to happen .
Back in 1944 economist and author John Flynn pointed out that we have been laying the basecoat of fascism here in the U.S. in the book As We Go Marching .
“ But alas , the most terrifying aspect of the whole fascist episode is the dark fact that most of its poisons are generated not by evil men or evil peoples , but by quite ordinary men in search of an answer to the baffling problems that beset every society .
Nothing could have been further from the minds of most of them than the final brutish and obscene result .
The gangster comes upon the stage only when the scene has been made ready for him by his blundering precursors . ”
Flynn would n’t be at all surprised to see that what he predicted 65 years ago is happening in our country today .
He said “ all the elements of facism ” include the “ organization of the economic society as a planned economy under the supervision of the state . ”
Flynn laid it all out saying we faced “ a planned … economy , ” “ militarism as an economic weapon , ” “ imperialism ” and ultimately “ dictatorship . ”
I thought of Flynn during the presidential debates when both candidates talked up the necessity for war in foreign countries , for mandating “ sustainable ” energy , for demands for a government - controlled health care system , for more farm subsidies , for “ bailing out ” the banking industry , despite the voter ’s outcry against it .
And I thought of him again when the “ bailout ” was passed by Congress because Flynn had written :
“ Fascism will come at the hands of perfectly authentic Americans … who are convinced that the present economic system is washed up … and who wish to commit this country to the rule of the bureaucratic state ; interfering in the affairs of the states and the cities ; taking part in the management of industry and finance and agriculture ; assuming the role of a great national banker and investor , borrowing billions every year and spending them on all sorts of projects through which a government can paralyze opposition and command public support ; marshaling great armies …at crushing costs to support the industry of war …. which will become our greatest industry … adding … global planning … under the authority of a centralized government in which the executive will hold … all the powers , with Congress reduced to the role of a debating society . ”
Fascism did n’t come to America wearing jack boots and brown shirts .
It came respectably - clad in suits and ties and calling itself Republicans and Democrats .
The fascism basecoat was laid with each government intervention in the free market system , each undeclared and unconstitutional war and every single incursion by the state into private enterprises like banking and auto manufacturing .
And both the R’s and the D’s were behind it all .
As we watched the basecoat dry we continued to allow the incremental creeping toward fascism by electing those who made no secret of their plans to redistribute wealth , make the state the boss of us and dismantle the free enterprise system .
Both McCain and Obama and elected officials in both parties have consistently supported elements of fascism and they never had to worry they ’d lose because of it .
It was only a matter of how much fascism Americans wanted each election cycle .
Elected officials know that as members of the controlling elite that masquerades as two separate and opposing factions , they will not be deposed .
The vast majority will be easily re-elected despite their opposition to the majority of Americans on such issues as illegal immigration , secure borders , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the “ Bailout . ”
Unless Americans make a determined move to unseat incumbents for these and other assaults against the Constitution , we can expect nothing more than a shallacking by those now controlling our government in both “ Big Box ” parties .

What did McCain mean when he called Obama ' that one ' ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008

A growing perception that Republican presidential candidate John McCain is outright disdainful of having to share a stage with -- let alone losing to -- Barack Obama is gaining more traction after McCain dismissively referred to his opponent as " that one " during Tuesday 's debate .
Andrew Sullivan pronounced it " the moment the contempt spilled over . "
Crooks and Liars Nicole Belle wonder if McCain was " going to yell at him to get off his lawn next . "
Some Obama supporters have already co-opted the phrase , on T - shirts and by registering the url , That One08.com .
The comment was instantly noticed by the Obama campaign itself .
" Did John McCain just refer to Obama as ' that one ' ? " campaign spokesman Bill Burton asked in an e-mail to reporters just minutes after it happened .
A video of the exchange wound up on YouTube before the debate was even over .
After a previous debate appearance in which McCain seemed unable to even look at Obama , some are wondering whether McCain 's " that one " quip reveals more about his character .
Brian Beutler notes the phrase is " a singular rendering of the phrase ' Those people ! ' "
Plenty of people are giving McCain the benefit of the doubt though .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder says McCain uses the phrase often in stump speeches and just bungled the set - up Tuesday night .
" I did n't think the moment came off as racist .
Rather , it was tone deaf .
It was Grandpa Simpson .
It was cranky .
Which fits it into a narrative connecting the first two debates , " writes Ezra Klein .
" In both , McCain 's most memorable tics were exhibitions of contempt for Barack Obama . "
McCain was speaking about his vote against a 2005 energy bill championed by President Bush .
The GOP candidate , buffing his reputation as an opponent of pork - barrel spending , contrasted his opposition to the measure he described as " loaded down with ... billions for the oil companies " to Obama 's vote in favor of the bill .
" You know who voted for it ?
You might never know , " McCain jabbed .
" That one . "
A McCain spokesman dismissed discussion of the quip , according to ABC News , calling the Obama campaign 's attempt to draw attention to the remark " diversionary . "

Good morning .
President Obama is in Arizona , where just after noon ( ET ) he is due to unveil a $ 50 billion plan intended to help homeowners stay in their homes , USA TODAY 's Rich Wolf writes .
The Arizona Republic adds that the plan is " expected to offer assistance to struggling homeowners and push lenders to restructure loans and lower mortgage rates . "
As for stories making headlines , they include :
• The Financial Times -- Greenspan says it may be necessary to nationalize some banks :
As the Obama administration continues to work on its plan for shoring up the bank and financial sectors of the economy , the FT writes that :
The US government may have to nationalise some banks on a temporary basis to fix the financial system and restore the flow of credit , Alan Greenspan , the former Federal Reserve chairman , has told the Financial Times .
In an interview , Mr Greenspan , who for decades was regarded as the high priest of laisser - faire capitalism , said nationalisation could be the least bad option left for policymakers .
" It may be necessary to temporarily nationalise some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring , " he said .
" I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do . "
• The New York Times -- " Obama 's war on terror may resemble Bush 's in some areas " : " Even as it pulls back from harsh interrogations and other sharply debated aspects of George W. Bush 's ' war on terrorism , ' the Obama administration is quietly signaling continued support for other major elements of its predecessor ’s approach to fighting al - Qaeda .
In little - noticed confirmation testimony recently , Obama nominees endorsed continuing the CIA 's program of transferring prisoners to other countries without legal rights , and indefinitely detaining terrorism suspects without trials even if they were arrested far from a war zone .
The administration has also embraced the Bush legal team 's arguments that a lawsuit by former C.I.A. detainees should be shut down based on the ' state secrets ' doctrine .
It has also left the door open to resuming military commission trials . "
• Detroit Free Press --
Automakers present Obama with another crisis : Yesterday 's word from General Motors and Chrysler that they need a quick infusion of $ 7 billion , and $ 39 billion more in aid over all , presents " yet another economic crisis for President Barack Obama in his first month in office .
...
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president 's auto task force will review the reports closely in the next few days .
' It is clear that going forward , more will be required from everyone involved -- creditors , suppliers , dealers , labor and auto executives themselves -- to ensure the viability of these companies going forward , ' he said . "
• USA TODAY -- Afghanistan looks to be Obama 's second - highest priority : With the announcement Tuesday that he 's sending an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan , President Obama underscored that " the economic downturn will continue to be the administration 's top priority , but close behind will be Afghanistan -- a place whose tribes defied the armies of the Mongols in the 13th century , the British in the 19th and the Soviets in the 20th .
Pentagon plans assume that a significant number of U.S. troops will be deployed there through the four years of Obama 's term . "
• Wall Street Journal --
Stimulus plan unclear on executive pay limits : " Executive - pay restrictions in the economic stimulus package could reach much further into the ranks of affected companies than previously believed , depending on how a crucial but confusingly written provision is interpreted , lawyers and compensation consultants said .
Meanwhile , consternation about the new pay restrictions continued to grow , with some financial - industry insiders predicting an upheaval in industry compensation structures and a slow brain drain from affected firms . "
• Politico --
As some journalists land jobs in the administration , critics say a bias is showing : " In three months since Election Day , at least a half - dozen prominent journalists have taken jobs working for the federal government .
Journalists , including some of those who 've jumped ship , say it 's better to have a solid job in government than a shaky job –- or none at all - – in an industry that 's fading fast .
But conservative critics answer with a question : Would journalists be making the same career choices if John McCain had beaten Barack Obama in November ? "
• Canadian Broadcasting Corp. --
Obama says stimulus will improve trade ties over time : " Washington 's mammoth economic stimulus package will ' enhance ' the ability of trading partners such as Canada to work within U.S. borders over time , U.S. President Barack Obama told CBC News on Tuesday in an exclusive interview from Washington .
The interview with the CBC 's chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge took place in the White House on Tuesday morning ahead of Obama 's first official foreign visit as president with Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa on Thursday . "

Parliamentary officials said that it would take a few days before they would be able to judge the effectiveness of the new system , which costs around £ 400,000 to install , on the basis of the number of participating MPs .

[ Haskell ] ANN : filestore 0.1
ANN filestore 0.1
We are pleased to announce the first release of a new library , filestore .
What is it ?
filestore provides a uniform , abstract , generic interface for storing versioned files on disk .
It allows calling programs to use generic commands to store strings or binary data and perform various queries , such as ' what files are in this repository ? ' or ' what were the contents of this file at revision XXXXXXX ? ' or ' give me a diff of this file between revision XXXXXXX and revision YYYYYYY . '
Because the interface is abstract , the calling program is insulated from the messy details of the backend ( which might be a VCS or a database ) .
What backends are supported ?
Darcs and Git are fully supported .
There are plans for a SQLite backend .
What is this good for ?
Currently it is used by two wikis , Gitit and Orchid .
We hope it will see use in other applications as well that need to version data and would like the various advantages of DVCSs ( such as easy collaboration , advanced merging , etc. ) .
Where can you get it ?
Your local cabal - install , Hackage at http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/filestore and of course you can do ' darcs get http://johnmacfarlane.net/repos/filestore' for the very latest .

The forces behind the drive to extend Europe 's musical copyrights from 50 to 95 years ( i.e. , the record labels , Sir Cliff Richard , and at least a few actual , aging session musicians that the law is ostensibly designed to help ) won a major victory late last week when the bill was passed out of the powerful Legal Affairs Committee ( known as JURI ) at the European Parliament .
Lost in much discussion about the vote was the fact that the committee wondered aloud whether " a similar copyright extension would benefit the audiovisual world . "
Actually , " wondered aloud " is putting it too weakly .
The committee actually asked the European Commission , which started the current process on musical term extension , to produce an " impact report " by January 2010 on the subject .
That report , if it follows the depressing pattern of the current proceeding ( all but ignoring academics , even those that produced EU - commissioned work on this topic ) might well find that aging , out - of - work actors with gimpy knees and bad lungs need another 45 years of protection to keep them out of the poorhouse .
And , should that happen , the term extension push will ramp up once more , this time for movies and TV shows instead of music .
All that paranoid talk of perpetual copyrights and infinite term extensions ?
Well , there 's a reason it gets started , and this is it .
It 's also a textbook example of how the drive for copyright " parity " only moves one way — toward longer terms .
No need for evidence
The current musical term extension push began in February 2008 , when European Commissioner Charlie McCreevy of Ireland announced his support for a near doubling of the current term of protection .
The rhetoric around the issue has centered on impoverished session musicians , who are n't getting money just when they need it the most .
( " Saving for retirement " was apparently a precept never picked up over the last 50 years during which these musicians have been able to earn royalties on their work . )
A closer look at these claims shows just how odd they are .
For instance , the whole issue was looked at quite carefully by the UK's Andrew Gowers during his hugely publicized report on intellectual property .
Gowers concluded in 2006 that no such term extension was needed — at which point the labels simply shifted their focus away from national governments to the EU .
Charlie McCreevy
But Gowers was operating in a UK context ; groups of continental academics have come to similar conclusions when looking at the data .
One group , headed by Prof. P. Bernt Hugenholtz of the University of Amsterdam , found that a copyright term extension would be a bad idea with costs for consumers , competitors , and society as a whole .
Despite being commissioned , paid for , and published by the European Commission , Hugenholtz 's work was n't even mentioned when McCreevy made his proposal ( though music industry work was considered ) .
This led Hugenholtz to blast off an angry letter about a process which " seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the Parliament , as well as the citizens of the European Union .
In doing so the Commission reinforces the suspicion , already widely held by the public at large , that its policies are less the product of a rational decision - making process than of lobbying by stakeholders . "
Another group of academics fired off an open letter to the Times of London in which they complained that the new plan would only pad the pockets of " record companies , aging rock stars or , increasingly , artists ' estates .
It does nothing for innovation and creativity . "
But forget Gowers and European academics — what claim do those pushing the idea of term extension make ?
The official legislative dossier tells us : " Once their performance fixed in a phonogram is no longer protected , around 7,000 performers in any of the big Member States and a correspondingly smaller number in the smaller Member States will lose all of their income that derives from contractual royalties and statutory remuneration claims from broadcasting and public communication of their performances in bars and discotheques . "
A tremendous loss to the German public domain is therefore enacted in order to help , for example , just 7,000 performers in all of Germany .
And how much will these musicians make ?
According to Commissioner McCreevy , an average of just ? 2,000 a year .
But , according to the UK - based Open Rights Group , this is n't about session musicians anyway .
Writing in the Telegraph last week , the group 's new executive director said , " That argument is hard to swallow .
Firstly , two - thirds of the money that a recording generates is made in the first six years after publication .
We might conclude that if artists want to survive in their later years , record companies should ensure they invest in a pension , not depend of the vague hope of earnings from ancient recordings .
" Secondly , an analysis of the figures shows where the money really ends up .
About 80 per cent will go to recording companies .
Of the rest , nearly all would go to big stars , and a very small percentage to the small artists the Directive claims to be all about . "
Another UK academic at the University of Bournemouth says that a slightly lower 70 percent of all new revenues will go to the record labels , not the performers ; in any event , most of the money goes to labels that have already had five decades to profit from the songs in question .
Let 's compromise at 70 ?
Brian Crowley
The term extension still needs to pass Parliament , but that looks likely with JURI 's recommendation ( where the bill was overseen by another Irishman , Brian Crowley , who is in the same party as McCreevy ) .
The measure may face more opposition when the Council of Ministers considers it , though .
The UK government has already said publicly that it does not support an extension to 95 years , but it would be open to a 70 - year term .
The end result of the entire process might well be a compromise that sees the term extension " reduced , " giving the labels and performers another two decades of copyright protection .
And in 2028 , when the copyright on 1958 's music would finally start to expire ?
The EU could always push for another extension .
At least a 70 - year term has some basis in reality ; it 's designed to make sure that performers can profit from their work for their entire lives .
With increasing life spans , a 50 - year term wo n't cover many musicians for their entire lives .
The current 95 - year plan uses the same rationalization to a less convincing effect .
It is designed to " improve the social situation of performers , and in particular sessions musicians , taking into account that performers are increasingly outliving the existing 50 year period of protection for their performances . "
Though , even if musicians popped out of the womb and landed in a recording studio , very few would need 95 years of coverage .
Beautiful harmonies
Whatever happens , it 's clear that the situation would create an inequity of the kind that copyright maximalists love to exploit .
If music gets 70 years of coverage , how could it possibly be fair to grant only 50 years of protection to audiovisual works ?
Better consider extending those , too — an argument that some in the European Parliament are now making explicitly .
And what if you consider authors ?
In the EU , authors get protection for their entire lives plus 70 years after death .
It does n't really make much sense to grant that sort of protection only to authors , so of course there will be a push to give music and then audiovisual works similar terms of protection .
In fact , with the current proceeding , that process is well under way .
The European Commission 's Internal Market section ( headed by Commissioner McCreevy ) says explicitly that this is the goal .
" The Commission adopted a proposal to extend the term of protection for performers and sound recordings to 95 years , " it notes on its website .
" The aim of the proposal is to bring performers ' protection more in line with that already given to authors — 70 years after their death . "
This sort of " harmonization " of copyrights always moves in one direction — toward longer protection terms — and when there 's nothing to harmonize at home , one can always suggest that one 's creative classes are getting a raw deal because some foreign government offers its creators a longer term .
The proposal passed by JURI does contain a couple of important limitations .
It has a " use it or lose it " clause under which the original performers would get copyright control over their music if labels choose not to market it .
Labels also must pay 20 percent of the new revenue they earn ( not their total revenue ) into a fund that will be distributed to session musicians .
Still , given the limited impact even the bill 's most optimistic supporters say it will have on a few thousand musicians per country , an extra 45 years of copyright protection seems an enormous price to pay .
[ Update : Since posting this story , we ’ve had a lot of inquiries from readers , with questions ranging from whether Android is ready for laptops and full - scale PCs , why Android ca n’t rely fully on Linux , and so on .
See our follow - up Android FAQ post . ]
The image above shows a netbook Asus EEEPC 1000H running on Google ’s mobile operating system Android .
Huh ?
You thought Android was for mobile phones , right ?
Well , as we ’ve written before , Google is planning to use Android for any device — not just the mobile phones .
Besides writing as freelancers for VentureBeat , we also run a startup called Mobile - facts .
It took us about four hours of work to compile Android for the netbook .
Having done so , we ( Daniel Hartmann , that is ) got the netbook fully up and running on it , with nearly all of the necessary hardware you ’d want ( including graphics , sound and the wireless card for internet ) running .
See the images below for further impressions .
Here ’s the significance : Imagine the billion dollar market at stake here if Google can make good on this vision .
Netbooks are basically small - scale PCs .
For Silicon
Valley myriad of software companies , it means a well - backed , open operating system that is open and ripe for exploitation for building upon .
Now think of Chrome , Google ’s web browser , and the richness it allows developers to build into the browser ’s relationship with the desktop — all of this could usher in a new wave of more sophisticated web applications , cheaper and more dynamic to use .
Ramifications abound :
What does it mean for the stock price of Microsoft ?
Microsoft currently owns the vast majority of the desktop operating system market share ?
In recent weeks , Microsoft ’s Steve Ballmer repeatedly dismissed Android as competition to Windows Mobile .
Back to our experience in compiling Android for the Asus netbooks .
It shows us that there is a big technology push to let Android run on netbooks under way .
Based on the progress we see in the Android open source project , we believe that getting an Android netbook to market is doable in as few as three months .
Of course , the timing depends as much on decisions by the partners in Google ’s OHA alliance and other developers contributing to Android , as it does on Google itself .
It is these partners — including device makers and carriers — who decide how and when to adopt Android for different devices and markets .
As we note below , Intel is one such contributor working on the adoption of Android to a notebook .
A mass production of the netbooks would be possible between three to nine months , depending on circumstances , two sources familiar with such matters told us .
However , as we evaluate the progress of the various OHA projects , we expect conditions for a mass - market netbook to ripen in 2010 , rather than in 2009 .
Right now a variety a of OHA members , announced and unnanounced , are working on projects to set up a sufficient ecosystem .
One important part of the ecosystem would be to have a set of well - functioning applications ( an office productivity suite , for example ) .
Google is mostly leaving applications development for Android to third parties ( applications which run in the browser like Google Docs being the notable exception ) .
At the rate things are going , we do n’t see enough of these third parties developing applications for Android netbooks in the next 12 months .
There have been recent predictions about Android netbooks appearing in 2009 .
Background
In researching for our Android coverage at VentureBeat , we ’ve participated in various Android developer groups and frequently play around with Android to understand some of the issues behind IT .
The trigger for us to do the compilation was some news on the Android Porting Google Group .
In it , Google developer Dima Zavin claimed a couple of days ago that he ported Android to an Asus EeePC 701 .
So we decided to have our own go at another Asus netbook .
“ Compilation ” is a process which needed for a machine such as a PC to be able to use an operating system and understand code .
Zavin was compiling Android for a regular Intel CPU , which is what the Asus netbook runs on .
The G1 phone , the first commercial mobile phone that Android runs on , however runs on a different processor : the ARM CPU .
Taking Zavin ’s work as credible , we assumed that compilation would n’t take that much time .
Android ’s Linux core makes experimental compilations like ours possible .
For example , compilations require something called drivers .
Drivers are programs which are needed to communicate an operating system like Android with various computer hardware .
There are already a lot of Linux drivers , and Linux is able to run on a lot of different computer architectures .
Otherwise we ’d have needed to build our drivers from scratch .
Android Netbooks coming , but more likely in 2010
We already argued back in August that Android wants to be on any device , not just a phone .
Android is designed to run on any device in a category widely referred to as “ embedded devices . ”
The fact that various OHA partners have already developed Android enough to easily work on our netbook may be considered evidence enough that Google is getting increasing buy - in from industry players to realize this vision .
We found two additional indicators that technology is being developed in this direction .
For one , we discovered that Android already has two product “ policies ” in its code .
Product policies are operating system directions aimed at specific uses .
The two policies are for 1 ) phones and 2 ) mobile internet devices , or MID for short .
MID is Intel ’s name for ‘ mobile internet devices , ’ which include devices like the Asus netbook we got Android running on .
The context for our finding can be found here .
The important line is this one :
PRODUCT_POLICY
android.policy_phone
android.policy_mid
Another indicator for a coming Android netbook is that Intel already had the right drivers for MID chips in place .
You can view some parameter information here .
Overall , we ’re impressed with the relative ease of the compilation .
Android code is very “ portable ” and neat .
Mainy observers , specifically Symbian supporters , have opined that Android would have problems because of its “ open source ” nature , leading to “ chaotic code ” and tendency toward desintegration as developers take the OS in different directions .
If true , that could give more controlled OS ’s like Symbian , not to mention the iPhone ’s , an advantage .
Based on our experience with Android , we do n’t see that danger mid-term .
Quite possibly , Android competitor Symbian does not see that problem either , as the Symbian Foundation also decided to go down an open source path .
Pictures and Observations
After some additional work , the normal webkit browser is working fine on our Asus , and so is the music player .
At first , we had problems to get both networking and sound running , though .
The Asus screen size is approximately 5 times bigger than the G1 screen .
An adaption of the screen size was not an issue as Android did the adaption automatically .
The open source version of Android does not include Android Market .
Therefore we have n’t yet downloaded any apps .
In “ Settings , ” we stumbled upon the feature “ Select locale . ”
In it , we noticed that the following translations of Android are under way : Czech , German , English ( Australia , United Kingdom , Singapore , United States ) , Spanish , Japanese , German and Dutch .
Expect speculation on devices launching in these markets soon .
Voting system glitches buttress call for review
Shilonda R. Williams of northwest Houston cast a ballot in the November election .
But it was unclear Thursday whether her votes counted or even whether they should have been included in the final tally .
Williams ' ballot is among hundreds , if not thousands , of ballots that Democratic judicial candidate Goodwille Pierre is eyeing as he pursues a court challenge to his loss — by 230 votes out of 1.1 million cast — to Republican incumbent Joseph " Tad " Halbach .
Pierre 's lawyer , Nile Copeland , said newly discovered glitches in the voting system mean the true outcome of the state district judge race is so cloudy that it merits a review — and that not all legitimate votes in the county were counted .
Halbach 's lawyer , Andy Taylor , said Pierre 's case is doomed because it would be virtually impossible to prove he was the rightful winner or that significant errors in the handling of ballots warrant a new election .
The Harris County Clerk 's Office sent Williams a letter after the November election saying her ballot had been disqualified because there was no record of her voter registration .
But the bipartisan Early Ballot Board , formed to make final decisions on whether thousands of questioned ballots should have been counted , never got to deliver a verdict on whether Williams was missing from the registration list .
The clerk 's office withheld Williams ' ballot from the referees because election workers apparently lost track of the electronic record of the choices she had marked on a voting machine .
Because there was no way to retrieve a record of her votes , it was uncertain Thursday whether her votes were rejected prematurely — or counted when they should not have been .
The ballot board , chaired by Republican retired business executive Jim Harding , rejected more than 5,000 ballots cast by people who were allowed to vote on the condition that questions about their registration status would have to be resolved weeks later .
Each of those voters had to fill out a " provisional ballot affidavit , " swearing he or she was qualified to vote , before getting to touch a voting machine .
But more than 200 affidavits never made it through the system because there was no record of cast votes to go with them .
In some cases , people completed the affidavit without subsequently voting , according to ballot records .
In others , election judges mistakenly gave provisional voters a code that allowed their votes to be recorded permanently , with no way for county workers or the ballot board to decide whether the votes should have been counted .
" My mistake — went through as a regular vote , " an election judge in northwest Houston wrote on a woman 's ballot .
But in Williams ' case and others , there was no ready explanation for why the clerk 's office said it never received a ballot along with the affidavit .
" I think they should have counted everybody 's vote , " said Williams , 36 , who remained convinced Thursday that she had properly registered and was entitled to vote .
" I need to make sure I 'm registered next time and not wait to the last minute . "
Harding , chairman of the bipartisan board , said County Clerk Beverly Kaufman 's office should have forwarded every affidavit anyway so the citizen members could record the fact that some votes apparently were lost .
" If there 's one system in this democracy that you want to work , it 's the voting system , " he said .
But Kaufman 's spokesman , Hector de Leon , said the agency was supposed to forward ballots — and that it made no sense to send along affidavits from voters without ballots .
County records indicate other kinds of apparent flaws in the rejection of the 5,000 or so ballots .
The ballot board rejected a smattering of ballots because they were cast in the wrong precinct , according to the records .
But many were marked by voters during the early voting period , when anyone registered in the county could vote anywhere in the county .
Only on Election Day were votes required to vote in the correct location for their precinct .
" They should have been included , " Harding said .
Pierre 's lawsuit has been assigned to state District Judge Cara Wood of Montgomery County .
No hearing date has been scheduled .

Linux advocacy is caught up in a race to the bottom , and this is understandable , because for those who wish to dethrone Windows , diving to the bottom appears to be the most direct route to the throne .
But appearances are deceiving , and I do n't see any glory in capturing the dumb crown anyway .
The Queen of Twits !
The King of The Clueless !
Er ... no thank you .
A fair bit of so - called advocacy seems to be taking its cues from the poor quality of most Linux news reporting .
I indulged in an enjoyable and cathartic rant against shoddy tech journalism , and one thing I left out , since I tend to ramble on excessively , was why do so many tech journalists pretend to be some mythical average dimwit user when they 're writing about Linux ?
And not just the pros , but all kinds of bloggers and commenters in forums and mailing lists do this too .
This mythical average user , this " Joe Sixpack " , is too stupid to figure out which shoe goes on which foot , let alone run a computer .
And yet this is the target user for whatever Linux version or device they are talking about :
" Ubuntu and OpenSUSE ... provide much if not all of what " Joe Sixpack " wants to do with their personal computer , but the reality is there are significant obstacles that must be overcome .... " " ... unwashed masses ... " " ... the best Linux distribution for the mythical Mr. Joe Sixpack I 've seen yet . "
" Linux will never be ready for the desktop until Joe and Jane Sixpack can use it without ever having to go anywhere near the command line interface , or edit a configuration file " " Joe Sixpack probably could n't find a need for those kind of applications anyway . "
And on and on .... it's condescending and embarrassing .
Rather like the well - meaning but ignorant people who are quite sure they know all about being gay , or non-white , or not raised in privilege ... you get the idea .
They 're sweet and they mean well , but they do n't know squat and really need to close their mouths , and open their eyes and ears .
I swear the next time I read some Linux review or news story where the reporter throws up his or her hands in despair and gives up because " It 's too hard for Joe Sixpack ! " instead of finding answers , or talking to actual users , like a real journalist is supposed to do , I will go to their house and I will slap them silly .
Ok I wo n't , but I sure would like to .
Not to mention it 's fictional -- silly idealistic me , I thought journalists dealt in facts .
I can accept " This seems like a difficult and convoluted way to do this task , but it works and now you know how . "
But instead what we 're getting is not reporting , it 's story - telling , and it's not even good storytelling because it always ends in the same passive - aggressive disguised - as - but - not - really - a - compliment way : " And that , my children , is why , despite being the favorite of zealots everywhere , Linux will never succeed ! "
And the crocodile tears flow .
Quit Apologizing !
All of this apologetic crud makes me very grumpy .
It 's like Linux has low self - esteem and is constantly fishing for compliments .
" Oh I know I have all these rough edges and you 'll probably hate me .
But I have Compiz bling if that makes any difference .
And I 'm free , as in no cost !
I wo n't bore you with nonsense about freedom because what you want to hear is free and easy !
If that matters ... no , I guess not , you still hate me .
It 's OK , I understand . "
Elvis in an Oldsmobile !
Repeat after me : Linux has nothing to apologize for .
Here is a nice bullet - pointed list to drive this point home :
Frequent incremental releases
Continual improvements
Dominates super - computing
Dominates on the server
Dominates the embedded realm
Dominates in real innovation
Dominates in flexibility and customizability
Dominates in user - friendliness
Does not fuel the World Wide Botnet
Genuine innovation comes from Linux and FOSS
Bigger on the desktop than it is given credit for
Of course there is much more and you 're welcome to add to it .
And as much as I hate to say this , because it 's self - evident , but I might as well head off the nitpickers : duh Linux is not perfect , and duh pointing out genuine flaws is not being a traitor to the cause .
Being " wrong for Joe Sixpack " is not a flaw , it 's the FUDdiest of strawmen .
Effective advocacy , teaching , and reporting are all closely related , no matter what the subject matter is -- close mouth , open eyes and ears , and give your audience credit for having a brain .
Linux does n't need to be pumped up and trumped up , and it does n't need apologies -- the plain truth is plenty fine .
Gold has been on a tear lately .
Indeed , gold was the only commodity that did not break its long term trendline during the massive commodities correction starting summer of 2008 .
Gold Monthly Chart
Click on any chart in this post to see a sharper image .
Many have not yet noticed , but recent strength in gold comes at a time of increasing strength in the dollar as well .
Correlation between gold and the dollar has been near perfect since January 26 , and more correlated than normal for quite some time .
Gold Daily Chart
US $ Index Daily Chart
The above two charts show a very strong positive correlation between the US $ index and the price of gold .
A near perfect inverse correlation to gold can be seen by looking at a chart of the Euro vs. the US $ .
US $ vs. Euro Daily Chart
Many claim that gold is rising because of inflation .
That argument , repeated daily , simply does not stand up under any scrutiny .
Gold 1980 - Present
Gold fell from $ 850 to $ 250 over 20 years yet there was inflation , every step of the way .
A more convincing theory , backed up in practice is that gold does well in times of severe credit dislocations .
In 1971 , Nixon Closed The Gold Window making the dollar inconvertible to gold and imposed wage and price controls .
Commodity prices and interest rates soared for a decade .
This was a credit event .
The stock market panic in 1929 , culminating in Roosevelt illegally confiscating gold during the Great Depression and devaluing the US dollar , was another credit event that strengthened the price of gold .
A third credit event is happening right in front of our eyes .
This credit event is the insolvency of the world 's banking system , a deflationary event as detailed in Humpty Dumpty On Inflation .
The important point now is that it is not just the US banks that are insolvent , but banks in the UK , and EU as well .
Europe 's New Wave of Toxic Debt
Please consider Europe 's New Wave of Toxic Debt
A decade of heavy borrowing has lofted euro zone debt to $ 11 trillion , and it 's starting to come due just when companies are strapped for cash .
More toxic debt soon could come crashing through the global financial system .
The surprising source : Europe Inc. Once- stodgy Old World companies , from cement makers to phone operators to chemical companies , went on an unprecedented borrowing spree over the past decade that has left them up to their necks in debt .
Corporate debt in the euro zone stands at more than $ 11 trillion , equaling some 95 % of the region 's economy , vs. only 50 % in the U.S .
Hundreds of billions in payments are coming due just as sales are slumping in the global economic crisis .
In better times , companies might have gone to the bank to refinance .
No more .
Bank lending to euro zone companies plunged 40 % last fall as the credit squeeze tightened .
That helps explain why Europeans in January issued $ 159 billion in bonds , the highest level in two years .
But the price is steep .
Average yields on investment - grade European corporate bonds have almost tripled during the past year , even for relatively healthy companies such as Nokia ( NOK ) and German utility group E.ON ( EONGN.DE ) .
The higher cost of servicing debt " will entail a restriction in hiring , wage growth , and investment , " says Gilles Moëc , a London economist with Bank of America ( BAC ) .
" The amount of debt to roll over is huge . "

There ’s no doubt about the fact that ElSemi take his time when it ’s about updating his Sega Model 2 arcade board emulator , but it ’s similarly true that any new Model 2 Emulator update offers such an amount of improvements to give meaning to the time gone - by between a release and another .
Seven months after the last revisions , therefore , the talented Spanish coder has in the past days delivered the 0.9 version of his thoroughbred arcade emulator .
In this case too , likewise to previous versions , the novelties are numerous and all important : even if it remains a work - in - progress and little user - friendly emulator , Model 2 Emulator has achieved a remarkable quality and is able to give a pleasant videogaming experience that furthermore is faithful to the first tridimensional arcades released in the Nineties .
Above all the improvements of release 0.9 is worth highlighting the fixes to TGP graphic coprocessors emulation , thanks to which Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtua Cop 2 are now playable .
Together with the two aforementioned games , Model 2 Emulator 0.9 adds support for Daytona USA ’93 , Daytona USA : GTX 2004 , Rail Chase 2 , Indianapolis 500 and Sega Water Ski , though for the last one with no sound because the dump of the corresponding ROM seems to be broken , as ElSemi himself writes on his site .
Another substantial upgrade involves the Model 2 graphics rendering , that now “ works the same way the real hardware does ” showing on screen the same colors of the original board by using pixel shaders version 2.0 , the minimum requirements for a graphic card that would like to run the new version of the emulator .
Besides a huge amount of bugfixes to the Model 2 components emulation , the graphics and the sound of the platform that brought 3D in the arcades , it has been introduced support for using two mouse at the same time and an option to hide the crosshair in shooters like The House of the Dead .
Considering that ElSemi is one of the most busy mamedevs out there , it ’s no a surprise that the new Model 2 Emulator try to comply in full with the conventions adopted by MAME for romsets names .
As usual , Model 2 Emulator is available for download on the ElSemi website in standard and multi-core versions , while the games ’
ROMs are user ’s own business .
In the end it ’s worth citing that the next version of one of the most advanced 3D emulators out there should n’t delay other 6 - 7 months , seeing that one day after the 0.9 release on the official forum was already appeared the thread “ Model 2 Emulator ‘ 1.0 / 0.10 / 0.91 ’ WIP “ , containing ( in Spanish ) the first changes brought to the post - 0.9 program code .

PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
A day of strikes dubbed " Black Thursday " in France looked more like " Gray Thursday , " with officials reporting a mixed impact across the country .
Commuters wait for a train at a metro station in central Paris on " Black Thursday . "
Union officials said 2.5 million people demonstrated across the country , while the Ministry of the Interior put the number at one million .
No arrests or violence were reported , Paris police said .
In Paris , all but three lines of the Metro subway system were operating Thursday , the RATP transport authority said .
Buses and trains were operating normally with only slight disruptions , the authority said .
Suburban trains lines into and around Paris were badly hit .
At best , only one in five was operating Thursday , operator RER said .
Public transportation workers and other civil servants planned the 36 - hour strike over a range of concerns spurred by the world economic crisis .
Specifically , workers are anxious about a range of problems , including low salaries , poor buying power and job insecurity .
Their collective strike action challenges the way the French government has handled the economic crisis .
Unions complain that the government has spent billions to bail out banks and the auto industry while allowing little of that money to filter down to workers .
Students , teachers and government workers were striking alongside transportation employees .
Under a law introduced last year , schools are required to provide a " minimum service " to ensure that children with nowhere else to go during a strike may still be able to go to school .
The law does n't require that classes take place -- only that caretakers are provided .
Paris municipal authorities said it was difficult for them to ensure a minimum service Thursday because they were not given enough notice for the strike .
City officials said a total of 90,000 children in the capital would be affected in some way .
The strike began at 8 p.m. ( 2 p.m. ET ) Wednesday and is to end at 8 a.m. ( 2 a.m. ET ) Friday .
Union officials plan to meet Monday to consider future strikes , they said .
Hospital and postal workers , bank staffers , air traffic controllers and auto workers also walked off the job .
Air France said it was operating 100 percent of its long - haul flights .
In Paris .
the airline said it suspended 30 percent of its short - and medium - haul flights at Orly airport and 10 percent at Charles de Gaulle as a precaution during the strike .
The national state - owned railway SNCF said traffic was normal on trains from Paris to other European capitals such as London and Zurich .
It said the national high - speed TGV trains were running normally in eastern France , with traffic at 50 percent to 80 percent of normal levels in other parts of the country .

The third pincer can be seen on Ali 's left claw
A mutant crab with three pincers on one claw has been adopted by an aquarium in East Sussex .
The crustacean , named Ali , was caught by a fisherman in Hastings at the weekend , who gave it to the Blue Reef aquarium after noticing the pincer .
The extra appendage , growing from Ali 's left claw , is about 15 cm ( 6in ) long .
Blue Reef curator Daniel Davies said crabs could regenerate injured limbs and claws but in Ali 's case an extra pincer had grown instead .
" We are unsure whether Ali can use this extra section of his claw but knowing how powerful crab claws can be we do n't want to find out the painful way " , he said .
Ali , an edible crab , has been given a special new display at the aquarium .
" It 's very lucky the fisherman realised just how unusual Ali was , otherwise I suspect he would have been heading for the pot , " Mr Davies added .

All Myron Edwards wanted was his stolen dog back .
He got it - but it ended up costing him his life .
On Tuesday , San Francisco police arrested a recent parolee in the slaying of the 40 - year - old Edwards .
They described a tragic chain of events that ended in the recovering addict 's shooting death Saturday afternoon in the Western Addition .
Those events began Feb. 4 , when Edwards ' apartment on Larch Way in the Plaza East public housing development was burglarized .
His big - screen television and other valuables were taken .
Most important for Edwards , his pit bull puppy , Foxy , was gone .
Edwards called police , then went to get some cigarettes .
On the way back , he was confronted and beaten by as many as 15 suspected members of the Eddy Rock gang , apparently for having gone to authorities , investigators say .
Police evidence technicians at his apartment saw Edwards after the beating and asked him to make a police report or point out his attackers .
He refused , and that might have been the end of it .
But that evening , members of the police gang task force raided a residence on the 1200 block of Eddy Street .
They arrested several suspected Eddy Rock gang members and seized drugs .
They also found Edwards ' dog , complete with tag .
" The gang task force called him and gave him back his dog , but they did n't have his big screen or the other stuff they had taken , " said Inspector Mike Johnson of the police homicide detail .
For the next two days , Edwards kept a low profile , figuring the gang might blame him for the police raid that netted his prized dog , investigators say .
In fact , police say , the raid had long been planned , and the burglary at Edwards ' apartment had nothing to do with it .
The management of Plaza East got wind of what happened and offered to move Edwards to a hotel as of Thursday , said police Cmdr. Leroy Lindo .
The next day , Edwards went to the Housing Authority offices on Turk Street and sought to relocate .
The Housing Authority offered him various options to move out that day , Lindo said .
But Edwards decided to stay put .
And the next day , police believe , he tried to resolve the situation on his own .
Johnson said that on Saturday afternoon , Edwards left his apartment to meet a gang member .
In the middle of Eddy and Laguna streets , police say , a gunman fired as many as nine shots , killing him .
To homicide Inspector Robert Lynch , the reason Edwards died is simple .
" He got burglarized and called the police , " the inspector said .
" He got killed because he called the police . "
Investigators say several witnesses saw the shooting .
On Tuesday , police arrested Jonathan Brown , 23 , on murder charges .
Brown had been paroled from state prison Jan. 17 after serving time for a home invasion robbery in Daly City , said Steve Wagstaffe , chief deputy district attorney of San Mateo County .
" He 's our basic stupid guy gets out of prison , wants to be a thug , " Johnson said .
Edwards , a longtime drug addict with a history of property crime , was enrolled in a Walden House drug treatment and job placement program .
In December , he was photographed with his counselor , Lauren Kahn , for a Chronicle story about Walden House 's budget problems .
Kahn said Tuesday that she could not talk about Edwards because of confidentiality rules .
Police said Edwards had been clean for two years after struggling with drug abuse for years .
On Saturday , they said , Edwards - who grew up in the neighborhood - figured he could talk sense to a younger generation .
" He 's an older guy - he 's 40 , " Johnson said .
" These were all kids .
He grew up in the neighborhood .
But it 's not the same neighborhood he grew up in . "
Since his killing , police said , Edwards ' family members have been relocated for their protection .
His dog is with them .
Nintendo create video game that encourages players to LEAVE the house
Computer games and the great outdoors do n't normally go hand in hand .
But Nintendo has come up a new generation of fitness gadget that actually gets gamers off the sofa and out the front door .
Walk With Me , which launches next month , uses an electronic pedometer to measure players ' steps and the makers are hoping this will finally get the nation walking .
At the start of the day users pop the Activity Meter in their pocket or bag and go about their daily routine .
At the end the day players can upload the data onto a handheld console and see just how active they are .
Players can compare their activity to other users and set walking targets
Makers Nintendo found success with the hugely popular Wii Fit , which has seen people of all ages getting into exercise in the comfort of their own homes .
Players using Walk With
Me earn points depending on how far they walk and targets can also be set for the day - the basic setting is 3,000 steps in 24 hours .
For those struggling for motivation , walking unlocks mini games and trivia .
Collected steps can also be used to create images and find out how much electrical energy a day 's worth of walking would have created .
If that is not enough motivation , then maybe thought of losing out to the family pet in a walking race is enough to keep players moving .
Nintendo say that users can compare their activity with family , friends or even your dog .
The walking record is currently held by a dog in Japan .
Robert Saunders of Nintendo said : ' We hope that , like the Wii , this will appeal to people from nine to 95 . '
The Activity Meter uses infra-red technology to transfer all the data onto a Nintendo DS console , which is also needed to play the game .
The company 's Wi-Fi internet connection can also be used to measure your walking with the rest of the world .
Players can post step data to combine it with users in other countries to plot a virtual walk across the solar system .
For those with a strong competitive streak , walking rankings for all users will be updated on a global scale once a week , giving players the chance to see if we really are a nation of couch potatoes .
The game will be launched in Europe next month .
In the UK the company have sold eight million of the £ 100 portable DS consoles used to play the game .
Sales has hit 100 million worldwide .
A Walk with me !
game continues two activity meters that act like pedometers
Director of the National Obesity Forum Dr David Haslam said he has ' misgivings ' about fitness computer games .
He said : ' The risk is that you 're still inside playing on your computer game , but if they 're promoted and used properly they 're OK .
As long as they 're not taking away natural outdoor play .
' Nintendo put the wrong software in some of their consoles and so slim youngsters were being told they were fat .
The software must be child appropriate and the activities have to be child appropriate if they are used for children . '
But a number of Mail Online readers were enthusiastic about the product , saying they intended to buy one .
' My partner and I being hardcore gamers would love this type of thing as it would encourage us to do more exercise , ' Emma from Torquay commented .
Nintendo's brain training games recently came under criticism from researchers who claimed they not improve mental agility .
Researchers found no evidence to support claims that the Nintendo DS console and Dr Kawashima 's bestselling Brain Training game were any better than a simple game of Scrabble tradition pencil - and - paper puzzles .
Alain Lieury , professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes , who tested the consoles on a group of ten - year - olds , says helping children with their homework , watching documentaries , reading and playing games is just as effective , if not better than brain training .
Mark Prigg review ...
Rating :
The success of Nintendo's Wii has shown that turning exercise into a game really can work , and walk with me is an excellent evolution of that idea .
It 's simple to set up , and then it 's just a case of putting the activity meter in your pocket and forgetting about it .
At the end of the day , it 's quite exciting to see how far you 've gone , and anyone with a competitive edge will soon be hooked , particularly if you 're playing against family members .
However , the included games are a little disappointing , and it 's unlikely you 'll return to them after an initial play .
That said , the tracking element of the game alone is more than enough to keep you coming back .
For a parent trying to convince their child to exercise , or anyone who feels they should be doing more , walk with me is an excellent way to make exercise a little more fun .
In a crime that outraged Germany , the 24 - year - old , identified as Ahmad - Sobair O. , killed his sister Morsal on May 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in Hamburg for protection from her brother .
He said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
The case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether Muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central Asian custom of honor killing to Germany .
The term refers to a Muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
However , Muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing Western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
The defense rejected the honor - killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
O. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
A court - appointed psychologist said O. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
Prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
Morsal was stabbed to death in a Hamburg parking lot
Defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
They said O. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
Defense lawyer Thomas Bliwier denounced the " politicking " in Germany over the case .
Witnesses said Morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun - loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
Defendant showed remorse in court
Morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer - counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth - aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
The brother killed Morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that Morsal would become a prostitute .
Just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill Morsal .
" She was my own sister , " he shouted .
German campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
Heidemarie Grobe of the group Terres des Femmes insisted that Morsal 's death fitted the honor - killing pattern .
" It 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" The brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
Terre des Femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in Germany for reasons of supposed honor .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home prices plunged a record 18.2 percent in November from a year earlier as the country ’s housing market remains in the throes of a deep recession , according to an index from Standard & Poor’s .

Prices in 20 metropolitan areas tracked by S&P fell 2.2 percent from October as housing continues to suffer from a huge supply of unsold homes , tighter lending standards and record foreclosures .
The drop in prices on a month - over - month basis was slightly steeper than expectations , based on a Reuters survey of economists .
However , the annual rate of decline for the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller composite index for 20 cities was not as steep as economists had expected .
S&P said its composite index of 10 metropolitan areas also fell 2.2 percent in November from October for a 19.1 percent year - over - year drop , matching the previous month ’s record decline .
Prices in 11 metro areas fell at record rates from a year earlier .
Prices in 14 cities fell more than 10 percent from November 2007 .
“ The free - fall in residential real estate continued through November 2008 , ” David M. Blitzer , Chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor ’s , said in a statement .
“ Since August 2006 , the 10 - city and 20 - city composites have declined every month -- a total of 28 consecutive months , ” he said .
Prices in every region fell more than 1 percent from October .
In eight metro areas , prices fell at a record monthly rate , Blitzer said .
Phoenix and Las Vegas were hardest hit in November , with prices down 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent , respectively .
The two cities also have the worst returns over the one - year period , with prices falling 32.9 percent and 31.6 percent , respectively .
“ Overall , more than half of the metro areas had record annual declines , ” he said .
As of November , average home prices are at similar levels to what they were in the first quarter of 2004 .
From their peak in mid-2006 , the 10 - city index is down 26.6 percent and the 20 - city Composite is down 25.1 percent .
The battered U.S. housing market is critical to the U.S. economy , with a wide - ranging impact from the construction industry to the sale of appliances and furniture .
After hurting growth for multiple quarters , a continued deterioration could prolong a turnaround for the world ’s largest economy , which has been in a recession since late 2007 .
Harley - Davidson is cutting production by up 13 % in 2009
Motorcycle firm Harley - Davidson has secured a $ 600 m ( £ 418 m ) cash injection , including $ 300 m from billionaire investor Warren Buffett .
The funds will help the iconic US firm improve its cash base , after losses in its financing arm saw it post a 58 % fall in profit for October to December .
The other $ 300 m comes from investment group Davis Selected Advisers ( DSA ) , Harley - Davidson 's biggest shareholder .
Harley - Davidson announced last month that it is cutting 1,100 jobs .
This represents more than 12 % of its workforce .
It is also trimming production by up to 13 % this year .
Generous interest
The announcement of the fresh investment saw shares in the Milwaukee - based company rise as much as 23 % .
Mr Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway company and DSA will be paid an annual interest of 15 % for their investment .
It is just the latest big investment made by Mr Buffett , 78 , as the US economic downturn has worsened .
Towards the end of last year he bought $ 5bn of shares in US bank Goldman Sachs , which also needed additional funds to improve its finances .
" Harley 's finance arm needs capital in a highly constrained credit environment , " said Ed Aaron , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets .
" We knew capital would be available at a price . "
An analysis of nearly 16,000 nursing homes reveals for - profit homes are more likely to provide inferior care than their non-profit rivals , according to a USA TODAY examination of the federal government 's first ratings of the homes ' performance .
The new Zagat - like rating system , released today by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , assigns homes one to five stars for quality , staffing and health inspections , plus an overall score .
The scores reflect tens of thousands of inspection records , complaint investigations and quality measures , such as how many nursing staff hours were provided each day to patients , how many patients developed bedsores and how many were placed in restraints .
Much of the data were collected in 2008 .
Acting Medicare Administrator Kerry Weems says offering the data in a simple five - star format should prompt " a national conversation about nursing home quality " and spur homes to improve .
USA TODAY 's analysis of the data found :
• Twenty - seven percent of the USA 's 10,542 for - profit homes were one - star , compared with 13 % of the 4,182 non-profits .
• Nineteen percent of non-profit facilities got five stars , compared with 9 % of for - profits .
Most non-profits are owned by corporations , while about one - fifth are run by faith - based groups .
The USA TODAY analysis is consistent with other research , says Charlene Harrington , professor emeritus of nursing at the University of California - San Francisco and a member of Medicare 's technical advisory committee for the ratings .
Studies show " a lot of the for - profit homes have low staffing , and it shows up in their quality , " she says .
View our searchable database of ranked nursing homes
Thomas Hamilton of Medicare , who led development of the rating system , says agency researchers worked for years to develop their formulaand assembled the advisory panel over the summer to help finalize the ratings .
Results will be updated at least quarterly .
Janet Wells , of the National Citizen Coalition for Nursing Home Reform , a consumer group , says members initially opposed ratings , fearing they would be inaccurate .
Now , she says , her members give the agency " high marks " for helping to distinguish bad homes from good .
" It 's probably going to be most useful at the extremes , " she says .
Nursing home groups say they welcome efforts to spotlight good and bad performers .
But the American Health Care Association , a trade group whose members include for - profit homes , asked Congress in November to urge Medicare to delay release , saying the data were " flawed . "
" The public is accustomed to looking at star ratings for restaurants or hotels , " says Lyn Bentley , the association 's director of regulatory services .
" This is way more complex than that . "
Bentley would not discuss why for - profits tend to score lower than non-profits .
" I do n't think poor quality is acceptable regardless of who provides it , " she said .
Larry Minnix , head of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging , which represents non-profit homes , says the ratings reflect often - subjective information but are still a good idea .
" Our goal is that you should not have to worry that your mother is in a good place , " he says .
LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) -- Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer kicked off the 2009 International Consumer Electronics Show on Wednesday with an impassioned endorsement of PCs and a sneak peek at the company 's future Windows 7 operating system .
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says Windows 7 will make PCs easier to use .
As expected , Ballmer announced that Microsoft is releasing a beta version of Windows 7 , which will be available for download beginning Friday .
The news suggests the world 's largest software maker may be giving up efforts to rehabilitate its often - maligned Vista operating system , which was released worldwide in January 2007 .
" We are on track to deliver the best version of Windows ever , " Ballmer told an audience of several thousand tech professionals and journalists inside a cavernous ballroom at the Venetian hotel .
" We 're working hard to get it right and get it ready . "
Without mentioning the security and compatibility issues that have dogged Vista , Ballmer promised that Windows 7 will make PCs faster and easier to use .
He did n't offer a timetable for its official release , although Windows Vista went on sale more than two years after it was issued in beta form .
Early reviews of Windows 7 , which was leaked to the Internet in beta form in late December , have been positive .

The forthcoming operating system will have touch - screen capability , side - by - side windows for comparison shopping and a " Peek " feature that makes open windows transparent , allowing users to see the icons on their desktop .
" Windows 7 makes it easier to move between the things on your desktop , " said Microsoft group project manager Charlotte Jones , who gave a brief demonstration of the system on the hall 's giant display screens .
Jones said the new system also makes it easier to send files back and forth between home computers .

Ballmer later yielded the stage to Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's entertainment and devices division , who praised the explosive growth of the company 's Xbox Live online gaming community .
Bach also announced forthcoming releases of new versions of Microsoft 's popular " Halo " game series : " Halo Wars , " due Feb. 28 , and " Halo 3 : ODST , " which will ship in the fall .
Watch Bach predict coming trends »
Wednesday 's address marked the energetic Ballmer 's debut as CES keynote pitchman , a job that had been handled for the past decade by Microsoft chairman and industry pioneer Bill Gates .
Ballmer 's presentation came two days after a similar , high - profile keynote at the Macworld show in San Francisco by Apple , Microsoft 's chief rival , and its vice president Philip Schiller , filling in for the ailing Steve Jobs .
Unlike Schiller , Ballmer tackled the struggling economy head - on in his remarks .
He said that although the recession has created " a period of reduced expectations , " the tech companies that push forward now with innovative research will fare better in the long - term than the companies that scale back .
Ballmer said the convergence of screens on computers , TVs and mobile phones is revolutionizing how people communicate with each other .
" Our digital lives will continue to get richer .
There 's really no turning back from the connected world , " he said .
" We 're on the verge of the kind of technological transformation that only happens once every 10 or 15 years . "

As if to prove his point , Ballmer also welcomed onstage program manager Janet Galore , who gave brief demos of some Microsoft product prototypes , including a tabletop - like touch screen and a flexible , wafer - thin digital screen you can roll up like a piece of paper .
In a gentle swipe at Apple , which has gained market share against Microsoft in recent years , Ballmer said the PC remains the best choice for consumers seeking " value and power " in a computer .
" That 's why we say , ' I 'm a PC and proud of it ! " he bellowed -- a reference to a new Microsoft ad campaign that play off similar ads by Apple .

Are you attending CES ?
Ballmer also announced that Microsoft has formed a partnership with Verizon Wireless to add Live Search tools to all Verizon smart phones in the U.S .
He also announced a partnership with Dell , which will soon come loaded with Microsoft 's Windows Live suite of software , and links between Windows Live and the social - networking site , Facebook .
Reaction to the 90 - minute presentation , which also included a performance by Australian musical - comedy trio Tripod , was mixed .
Attendees praised the lively pace of Ballmer 's talk , but wished he had made more news .
" I really loved what I heard tonight .
There 's definitely a lot of things to look forward to , " said Sebastian Mineau , a Montreal - based blogger with MSN Canada .
" It [ Windows 7 ] was n't a big surprise .
But it was still nice to get the confirmation straight from the lion 's mouth . "
" It was very disappointing , " said Ben Sillis , a reporter with ElectricPig , a British tech site .
" CES is supposed to be about new products , new stuff .
And this had all already been leaked .
There was nothing new . "
Some 2,700 exhibitors and 130,000 attendees are in Las Vegas for CES , the nation 's largest consumer electronics trade show .
The event runs through Sunday .

Sea level rise due to global warming will " substantially exceed " official UN projections and could top 150 cm by the end of the century , according to a report from the US Geological Survey on the risks of abrupt climate change .
Such a rise would be catastrophic , seeing hundreds of millions of people affected by flooding .
Many scientists now fear the warming world is on the verge of " tipping points " , in which climate change and its effects accelerate rapidly .
The science is evolving quickly and the new report updates the most recent findings of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which was released in 2007 .
Some observers have called for an update of the science before the UN talks on a global deal on greenhouse gases emissions reach their finale in December 2009 .
The US report considers four scenarios for abrupt change , and delivers bad news on two .
On sea level , the report found models used by the IPCC in 2007 do not take into account recent information on how fast glaciers slide into the oceans , particularly from Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets .
The report says the south western states of the US will enter a " permanent drought state " .
But the risk of the ocean circulation in the Altantic shutting down – freezing the coasts of America and Europe , as in the film The Day After Tomorrow – is rated as low by the report .
It predicts a slowdown of around 25 % to 30 % .
The chance of a catastrophic release of methane from frozen sub -sea stores at high latitudes is also rated low .
The report is part of a series by the US Climate Change Science Program , which collates all US federal research on the subject .
It was presented tonight at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco .
The IPCC predicted that sea level would rise by 28 cm to 42 cm by the end of the century .
, The authors cite a 2007 study by Prof Stephan Rahmstof at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Research which predicted a sea level rise of between 40 cm - 150 cm by 2100 .
But even this much higher estimate will " likely need to be revised upwards " because it does not fully capture the ice flow processes .
Hollywood has run out of novels .
It is now making films out of self - harm books .
He 's Just Not That Into
You opened at the weekend .
It is probably a prequel to Men Are From Mars , Women are from Primark or Think Yourself Anorexic .
It is here to maim us .
The co-author of the book , Greg Behrendt , who once wrote for Sex and the City , explains in 238 pages of hate that there is only one thing you need to know when dating .
It is that your lover does n't want you .
He is trying to escape from you but he does n't want to hurt you or confront you , so he does n't tell you .
But if you read the runes ( and Greg will tell you how ) you will soon realise that he 's just not that into you !
And then you will be free !
To commit suicide !
He 's Just Not That Into
You is a more offensive version of The Rules , the self - help book that advises women to pretend to be dead in order to get married .
The Rules are : never telephone a man ; never be in when he calls ; never speak to him ; wear matching underwear .
This was also going to be made into a film , but there was no rating bloody enough for it .
So what does Greg say ?
You should never ask a man out , he tells us , like an exhumed corpse from 1812 .
Why not ?
" Because we do n't like it , " he says .
Men like to chase .
You should never telephone a man and , if he gives you his number , you must n't call .
Because he is trying to trick you into asking him out .
So he can reject you .
Because - he 's just not that into you !
Greg can't stop saying , " He 's just not that into you ! "
He says it at least five times a page .
He has a kind of misogyny - themed Tourette syndrome , and reading his book is like being repeatedly slapped round the face by Hugh Grant .
Men are never scared of commitment , in Greg 's mind .
Fear of intimacy is an urban myth .
" The only thing he 's scared of , " writes Greg , " and I say this with a lot of love , " - although I think he 's lying - " is how not attracted to you he is . "
If a man is not trying to undress you , he 's not into you .
If he does n't want to marry you in the next 10 minutes , he 's just not that into you .
If your lover is impotent , distant , tired , anxious , busy , brusque , depressed - anything that proclaims him to be a human being , not a Disney hero with cartoon flowers , nice teeth and a 24/7 erection - he 's just not that into you .
So you should instantly dump him , ideally without telling him .
To do that , of course , would be a waste of your time , because you should be moving on to the next man who 's just not that into you .
This is dating for little girls .
Anything less than the childish fantasy of the perfect ever - loving father should be shunned and , because we are indeed those little girls , Greg sets us some homework .
" Write down five reasons you have a good reason to call him ...
Now put your dialling finger away , " he says .
And never be cross when it 's over .
" Always be classy , never be crazy , " says Greg .
He really means - never be angry .
Because angry is n't hot .
And when you 've finally realised that every man you 've ever loved did n't want you , you 'll feel better because you are now in control .
Greg has another mantra for this .
This one is : " Do n't waste the pretty ! "
And what is terrifying - more terrifying than Greg 's worldview - is that it is women who will pay to see this movie .
Misogynists wo n't waste their money .
Can we please scream we 've had enough of the self - help rom-com that maims ?
We are not child women .
We do not need dating homework and pop culture self - hatred .
We do not need to hear that Greg 's just not that into us .
Because if he was , who 'd care ?
( CNN ) --
A group celebrating a birthday shot off fireworks at their table and set fire to a bar in China 's Fujian province , leading to the deaths of 15 people , China 's state - run Xinhua news agency reported .
Another 17 were injured .
The fire happened Saturday at a " Latin- style " bar and restaurant in Changle City at about 11:55 p.m .

He told Xinhua the fire was put out in about 30 minutes and that three of the injured were in critical condition .
Changle City has closed all entertainment facilities in response to the fire .
Saturday was the last day of the weeklong holiday marking the Lunar New Year , which fell on Monday .

From Australia to Asia and Europe to the United States , the message on Wednesday in the latest economic reports was clear : manufacturing continued to slump amid the worst slowdown since the Great Depression .
In the United States on Friday , a crucial measure of manufacturing activity fell to the lowest level in 28 years in December .
The Institute for Supply Management , a trade group of purchasing executives , said its manufacturing index was 32.4 in December , down from 36.2 in November .
“ Manufacturing activity continued to decline at a rapid rate during the month of December , ” said Norbert J. Ore , chairman of the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Business Survey Committee .
This index was at the lowest reading since June 1980 , when it was 30.3 percent .
“ This report indicates that the U.S. economy was on even weaker footing than commonly believed as 2008 came to a close , ” said Joshua Shapiro , chief United States economist at MFR .
“ Moreover , the signal from the export orders index is that the rest of the world is right there with us .
Hardly a signal for economic recovery anytime soon . ”
Just when all the fans around the world thought St - Pierre had dominantly defeated BJ Penn fair and square in UFC 94 , controversy on his victory immediately arised as soon as the fight was over .
Apparently NSAC and some UFC fighters on scene such as Chuck Liddell noticed GSP ’s cornermen applied Vaseline on his shoulders and back in between rounds , so that it made BJ having difficult time utilizing his jiu - jitsu to defend himself or to attempt any submissions .
We ’d seen Kazushi Sakuraba got TKO for the same reason in the past , and few days after the investigation , the fight was ruled “ No Contest ” .
I doubt the same thing will happen to this fight , but I wo n’t be surprised if it turns out the same way .
As a die - hard MMA fan , I only want to watch a clean and fair fight between two of the greatest fighters .
It ’s a shame that the outcome had to end up this way .
I ’m not saying BJ would have won the fight without the grease , but I ’m sure it would n’t have been as one - sided as it seemed .
Whether it was intentional or not by those cornermen , GSP ’s legitimacy is forever tainted .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Giving steroids to children who are wheezing because of viral or other infections does not help , researchers reported on Wednesday .
And an experimental treatment designed to prevent wheezing may be effective , but it seems to pose too many risks to be recommended , according to studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
About one - third of preschool children develop wheezing , which can worry parents .
At least 75 percent outgrow the problem by age 6 .
In the past , doctors have treated it as they would asthma , which is why they often use corticosteroids .
“ It is clear that on the basis of these two studies , current practice must change , ” Dr. Andrew Bush of the Imperial School of Medicine and Royal Brompton Hospital in London wrote in a commentary .
Dr. Jonathan Grigg of Queen Mary University in London and colleagues found that children given five days of the steroid prednisolone stayed just as long in hospital as children given a placebo .
They tested nearly 700 children aged 10 months to 5 years old .
Nor was there any difference in their symptoms over the next seven days , Grigg ’s team reported .
“ If your child is very sick , it does n’t mean you should n’t give oral steroids .
But in the general run of things , for most kids at home or presenting to their doctor with moderate wheezing that does n’t require many days in the hospital , steroids are not going to be of any benefit , ” Grigg said in a telephone interview .
“ I would have loved for steroids to work , ” Grigg added .
However , he said , the result “ does fit into the general perception that preschool wheeze is very different from attacks of allergic asthma in older children and adults . ”
UNNECESSARY TREATMENT
Bush wrote : “ It is disturbing to contemplate how many unnecessary courses of prednisolone have been given over the years , in good faith , because we all assumed that preschool children are little adults .
There is certainly a lesson there for the use of other medications . ”
The second study compared GlaxoSmithKline ’s Flovent , available generically as fluticasone , with a placebo in 129 children aged 1 to 6 years .
At the first sign of nasal congestion , sore throat or other symptoms that might indicate an upper respiratory tract infection , the children were treated twice daily for up to 10 days .
The drug seemed to help , Dr. Francine Ducharme of the Center Hospitalier Universitaire in Montreal and colleagues reported .
While 18 percent of the youngsters in the placebo group needed further treatment with steroid drugs , the rate was 8 percent for those who got Flovent .
But the children who got Flovent tended to grow less -- a tenth of an inch ( one - third of a centimeter ) less over nearly 10 months -- than those getting placebo .
“ There is concern about patients overusing the drugs , ” Ducharme said in a telephone interview .
GlaxoSmithKline , which helped fund the study , released a statement saying that the dose of Flovent was well above the recommended range for treating asthma in children of that age , and noting that the drug is not approved for treating wheezing .
However , the company said , “ these results may help inform future research efforts into viral - induced wheezing . ”

This engine is suitable for any templating ( not only HTML / XML ) , and is minimal ( 40 lines of code ! ) and fast ( all preprocessing is done in " compile time " )
All text between $ { and }$ is considered python code , and is evaluated when the Templite is rendered .
You can escape the ${ delimiter by $ \{ and the }$ delimiter by }\$ .
Emitting output is done with the emit ( ) function , which accepts any number of arguments , converts them to a string , and appends to the output where the template was located .
Security notice : IT 'S NOT SECURE , as the template - generating code is arbitrary python code .
So be sure you do n't just evaluate user - provided Templites , at least not before taking a look at them .
It 's meant to be a light and fast templating engine , for trusted server side code ( generating reports , etc. ) .
The video is brief , just a couple of minutes , but it ’s reality TV as riveting as anything you ’ll ever see .
A man in his mid-50s , affable , articulate , faces the camera and talks a bit about a medical procedure he ’s had .
He holds in his hand what looks like a remote control .
“ I ’ll turn myself off now , ” he says mildly .
The man presses a button on the controller , a beep sounds , and his right arm starts to shake , then to flap violently .
It ’s as if a biological hurricane has engulfed him , or perhaps it ’s that his arm is made of straw and some evil sprite is waving it about .
With effort , the man grasps the malfunctioning right arm with his left hand and slowly , firmly , subdues the commotion , as if he were calming a child in the throes of a temper tantrum .
He ’s breathing hard , and it ’s clear he can’t keep it up much longer .
With an almost desperate gesture , he reaches out for the controller and manages to press the button again .
There ’s a soft beep , and suddenly it ’s over .
He ’s fine .
Look on the bright side :
This ’ll make for one hell of a Slate column once he gets back .
I can only assume they did n’t recognize him , as the opportunity to scalp one of the world ’s foremost atheists surely would have been irresistible .
I dont know if you find this as news worthy or not , but Christopher Hitchens is currently in Beirut sponsored by the same group that owns that crap NOW Lebanon .
He got in a few nights ago and surprisingly went out drinking .
On his way out of the bar he saw an SSNP poster and wrote on it “ Fuck the SSNP ” .
There just happened to be some SSNP thugs near by –most likely asking people for their ID , and most likely to no avail–and saw him write on the poster and kicked his ass .
He is still walking with a limp .
Abu Muqawama says he ’s confirmed the story .
The SSNP is , of course , a Hezbollah ally that advocates a Syrian anschluss of Lebanon ( and Israel , natch ) .
Consider Hitch a minor martyr to the cause of the Cedar Revolution here .
Exit question one : More or less unpleasant than being waterboarded ?
Exit question two : Er , is n’t Ace there with him ?
Has anyone heard from Ace recently ?
Update : Belated exit question three :
Is it time for me to organize a mighty atheist army and lead it on a march to Damascus for justice ?
Yes .
Update : Forbes says Totten was in the mix .
But later that night , three of our “ scoop ” brigade–Jonathan Foreman , Michael Totten and Christopher Hitchens–got involved in a street brawl with some thugs of a Syria - loving skinhead party called the SNPN after Hitchens rather gallantly insulted their swastika flag .
On our way to a meeting with Minister of State Nissib Lahoud , Hitchens showed me the gashed knuckles and bruises suffered during the punch up .
The attackers had apparently come out of nowhere on posh Hamda Street , where they had gone to buy shoes .
“ I was on the ground , ” Hitchens said , “ and getting it in the head . ”
It was a miracle they did n’t pull Kalashnikovs .
Note : I changed the headline to reflect that the attackers were pro-Syrian , but not necessarily Syrian in origin .
Update :
Ace sets the record straight .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have discovered human antibodies that neutralize not only H5N1 bird flu but other strains of influenza as well and say they hope to develop them into lifesaving treatments .

The antibodies -- immune system proteins that attach to invaders such as viruses -- also might be used to protect front - line workers and others at high risk in case a pandemic of flu broke out , the researchers said .
In tests on mice the viruses neutralized several types of
influenza
A viruses , including the H5N1 avian influenza virus , the researchers reported in Sunday ’s issue of the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology .
“ We were surprised and actually delighted to find that these antibodies neutralized a majority of other influenza viruses , including the regular seasonal ( H1N1 strain of ) flu , ” Robert Liddington of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla , California , told reporters in a telephone briefing .
The researchers found the antibodies in a “ library ” of such immune system proteins generated from 57 volunteers at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute affiliated with Harvard Medical School in Boston .
They said it is not clear how common they are in the general population .
Influenza is especially difficult to fight because it cloaks itself in lollipop - shaped proteins called hemagglutinin and neuraminidase , which mutate regularly and give influenza A strains the “ H ” and “ N ” designations in their names .
Vaccines target hemagglutinin , while drugs called neuraminidase inhibitors , including Roche AG ’s Tamiflu and GlaxoSmithKline ’s Relenza , attack neuraminidase .
Because of the mutations , vaccines have to be reformulated every year and the viruses can develop resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors , as they have to older antivirals .
GUMMING UP THE WORKS
The new antibodies attach to a less mutation - prone part of the virus , on the “ stick ” part of the lollipop , the researchers said .
It appears to be similar across various strains .
“ It forms part of a complex molecular machinery with many moving parts , ” Liddington said .
“ All the parts must work perfectly together if the virus is to enter the cell and establish an infection . ”
The antibodies gum up the works , the researchers found by making atomic images of the antibodies attacking the virus .
They hope to use this knowledge to engineer or find other monocolonal antibodies that can neutralize the six strains of flu not affected by this latest discovery -- including the H3N2 strain of seasonal flu now circulating .
Dr. Ruben Donis of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the antibodies , called monoclonal antibodies because they attack one specific target only , protected mice from what should have been a lethal target of H5N1 avian flu virus -- even up to three days later after infection .
“ When we tried to select viruses that were resistant to the activity of these antibodies , we failed , ” Donis told the briefing .
“ We could not get the virus to mutate and escape . ”
Dr. Wayne Marasco of Dana - Farber said it should be straightforward to develop the antibodies as drugs , because they are already used broadly in cancer therapy .
A single injection protects for three weeks .
“ It provides durable immunity , ” Marasco said .
Cancer monoclonal antibodies can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year but Marasco said companies have learned how to make them more cheaply recently .
The National Institutes of Health , which funded the study , has patented the work and will seek a drug company to help make and test the antibodies .

Four weeks after birthing a nationwide Wikipedia edit ban , Britain 's child porn blacklist has led at least one ISP to muzzle the Internet Archive 's Wayback Machine - an 85 billion page web history dating back to 1996 .
According to multiple customers of Demon Internet - now owned by Brit telecom Thus - the London - based ISP is blocking access to all sites stored in the archive .
When they query the Wayback Machine , hoping to retrieve archived pages , customers are met with generic " not found " error pages .
But judging from their urls , these pages are generated by a web filter based on the blacklist compiled by the Internet Watch Foundation , a government - backed organization charged with policing online pornography .
One Demon customer tells us he was unable to visit archived versions of websites run by the BBC , Parliament , the United Nations , the Internet Watch Foundation , Demon Internet , and Thus .
In other words , this customer points out , Thus is blocking its own web history .
" It is nuts , " he says .
His experience is confirmed by other Demon customers posting to a Demon newsgroup here .
We have contacted both Thus and the Internet Watch Foundation , but they did not receive our messages until after UK business hours .
When they respond , we will update this story .
It is unclear why Demon 's IWF filter would block the entire archive .
Presumably , the archive is housing images flagged by the IWF , and in an effort to censor these images , Demon has censored everything .
But it appears the problem does not extend to all ISPs .
One Demon customer says he has no problem accessing the Wayback Machine from his Vodafone mobile internet service .
Another user calls the archive blockage " yet more ' unintended collateral damage ' from the IWF .
Did n't they actually learn anything from their Wikipedia disaster just before Christmas ? "
In early December , under IWF instructions , at least six UK ISPs censored the Wikipedia entry dedicated to Virgin Killer , a mid-1970s record album from German heavy metal band The Scorpions .
The album 's original cover depicts a naked prepubescent girl .
The IWF had received a complaint about the Virgin Killer image , and after deciding the image may violate the UK Protection of Children Act , the British net censor added Wikipedia to a blacklist designed to shield ISPs customers " from inadvertent exposure to a potentially illegal indecent image of a child " .
To block the image , those six ISPs began routing all Wikipedia traffic through a small number of transparent proxy servers , and in a roundabout way this resulted in Wikipedia banning edits from large swathes of the UK .
Because ISPs were squeezing all Wikitraffic through proxies , most editors appeared to be coming from the same IP range .
If Wikipedia admins banned one editor for " vandalizing " the site , they banned untold thousands more .
But days later , after complaints from across the web , the IWF removed Wikpedia from its blacklist .
" The IWF board has today considered [ its previous ] findings and the contextual issues involved in this specific case , and – in the light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability – the decision has been taken to remove this web page from our list , " the net censor said . ®
Update
The IWF has responded to say " We ’re investigating the issue more fully at the moment and will discuss it with Thus to get a better understanding of what has happened . "
The not - for - profit wants to make it clear that " we only add URLs to our list and blocking is implemented by our member companies to ensure only access to specific URLs is blocked . "
Customers of ISPs Be Unlimited and Virgin have also noticed some Internet Archive blocking .
Update 2
The IWF has now said that it has indeed blacklisted images housed by the Internet Archive .
But its guidelines say that blacklisted URLs " are precise web pages " chosen so that " the risk of over blocking or collateral damage is minimised . "
And the organization will not speak for ISPs that seems to be blocking the entire archive ( in some cases ) .
Is the Wayback Machine blocked on your ISP ?
If so , we would love to know .

By MIKE MELIA , SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( AP ) – Army Pvt. Brandon Neely was scared when he took Guantanamo ’s first shackled detainees off a bus .
Told to expect vicious terrorists , he grabbed a trembling , elderly detainee and ground his face into the cement – the first of a range of humiliations he says he participated in and witnessed as the prison was opening for business .
Neely has now come forward in this final year of the detention center ’s existence , saying he wants to publicly air his feelings of guilt and shame about how some soldiers behaved as the military scrambled to handle the first alleged al - Qaida and Taliban members arriving at the isolated U.S. Navy base .
His account , one of the first by a former guard describing abuses at Guantanamo , describes a chaotic time when soldiers lacked clear rules for dealing with detainees who were denied many basic comforts .
He says the circumstances changed quickly once monitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived .
The military says it has gone to great lengths in the seven years since then to ensure the prisoners ’ safe treatment .
“ Our policy is to treat detainees humanely , ” said Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman .
After the Sept. 11 attacks and the swift U.S. military response in Afghanistan , the Bush administration had little time to prepare for the hundreds of prisoners being swept up on the battlefield .
The U.S. Southern Command was given only a few weeks notice before they began arriving at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba – a locale thought to be beyond the reach of U.S. and Cuban law .
The first arrivals were housed in cages that had been used for Haitian migrants almost a decade earlier .
Now President Barack Obama is committed to closing the prison and finding new ways of handling the remaining 245 detainees as well as any future terror suspects .
Human rights groups say his pledge to adhere to long established laws and treaties governing prisoner treatment is essential if the United States hopes to prevent abuses in the future .
“ If Guantanamo has taught us anything , it ’s the importance of abiding by the rule of law , ” said Jennifer Daskal , senior counterterrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch .
Or as Neely put it in an interview with The Associated Press this week , “ The stuff I did and the stuff I saw was just wrong . ”
Neely , a burly Texan who served for a year in Iraq after his six months at Guantanamo , received an honorable discharge last year , with the rank of specialist , and now works as a law enforcement officer in the Houston area .
He is also president of the local chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War .
An urge to tell his story led him to the University of California at Davis ’ Guantanamo Testimonials Project , an effort to document accounts of prisoner abuse .
It includes public statements from three other former guards , but Neely was the first to grant researchers an interview .
He also spoke extensively with the AP .
Testimony from the other guards echoes some of Neely ’s concerns .
One of the other guards , Sean Baker , described in an interview with CBS ' ” 60 Minutes ” how he was beaten and hospitalized by fellow soldiers in a January 2003 training drill in which he wore an orange jumpsuit to play the role of a detainee .
Terry C. Holdbrooks Jr. told the Web site cageprisoners.com in an interview this month that he saw several abuses during his service at Guantanamo in 2003 , including detainees subjected to cold temperatures and loud music , and he later converted to Islam .
Neely , 28 , describes a litany of cruel treatment by his fellow soldiers , including beatings and humiliations he said were intended only to deliver physical or psychological pain .
A spokeswoman for the detention center , Navy Cmdr. Pauline Storum , said she could not comment on “ what one individual may recall ” from seven years ago .
“ Thousands of service members have honorably carried out their duties here in what is an arduous and scrutinized environment , ” she said .
Neely ’s account sheds new light on the early days of Guantanamo , where guards were hastily deployed in January 2002 and were soon confronted by men stumbling out of planes , shackled and wearing blackout goggles .
They were held in chain - link cages and moved to more permanent structures three months later .
The soldiers , many of them still in their teens , had no detailed standard operating procedures and were taught hardly anything about the Geneva Conventions , which provide guidelines for humane treatment of prisoners of war , Neely said , though some learned about them on their own initiative .
“ Most of us who had everyday contact with the detainees were really young , ” he said in the AP telephone interview .
Army Col .
Bill Costello acknowledged that Guantanamo - specific procedures developed over time , but insisted that the guards had strict direction from the start .
“ This was a professional guard force , ” said Costello , who served as a Guantanamo spokesman during its first months and now speaks for the U.S. Southern Command in Miami , which oversees the base .
Only months had passed since the Sept. 11 attacks , and Neely said many of the guards wanted revenge .
Especially before the first Red Cross visit , he said guards were seizing on any apparent infractions to “ get some ” by hurting the detainees .
The soldiers ’ behavior seemed justified at the time , he said , because they were told “ these are the worst terrorists in the world . ”
He said one medic punched a handcuffed prisoner in the face for refusing to swallow a liquid nutritional supplement , and another bragged about cruelly stretching a prisoner ’s torn muscles during what was supposed to be physical therapy treatments .
He said detainees were forced to submit to take showers and defecate into buckets in full view of female soldiers , against Islamic customs .
When a detainee yelled an expletive at a female guard , he said a crew of soldiers beat the man up and held him down so that the woman could repeatedly strike him in the face .
Neely says he feels personally ashamed for how he treated that elderly detainee the first day .
As he recalls it , the man made a movement to resist on his way to his cage , and he responded by shoving the shackled man headfirst to the ground , bruising and scraping his face .
Other soldiers hog - tied him and left him in the sun for hours .
Only later did Neely learn – from another detainee – that the man had jerked away thinking he was about to be executed .
“ I just felt horrible , ” Neely recalled .
Neely grew up in a military family in Huntsville , Texas , and said he initially saw the Army as a career .
He says his experiences led him to see the treatment of detainees and the Iraq invasion as “ morally wrong . ”
He refused to return to active duty when called up from the Inactive Ready Reserves in 2007 and ignored repeated letters threatening penalties .
Neely acknowledged that by talking about his experiences , he also has broken the nondisclosure pledge he signed before leaving Guantanamo .
He also says a lawyer told him the document he signed could not be enforced .
Storum said guards receive “ operational security debriefings ” on their way out of Guantanamo “ so that personnel are mindful of their responsibilities and are made aware of what can be openly discussed in a public forum . ”
Interviews with former guards are rare .
The military allows journalists visiting Guantanamo to interview active - duty guards at the base , but they are hand - picked by the military and speak in the presence of public affairs officers .
Neely said discussing his experience now has helped put it behind him .
“ Speaking out is a good way to deal with this , ” he said .

SOME KEY WACO STORIES
Zero tolerance
Leading European scientists have said that mathematical modelling is key to future breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases including cancer , schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease .
In a science policy briefing published by the European Science Foundation , the scientists set out a detailed strategy for the application of an area called systems biology to medical research .
The aim is to improve early diagnosis , develop new therapies and drugs , and to move to a more personalised style of medicine .
Conventional approaches to biomedicine contain little mathematical description .
Mathematics has not traditionally played a huge part in medical and biological research .
Conventional approaches to the biomedical sciences rely mostly on verbal reasoning rather than mathematical description , and the role of maths has been restricted mainly to the use of statistics in drug testing .
The conventional approach works fine as long as mechanisms with only a small number of components are considered , but in recent decades it has become clear that most diseases involve large and complex networks of interacting agents .
The functioning of a cell , for example , is regulated by a network of genes which communicate via proteins , and diseases like cancer or diabetes are results of disruptions of these communication networks .
Disorders of the central nervous system , including schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease , require an understanding of the vastly complex networks of neurons in the brain .
And while the cellular and neural events implicated in these diseases take place in a matter of seconds or minutes , the progression of the disease itself can take years .
Understanding a disease involves understanding dynamic interactions between many components on different timescales — as the scientists put it in their report , " The spatio - temporal dynamics of the system as a whole are of such complexity that their understanding challenges conventional approaches and makes mathematical modelling a necessity . "
Mathematicians have long been interested in dynamical systems and , especially over the last few decades , have come up with powerful tools to describe complex interactions and networks in crisp and clear mathematical terms .
Systems biology combines these theoretical methods with high - powered computational techniques , and uses them to gain insight into biological processes .
It allows researchers to create routemaps of important networks and mechanisms , and to simulate their behaviour on computers .
Using these computer models , they can discover hidden patterns and perform virtual experiments that would otherwise be unethical , unfeasible or even impossible .
As a result , researchers can gain new insights into the origin and progression of diseases , diagnose them earlier and develop new and more personalised treatments .
In future , mathematical modelling may even provide alternatives to animal testing .
Not just beneficial for humans : the mathematical approach may spare lab animals their ordeal .
Systems biology is a relatively young field , but , as the authors of the report put it , it " has recently shown signs of moving from hype to hope " .
They highlight several successes of the mathematical approach , including a recent virtual model of the human heart , which has resulted in a treatment for chronic angina , and a mathematical model which predicts the response of the HIV virus to combination therapy .
Probably the most famous breakthrough in systems biology came as early as 1952 , when Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used differential equations to describe the nerve impulses that allow an organism to be controlled by a central nervous system .
They were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work .
Looking to the future , the report identifies several areas that particularly lend themselves to the mathematical treatment .
They include aspects of cancer research , inflammatory diseases like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis , as well as diabetes , drug addiction , and even the functioning of the biological clock which regulates our responses to the solar day and is hugely important to all aspects of our health .
A major challenge for the future is the creation of a large database of high - quality quantitative data .
To be realistic , mathematical models need to be based on and tested against real - life biomedical data , but such information is hard to come by .
Small research teams in particular often lack the funds and time to generate it themselves .
The report therefore recommends the creation of interdisciplinary centres housing advanced technologies , for example for DNA sequencing .
The information generated in these centres should then be stored in a standardised format and be accessible to all researchers as a basis for their mathematical models .
But mathematics has more to offer than just the technical tools to cope with dynamical processes or chomp through vast amounts of data .
" Modelling necessitates the statement of explicit hypotheses , " the authors write , " a process which often improves our understanding of the biological system and can uncover critical points where understanding is still poor .
Theoretical thinking and mathematical modelling can [ also ] create new hypotheses that can be tested in the laboratory . "
Systems biology is not only about introducing new techniques to the biomedical sciences , but also about introducing new ways of thinking .
Mathematics is not so much about juggling numbers and equations as it is about spotting the patterns and rules that drive complex processes .
As the population scientist Joel E. Cohen put it , " Mathematics is biology 's next microscope , only better . "

Personal genomics is here to stay .
The science will improve as efforts like the Personal Genome Project amass huge samples , the price of sequencing sinks and biologists come to a better understanding of what genes do and why they vary .
People who have grown up with the democratization of information will not tolerate paternalistic regulations that keep them from their own genomes , and early adopters will explore how this new information can best be used to manage our health .
There are risks of misunderstandings , but there are also risks in much of the flimflam we tolerate in alternative medicine , and in the hunches and folklore that many doctors prefer to evidence - based medicine .
And besides , personal genomics is just too much fun .
At the same time , there is nothing like perusing your genetic data to drive home its limitations as a source of insight into yourself .
What should I make of the nonsensical news that I am “ probably light - skinned ” but have a “ twofold risk of baldness ” ?
These diagnoses , of course , are simply peeled off the data in a study : 40 percent of men with the C version of the rs2180439 SNP are bald , compared with 80 percent of men with the T version , and I have the T .
But something strange happens when you take a number representing the proportion of people in a sample and apply it to a single individual .
The first use of the number is perfectly respectable as an input into a policy that will optimize the costs and benefits of treating a large similar group in a particular way .
But the second use of the number is just plain weird .
Anyone who knows me can confirm that I ’m not 80 percent bald , or even 80 percent likely to be bald ; I ’m 100 percent likely not to be bald .
The most charitable interpretation of the number when applied to me is , “ If you knew nothing else about me , your subjective confidence that I am bald , on a scale of 0 to 10 , should be 8 . ”
But that is a statement about your mental state , not my physical one .
If you learned more clues about me ( like seeing photographs of my father and grandfathers ) , that number would change , while not a hair on my head would be different .
Some mathematicians say that “ the probability of a single event ” is a meaningless concept .
Even when the effect of some gene is indubitable , the sheer complexity of the self will mean that it will not serve as an oracle on what the person will do .
The gene that lets me taste propyl­thiouracil , 23andMe suggests , might make me dislike tonic water , coffee and dark beer .
Unlike the tenuous genes linked to personality or intelligence , this one codes for a single taste - bud receptor , and I do n’t doubt that it lets me taste the bitterness .
So why has n’t it stopped me from enjoying those drinks ?
Presumably it ’s because adults get a sophisticated pleasure from administering controlled doses of aversive stimuli to themselves .
I ’ve acquired a taste for Beck ’s Dark ; others enjoy saunas , rock - climbing , thrillers or dissonant music .
Similarly , why do n’t I conform to type and exploit those fast - twitch muscle fibers ( thanks , ACTN3 genes ! ) in squash or basketball , rather than wasting them on hiking ?
A lack of coordination , a love of the outdoors , an inclination to daydream , all of the above ?
The self is a byzantine bureaucracy , and no gene can push the buttons of behavior by itself .
You can attribute the ability to defy our genotypes to free will , whatever that means , but you can also attribute it to the fact that in a hundred - trillion - synapse human brain , any single influence can be outweighed by the product of all of the others .
Even if personal genomics someday delivers a detailed printout of psychological traits , it will probably not change everything , or even most things .
It will give us deeper insight about the biological causes of individuality , and it may narrow the guesswork in assessing individual cases .
But the issues about self and society that it brings into focus have always been with us .
We have always known that people are liable , to varying degrees , to antisocial temptations and weakness of the will .
We have always known that people should be encouraged to develop the parts of themselves that they can ( “ a man ’s reach should exceed his grasp ” ) but that it ’s foolish to expect that anyone can accomplish anything ( “ a man has got to know his limitations ” ) .
And we know that holding people responsible for their behavior will make it more likely that they behave responsibly .
“ My genes made me do it ” is no better an excuse than “ We ’re depraved on account of we ’re deprived . ”
Many of the dystopian fears raised by personal genomics are simply out of touch with the complex and probabilistic nature of genes .
Forget about the hyperparents who want to implant math genes in their unborn children , the “ Gattaca ” corporations that scan people ’s DNA to assign them to castes , the employers or suitors who hack into your genome to find out what kind of worker or spouse you ’d make .
Let them try ; they ’d be wasting their time .
The real - life examples are almost as futile .
When the connection between the ACTN3 gene and muscle type was discovered , parents and coaches started swabbing the cheeks of children so they could steer the ones with the fast - twitch variant into sprinting and football .
Carl Foster , one of the scientists who uncovered the association , had a better idea : “ Just line them up with their classmates for a race and see which ones are the fastest . ”
Good advice .
The test for a gene can identify one of the contributors to a trait .
A measurement of the trait itself will identify all of them : the other genes ( many or few , discovered or undiscovered , understood or not understood ) , the way they interact , the effects of the environment and the child ’s unique history of developmental quirks .
It ’s our essentialist mind - set that makes the cheek swab feel as if it is somehow a deeper , truer , more authentic test of the child ’s ability .
It ’s not that the mind - set is utterly misguided .
Our genomes truly are a fundamental part of us .
They are what make us human , including the distinctively human ability to learn and create culture .
They account for at least half of what makes us different from our neighbors .
And though we can change both inherited and acquired traits , changing the inherited ones is usually harder .
It is a question of the most perspicuous level of analysis at which to understand a complex phenomenon .
You ca n’t understand the stock market by studying a single trader , or a movie by putting a DVD under a microscope .
The fallacy is not in thinking that the entire genome matters , but in thinking that an individual gene will matter , at least in a way that is large and intelligible enough for us to care about .
So if you are bitten by scientific or personal curiosity and can think in probabilities , by all means enjoy the fruits of personal genomics .
But if you want to know whether you are at risk for high cholesterol , have your cholesterol measured ; if you want to know whether you are good at math , take a math test .
And if you really want to know yourself ( and this will be the test of how much you do ) , consider the suggestion of François La Rochefoucauld : “ Our enemies ’ opinion of us comes closer to the truth than our own . ”

Read the transcript of this Q&A >>
Chris Anderson :
So you were at Davos last week , and the mood was reported as being pretty bleak .
Do you have any fixes for the crisis ?
Bill Gates :
Well , I think it ’s good that the mood was bleak .
You know , we ’re going through a period of years here where a 50 - year credit expansion has moved to contraction .
And there ’s no doubt the U.S. consumer was overspending and to get the consumer balance sheet back , to get the savings rate up you ’re going to have a number of years where aggregate demand is very low .
And people expecting that the government is magically going to change that — if you actually went back to that heavy spending , you ’d just be extending the problem and making it worse when you have to come and deal with it .
So , it was a great meeting where people really had to say : “ How ’s your economy falling apart ? ” “ Oh , that ’s slightly different than the way mine is . ” ( Laughter ) “ What ’s your solution ? ”
And here are different ideas .
But there ’s no doubt we ’ve got three , four years here that are going to be very tough .
I know we ’re going to get past it .
The kind of invention being talked about here is the reason why the economy will go onto a very positive path .
But it was a great checkpoint , and for me it was a chance to say : I hope that the aid for the poorest does n’t get cut because in past economic problems that ’s the first thing that ’s been eliminated .
But now I think we have a broader constituency .
I do n’t think that has to happen this time .
CA : You have conversations all the time with the foundation about these big issues , but your foundation is often the 800 - pound gorilla in the room .
Is there any danger that you almost inadvertently gain a monopoly of ideas and that other people in the room are afraid to tell you what they really think because you ’re so powerful ?
BG : Well , I ’m here , anybody can tell me what they think .
Our foundation is , relative to other foundations , large .
We will spend 3.8 billion this year — about half of that on global health .
If you divide that down and say : okay , tuberculosis gets a couple hundred million , malaria gets a few hundred million — I do n’t think of it as that much , I think geez , I ’d like to have more because they ’re interesting problems .
And we do measure — are we getting others involved ?
In fact , the baseline on infectious diseases or teacher effectiveness — the amount of money that was going into those things before was minuscule .
And I do feel good that we ’ve drawn many other people into these things by working with them , by packaging things , just by sharing the success stories .
We do need a diversity of ideas and we need people to disagree , try different things out and so …
( Laughter )
BG : It ’s fine .
CA : I ’m not distracted , I ’m reading a question .
( Laughter )
There ’s an associate member here , Tyler Donald , who ’s writing from Chester Springs , saying : “ It ’s obvious you ’re doing wonderful things to prevent deaths , you ’re a self - proclaimed optimist .
Another view is that your charity is adding enormously to the problem of overpopulation in the world . ”
Do you have an optimistic solution to that problem ?
BG : Okay , this is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me .
When our foundation first started up , it was focused on reproductive health .
That was the main thing we did because I thought population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face .
You ’ve got to help mothers who want to limit family size , have the tools and education to do that .
That ’s the only thing that really counts .
Well then , I came across articles that showed that the key thing you can do to reduce population growth is actually improve health .
And that sounds paradoxical .
You think :
Okay , better health means more kids not less kids .
Well in fact , what parents are doing is they ’re trying to have two kids survive to adulthood to take care of them .
And so , the more disease burden there is , the more kids they have to have to have that high probability .
So there ’s a perfect correlation , that as you improve health , within a half generation , the population growth rate goes down .
In fact , Hans Rosling , here at this conference in two of my favorite speeches actually showed that unbelievable correlation that population growth has gone down .
Today , where is there high population growth ?
It ’s in the places with the worst health conditions — Northern Nigeria , Northern India …
And so the two problems go exactly hand in hand and if we improve health rapidly we will get the peak population to be as much as a billion below the current expected peak — that is about 8.3 billion versus 9.3 .
( Applause )
CA : Another of our associate members , D. Howard , who ’s writing from New York he says — I like this —
“ Yeah , all the great teachers in my life have been eccentrics with a passion , how can we get a school system to tolerate dotty , humorous people with a lot of opinions , fascinating the pants off the children , without following a strict curriculum but opening minds and challenging kids to think for themselves ? ”
Are those the kind of teachers that your charter school support ?
BG : Well , we need to bring in all the people who can teach well and objectively look if they are teaching well then they should get better rewards .
If they do n’t stay for their pension , they should still have a very good salary .
You know , if they do n’t get a master ’s degree , they should still have a very good salary .
So it should n’t be a system that tries to look at lack of eccentricities as some positive thing .
In fact , if you go into a teacher ’s personnel file today you wo n’t find some deep analysis of their skills .
You ’ll find checklists like : keeps classroom clean .
And I ’ll bet those eccentric guys did n’t get that nice check mark next to keeps classroom clean .
So today ’s system is driving out those kinds of teachers .
CA : So Malcolm Gladwell just published a book , “ Outliers , ” where he has a whole chapter devoted to you .
And he says the traditional view of your huge success as this sort of a brilliant , genius , software coder , determined young man , changing the world through those personal skills is basically wrong and that the way to think of you is as someone who was born in the right place at the right time .
You had these incredible advantages of going to the right school at the right time , getting to computers early and so forth .
What do you make of that ?
( Laughter )
BG : Malcolm interviewed me for that book and it was because he and I agreed about these things that he put that in there .
I mean , he did n’t want to write a book where the person he wrote about said :
Oh , what a bunch of garbage .
It ’s not quite as simple as what you ’ve described .
What the book says is that if you get opportunities , which are partly a matter of luck and partly a matter of skill , those compound .
So , when I was young I got to use computers that was very lucky .
I got to work at a computer company because I was pretty good — these senior people looked at my code and told me :
Nah , that ’s not as good as it can be .
And so I got better .
And then I had another experience where a great developer looked at my code and told me how to do it better .
So it ’s a cycle , where luck and skill come and mess with each other and that ’s what leads to a great — from my point of view — a great outcome .
CA : Bill , you ’ve led this incredible life , where you ’ve changed the lives of so many people around the world , you ’ve been feared by many , you ’ve been regarded as bad Bill , good Bill , I mean — in ten or fifteen years , what words , what would you want written on your tombstone ?
( Laughter )
BG : Well , I hope I ’m alive a lot longer than that .
( Laughter )
Warren Buffet always likes to say that the tombstone should say : check my pulse .
( Laughter )
I do n’t think anyone optimizes for having a good funeral or a nice epitaph .
CA : No , but —
( Applause )
CA : But I ’m serious though , your legacy , you must think about your legacy a bit .
You ’ve already got an incredible legacy in software .
Is that how you want most to be remembered ?
Are you really excited by this philanthropic stuff to the same level or is it kind of a hobby ?
BG : I ’m as engaged in the new work as I ’ve ever been in anything so the same as I was in software but it ’s because of the day - to - day activity and the ambitious goals .
It ’s not about legacy .
It ’s working with smart people , you know , some of the drugs fail .
I was in Nigeria the last three days and polio — we ’ve had a huge setback in polio eradication there .
The cases doubled in the last year and in the North , they do n’t have very good coverage .
It was thrilling to go meet the Sultan of Sokoto and have him say that he ’d get his religious people out to educate the parents that the vaccine really is a good thing .
These are amazing issues , and it ’s fun to work on them .
It ’s also fun when you achieve the ambitious goal .
So , in that sense , it ’s magic in the same way that software was .
CA : Well it certainly feels like the moment where you turned — you decided to turn your incredible success into giving a huge portion of your wealth back to the world — that was actually a big moment for the world and there a lot of people in the room who are also incredibly successful , building businesses and I believe many of them , including me , have been inspired by what you ’ve done .
So thank you so much for coming here today .
BG : Thank you , great .
CA : It was fantastic .

Dozens of secret Bush surveillance , executive power memos found ; Could be made public John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 3 , 2009
Print This Email This Details about more than three dozen secret memoranda written by Bush Administration officials now sit atop a chart created by a public interest reporting group .
The memos track new details about dozens of secret Bush Administration legal positions on torture , detention and warrantless wiretapping .
Meanwhile , Obama 's freshly - confirmed Attorney General Eric Holder told senators that he was open to declassifying White House legal memos if no support for their original classification could be found , signaling a likely showdown with former President George W. Bush over executive privilege .
" The Bush administration 's controversial policies on detentions , interrogations and warrantless wiretapping were underpinned by legal memoranda , " Pro Publica 's Dan Nguyen and Christopher Weaver write .
" While some of those memos have been released ( primarily as a result of ACLU lawsuits ) , the former administration kept far more memos secret than has been previously understood .
At least three dozen by our count . "
Nguyen and Weaver produced the chart .
Propublica was founded in 2007 as a non-profit driven investigative news outlet and is run by a former managing editor from the Wall Street Journal .
The chart lists 40 memos that remain secret , along with identifying the 12 that have been made public .
Click for more
Given the chart , one can find the exact date a memo was written , its author and sometimes short details the authors have gleaned from other sources .
Among the memos ' titles : " Criminal Charges against U.S. terrorists " ; " Options for Interpreting the Geneva Convention " and " Fourth Amendment does n't apply to military operations abroad or in U.S. "
Little is known about the specifics or the resulting effect of the other clandestine briefs .
For example , the effects of the secret Fourth Amendment memo could be stunning .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said in another memo that the White House 's lawyers had concluded that the Fourth Amendment 's protections against warrantless search and seizure do n't apply to the US military -- even when the operations take place on U.S. soil .
Holder told senators in response to questions sent to him before his confirmation hearings that he'd take an aggressive stance with regard to releasing the White House legal opinions his predecessors ' had labeled as secret .
 Once the new Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel is confirmed , I plan to instruct that official to review the OLCs policies relating to publication of its opinions with the [ objective ] of making its opinions available to the maximum extent consistent with sound practice and competing concerns ,  Holder wrote .
Holder 's comments were first noted by Secrecy News ' Steven Aftergood .

Obama plots huge railroad expansion
Railroads made Chicago , and now a Chicago - rich White House wants to return the favor : remaking rail with a huge new federal investment in high - speed passenger trains .
The $ 787.2 billion economic recovery bill — to be signed by President Barack Obama on Tuesday — dedicates $ 8 billion to high - speed rail , most of which was added in the final closed - door bargaining at the instigation of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel .
Advertisement
It ’s a sum that far surpasses anything before attempted in the United States — and more is coming .
Administration officials told Politico that when Obama outlines his 2010 budget next week , it will ask for $ 1 billion more for high - speed rail in each of the next five years .
Yet for all the high stakes , the pieces did n’t fall into place until the end of deliberations on the recovery bill .
And the way in which they did is revealing of the often late - breaking decisions — and politics — that shaped the final package .
As a candidate for president , Obama spoke of high - speed rail as part of his vision of “ rebuilding America . ”
Campaigning in Indiana , he talked of revitalizing the Midwest by connecting cities with faster rail service to relieve congestion and improve energy conservation .
“ The time is right now for us to start thinking about high - speed rail as an alternative to air transportation connecting all these cities , ” he said .
“ And think about what a great project that would be in terms of rebuilding America . ”
But the administration never emphasized high - speed rail when the House Appropriations Committee was writing its bill in January , so no money was included .
The first real request came only days before the Senate Appropriations panel marked up , and the committee had to scramble to find room for $ 2 billion — in part by cutting other Obama priorities .
Last week , Emanuel greatly upped the ante , asking House - Senate negotiators for $ 10 billion for high - speed rail — far more than either bill provided .
“ I put it in there for the president , ” Emanuel said in an interview .
“ The president wanted to have a signature issue in the bill , his commitment for the future . ”
Emanuel himself was excited by the idea , but the decision to wager so much on high - speed rail reflected the fact that other candidates for a signature Obama issue were fading .
Moderate Senate Republicans , whose votes were needed , were resisting the president ’s school construction initiative .
Modernizing the nation ’s electric grid , another White House favorite , seemed to have lost some of its cachet .
High - speed rail sailed through with surprisingly little attention paid to the president ’s role .
The same Maine and Pennsylvania Republican moderates who had criticized Obama ’s school construction initiative were more accepting of the rail funds , since the Northeast corridor has a major stake in more improvements .
To help pay for the added cost , a business tax break — providing a five - year carry back for net operating losses — was narrowed to keep the focus more on smaller firms with receipts of less than $ 15 million .
At the same time , conservative Republicans seemed almost blind to Obama ’s role .
Instead , in their campaign to find pork barrel projects in the stimulus bill , they painted the whole funding as a scheme by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on behalf of Las Vegas interests seeking a rail link to Los Angeles .
“ Sin City to Tomorrow Land ” was one description .
Here is Rep. Candice S. Miller ( R - Mich . ) explaining her vote against the bill Friday despite the benefits to her home state : “ Michigan is a state of about 10 million people , and we are the hardest hit , as I said , by this economy .
And yet we are expected to get approximately $ 7 billion from this bill .
And apparently the Senate majority leader has earmarked $ 8 billion for a rail system from Las Vegas to Los Angeles ?
You have got to be kidding .
You have got to be kidding . ”
In fact , there ’s little evidence that Reid had a decisive role , although he was happy to see his name mentioned for the sake of voters at home .
“ It ’s amazing .
I ’m stunned , ” he said in an interview Friday , hours before the bill passed Congress .
“ I ’m glad I get the credit in Nevada , but this is Obama ’s No. 1 priority .
This is his legacy issue out of this bill , because we need these high - speed corridors .
...
I ’ll take credit but frankly did n’t have much to do with it other than carry forward with what Obama wanted . ”
Big hurdles remain .
Critics already argue that the money is misplaced in a stimulus bill since it will be hard to spend quickly .
Much depends on winning the cooperation of Class 1 freight lines that control many of the rights of way outside the Northeast .
But it is a landmark transportation investment with regional effects in almost every corner of the nation .
Just last October , former President George W. Bush signed a bill authorizing up to $ 1.5 billion for high - speed rail through 2013 .
Obama ’s commitment in the same period will be eight times that .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood is given 60 days to come up with a strategic plan for the funds .
The combination of large capital upfront — followed by annual appropriations — fits the prototype for the infrastructure bank once considered for , but never included in , the recovery bill .
“ High - speed rail is the infrastructure bank , ” said Emanuel , and the legislation gives LaHood discretion to assign “ priority to projects that support the development of intercity high - speed rail service . ”
There is some precedent .
At the height of the New Deal , FDR ’s Public Works Administration played a role in persuading the Pennsylvania Railroad to complete the electrification of its Washington - New York line and finish Philadelphia ’s 30th Street Station .
Today , the government could make capital investments that both benefit freight operations and facilitate high - speed passenger service .
With the drop in freight traffic , the railroads might be more cooperative , although they are sure to want some liability protection for accidents .
Man charged with fraud in scuttling of his own yacht
Felony insurance fraud charges have been filed against a Seattle man who is accused of sinking his own yacht because of “ financial pressure and frustration with the maintenance ” of the vessel , authorities said .
Court documents say that on March 22 , 2008 , Brian A. Lewis , 50 , scuttled the Jubilee in the Puget Sound Bay , and then rowed a borrowed vessel back to shore , CNN reported .
Three days later , Lewis filled an insurance claim with USAA Insurance reporting the Jubilee sank accidentally “ due to unknown causes . ”
Insurance investigators examining the boat found that a 2 - inch hole had been cut into the boat ’s hull and that the bilge system had been damaged .
“ The vessel appeared to have been deliberately sunk , ” authorities said in their probable cause affidavit .
According to court documents , Lewis admitted he intentionally sunk his vessel , saying the financial strain “ caused him extreme anxiety and frustration . ”
Before the sinking , Lewis had attempted to sell the boat at an asking price of $ 28,500 .
Jack Bateman , a broker with Mahina Yachts , remembers the Jubilee as a “ beautiful ” 1967 Chris Craft Cavalier .
He said the Mahina has only seen this type of case one other time in its 30 years of operation .
The next time you have a wedding , make sure your videographer is n't a secret spy for the RIAA or similar copyright group .
This real - life scenario happened to a couple in Spain thanks to the efforts of the Spanish General Society of Authors and Editors ( SGAE ) , a rights group for musicians and artists .
But although the group managed to bust the reception venue for copyright violations , SGAE itself has been fined for violating the privacy of the newlyweds .
The incident originally took place back in 2005 , when SGAE snuck a private detective into the wedding reception acting as a cameraman .
The group had suspected the venue — La Doma restaurant near Seville , Spain — for using music without paying royalties .
Predictably , this series of events have horrified privacy advocates who argue that the couple 's privacy was breached .
As noted by The Sunday Times , however , the issue has come to light recently because SGAE has increased its efforts to catch venues that are avoiding royalty payments , and another , similar case is about to go to court .
SGAE claims that the video was taken by guests .
However , in the case of the La Doma video , a Seville court ruled that it could not be used as evidence of copyright violations because it was " a clear violation of the constitutional rights to a person 's own image . "
Despite this , La Doma was fined € 43,179 for illegally using the music .
La Doma got off lightly compared to the SGAE , which was nicked for € 60,101 for the privacy violations .
So the SGAE 's copyright enforcement cost it nearly € 18,000 — not including court costs .
SGAE apparently does n't feel that it has done anything wrong , and apparently plans to continue crashing weddings in order to catch venues in the act ( and maybe sneak a slice or two of cake in the process ) .
" Using private detectives to investigate fraud is common .
We will carry on doing it , " SGAE director Pedro Farre told the Times .
On the other hand , with cameramen being fined upwards of US $ 86,000 , SGAE may soon find itself hard - up for volunteers to carry out its dirty deeds .

BELIEVE the hype , and America 's planned missile - defence bases in Poland and the Czech Republic risked starting a new cold war .
The Russians , claiming that they were intolerably provocative , even threatened to station new short - range missiles in Kaliningrad and to target their existing nuclear warheads at Europe .
Many west European countries thought the whole affair epitomised both the Bush administration 's clumsy foreign policy and the destructive paranoia of the ex-communist countries in Europe 's east .
Now things are looking different .
Barack Obama criticised the waste of money on “ unproven ” missile - defence technology during his presidential campaign .
At the forthcoming Munich security conference , the Americans are expected to announce a review of the whole scheme .
That could take a long time .
For their part , the Russians said semi-officially this week that they would halt the planned deployment of the short - range missiles to Kaliningrad ( although they are also pressing Belarus to accept new rocket bases ) .
On the surface , all of this sounds like good news .
America hopes that Russia will come to see the missile shield as a joint project against Iran .
Poland has removed a sticking - point by saying privately that it is willing to accept “ intrusive ” Russian monitoring of the base when it is built .
Previously it had been twitchy about Russian snooping .
The new administration 's willingness to talk about arms control helps as well .
The main treaty dealing with long - range nuclear weapons , Start - 1 , expires in December .
The Bush administration seemed not to care , which stoked the Russians ' feeling that they were being ignored .
With a decaying arsenal of nuclear warheads , and a shrinking number of ways of launching them , the Kremlin has a bigger interest in talking about cuts .
So if Russia wants a deal on missile defence , one may be possible .
But what if it does n't ?
American officials think the Kremlin 's complaints about the scheme reflected a wish to pick a fight over Western influence in eastern Europe .
Contrary to popular myth , the previous administration tried hard ( albeit unsuccessfully ) to present missile defences as a matter of common interest .
Nobody on the Russian side could explain how a handful of interceptor rockets in Poland would hamper a nuclear superpower that can launch weapons from anywhere on the planet .
America is now committed to boosting Poland 's defences .
The paradox is that Russia complained loudly about something that did not matter , but by doing so it has got America to do something that does : beef up its security relationship with Poland .
This will include more training and equipment ( including such sought - after kit as armoured Humvees ) as well as high - tech air - defence systems for Warsaw .
Even if missile defences are delayed , officials say , these promises will be kept .
A big theme for the Obama administration is treating its allies better .
The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim is close to a deal to pump $ 250 m ( £ 172 m ) into the New York Times 's parent company as the newspaper publisher struggles with a shrinking readership and the imminent expiry of a loan facility .
Slim , who already owns a 6.4 % stake in the New York Times Company , is to get 10 - year notes with warrants convertible into shares .
He could also receive special dividends with a return of up to 10 % , according to a report in the NYT 's own business section .
A dominant player in Mexico 's telecommunications industry , Slim is estimated by Forbes magazine to be the world 's second - richest man with a fortune of $ 60bn , second only to Warren Buffett .
The NYT Company , which also owns the Boston Globe and the Herald Tribune , lost $ 2 m on continuing operations in the third quarter of 2008 , although it made a bottom - line profit after an $ 8.6 m gain on the sale of nine television stations .
Nicknamed the " Grey Lady " , the NYT is struggling with recession - hit advertising and waning sales - its daily circulation dropped by 3.6 % to just over 1 m in the six months to September .
The publisher has two $ 400 m credit facilities , one of which expires in May , prompting speculation about the stability of its finances .
The NYT is negotiating a sale and leaseback to borrow $ 225 m against its office near Times Square .
John Morton , a newspaper analyst , said the level of return reportedly offered to Slim was significant : " The fact that there 's interest in borrowing money at a very substantial interest rate indicates that they 're under some stress . "
A spokeswoman for the NYT declined to comment .
But the publishing company reacted angrily last week to a report in the magazine Atlantic Monthly that suggested that it could default on its loans .
" While credit markets remain tight , we have been talking with lenders and , based on our conversations with them , we expect to get the financing to meet our obligations when they come due , " said the NYT in a letter to the Atlantic Monthly .
It added that it was only using $ 400 m out of its total $ 800 m in available credit , and therefore does not need to replace the whole of its expiring facility .
We ’ve all been exposed to different types of character encoding while using the Internet .
Some of these include ASCII , ANSI , Latin - 1 , ISO 8859 - 1 , Unicode , UTF - 7 , UTF - 8 , UCS - 2 , URL - encoding , etc .
There are a lot of them , and for many it ’s very difficult to remember the differences between these standards , and when to use one vs. the other .
So let ’s fix that .
Permanently .
Here , now , on one page .
Encoding is simply the process of transforming information from one format into another .
It ’s not magic , it ’s not hard , and having a good understanding of the topic will help you a lot in the IT field .
In this study piece I ’ll be covering both the underlying concepts as well as providing a quick reference for the most commonly used standards .
The best way to quickly grasp the basics of character encoding is to start with how ASCII came to be .
When UNIX and C were being developed there was only a need for unaccented English characters .
As such , ASCII was created so that everything English ( and the unprintable stuff like spaces and linefeeds ) could fit in 127 places , which took up just 7 bits ( 0 - 127 ) .
But since computers were using 8 - bit bytes , various governments and groups started thinking up of things to do with the other 128 places ( 128-255 ) .
The problem is that they did n’t agree on what to do with them , and chaos ensued .
The result was that documents sent from system to system often could not be read because they were using different character standards .
Finally , the IBM ( OEM ) and ANSI ( Microsoft ) systems were created , which defined code pages that consisted of ASCII for the bottom 127 characters and then a given language variation for the top 128 characters .
So code pages 437 ( IBM ) , 737 ( Greek ) , 862 ( Turkish ) , etc. , were all 256 characters each , with ASCII as the first 127 and then their respective language for the other 128 .
This way anyone using the same code page would be able to exchange documents without having his content mangled .
This system of hotswapping code pages limped along until the Internet connected everyone and proved a ) 8 bits are n’t enough , and b ) exchanging text between systems all over the world is going to be the norm , not the exception .
That lead to a fundamental shift in how encoding is accomplished .
That brings us to the following :
It ’s helpful to think of encoding methods as falling into two main categories –the old way and the new way .
The Old Way : Each character has a specific and direct representation on a computer .
The New Way : Each character is a concept , and can be represented in multiple ways .
As mentioned , ASCII is one of the first types of encoding , and it uses the old way .
In other words , ASCII characters are stored in a fixed number of bits in memory - all the time , every time .
So an ASCII “ D ” always looks like this on a computer :
0100 0100
… which is 68 in decimal , and 44 in hex , etc .
The problem with this approach is that it does n’t scale .
8 bits only hold 256 combinations , and while English only has 26 characters in its alphabet ( 52 for capitals ) , you still need to add symbols , numbers , non-printable characters , etc .
And that ’s just English .
Once you start adding all the other languages , many of which use accented and other special types of characters , 256 becomes a very low number .
The newer , better solution is to not map characters directly at all , and to instead map them to a very specific conceptual entity which can then be described by a computer in multiple ways ( using more bits / bytes as needed ) .
This is what Unicode does–it maps every letter of every language to a unique number ( called a code point ) , so an upper - case “ D ” in Unicode maps to :
U+0044
This is always the case ( sorry ) regardless of the font used .
One concept ( letter ) to one code point .
So an upper - case “ D ” is always U+0044 , and a lowercase “ d ” is not simply a “ D ” that looks different–it ’s a completely different entity with its own number ( U+0064 ) .
The numbers after the u+ are always in hex .
So now that you have set of individual numbers ( code points ) for characters you can decide how to handle them using a computer .
This is the encoding part , which we ’ll cover below in the standards section .
The key distinction between the old way and the new way is that the old way combined the characters themselves with how they were represented on a computer , whereas the new system decouples these pieces .
So in ASCII , for example , the letter “ D ” is always 7 bits , just like any other English letter , but in Unicode the letter “ D ” is just an idea that can be represented on a computer in a variety of ways .
This difference between the old and new systems is key to understanding character encoding .
EBCDIC , ASCII , and code pages are all examples of this old system of mapping directly to integers that are stored in a fixed way .
Unicode and the Universal Character
Set are examples of the new system that makes a distinction between identity and representation .
Before proceeding we should address the concept of “ plain text ” .
“ Plain Text ” is a misnomer ; it does n’t actually exist .
Talking about “ plain ” text with reference to a computer is like going into a supermarket and asking for “ regular ” food , or asking someone who speaks 200 languages to speak “ normally ” .
In short , the words regular , normal , and “ plain ” are all subjective , and computers do n’t like subjective .
Email and Web Encoding Declarations ( respectively )
The only way to describe how something is encoded to a computer is to tell it what standard to use .
Period .
Always explicitly define encoding in your documents ; it will reduce by a significant margin the number of unexpected outcomes you experience .
Below I give some information on the common character encoding standards .
I ’ll do so in a repeating format that covers history , characteristics , and any references for the standard .
History : ASCII is one of the first computerized character systems in the world ( after EBCDIC ) .
Initially an English - only and non-accented character system used back when the C programming language and UNIX operating systems were being created .
Characteristics :
This is a 7 - bit system ( 0 - 127 ) .
Characters from 0 - 31 are non-printable , and from 32 - 127 are the standard characters that people often mistakenly call “ plain text ” .
Reference : The ASCII Standard ( wikipedia.org ) , ASCII Table .
History : Extended ASCII is something of an informal name .
It really just refers to how various groups handle the top 128 characters above the commonly accepted ASCII .
So any system that ’s compatible with ASCII for the first 0 - 127 characters , but has more above that , is considered “ extended ” ASCII .
Characteristics : Again , there is n’t really a strong definition of what “ extended ” ASCII is since it ’s kind of a misnomer .
Any character system that has content between 128 and 256 in addition to 0 - 127 is considered to be an implementation of extended ASCII .
These include both code pages and Unicode .
Reference : Extended ASCII ( wikipedia.org )
History : IBM Code Pages ( also called OEM Code Pages ) were created by IBM as a solution to everyone using the unused 8th bit in ASCII for their own purposes and causing confusion .
They created a set of code mappings that included standard ASCII as the bottom 128 characters , but then various languages in the top 128 , e.g. Greek , Turkish , Hebrew , etc. IBM code page 437 is the original character set for the IBM PC .
Characteristics : Code Pages contain the full 256 characters available from an 8 - bit system , and include the agreed - upon ASCII at the bottom 127 ( with some occasional variation ) and then the top 128 vary based on the language , as indicated by the name .
So the IBM code page 869 , for example , is Greek in the top half and ASCII in the lower half –making a total of 256 characters .
Reference : IBM Code Page Reference ( ibm.com )
History : The ANSI Code Pages are sets of characters very similar to IBM ’s Code Pages , but were used in Microsoft operating systems .
The name “ ANSI ” is interesting , as it implies that the mappings are standardized by ANSI , but they are n’t .
The name came because ANSI Code Page 1252 was supposedly based on a draft submitted to ANSI , but to this day ANSI has not made any of the “ ANSI ” standards official .
So they ’re best thought of as Microsoft standards .
Characteristics : ANSI Code Pages , like their IBM counterparts , contain the full 256 characters available from an 8 - bit system , and include the agreed - upon ASCII at the bottom 127 ( with some occasional variation ) and then the top 128 vary based on the language , as indicated by the name .
So the ANSI code page 1256 , for example , is Arabic in the top half and ASCII in the lower half –making a total of 256 characters .
Reference : ANSI Code Pages ( wikipedia.org )
History : Unicode is the result of a herculean effort to build a single code mapping ( and encoding ) system able to be used universally around the world .
It was designed to replace code pages , which are various language - specific character mappings of 256 characters each .
The first version of Unicode was launched in 1988 , created by representatives of Xerox and Apple .
Characteristics :
As covered in the concepts section ( I recommend reading that first ) , it ’s important to understand that Unicode separates character mapping from character encoding .
On the mapping side , Unicode maps virtually every letter or symbol , in every language , to a unique code point , each of which is described by a U+ followed by four characters of hex , e.g. the uppercase English letter “ D ” is represented by U+0044 .
Unicode defines 1,114,112 ( 220+216 ) individual code points in this way .
For the encoding side , Unicode has numerous ways of converting these code points into actual bits and bytes on a computer ; these are called Unicode Transformation Formats ( UTFs ) .
You ’ve no doubt come across UTF - 8 in your travels , and that ’s one option .
But UTF - 8 is not the only way you can encode a capital “ D ” ( U+0044 ) in Unicode .
Here ’s a table that shows some alternatives :
unicode.org
The chart above reveals another misconception about Unicode : the “ 8 ” in “ UTF - 8 ” does n’t indicate how many bits a code point gets encoded into .
The final size of the encoded data is based on two things : a ) the code unit size , and b ) the number of code units used .
So the 8 in UTF - 8 stands for the code unit size , not the number of bits that will be used to encode a code point .
unicode.org
Image from : http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
So now we see that UTF - 8 can actually store a code point using between one and four bytes .
I find it helpful to think of the code unit size as the “ granularity level ” , or the “ building block size ” you have available to you .
So with UTF - 16 you can still only have four bytes maximum , but your code unit size is 16 bits , so your minimum number of bytes is two .
As an example of the various ways to encode the same content different ways , here is a chart that shows various ways you can encode English ’s unaccented capital “ D ” .

Reference :
History : The Universal Character Set ( UCS ) is described in ISO / IEC Standard 10646 , and was begun in 1989 .
Since 1991 the Unicode Consortium has worked with ISO to develop The Unicode Standard and ISO / IEC 10646 in parallel .
The character set , character names , and code points of Unicode exactly match UCS ( with very few exceptions ) .
Characteristics :
The UCS standard is basically a sister standard to Unicode ; they are extremely similar .
The differences lie in the fact that UCS is an ISO standard while Unicode is backed by the Unicode Consortium , and Unicode supports a number of additional features beyond UCS , e.g. right - to - left language support .
Again , keep in mind that UCS / Unicode can be used interchangeably in many scenarios .
Here is how their standards map to each other :
UCS to Unicode Mapping
UCS - 2 is an obsolete system that ’s often confused with UTF - 16 .
There is confusion because UCS - 2 always used two ( 2 ) bytes per character , and the original concept for Unicode was two bytes per character as well , but that ’s not the case now .
UTF - 16 has a minimum encoding of two bytes for any code point , but UTF - 16 can use more than 2 bytes per character ( up to four ) because it supports surrogate pairs ( pairs of 16 - bit words ) .
In short , UCS - 2 was a fixed - length encoding scheme with all code points encoding to two bytes , and UTF - 16 is variable - length with two bytes as a minimum .
But because they both had something to do with “ two bytes ” they often get confused .
It ’s a moot point anyway since UCS - 2 is obsolete ; if you need a 16 bit base , always use UTF - 16 .
UCS - 4 is identical , from a character mapping standpoint , to UTF - 32 .
Both are fixed - length encoding schemes that encode every UCS / Unicode code point to 32 bits .
Reference : The Universal Character System ( UCS ) ( ISO 10646 ) ( wikipedia.org )
History : SMTP specifies that data be transmitted in ASCII , and does n’t allow bytes above the standard 0 - 127 range .
The goal of UTF - 7 was to make a system for encoding Unicode characters below 128 in a format that would pass through a classic SMTP implementation without being mangled .
Characteristics : UTF - 7 is a 7 - bit variable - length encoding system .
It ’s called UTF , but it ’s not actually a Unicode standard itself .
It encodes only the characters below 128 ( it only has 7 bits to work with ) by using one of two methods :
For approximately 65 of the ASCII characters UTF - 7 encodes them directly into the ASCII representation .
For the rest it converts the character to UTF - 16 and then performs Modified Base 64 Encoding on them .
From Wikipedia , the actual steps are :
Express the UTF - 16 characters in binary Concatenate the binary sequences Regroup the bits into groups of six
If the last group has less than six , add zeros Replace each group of six bits with a Base64 code
Reference : UTF - 7 ( wikipedia.org )
History : ISO 8859 is an early ISO standard ( before UCS / Unicode ) that attempted to unify code mapping systems .
Characteristics : ISO 8559 is an 8 bit system that groups various alphabets into parts , which are then named 8859 - 1 , 8859 - 2 , etc .
Here ’s how they break down :
Part 1 : Latin - 1 | Western European Part 2 : Latin - 2 | Central European Part 3 : Latin- 3 | South European Part 4 : Latin - 4 | North European Part 5 : Latin-Cyrillic Part 6 : Latin-Arabic Part 7 : Latin-Greek Part 8 : Latin-Hebrew Part 9 : Latin - 5 | Turkish Part 10 : Latin - 6 | Nordic Part 11 : Latin- Thai Part 13 : Latin - 7 | Baltic Rim Part 14 : Latin - 8 | Celtic Part 15 : Latin-9 Part 16 : Latin-10 | South - Eastern European
This standard is pretty much obsoleted by UCS / Unicode .
It ’s like the standard that ISO wishes never happened .
Avoid it when possible and use Unicode instead .
Reference : ISO 8859 ( wikipedia.org )
History : RFC 1738 ( the standard for URLs ) dictates that “ Only alphanumerics [ 0 - 9 a - zA - Z ] , the special characters – $ - _.+!*'( ) , –and reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used unencoded within a URL . ” HTML allows any character in the ISO 8559 - 1 character set , and HTML 4 allows for anything in Unicode .
Characteristics :
As a result of this requirement for URLs many common character sets cannot be used .
All of ASCII ca n’t be used becauase much of it is unprintable .
“ Extended ” ASCII ( 128-256 ) ca n’t be used because it ’s not in the standard ASCII set .
And some characters are simply a bad idea to use because it ’s too easy to confuse them within URLs .
Here ’s a list of these from bloobery ’s excellent page :
Space
Quotes “ ”
Less Than “
Greater Than “ > ”
Pound “ # ”
Curley Braces {}
The Pipe Symbol |
The Backslash
The Carat ^
The Tilde ~
Brackets [ ]
The Command Tick `
For any of these characters listed that ca n’t ( or should n’t be ) be put in a URL natively , the following encoding algorithm must be used to make it properly URL - encoded :
Find the ISO 8859 - 1 code point for the character in question Convert that code point to two characters of hex Append a percent sign ( % ) to the front of the two hex characters
This is why you see so many instances of % 20 in your URLs .
That ’s the URL - encoding for a space .
Reference : The W3C URL Encoding Reference , URL Encoding ( bloobery.com )
Here I ’ll try and address a number of common questions in question / answer format .
If you have the time , however , I suggest you check out the concepts and / or standards sections first .
Think of Unicode and UCS as basically the same when it comes to character mapping .
They almost mirror each other in this regard .
Unicode , however , adds a number of features such as the ability to properly render right - to - left scripts , perform string sorting and comparison , etc .
If ever in doubt you probably want to use Unicode .
The BMP is one of 17 sets of the total Unicode code space .
It is the first one ( plane 0 ) , and has the most character assignments .
Its purpose is to unify the character sets of all previous systems , and to support all writing systems currently being used .
ASCII -> 7 bits
-> 7 bits “ Extended ASCII ” -> 8 bits

Notes
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his Health and Human Services secretary , saying Daschle 's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently than average people .
President Barack Obama is interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday .
Daschle , the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate , withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill .
" I think I screwed up , " Obama said in an interview with CNN 's Anderson Cooper .
" And , I take responsibility for it and we 're going to make sure we fix it so it does n't happen again . "
Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes , calling them an embarrassment .
The series of errors included improperly reporting $ 15,000 in charitable donations , failing to list $ 80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error and not reporting a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate as income .
Watch the president say he made a mistake »
Daschle recently filed amended tax returns , and paid more than $ 140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 - 2007 .

Those tax issues , as well as questions over whether work he did after his stint in the senate amounted to lobbying , gave critics ammunition to question Obama 's call for a culture change in Washington .
" Ultimately , I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom - up politics , " Obama said .
" And I do n't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes . "

Earlier , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted Daschle had decided to withdraw on his own , not as a result of any prodding from the administration .
In a written statement , Daschle acknowledged the political problem he had created for the administration .
Still , Obama insisted the mistake was his .

Evolution has enabled us to walk upright in a locomotive form known as bipedalism .
While this form of motion is quite energy - efficient , it is not what our muscular - skeletal system is best suited for — something that many people with back and / or knee problems can attest to .
Bipedalism evolved in human predecessors somewhere around 6 million years ago , and there are a number of theories as to why bipedalism became the dominant mode of locomotion .
The shift to walking upright occurred before our ancestors ' brains started to grow to anywhere near the size of modern humans , and before they had begun to use rudimentary stone tools .
This change in locomotive methodology brought with it a host of anatomical changes ; our feet , knees , hip , spine , and even our skull all had to change to accommodate this mode of moving .
This week 's edition of Science features a cover article describing the find of some very old hominid footprints .
Dating to around 1.5 million years ago , the series of footprints found at Ileret , Kenya gives anthropologists a clear view of what our ancestors feet looked like at that time , and it turns out they looked quite ... human .
Two surfaces in the Okote Member of the Koobi Fora Formation near Ileret , Kenya were found to contain the fossilized footprints of early hominids .
The upper surface contains three hominid footprint trails — two trails containing two prints , and one containing seven distinct prints .
Five meters below this surface , another set of prints was found in a single trail of two footprints , and a single isolated hominid footprint fossil .
By examining the geological neighborhood of the sedimentary layers that contain the footprints , researchers have been able to determine that the upper prints date to 1.51 to 1.52 million years ago , while the lower set of prints dates to 1.53 million years ago .
These represent the second oldest known set of hominid footprints , the oldest being the 3.75 million year old footprint found by Mary Leakey in Laetoli , Tanzania that is thought to have been made by an Australopithecus afarensis .
Footprints reveal a good deal about how a creature walks — they graphically illustrate the pressure distribution generated during a step or stride .
Under normal walking conditions , there is a highly predictable movement and pressure distribution .
Modern humans begin with our heel making the first contact with the ground ; the pressure is then transferred along the outside of the foot , travels across the ball of our foot , and we finally push off using our hallux — the big toe ( the one that went to market ) .
The Internet has just served its billionth customer .
In December , the total global Internet audience surpassed one billion users , according to Internet traffic measurement firm comScore ( NASDAQ : SCOR ) .
In a new report , the research firm said that the Asia - Pacific region continues to claim the lion 's share , accounting for 41 percent of Internet users worldwide -- about 416 million .
Europe came in second with about 283 million Internet users , accounting for 28 percent of the wired population .
With 185 million users , North America came in third at 18.4 percent , comScore said .
Latin America accounted for 7 percent of total users with 75 million , and the combined Middle East and Africa region together attained 5 percent share , or 49 million .
" Surpassing one billion global users is a significant landmark in the history of the Internet , " Magid Abraham , comScore 's CEO , said in a statement .
" The second billion will be online before we know it , and the third billion will arrive even faster than that . "
Even as the world 's online population continues to grow , the findings also demonstrate the U.S. 's declining share of Internet usership .
That 's in spite of the fact that the U.S. government had a large role in setting up and directing much of the Internet 's early growth -- and still maintains close ties to key Internet authorities today .
Concern over the U.S. 's place in the Internet economy also stemmed from findings that showed that the country is falling behind in affordable broadband .
A report in 2007 claimed that U.S. had slipped to 15th place in per capita broadband adoption , down from fourth place in 2001 .
Such findings have since prompted legislators and policymakers to seek ways to encourage the spread of high - speed Internet to underserved Americans .
Most recently , that 's involved discussion of including funds to encourage broadband rollout in the economic stimulus package now being debated in Congress .
On a country by country basis , China leads with the biggest audience on the planet : comScore counted 180 million users online in the country , representing 18 percent of the total worldwide audience .
The U.S. , with its 16.2 percent share , is in second place with 163 million users .
Japan rounds out the top three with 63 million , or 6 percent share of the Internet population .
The report counted only Internet users 15 years older who logged on from home or work PCs -- so it excluded the growing population of those using the Web via mobile phones .
Top sites on the Internet
comScore also ranked the most popular sites online .
The top Internet site worldwide was search colossus Google , with 778 million visitors , and which reached 77 percent of all Web users .
Right behind was Microsoft 's network of sites , which garnered 647 million visitors and reached 64.2 percent of Web surfers .
Yahoo came in at No. 3 , with 562 million visitors and 55.8 of the worldwide audience .
It was a photo finish between Time Warner 's AOL properties and Wikipedia for the fourth - and fifth - place spots on comScore 's list .
AOL claimed the No. 4 slot with 273 million visitors in December , while Wikipedia received only 22,000 fewer visitors , comScore said .
Facebook dominated in the competitive social networking arena , according to comScore , which said the site grew 127 percent during the past year to claim 222 million visitors in December .
That made it the top social site and seventh most - popular property worldwide .
Obama In Japan
By Israel Shamir
I came to Japan for the preview of Obama 's visit , when the G7 foreign ministers assembled at Hiroshima , led by the US State Secretary John Kerry .
He should apologise , people said .
You do not think Kerry apologised for nuking the city , did you ?
Neither did Obama .
The Americans never apologise , banish the thought .
Love means never having to say you 're sorry , and they are in love with the rest of the world .
Otherwise , why would they screw it so violently and wish to possess so intensely ?

Will the men voting for Mrs Clinton end up in Hell ?
I am not sure .
We know that women who vote for a male candidate have a special place in hell , as the old Jewish feminist lady divined , and she should know .
It is not only Madeleine Albright looks like a creature from hell , she also belongs there , for her justification of murder of half a million Iraqi children , among other deeds .
But what about men who cross the gender divide ?
I would not condemn them .
Such a condemnation would rather undermine and harm Messrs Trump and Sanders , for men have no gender voting pattern .
Men vote for the cause they prefer , and they strongly dislike a suggestion that their vote has been determined by what they are , instead of what they think .

A colossal mass demonstration , well choreographed to the level of ballet but with tens of thousands of participants in the centre of Pyongyang completed and sealed an important and unusual political event in this remote and isolated land of North Korea – the Party Congress .
The demo has been followed by a show , so big that it could not be staged anywhere else .
Magnificient fireworks , twenty thousand men and women dancing with torches in the darkness of Pyongyang night – this show I 'll remember forever .
For the Koreans it was not a show , but a declaration of their loyalty to the state and the leader – or , perhaps , even for them it was just a night dance .
Who knows ?

As the Russian Easter approaches – it will symbolically coincide this year with May Day – it is the right time to speak of a very important recent spiritual event that received too little publicity in the West , but it kept Russia all agog .
This was not an Oscar nomination , after all .
Two old men , heads of two great churches had met on the territory of the third church .
These were Kyril and Francis , the bishops of Moscow and Rome on the last vestige of the communist territory , in Cuba .
They represented two ancient and venerable churches : the Roman Catholic and the Russian Orthodox , separated by a millennium - old schism , and as the ghost , the Communist church was present at this summit .

You have to pay obeisance to Israel if you want to become the US President .
You have to swear your full compliance with Israel 's demands .
You have to run to AIPAC and declare your eternal love of the Jewish state .
This is a truism , like “ Monsieur de la Palisse was alive fifteen minutes before his death ” .
Or so it was until Bernie Sanders turned the tables and changed the rules .
We do not know yet whether his game will succeed and he will be anointed the next President .
We do not know even whether he will snatch the Democrats ' nomination from the teeth of Mme Clinton .
But he already achieved a great victory and toppled the mainstay pillar of the regime .

The massive terrorist attack in Brussels came as a Not So Fast answer to Vladimir Putin 's Mission Accomplished .
It appears the world needs more of Russian intervention in the Middle East if the black killers from the desert are to be stopped .
Luckily , Russia is not in a rush to leave completely .
From what I hear in Syria , the promised withdrawal is rather a figure of speech .
Some Russians are leaving , others are staying .
Yes , I am aware that many of our colleagues , gentlemen of the free press , already explained and justified Putin 's sudden declaration .
They wrote that Putin had said in September the campaign would last till spring , so being a man of his word he had to live up to his promise .
They wrote the Russians had done as much as they could or should , that their mission is indeed accomplished .
( This is odd , for the dreadful Daesh and his awful sister al Nusra are alive and kicking ) .
Others said the Russians are clever to go while going is good , that is before the looming joint Turkish and Saudi invasion of Syria .

The area around the Central Moscow tube stations looks like Aleppo after an air raid .
Ruins , destroyed buildings , bulldozers gathering the shambles .
No , Moscow was not hit by terrorists : this is a planned demolition of hundreds of small and not - too - small shacks erected ( in defiance of planning law ) in the vicinity of tube stations in the notorious Nineties , when the Law was vague and easily bought for ready money .
The biggest of them , the Pyramid on top of Pushkinskaya Station , went down this week .
The municipal workers promptly removed the vestiges of the collapsed constructions , while the erstwhile owners stared in disbelief .

By Israel Shamir
The Russians and their Syrian allies have cut the main supply line of the rebels to the north of Aleppo , the Azaz corridor .
In our last report , we wrote about the Azaz corridor , “ a narrow strip of land connecting Turkey to the rebel forces in Aleppo .
Though it has been narrowed down to four miles in some places , the Syrian [ government ]
Army can't take it , despite the Russian aerial support .
For the success of the whole operation , it is paramount to seize the corridor and cut the supply lines , but there is a heavy political flak and military difficulties .
At the last Lavrov - Kerry meeting , the American State Secretary six times implored his Russian counterpart to keep hands off the Azaz corridor .
The Americans do not want to see Russian victory ; besides , the Turks threaten to invade Syria if the corridor is blocked . ”

God Bless You , America !
By Israel Shamir
New Hampshire is wonderful news .
After many years of frustration , we see the America we would want to bless : an America that rejects the money - making machine of Wall Street and the death - churning machine of Pentagon .
Both leaders of the Presidential race are good — Sanders for the Left and Trump for the Right are great , exactly what is needed , and now let the best man win , for foreigners either of them will do fine .
Both are non-interventionists , both want to fix America rather than interfere overseas .
People rejected the war - mongering candidates of the establishment , and that is what matters .

Moscow Snowbound , Litvinenko Poisoned , and the Syrian War

Indeed , at that time thousands of Russians were queuing in Central Moscow .
The enormous line snaked around in the park , despite frost and snow .
People stood three and four hours , braving winter weather : old ladies in furs and gentlemen in greatcoats , young people in anoraks , all sort of Russians from Moscow and from provinces .
Do you think they were queueing for a fire sale to buy discount products or to change their depreciating roubles for dollars or whatever these desperate people were supposed to desire ?
Nope .

A Cold Summer for Europe
By Israel Shamir
Summer reigns all over Europe , from Greece to Sweden .
Vacations have emptied the offices , and filled the beaches .

But things are not as ever before .
The old continent is sick .
Living is easy , but not for you .
Fish are jumping , and unemployment is high .

International Courts and the Mystery of the Malaysian Airliner

Such is the death of 300 passengers and crew of the Malaysian airliner flight 17 in the crash in Donbass , near Russian - Ukrainian border .

The Fateful Triangle : Russia , Ukraine and the Jews

The erotic reliefs of Hindu temples with their gravity - defying and anatomy - challenging positions have found a new modern competitor in the Ukrainian crisis .
Each party wants to get the Jews on their side , while claiming that the other side is anti-Jewish and a Jewish puppet at once .
This impossible , Kama - Sutraesque position is the result of extremely confusing alliances : the Kiev regime lists devout Jews and fiery antisemites among its mainstays .

Wikileaks Rides East !
By Israel Shamir
A diverse gang of five journalists in their early thirties ride a car through deserts and high mountains of Central Asia .
Amidst breathtaking scenery , they cross impassable tunnels , negotiate steep curves and flocks of sheep on country roads , visit the capitals of new republics that came into being since the fall of the USSR , meet interesting people and discuss freedom of speech and its limits .
A road movie par excellence , it ’s Easy Rider by Wim Wenders , but in a better setting .
Soon we learn that theirs is not a joyride .
These young people had been sent on a quest to far - away lands by the maverick genius of Julian Assange , captive of Ellingham Hall in East Anglia

The Cape of Good Hope
By Israel Shamir First , the good news .
American hegemony is over .
The bully has been subdued .
We cleared the Cape of Good Hope , symbolically speaking , in September 2013 .
With the Syrian crisis , the world has passed a key forking of modern history .
It was touch and go , just as risky as the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 .
The chances for total war were high , as the steely wills of America and Eurasia had crossed in the Eastern Mediterranean .
It will take some time until the realisation of what we ’ve gone through seeps in : it is normal for events of such magnitude .
The turmoil in the US , from the mad car chase in the DC to the shutdown of federal government and possible debt default , are the direct consequences of this event

The French Spring

This year , spring in France is unusually cold and rainy , following on the heels of a frosty and long winter .
Only the last Sunday was different : the sun pushed the clouds away for the first time in months , and immediately the lucid Parisian air warmed up and trees broke out in full bloom .
The French were cheered up after the long , hibernal gloom and went out to the streets to protest – ostensibly , against the new gay marriage and adoption bill that the government is trying to push through Parliament despite popular rejection , but verily against the neoliberal policies of their new government .

Putin against Babies
By Israel Shamir
To the many crimes of President Vladimir Putin , a new one was added last month : kicking babies , sweet , innocent , plump babies -- out of sheer wickedness .
This crime was discussed ad nauseam , until it became a meme which was summed up by the NY Times ’ own Thomas Friedman :
“ When recently confronted with his regime ’s bad behavior , [ Putin ’s ] first instinct was to block American parents from adopting Russian orphans , even though so many of them badly need homes . ”
Surprisingly , in Russia the voices against the new ban are even more shrill .
At recent press conference , no less than eight different Russian journalists badgered President Putin on this one topic , each offering little more than loaded insinuations disguised as questions .
The “ White ” opposition marched in force against the “ Scoundrels ” ( as they describe the supporters of the ban ) and compared Putin to King Herod .

Liberals and Communists Regroup
By Israel Shamir
Many liberals and non-ethnic Russians are deeply suspicious of Navalny .
But their presentation of Navalny as a " new Hitler " is far - fetched .
Blue - eyed , good - looking , a dash of the racist , yes , but not an especially silver - tongued one .
Navalny tried to talk to the demonstrators in December but was catcalled more than once .
His manner was too rude , as if he were talking to a street gang .
Even more odd , when asked for a model state Russia should follow , Navalny said , " Singapore . "
This is an odd choice for a person fighting Putin 's strong - arm style , as Lee Kuan Yew was probably more authoritarian than Putin .
As fond as I am of Singapore street cooking , I can't imagine a less suitable model for a vast multinational ex-empire than the tiny Chinese polis .

Making sense of the Russian elections

Moscow is unusually warm : the temperature refuses to dip below zero degrees Centigrade , the freezing point .
Instead , it is wet and dark .
The sun gets up late and goes to sleep early .
To make matters worse , President Medvedev decided to keep Russia on daylight savings time throughout winter .
To offset this stupid decision , Christmas illumination was turned on a month before the usual time , in order to cheer up the voters .
Now it lights the way for the armoured vans of the riot police sent in to pacify the cheery electorate .

The Vengeance of History ( Russian elections follow - up )
By Israel Shamir
Moscow saw its biggest demo in a decade last Saturday .
It was a feel - good peaceful manifestation of youthful Facebook users , and it was already nicknamed the Likes Parade , as the prospective participants had clicked on “ like ” in response to the call to demonstrate .
The predictions were dire : some expected clashes and bloody martyrdom , others hoped for a conquest of the Kremlin and revolution .
However things went smoothly .
It should serve as a wakeup call to the Putin administration : for too long a time , they banked on their hold on the mainstream media and on the passivity of the people .

James Ball : a Portrait of the Petty Cheat as a Young Man
By Israel Shamir
Cheats and thieves have to prove their moral superiority over their victims in order to justify their crimes .
This is the case with a petty cheat and thief called James Ball .
This young man was a hired hand in the Wikileaks ; he was offered a bribe of a job by the Guardian and he gratefully accepted it , betraying Julian Assange 's trust and stealing all he could put his sweaty hands on .
Since then , he is obsessed with demeaning and debunking Assange : only moral disgrace of the Australian will reduce the burden of the traitor 's guilt .
Unmanning the Man

The defeat of Julian Assange is a defeat for all the men , and a defeat for mankind , promising a bleak future – unless we shall do something about it .
It is not only our freedom but our manhood is at stake .

Caribbean Sea Pirates in Crisis
By Israel Shamir ( A lecture on Economics delivered at Rhodes Forum on October 9 , 2011 )
The crisis peaking in Britain is of a Caribbean - sea - pirate type : long time no trophies , while lifestyle has to be maintained .
Neoliberal policies have undermined the toughest folk on earth , hard - working , prudent , obedient , stiff - upper - lipped red-faced Brits , the people who managed India , burned down the White House and withstood Hitler .
Their backbone – Yorkshire miners and Sheffield steel workers – was broken by their Golders Green grocer - at - large , a.k.a. the Iron Lady .
She folded down the industries , and turned the Isles into a Tortuga - like pirate paradise , a place for financiers to relax , unwind and plan their raids .

The Arab Autumn
By Israel Shamir
The independence of truncated Palestine is not the ideal .
It will not solve the problems of refugees , of separation between the West Bank and Gaza , of discrimination within Israel proper .
But do n’t worry : Mahmud Abbas ’ bid will not create an independent Palestine .
It will get the Palestinian train out of impasse , it will wipe the snide smirk off Netanyahu ’s and Lieberman ’s faces ; it will undermine the US hold on the region .
More importantly , it will support a new dynamic , extremely negative for Israel , even if this straw does not break the proverbial camel ’s back .
Anyway , the Palestinians can’t solve this problem themselves : elimination of the apartheid regime in Israel / Palestine will be effected by the future Caliphate , which is sure to enhance its legitimacy and popularity .

Slavoj Zizek and Freedom Flotilla

Why Palestine is Important
By Israel Shamir
Palestine is important not because it is as beautiful as Tuscany , nor because the Palestinians are suffering , and not even because it is occupied by a Jewish state .
The Jews have been handed Palestine not because they were so smart or so strong or so devoted , but by Imperial design .

The building was bought by the water company in the 1920s
A remote Cumbrian farmhouse , made famous in the 1986 film Withnail and I , is to be sold at auction .
Isolated Sleddale Hall near Shap , will be put up for sale by water giant United Utilities with a starting price of £ 145,000 .
The ramshackle building , known as Uncle Monty 's Cottage in the cult movie , still contains many of the original features used during filming .
It will come under the hammer with Savills on 16 February .
The farmhouse , which has been unoccupied for many years , is almost two miles from the nearest public road and is accessible only via a dirt track .
Family home
It was originally acquired by the Manchester Corporation in the 1920s , which eventually became part of North West Water and then United Utilities .
United Utilities senior land agent , Edward Holt , said : " Sleddale Hall is in one of the quietest parts of the Lake District .
" I hope it is bought by someone who can restore it .
It would make a lovely family home . "
It has long been an interest for fans of the film Withnail and I , which starred Richard E Grant and Paul McGann .
The film tells the story of two out of work actors in the 1960s who venture to the Lakes to escape London only to find themselves hilariously ill - equipped for the bleak conditions they encounter .

He lost everything but went to searching for survivors , videotaping his loss and his search .
Heartbreaking .
Southern California ’s most expensive area , Orange County is not immune from the current economic downturn .
The employment situation is dire across the state with the current unemployment rate spiking to 9.3 % in December from a rate of 8.4 % in November .
The speed of job losses is increasing in a state with a deeply troubled housing situation .
Orange County seemed to be a stronghold in the early stages of the bubble but now is simply another county in California with double - digit declines .
So what is really going on in Orange County ?
How do the job losses look like for the common person on the street here in the sunny OC ?
Much of this is lost in the current statistics jungle where thousands of layoffs are merely aggregated together into one clean and cold percentage .
Yet the numbers do tell us a lot of what is happening .
Orange County has a pool of 1,648,500 workers and last month , lost 107,700 people to unemployment .
The current rate in Orange County is fairing much better than the overall state which is now at a stunning 9.3 % .
The amount of job losses are increasing and so is the velocity .
As the retail numbers point to a minor depression like nothing we have seen since World War II , we are left trying to stem the flow of broken balance sheets .
The unemployment rate has shot up from 5.9 percent in December of 2007 to 9.3 % in December of 2008 for the state .
Keep in mind , looking back at data to 1976 the worst unemployment rate California has had was 11 percent .
Given the way the unemployment numbers are calculated , this is already one of the worst recessions since those that are part - time workers looking for full - time work and those who have given up looking for work are simply not counted in the overall data .
Let us dig deeper into what areas are shedding jobs in Orange County :
* Source : Sacramento Bee
I ’ve sorted by the largest layoff notices .
Much of this data shows the large impact the housing and mortgage industry has here in Orange County .
Keep in mind that mass layoff announcement are made when 50 unemployment insurance claims are made against one company .
I wanted to provide you the above to give you a sense of which companies are cutting back .
But let us sort the data by date to see recent layoff announcements :
Looks like JP Morgan is busy with those layoff announcements .
Recently they have acquired WaMu which has a large presence here in California so these layoffs may have something to do with that integration .
I also have an account with WaMu and I have been getting recent letters telling me that they are soon going to be Chase .
Not sure when they are aiming to complete this renaming .
The way the layoff announcements data is calculated is as follows :
“ Employers must file warning notices when there is a plant closing , layoff or relocation of 50 or more employees within a 30 - day period .
Relocation is defined as a move to a different location more than 100 miles away .
So not every layoff is reflected in the WARN Act filings .
Also , some listings reflect short - term layoffs that are quickly rescinded , as when a retailer moves to a new location and imposes a temporary layoff . ”
So many of the layoff announcements have n’t even happened if you noticed so this will only add additional people to the unemployment lines .
This again reinforces the notion that we will have a profoundly bad housing market in California for years to come , even in areas like Orange County .
The recent median home price in Orange County just broke the $ 400,000 mark and is at $ 397,000 .
Take a look how the above employment situation has affected home prices :
We are miles away from the $ 646,000 price reached on June 2006 .
Just reflect , how do you think this plays out in the community to think that nearly $ 250,000 in equity has vanished into thin air ?
I saw a statistics that the average American retiree only has a $ 50,000 nest egg ( this data came out before the collapse last year when $ 50 trillion in global wealth vanished ) .
So here , we are talking about $ 250,000 gone in slightly over 2 years .
Yet the county is diverse .
Let us look at some data points :
Population : 2,954,771
Households : 976,713
Median Household Income : $ 73,263
So that should give you some perspective .
Let us look at some ratios :
( peak housing price ) / ( $ 73,263 ) = 8.8
( current home price ) / ( 73,263 ) = 5.4
Even with the current price decline , the median home price is still in a bubble .
Keep in mind that wages have been stagnant and as we point out above , many of the jobs that are being cut were high paying mortgage and finance jobs that wo n’t be coming back .
So the median household income may actually start declining in the next few years .
Keep in mind starting February 1st , the governor signed an executive order furloughing thousands of employees which is effectively a 10 % pay cut .
That will pull the median household income even lower .
So how wealthy is Orange County ?
Let us look at the actual income breakdown :
Orange County is a relatively affluent area .
Yet looking at the numbers , you realize that these numbers will be decreasing .
Why ?
This data is from 2007 which is the latest macro data we have yet was at the peak of the housing bubble here in the state .
Even with this in mind , only 9.2 % of household bring in over $ 200,000 a year in a county that had a peak home price of $ 646,000 .
It is highly likely that many of those households in between the $ 100 k and $ 200 k mark were employed in the finance , real estate , and housing industry .
These jobs are gone and many were commission and bonus based .
This is another reason why Chapter 7 bankruptcies are soaring because people simply cannot hang on anymore even in the glamorous OC .
The gig is up and a county so dependent on booming real estate and bubble finance is now taking it on the chin for relying so heavily on one industry .
It is also the case that people here were big spenders and reflect the poor habits of California with little or no savings .
This has left the budget in shambles and will leave many households dealing with the fallout for years to come , even in the OC .

Mono , an open source implementation of .NET runtime , is bringing Microsoft 's development technologies to some unexpected places , including the iPhone , Android , and the Wii .
According to Novell 's lead Mono developer , Miguel de Icaza , several applications in Apple 's App Store are powered by Mono .
This might come as a bit of a surprise to those familiar with Apple 's highly restrictive application inclusion policies , because the company strictly prohibits developers from using interpreted languages and third - party runtime environments — a constraint that largely rules out technologies like .NET and Java .
Static compilation is the special sauce that makes it possible for Mono to run on the iPhone .
Mono allows developers to use ahead - of - time ( AOT ) compilation , which converts .
NET 's common intermediate language ( CIL ) directly to native code at compile time .
This means that the application does n't have to use just - in - time ( JIT ) compilation to generate the native code at runtime .
There are also a few other tricks and Mono features that developers can use to reduce the size of Mono executables and assemblies for deployment in mobile environments .
You can use the Mono linker to shrink the library size , you can omit the JIT and code generation engines from the executables , and you can strip out CIL instructions from the assemblies .
Static compilation makes it possible to build Apple - approved iPhone applications with Mono , but it comes with some limitations .
Generics and dynamically - generated code are currently not supported when AOT compilation is used .
There are a lot of hoops to jump through right now to set up iPhone cross-compilation for Mono , but de Icaza says that developers who want to start now can use Unity , a third - party commercial programming framework for 3D game development that is built on Mono .
Unity supports several platforms , including the iPhone and the Wii , and comes with its own built - in Mono cross-compilation environment .
In a blog post published this week , de Icaza identifies almost 40 applications ( most of which are games ) in Apple 's App Store that are built on Unity and Mono .
He also wrote about My Animal Center , a German game for the Wii that is heavily coded in C# using Unity and Mono .
The iPhone is n't the only hot handset to catch Mono .
A developer has experimentally ported the Mono runtime to the Android - based T - Mobile G1 .
Although this port is only an experimental proof of concept and wo n't be used to deploy applications on the platform any time soon , it has a lot of potential and performs well against Google 's Dalvik runtime in some preliminary benchmarks .
Mono 's robust portability and advanced support for features like static compilation are enabling developers to use it in innovative ways that would n't be possible with Microsoft 's .NET implementation .
This demonstrates the value and flexibility inherent in an open implementation .
One of the 16 illegal immigrants allowed by a federal court to sue an Arizona rancher for stopping them at gunpoint after they sneaked across the U.S. - Mexico border is a convicted felon deported from this country after a 1993 arrest by U.S. authorities on drug charges , court records show .
Gerardo Gonzalez , described in a lawsuit brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund ( MALDEF ) as a 38 - year - old Mexican citizen , was convicted in September 1993 for possession of a controlled substance for sale and ordered deported to his home country .
Gonzalez , whose illegal re-entry after removal under U.S. law would be another felony , is among five women and 11 men detained by Roger Barnett , owner of the Cross Rail Ranch near Douglas , Ariz .
The trial against Mr. Barnett on charges of civil rights violations began last week before U.S. District Court Judge John M. Roll in Tucson and is expected to conclude Friday .
Asked about Gonzalez , MALDEF spokeswoman Laura Rodriguez in Los Angeles said Thursday night that a gag order had been issued in the case and she could not comment .
MALDEF had sought Jan. 6 to preclude questioning , testimony or evidence regarding Gonzalez´s drug conviction and his removal from the U.S. , saying it was “ irrelevant to the factual and legal issues at hand and extremely prejudicial . ”
Attorney Victor A. Rodriquez also sought to exclude at trial the numerous photographs and a videotape depicting vandalism and the transportation of illegal drugs through the Barnetts ´ ranch .
He said the photos and video did not involve any of the plaintiffs in this case .
On Jan. 8 , Judge Roll denied both motions .
The lawsuit seeks $ 32 million for civil rights violations , the infliction of emotional distress and other accusations - $ 1 million actual damages and $ 1 million punitive damages for each of the illegal immigrants .
Also named are Mr. Barnett ’s wife , Barbara , his brother , Donald , and Larry Dever , the sheriff in Cochise County , Ariz . , where the Barnetts live .
The trial is based on a March 7 , 2004 , incident in which Mr. Barnett approached a group of illegal immigrants while carrying a gun and accompanied by his dog .
The lawsuit said the Barnetts “ engaged in a private campaign and have conspired with each other and others to ‘ hunt ’ and detain against their will , and at gunpoint , Latino migrants or presumed migrants such as plaintiffs . ”
It also said Mr. Barnett committed assault and battery , falsely arrested and imprisoned the 16 illegal immigrants , acted negligently , inflicted emotional distress and “ engaged in a conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of their civil rights . ”
But in a statement of facts filed with the court , Mr. Barnett ’s attorney , David T. Hardy , said his client ’s 22,000 - acre ranch is frequently crossed by illegal immigrants and drug smugglers and that Mr. Barnett was checking for damages when his dog started barking and ran off into the desert .
He said Mr. Barnett followed the dog and came across a large group of people “ apparently trying to hide . ”
“ Since drug smugglers are frequently armed , I drew my handgun , ” Mr. Barnett said in an April 18 , 2007 , deposition .
“ I holstered it after assuring myself they were not armed .
I then called Border Patrol on my cell phone , and my wife , Barbara , on my radio , and waited until Border Patrol arrived and took them into custody . ”
A March 2007 deposition of Border Patrol agent Manuel Rodriquez found that after agents ran a records check of those detained on the Barnett ranch , other members of the party had made prior attempts at illegal entry .
Mrs. Barnett said during an April 2007 deposition that her husband would not have seen the 16 illegal immigrants had it not been for the dog .
“ If the dog had n’t gotten out and started barking , we would have never known they were there , ” she said .
In a 2002 interview with The Washington Times , Mr. Barnett , now 64 , said he first started to notice tracks and trash on his ranch in 1998 , and learned later that his property had become a major route for illegal immigrants headed out of Mexico and for northbound drug smugglers .
The ranch sits in what Cochise County , Ariz. , law enforcement authorities call “ the avenue of choice ” for illegal immigration .
“ Thousands of aliens have crossed my property , ” Mr. Barnett said during the interview .
“ There are so many that I can tell you that at times it looks like a slow - motion invasion .
Literally , I feel like the guy with his finger in the dike , and I just don´t think I can hold back the flood . ”
He said intruders on his ranch tore up water pumps , killed calves , destroyed fences and gates , stole trucks and broke into his home .
Some of his cattle have died from ingesting the plastic bottles left behind by the immigrants , he said , adding that he installed a faucet on an 8,000 - gallon water tank so the immigrants would stop damaging the tank to get water .

Last summer , our Web Scout blog profiled a Reddit user who goes by the name ' qgyh2 . '
He 's the top user on the social news website , which gives him a lot of power over what appears there .
Now the mysterious Midland , Mich. , maven , who scours the Web for interesting news bits , is finding himself the subject of news on his hangout and on its rival , Digg .
The Digg post " You think Digg has a Power User problem ? " hit the site 's front page a few days ago , amassing more than 3,200 votes .
The post highlights a screen shot showing that qgyh2 had submitted 10 of the top 18 links in the " environment " category .
Qgyh2 is the author of the " environment " category ( also known as a sub- reddit ) .
That grants him the ability to moderate submissions .
Some users , like the ones in this thread , are upset with the way he monitors for spam .
But qgyh2 said in an e-mail that much of the junk is now filtered automatically .
The " environment " sub - reddit does n't get much traffic , which could explain why one user has such dominance over its top submissions .
Also , it 's one of qgyh2 's favorite haunts .
" It is one of a handful of reddits I typically submit to , " he said .
Reddit user Illah says dominance by individuals is n't much of a problem on the website .
" ' Environment ' is a niche reddit with a limited audience , " he wrote in the thread .
" Most stories have single - digit vote counts . "
But all the attention given to Reddit 's top-user " problem " does n't seem to have taken the pressure off Digg 's top dog .
Andrew Sorcini , a 40 - year - old film editor from Los Angeles who goes by the alias MrBabyMan on Digg , gets plenty of flack for his widespread influence on the website .
Users accuse him of duplicating their story submissions ( an act they equate with stealing ) ; his more popular reputation lets him elevate stories to the front page , leaving the submissions of less - powerful Diggers to languish even if they discovered an interesting item first .
" I think it 's a natural artifact of being successful , " Sorcini wrote in an instant message .
" The best advice I 've been given is to consider flamers [ a nickname for excitable people on the Net ] as Web terrorists .
To address their abuse is to legitimize them , so the best course of action is to ignore them . "
In the end , these top users do n't seem to be gaining anything besides Internet celebrity .
They have n't yet found a way to cash in on their successes .
" I 'm just submitting stuff I like , " Sorcini wrote .
" My wife , on the other hand , wishes there was some way to monetize my ability ! "

3,000 Dead As Cholera Crisis In Zimbabwe Worsens
Over 3,000 Dead As Cholera Crisis In Zimbabwe Worsens , Says UN Health Agency
New York , Jan 28 2009 1:10 PM
The death toll from Zimbabwe ’s worst ever cholera epidemic has climbed to over 3,000 , with more than 57,000 infected by the water - borne disease , the United Nations World Health Organization ( WHO ) reported today .
Some 3,028 people have now died from cholera since the outbreak first hit the besieged southern African country about six months ago , with 57 deaths yesterday alone and 102 the day before .
WHO also recorded 1,579 new cases of the disease yesterday , brining the total number of people infected in Zimbabwe to 57,702 .
Meanwhile , the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) announced that around 500,000 Zimbabweans are set to benefit from its so - called “ Safety Net ” activities that support school - based feeding , people affected by HIV / AIDS and mobile and vulnerable populations .
The school - based programme , comprising 30 per cent of the agency ’s safety net programme , is dependent on the start of the school term , which may be delayed .
WFP 's cholera response has begun in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces , which has reached 12,600 patients and staff to date .
In addition , WFP has established three new partnerships for cholera food support that will support people in seven districts .
The cholera epidemic is just the latest crisis to strike Zimbabwe , which has been faced with a worsening humanitarian situation owing to years of failed harvests , bad governance and hyperinflation , as well as months of political tensions after disputed presidential elections in March involving the incumbent Robert Mugabe and the opposition figure Morgan Tsvangirai .
Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by infection of the intestine .
In five to 10 per cent of cases patients develop severe watery diarrhoea and vomiting from six hours to five days after exposure to the bacterium .
The loss of large amounts of fluids can rapidly lead to severe dehydration and without proper treatment , death can occur within hours .
Those who are malnourished or already have intestinal parasites can be at especially high risk of death .

Obama signals he is n't interested in ' truth commission ' to investigate Bush abuses John Byrne
Published : Monday February 9 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama gave a cool welcome at his Monday night press conference to Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy 's ( D - VT ) call for a " truth commission " to probe alleged abuses under George W. Bush , offering a fresh signal that the new president may not be interested in investigating President Bush .
Obama claimed at the first press conference of his presidency that he had not seen the proposal from Sen .
Leahy and would have a look at it -- " but my general orientation is to say let 's get it right moving forward . "
But " my view is also that nobody is above the law .
And if there are clear instances of wrongdoing , that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen , " Obama said .
Obama 's remarks also come just a few weeks after House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) subpoenaed former Bush White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove to testify about his knowledge in the firing of Bush US Attorneys and the prosecution of a Democratic Alabama governor .
In the subpoena , Conyers invoked Obama and told Rove " it 's time to talk . "
Leahy , meanwhile , compared his proposed panel to South Africa 's post - apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission , stressing that he did not want " to humiliate people " or lay the groundwork for prosecution .
" Rather than vengeance , we need a fair - minded pursuit of what actually happened .
Sometimes the best way to move forward is getting to the truth , finding out what happened , so we can make sure it does not happen again , " said Leahy .
The Vermont senator , who unveiled the proposal in a speech at Georgetown University , said he wanted to chart a middle way between those who want to prosecute Bush - era figures and those who want to wipe the slate clean .
" One path to that goal would be a reconciliation process and truth commission .
We could develop and authorize a person or group of people universally recognized as fair minded , and without axes to grind , " said the senator .
" People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences , not for purposes of constructing criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts , " said Leahy , a frequent Bush critic .
Obama , who has come under heavy pressure from his predecessor 's Republican allies to forswear prosecutions of US intelligence personnel who used controversial interrogation tactics , declared that " generally speaking , I 'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards . "
" I want to pull everybody together , including , by the way , all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush without adequate information , " he said .
With Agence France - Presse
Last week , James Adkisson was sentenced to life in prison .
Adkisson was the right - wing terrorist who went on an armed rampage against the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist church in Knoxville last July , killing two parishioners , Greg McKendry and Linda Kraeger .
He had intended to kill many more , but the people of the congregation , showing uncommon courage and heroism , swiftly subdued and disarmed him and held him until the police arrived .
Adkisson ’s manifesto has just been released ( HT : Orcinus ) , a four - page handwritten document which he had intended to be a suicide note .
His plan was to murder as many people as possible , then wait to be killed by arriving police .
Thanks to the bravery of the UU congregation , he ’ll instead be spending the rest of his life in prison – a far more appropriate fate , in my opinion , and one that will force him to come to terms with what he did rather than taking the coward ’s exit of suicide .
In his manifesto , Adkisson explains why he committed these murders .
The document is a glimpse into the deepest , darkest fringes of the right - wing mind , a worldview consumed by unrelenting hatred and a desire to inflict as much pain as possible on those he views as his enemies :
The worst problem America faces today is liberalism .
They have dumbed down education , they have defined deviancy down .
Liberals have attacked every major institution that made America great .
From the Boy Scouts to the military , from education to religion …
Liberals are evil , they embrace the tenets of Karl Marx , they ’re Marxist , socialist , communists .
… It takes a warped mind to hate America .
It makes me so angry !
I ca n’t live with it anymore !
… Liberals are a pest like termites .
Millions of them .
Each little bite contributes to the downfall of this great nation .
The only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is to kill them in the streets .
Kill them where they gather .
This murderous mentality is an outgrowth of everything that the American right , as a movement , has spent the past several decades cultivating .
One can draw a straight line from political operatives like Lee Atwater and his racist “ Southern Strategy ” or Newt Gingrich ’s 1996 memo urging Republicans to use words like “ corrupt ” , “ sick ” , “ radical ” and “ traitor ” to describe their political opponents , to popular conservative pundits who write books with titles like Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism ( Ann Coulter ) , Deliver Us From Evil : Defeating Terrorism , Despotism , and Liberalism ( Sean Hannity ) , and The Enemy Within : Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools , Faith , and Military ( Michael Savage ) , to internet columnists who proclaim in absolute seriousness that one - half of the American population is composed of traitors and subversives .
And from there , all this accumulated anger and hate trickles down into the right - wing sewers .
It was such a sewer that birthed James Adkisson and filled his mind with the venom that motivated his deeds .
This hatred is not an aberration , but the stock in trade of the American right wing , which has become obsessed with the personal destruction of its enemies .
The hate is n’t confined to a few fringe cranks and lunatics , but is spewed out daily from their most popular and influential think tanks , spokespeople , and political leaders .
And when their violent , eliminationist rhetoric becomes so pervasive – even when conservative leaders accompany it with wink - and - nudge disclaimers that they do n’t really mean for anyone to commit violent acts , of course not – a few unstable people are bound to be tipped over the edge into murderous insanity , and rampages like Adkisson ’s are the inevitable , foreseeable result .
In a very real sense , the leaders of the conservative movement bear partial responsibility for this horror , and the blood of the dead is on their hands .
In a rational world , this event should have been the catalyst for the right - wing movement to realize what they have created and step back from the abyss .
But if the past eight years have shown anything , it ’s that introspection is not their strong suit .
Many sane conservatives have already fled ; as for the rest , they may be too deeply invested in their hate to give it up now .
Worse , now that the Republicans are out of power , the rage and frustration among their supporters will only increase .
Though I very much hope I ’m wrong , I would not be surprised if , over the next few years , the killing in Knoxville turns out to be only the first .
It is becoming clear that Bernanke simply does not get it .
Just as he once thought subprime was contained , and has continued to misread the nature and trajectory of the credit crisis , so too he has said that there is a way out of it that involves little or no cost in terms of growth .
I ’ll be charitable and assume he is deluded rather than being dishonest .
As Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart ’s analysis of financial crises found , every country that experienced a housing / bank crisis of the magnitude of the one we are in has suffered a marked fall in GDP .
As they noted in their paper , “ Is the 2007 U.S. Sub - Prime Financial Crisis So Different ?
An International Historical Comparison “ :
At this juncture , the book is still open on the how the current dislocations in the United States will play out .
The precedent found in the aftermath of other episodes suggests that the strains can be quite severe , depending especially on the initial degree of trauma to the financial system ( and to some extent , the policy response ) .
The average drop in ( real per capita ) output growth is over 2 percent , and it typically takes two years to return to trend .
For the five most catastrophic cases ( which include episodes in Finland , Japan , Norway , Spain and Sweden ) , the drop in annual output growth from peak to trough is over 5 percent , and growth remained well below pre-crisis trend even after three years .
These more catastrophic cases , of course , mark the boundary that policymakers particularly want to avoid .
Note that this paper was presented February 8 , so it does not contain the most recent data .
Unfortunately , their analysis also showed that the US be on an even more extreme trajectory than what they called the “ Big Five ” , the most serious financial crises ,
The housing bubble was more severe ( click to enlarge ) :
The stock market stayed at exaggerated levels longer ( click to enlarge ) :
The current account deficit was ( and is ) vastly worse ( click to enlarge ) :
Yet the US has not taken much a hit as far as output is concerned :
So why has n’t the US suffered more ?
The big reason , as Brad Setser pointed out , is that our foreign creditors continued to lend .
As Tim Duy told us :
Perhaps most importantly , however , is the massive liquidity injections from the rest of the world , or what Brad Setser calls “ the quiet bailout . ”
In the first half of this , global central banks accumulated $ 283.5 billion of Treasuries and Agencies , something around $ 1,000 per capita .
This is real money – I outlined the likely implications in January .
Foreign CBs are happily financing the first US stimulus package ; will they be happy to finance a second ?
Do they have a choice ?
Their accumulation of Agency debt is also keeping the US mortgage market afloat .
Do not underestimate the impact of these foreign capital inflows .
If the rest of the world treated the US like we treated emerging Asia in 1997 - 1998 , the US economy would experience a slowdown commensurate with the magnitude of the financial market crisis .
You can best see the magnitude of the forbearance from this chart , which shows debt to GDP through the end of the first quarter 2008 ( click to enlarge ) .
You can clearly see that it continued to grow on a hyperbolic curve .
Despite the signs of a credit crunch , we had continued to increase rather than reduce our aggregate indebtedness .
As Setser and Duy pointed out , we got a subsidy of $ 1000 a person from our friendly foreign funding sources .
The bailout bill $ 700 billion figure ( which could be larger , since that is the maximum outstanding at any one time ; the real limit is the increase in the debt ceiling ) amounts to $ 2000 a person .
Will our creditors play ball and lend us the money ?
It is n’t at all clear that they will , at least at current interest rates .
They have become decidedly cool on buying agency paper .
The man on the street in Asia and Europe is taken aback by the events of the last two weeks .
Funding the US has become controversial in China , and may be in other major lenders .
And a rise in interest rates would considerably undermine the supposed benefits of the program .
The sorry fact is the US has consumed at an unsustainable level .
We need to reduce consumption and increase savings ( and reducing debt is a form of savings ) .
Reduced consumption means a fall in GDP .
In Britain , which is going through its own credit crunch , the officialdom has said that the public will experience a fall in living standards .
Why are we unwilling to accept the inevitable ?
Indeed , one can argue that our current mess resulted from our refusal to tolerate recessions , our running of an unduly lax monetary policy .
Not only did Greenspan lower the Fed funds rate to 1 % in the wake of the dot - com bust , he kept it low for an unprecedented amount of time .
Some economists have also argued that our monetary policy was too permissive even before that , due to the Fed ’s failure to take account of the deflationary effect of cheap imports .
So what did Bernanke tell Congress today ?
From his prepared remarks :
Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy .
In this regard , the Federal Reserve supports the Treasury ’s proposal to buy illiquid assets from financial institutions .
Purchasing impaired assets will create liquidity and promote price discovery in the markets for these assets , while reducing investor uncertainty about the current value and prospects of financial institutions .
More generally , removing these assets from institutions ’ balance sheets will help to restore confidence in our financial markets and enable banks and other institutions to raise capital and to expand credit to support economic growth .
This is largely rubbish .
As we have reported , the plan makes no sense ( in terms of assisting banks ) unless the Treasury buys assets at above market prices .
Indeed , a Congressional staffer told us that Paulson has said in briefings that that is precisely what they will do .
This will not aid in promoting price discovery .
Quite the reverse .
It establishes a phony bid which will prevent finding out what assets are truly worth and will deter private buyers from bottom - fishing .
Bloomberg reports that Bernanke puts aside his formal testimony and spoke off the cuff :
“ I believe if the credit markets are not functioning , that jobs will be lost , the unemployment rate will rise , more houses will be foreclosed upon , GDP will contract , that the economy will just not be able to recover , ” Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee today .
“ My interest is solely for the strength and recovery of the U.S. economy . ”
The Fed chair seems unable to accept that there are no good outcomes from where are are now , only bad and worse ones .
And his final comment , which suggests that he is not self - interested , is odd , to say the least .
Moreover , even with this magnitude of program , it is n’t clear if the amount purchased will in fact restore confidence .
We still have the massive overhang of credit default swaps .
Bridgewater Associates estimated that banks ( as opposed to securities firms ) would need over $ 500 bilion in new equity to recapitalize themselves and had raised only roughly $ 160 billion .
The amount of recapitalization is the amount of overpayment for assets , not the gross amount of purchases .
Thus if the Treasury overpays by , say , 25 % , that is tantamount to only $ 175 billion of recapitalization , short of what is needed .
We have said before that this program is an inefficient , covert way to recapitalize the financial system .
If I were a foreign central bank , I ’d have a lot more confidence if the US imposed regulatory reform , took over dud banks , got rid of top management , and then did the good bank / bad bank split .
That ’s a model that has worked and could be modified and improved .
But for some unknown , the powers that be are refusing to employ formulas that have worked and prefer their own home - cooked brew .
Update 4:15 PM
It turns out we are in good company .
Bank analyst Meredith Whitney , who has been the most accurate in her cohort in calling the credit crisis , says the bailout bill will do little to help .
From Reuters ( hat tip reader Dwight ) :
When Power.com , a service that lets you access all your social networks through a single site , launched last year , VentureBeat editor Matt Marshall wondered whether it was violating the networks ’ terms of service .
At the time , Power.com chief executive Steve Vachani insisted it was n’t , but it looks like Facebook disagrees :
The social networking company just sued Power.com for breaking anti-spam laws , for violation of the computer fraud and abuse act , and for infringing Facebook ’s copyrights and trademark , among other charges .
You can read the complaint below , via The New York Times , but the crux of Facebook ’s suit is the fact that Power.com asks users for their Facebook login info ( which is how users access their Facebook accounts through the Power.com site ) .
That violates Facebook ’s terms of service , allows Power.com unauthorized access to Facebook ’s servers , and creates security and privacy risks , the social network says .
Facebook also alleges that Power.com sent out intentionally misleading promotional emails from “ facebookmail.com ” addresses , which were signed “ The Facebook Team . ”
Power.com ’s side of the story is n’t clear yet .
Vachani told the Times that he ’s “ in discussions with Facebook to get their feedback on the best ways to work with them , ” which is nice and vague .
Facebook says it first asked Power.com to stop accessing its site on Dec. 1 . Vachini promised to use the Facebook Connect platform , which gives third - party websites limited access to Facebook , and to delete all Facebook login data from the Power.com site .
Since then , Vachani repeatedly delayed the implementation and most recently said the company made a “ business decision ” to continue collecting and using Facebook logins until Connect is implemented , according to the complaint .
Facebook is asking for an injunction to stop Power.com from accessing its site and for unspecified financial damages .
It seems sketchy for sites to collect all your login information ( as opposed to using various feeds and application programming interfaces , which is what FriendFeed and other sites do ) , but it ’s not unprecedented .
I ’ve shared my bank login with financial aggregator Mint.com , for example .
I also had similar concerns about PageOnce , a site that wants to store every single one of your passwords .
PageOnce integrates with a wide range of social networking sites — but not Facebook .
Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso 's already shaky government was rocked on Tuesday by the sudden resignation of his finance minister over allegations he appeared drunk after a recent summit .
Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa , who has denied being drunk , offered his resignation late on Tuesday after earlier in the day saying he would stay on until after parliament approves a supplementary budget , probably in late April .
Nakagawa 's resignation was accepted .
" I have resigned , " Nakagawa said .
" I decided that it would be better for the country if I quit . "
The resignation was a huge embarrassment for Aso , who the day before had asked Nakagawa to stay on .
Economy Minister Kaoru Yosano will assume Nakagawa 's duties , Kyodo News agency reported .

How ( not ) to brick the Android Developer Phone
LWN .net needs you !

Your editor 's adventure with the Android Developer Phone ( ADP1 ) began just before the end of the year .
This phone , remember , has the nearly unique selling point that it is lacking any sort of lockdown feature .
It will happily run any software which is fed to it , from the kernel on up .
It thus brings the promise of free software to a market which has traditionally gone out of its way to avoid enabling any sort of freedom .
It 's actually possible to control the software we run on our phones - but only if we buy the right phone .
The path to exercising this freedom is long and poorly documented , though .
Eventually somebody will certainly pull together a definitive resource for developers wanting to hack on their Android phones ; until then , one is left digging through a long series of web sites and forums ( a few of which are listed below ) .
This article will not be that resource , but , hopefully , it can help to point interested people in the right direction .
Please note that this article assumes that you have an ADP1 phone ; if you have a locked - down G1 you can still participate in all of the fun and games that follow , but you will need to root the phone first .
The first stop , unfortunately , is the decidedly non-free Android SDK .
Actually , this package is only truly mandatory for those wanting to build Android applications of their own .
But it contains a pre-built version of the Android Debug Bridge ( adb ) tool , which is essential for working with the phone over a USB connection .
With adb , one can connect to a shell running on the phone , move files back and forth , forward network ports to and from the phone , and more .
Yes , one can run a shell directly on the device using the terminal emulator application , but life is certainly much easier when one can use a real keyboard .
Note that it may be necessary to either ( 1 ) run adb as root , or ( 2 ) play with your udev setup to be able to access the phone via USB .
Putting new software onto the phone involves flashing its NVRAM .
There are six partitions on the onboard flash :
dev : size erasesize name mtd0 : 00040000 00020000 " misc " mtd1 : 00500000 00020000 " recovery " mtd2 : 00280000 00020000 " boot " mtd3 : 04380000 00020000 " system " mtd4 : 04380000 00020000 " cache " mtd5 : 04ac0000 00020000 " userdata "
Details about these partitions can be found on this page .
Most of them will be fairly obvious in purpose .
The " recovery " partition holds a recovery image which can be used to un - brick the phone .
In " boot " is the initial system image , while " system " is the root filesystem .
Application settings and such go into " userdata " .
With any luck at all , it should be possible to put a new system onto the phone by flashing only the " boot " and " system " partitions , leaving settings and such in place .
First , though , comes that sweaty - palms moment when one realizes that one is about to overwrite the operating software on an expensive new toy .
A fairly nice new toy that , mostly likely , has become an important working tool .
The idea of turning this nice device into an expensive brick lacks appeal .
It might be different if the second - generation Android devices were available ; then , at least , one could rationalize an update disaster as a celestial sign that it 's time to get a newer phone .
In the absence of such an ulterior motive , your editor stepped back from the brink and pondered ways to recover from a failed update .
[ PULL QUOTE : Everybody should be able to run vi on their phone ( though emacs appears to be a bit too much to hope for ) .
END QUOTE ]
One method your editor has seen recommended is to simply make copies of the various / dev/ mtd / mtd ?
devices , then use adb to lift those copies off the phone .
The system running on the phone has a rather minimal command set , so this copying must be done using cat and shell redirection operators .
This experience gives a quick thrill , as if one were reliving the very earliest days of Unix before advanced commands like cp had been invented , but said thrill is quick indeed .
Thereafter , one usually wants to go out and install busybox on the device .
After making a few strategic symbolic links , one will have something that looks a lot more like an ordinary Linux shell environment .
Everybody should be able to run vi on their phone ( though emacs appears to be a bit too much to hope for ) .
Back to backups : an alternative is to use the nandroid script .
With nandroid , a simple command will back up all of the useful partitions on the device in a way which lets them be quickly restored .
Unfortunately , though , nandroid will not work with a stock phone .
At a minimum , one must install busybox , then make links for commands like nc , tar , and md5sum .
Alternatively , one can install the modified recovery image from the amazingly productive " Jesus Freke , " then back up the phone while it is in recovery mode .
Either way , one will , once again , end up with a set of image files containing copies of the phone 's flash partitions .
So what does one do with these image files ?
The key tool here is fastboot , a command - line tool which runs on a Linux - based host system .
With fastboot , one can flash one or more partitions to a USB - connected phone , then reboot into the new code .
First , though , one must know the secret handshake : power up the phone while holding down the camera button , connect the USB cable , then hit the " back " button until the display reads " fastboot . "
Needless to say , the manual that came with the ADP1 did not mention this little detail .
Of course , said " manual " is a single slip of paper showing how to insert the battery .
Once one is convinced of one 's ability to recover from a disaster , it 's time to try to put some new software onto the phone .
If you have built the Android platform from source ( a process which will be addressed in the next installment ) , the result will be new " boot " and " system " images which can be flashed to the phone using fastboot .
System images built by others can also take that form , but the more common approach is to package the whole thing up into a Zip file .
In such cases , the recipe is as follows :
Using adb , put the update image onto the SD card on the phone ( mounted under / sdcard ) as update.zip .
) as .
Reboot the phone into recovery mode ( secret handshake : hold down the " home " key while booting ) .
Press alt l , followed by alt s .
Note that , unlike ordinary ADP1 / G1 keyboard operation , you need to actually hold down the " alt " key while pressing the associated letter .
This sequence will cause the phone to rewrite its software with the image found in the update .
zip file .
Once the process is complete , hitting the " home " and " back " buttons together will reboot the phone into the new image .
So , what might one install via this method ?
The set of modified images provided by Jesus Freke are a good place to start .
The JFv1.31 image makes a lot of things work more nicely ; it includes busybox with a set of useful links , a fancier recovery image with built - in backup capability , a version of su which asks the user for confirmation ( and which , thus , should be harder to exploit from an evil application ) , and more .
Also worth noting is that the JF images disable any over - the - air updates .
Such updates should not be happening with an ADP1 phone in any case , but , when one has control over one 's own phone , there is no reason to allow outside agencies to drop new software into it .
Rather more fun can be had by going to the JFv1.43 image .
This version includes an update from Android , which is said to fix a number of small issues and improve battery life .
It adds a voice calling capability which was notably lacking in the original Android distribution .
Your editor 's first attempt , " call home , " was turned into " call mom " though ; Google does not appear ( yet ) to have achieved a level of omniscience sufficient to know that those two have not been synonymous for some years now .
Also added is a voice search mechanism .
But that 's not all : this update includes the multitouch functionality that Google left out ; the " pinch " gesture now zooms web pages in and out .
Other applications have not yet been enhanced to use multitouch , yet .
Arguably even nicer than multitouch at this point is the new " autorotate " setting in the browser .
The ADP1 can report its orientation to an application , but almost no applications make use of that information .
So , on a stock ADP1 , using the browser in landscape mode requires opening the keyboard .
With autorotate turned on , the browser senses when the phone has been turned and adjusts the display accordingly .
It 's one of those little features which should have been there from the outset .
And that , of course , gets to the heart of why an open phone is such a nice thing to have .
We 're no longer dependent on the manufacturer to get everything right , and we 're no longer dependent on wireless carriers to hold off from crippling our devices .
We bought the hardware , and we wrote the software .
We are well within our rights to change how it all works - even if we want to do something crazy like install Debian over Android .
It is unfortunate that , at this time , so few devices afford this kind of freedom ; ADP1 and OpenMoko appear to be about the only options .
With any luck at all , awareness of the value of this freedom will spread over time , and vendors will find that their customers will settle for nothing less .
Of course , real freedom does n't stop at the ability to install software images created by others .
The next installment in this series will start to delve into the process of generating a new system image from source .
Among other things , your editor intends to take the " cupcake " development version - which includes , among other things , the much - requested on - screen keyboard feature - for a spin .
Stay tuned .
Resources .
Information about working with Android is spread around the net ; here are a few useful places your editor has found :
There is , of course , good information to be found at source.android.com .
developer.android.com is the source for the software development kit and related information .
The xda-developers site is a repository for vast amounts of useful - if noisy and slowly - served - information .
In particular , the Dream Android development forums seem to be the primary gathering point for people hacking on this platform .

I ’ve just finished a draft of a paper called Denotational design with type class morphisms , for submission to ICFP 2009 .
The paper is on a theme I ’ve explored in several posts , which is semantics - based design , guided by type class morphisms .
I ’d love to get some readings and feedback .
Pointers to related work would be particularly appreciated , as well as what ’s unclear and what could be cut .
It ’s an entire page over the limit , so I ’ll have to do some trimming before submitting .
The abstract :
Type classes provide a mechanism for varied implementations of standard interfaces .
Many of these interfaces are founded in mathematical tradition and so have regularity not only of types but also of properties ( laws ) that must hold .
Types and properties give strong guidance to the library implementor , while leaving freedom as well .
Some of the remaining freedom is in how the implementation works , and some is in what it accomplishes .
To give additional guidance to the what , without impinging on the how , this paper proposes a principle of type class morphisms ( TCMs ) , which further refines the compositional style of denotational semantics .
The TCM idea is simply that the instance ’s meaning is the meaning ’s instance .
This principle determines the meaning of each type class instance , and hence defines correctness of implementation .
In some cases , it also provides a systematic guide to implementation , and in some cases , valuable design feedback .
The paper is illustrated with several examples of type , meanings , and morphisms .
You can get the paper and see current errata here .
The submission deadline is March 2 , so comments before then are most helpful to me .
Enjoy , and thanks !
I ’ve just finished a draft of a paper called Denotational design with type class morphisms , for submission to ICFP 2009 .
The paper is on a theme I ’ve explored in several ...
Readers responded with great enthusiasm the last time I hoisted a big chunk of material from Australian economist Steve Keen ’s blog ( see “ Bernanke an Expert on the Great Depression ? ” ) I was therefore quite gratified when he wrote asking me to cross post his latest piece .
Keen is a fiercely independent thinker , and has other qualities I like : he ’s empirical , common - sensical , and cross disciplinary .
His lack of deference for orthodoxy means he is seen among economists , as the British might say , as unsound .
Given how well conventional wisdom has served us , maybe it ’s time we take the iconoclasts more seriously .
The post debunks several notions near and dear to the Fed , most economists , and pretty much all financial commentators .
First , that the Fed ’s current and expected money expansion moves are on a scale sufficient to create inflation .
They are n’t because , second , we are working with the wrong paradigm .
The assumption is that we operate within a “ fiat money ” or “ fractional reserve banking system ” .
Keen argues these are incidental elements to what is more properly described as a “ credit money system ” .
This post is LONG and very much worth your attention , so you might want to get a cup of coffee first .
From Keen ( see his site for the footnotes ) .
Boldface his :
Though inflation was ultimately suppressed by a severe recession , the monetarist experiment overall was an abject failure .
Central Banks would set targets for the growth in the money supply and miss them completely — the money supply would grow two to three times faster than the targets they set .
Central Banks around the world learnt this lesson the hard way in the 1970s and 1980s when they attempted to control the money supply , following neoclassical economist Milton Friedman ’s theory of “ monetarism ” that blamed inflation on increases in the money supply .
Friedman argued that Central Banks should keep the reserve requirement constant , and increase Base Money at about 5 % per annum ; this would , he asserted cause inflation to fall as people ’s expectations adjusted , with only a minor ( if any ) impact on real economic activity .
Thus causation in money creation runs in the opposite direction to that of the money multiplier model : the credit money dog wags the fiat money tail .
Both the actual level of money in the system , and the component of it that is created by the government , are controlled by the commercial system itself , and not by the Federal Reserve .
Since the main role of the Federal Reserve is to try to ensure the smooth functioning of the credit system , option one is out — so it either adds Base Money to the system , or relaxes the reserve requirements , or both .
refuse to issue new reserves and cause a credit crunch ; create new reserves ; or relax the reserve ratio
If the entire banking system is at its reserve requirement limit , then the Federal Reserve has three choices :
If a firm accesses its line of credit to , for example , buy a new piece of machinery , then its debt to the bank rises by the price of the machine , and the deposit account of the machine ’s manufacturer rises by the same amount .
If the bank that issued the line of credit was already at its own limit in terms of its reserve requirements , then it will borrow that amount , either from the Federal Reserve or from other sources .
Thus loans come first — simultaneously creating deposits — and at a later stage the reserves are found .
The main mechanism behind this are the “ lines of credit ” that major corporations have arranged with banks that enable them to expand their loans from whatever they are now up to a specified limit .
This first major paper on this approach , “ The Endogenous Money Stock ” by the non-orthodox economist Basil Moore , was published almost thirty years ago . [ 4 ]
Basil ’s essential point was quite simple .
The standard money multiplier model ’s assumption that banks wait passively for deposits before starting to lend is false .
Rather than bankers sitting back passively , waiting for depositors to give them excess reserves that they can then on - lend ,
Well , the so - called “ mainstream ” did — the school of thought known as “ Neoclassical economics ” .
A rival school of thought , known as Post Keynesian economics , took these problems seriously , and developed a different theory of how money is created that is more consistent with the data .
Academic economics responded to these empirical challenges to its accepted theory in the time - honoured way : it ignored them .
It does n’t take sophisticated statistics to show that the second prediction is wrong — all you have to do is look at the ratio of private debt to money .
The theoretical prediction has never been right — rather than the money stock exceeding debt , debt has always exceeded the money supply — and the degree of divergence has grown over time .( there are attenuating factors that might affect the prediction — the public hoarding cash should make the ratio less than shown here , while non-banks would make it larger — but the gap between prediction and reality is just too large for the theory to be taken seriously ) .
Thus rather than credit money being created with a lag after government money , the data shows that credit money is created first , up to a year before there are changes in base money .
This contradicts the money multiplier model of how credit and debt are created : rather than fiat money being needed to “ seed ” the credit creation process , credit is created first and then after that , base money changes .
The difference in the behavior of M1 and M2 suggests that the difference of these aggregates ( M2 minus M1 ) should be considered …
The difference of M2 – M1 leads the cycle by even more than M2 , with the lead being about three quarters . ” ( p. 12 )
“ There is no evidence that either the monetary base or M1 leads the cycle , although some economists still believe this monetary myth .
Both the monetary base and M1 series are generally procyclical and , if anything , the monetary base lags the cycle slightly .
( p. 11 )
Their empirical conclusion was just the opposite : rather than fiat money being created first and credit money following with a lag , the sequence was reversed : credit money was created first , and fiat money was then created about a year later :
Testing the first hypothesis takes some sophisticated data analysis , which was done by two leading neoclassical economists in 1990 .
[3 ]
If the hypothesis were true , changes in M0 should precede changes in M2 .
The time pattern of the data should look like the graph below : an initial injection of government “ fiat ” money , followed by a gradual creation of a much larger amount of credit money :
2 . The amount of money in the economy should exceed the amount of debt , with the difference representing the government ’s initial creation of money .
In the example above , the total of all bank deposits tapers towards $ 10,000 , the total of loans converges to $ 9,000 , and the difference is $ 1,000 , which is the amount of initial government money injected into the system .
Therefore the ratio of Debt to Money should be less than one , and close to ( 1 - Reserve Ratio ) : in the example above , D / M=0.9 , which is 1 minus the reserve ratio of 10 % or 0.1 .
1 . The creation of credit money should happen after the creation of government money .
In the model , the banking system ca n’t create credit until it receives new deposits from the public ( that in turn originate from the government ) and therefore finds itself with excess reserves that it can lend out .
Since the lending , depositing and relending process takes time , there should be a substantial time lag between an injection of new government - created money and the growth of credit money .
Two hypotheses about the nature of money can be derived from the money multiplier model :
This model of how banks create credit is simple , easy to understand ( this version omits the fact that the public holds some of the cash in its own pockets rather than depositing it all in the banks ; this detail is easily catered for and is part of the standard model taught to economists ) , … and completely inadequate as an explanation of the actual data on money and debt .
Over time , a total of $ 10,000 in money is created — consisting of the original $ 1,000 injection of government money plus $ 9,000 in credit money — as well as $ 9,000 in total debts .
The following table illustrates this , on the assumption that the time lag between a bank receiving a new deposit , making a loan , and the recipient of the loan depositing them in other banks is a mere one week .
Kim then deposits this $ 810 in her bank .
It keeps $ 81 of the deposit , and lends the remaining $ 729 to its customer Kevin .
The bank then lends $ 900 to its customer Fred , who then deposits it in his bank — which is now required to hang on to 9 of the bills — or $ 90 — and can lend out the rest .
It then lends $ 810 to its customer Kim .
When customer
Sue deposits say 100 newly printed government $ 10 notes at her bank , it is then obliged to hang on to ten of them — or $ 100 — but it is allowed to lend out the rest .
Banks are required to retain a certain percentage of any deposit as a reserve , known as the “ reserve requirement ” ; for simplicity , let ’s say this fraction is 10 % .
Every macroeconomics textbook has an explanation of how credit money is created by the system of fractional banking that goes something like this :
This month ’s Debtwatch is dedicated to analysing how these Cavaliers actually “ make ” money and debt — something they think they understand , but in reality , they do n’t .
A sound model of how money and debt are created makes it obvious that we should never have fallen for the insane notion that the financial system should be self - regulating .
All that did was give the Cavaliers a licence to run amok , with the consequences we are now experiencing yet again — 150 years after Marx described the crisis that led him to write Das Kapital .
One and a half centuries after Marx falsely predicted the demise of capitalism , the people most likely to bring it about are not working class revolutionaries , but the “ Roving Cavaliers of Credit ” , against whom Marx quite justly railed .
Simultaneously , precisely this can incidentally provide a very profitable business for manufacturers and others .
Returns become wholly deceptive as a result of the loan system … ” [ 1 ]
“ A high rate of interest can also indicate , as it did in 1857 , that the country is undermined by the roving cavaliers of credit who can afford to pay a high interest because they pay it out of other people ’s pockets ( whereby , however , they help to determine the rate of interest for all ) , and meanwhile they live in grand style on anticipated profits .
He got it wrong on some other issues , [ 2 ] but his analysis of money and credit , and how the credit system can bring an otherwise well - functioning market economy to its knees , was spot on .
His observations on the financial crisis of 1857 still ring true today :
Ten years ago , a quote from Marx would have one deemed a socialist , and dismissed from polite debate .
Today , such a quote can ( and did , along with Charlie ’s photo ) appear in a feature in the Sydney Morning Herald — and not a few people would have been nodding their heads at how Marx got it right on bankers .
Talk about centralisation !
The credit system , which has its focus in the so - called national banks and the big money - lenders and usurers surrounding them , constitutes enormous centralisation , and gives this class of parasites the fabulous power , not only to periodically despoil industrial capitalists , but also to interfere in actual production in a most dangerous manner — and this gang knows nothing about production and has nothing to do with it . ” [ 1 ]

This strikes me as a bit of an oversimplification ( at least as far as the US is concerned , but Keen is clearly casting his net broader than that ) .
The Volcker - induced recession of 1980 - 1982 is depicted as a successful monetarist experiment .
Volcker clamped down , hard , on money supply growth ( then the various Ms were published weekly and everyone on Wall Street stopped to read the 4:00 PM release on Thursdays ) .
However , that was the period in which banks were getting permission to offer new products , such as NOW accounts ( checking accounts that paid interest ) to compete with money market mutual funds .
My understanding is that aroune 1982 , money supply growth measures were becoming less reliable .
However , I have wondered why the Fed never did research on how to look at money supply in the light of deregulation .
I also wonder whether the “ Ms were getting wacky ” was an excuse for the fact that Volcker finally gave in to considerable pressure to ease up in July 1982 .
Back to Keen :
Ultimately , Central Banks abandoned monetary targetting , and moved on to the modern approach of targetting the overnight interest rate as a way to control inflation . [ 6 ]
Several Central Banks — including Australia ’s RBA — completely abandoned the setting of reserve requirements .
Others — such as America ’s Federal Reserve — maintained them , but had such loopholes in them that they became basically irrelevant .
Thus the US Federal Reserve sets a Required Reserve Ratio of 10 % , but applies this only to deposits by individuals ; banks have no reserve requirement at all for deposits by companies . [ 7 ]
However , neoclassical economic theory never caught up with either the data , or the actual practices of Central Banks — and Ben Bernanke , a leading neoclassical theoretician , and unabashed fan of Milton Friedman , is now in control of the Federal Reserve .
He is therefore trying to resolve the financial crisis and prevent deflation in a neoclassical manner : by increasing the Base Money supply .
Give Bernanke credit for trying here : the rate at which he is increasing Base Money is unprecedented .
Base Money doubled between 1994 and 2008 ; Bernanke has doubled it again in just the last 4 months .
If the money multiplier model of money creation were correct , then ultimately this would lead to a dramatic growth in the money supply as an additional US $ 7 trillion of credit money was gradually created .
If neoclassical theory was correct , this increase in the money supply would cause a bout of inflation , which would end bring the current deflationary period to a halt , and we could all go back to “ business as usual ” .
That is clearly what Bernanke is banking on :
The conclusion that deflation is always reversible under a fiat money system follows from basic economic reasoning .
A little parable may prove useful : Today an ounce of gold sells for $ 300 , more or less .
Now suppose that a modern alchemist solves his subject ’s oldest problem by finding a way to produce unlimited amounts of new gold at essentially no cost .
Moreover , his invention is widely publicized and scientifically verified , and he announces his intention to begin massive production of gold within days .
What would happen to the price of gold ?
Presumably , the potentially unlimited supply of cheap gold would cause the market price of gold to plummet .
Indeed , if the market for gold is to any degree efficient , the price of gold would collapse immediately after the announcement of the invention , before the alchemist had produced and marketed a single ounce of yellow metal .
Like gold , U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation …
If we do fall into deflation , however , we can take comfort that the logic of the printing press example must assert itself , and sufficient injections of money will ultimately always reverse a deflation . [ 8 ]
However , from the point of view of the empirical record , and the rival theory of endogenous money , this will fail on at least four fronts :
1 . Banks wo n’t create more credit money as a result of the injections of Base Money .
Instead , inactive reserves will rise ; 2 . Creating more credit money requires a matching increase in debt — even if the money multiplier model were correct , what would the odds be of the private sector taking on an additional US $ 7 trillion in debt in addition to the current US $ 42 trillion it already owes ? ;
3 . Deflation will continue because the motive force behind it will still be there — distress selling by retailers and wholesalers who are desperately trying to avoid going bankrupt ; and 4 .
The macroeconomic process of deleveraging will reduce real demand no matter what is done , as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer recently noted : “ We ’re certainly in the midst of a once - in - a - lifetime set of economic conditions .
The perspective I would bring is not one of recession .
Rather , the economy is resetting to lower level of business and consumer spending based largely on the reduced leverage in economy ” . [ 9 ]
The only way that Bernanke ’s “ printing press example ” would work to cause inflation in our current debt - laden would be if simply Zimbabwean levels of money were printed — so that fiat money could substantially repay outstanding debt and effectively supplant credit - based money .
Measured on this scale , Bernanke ’s increase in Base Money goes from being heroic to trivial .
Not only does the scale of credit - created money greatly exceed government - created money , but debt in turn greatly exceeds even the broadest measure of the money stock — the M3 series that the Fed some years ago decided to discontinue .
Bernanke ’s expansion of M0 in the last four months of 2008 has merely reduced the debt to M0 ratio from 47:1 to 36:1 ( the debt data is quarterly whole money stock data is monthly , so the fall in the ratio is more than shown here given the lag in reporting of debt ) .
To make a serious dent in debt levels , and thus enable the increase in base money to affect the aggregate money stock and hence cause inflation , Bernanke would need to not merely double M0 , but to increase it by a factor of , say , 25 from pre-intervention levels .
That US $ 20 trillion truckload of greenbacks might enable Americans to repay , say , one quarter of outstanding debt with one half — thus reducing the debt to GDP ratio about 200 % ( roughly what it was during the DotCom bubble and , coincidentally , 1931 ) — and get back to some serious inflationary spending with the other ( of course , in the context of a seriously depreciating currency ) .
But with anything less than that , his attempts to reflate the American economy will sink in the ocean of debt created by America ’s modern - day “ Roving Cavaliers of Credit ” .
How to be a “ Cavalier of Credit ”
Note Bernanke ’s assumption ( highlighted above ) in his argument that printing money would always ultimately cause inflation : “ under a fiat money system “ .
The point made by endogenous money theorists is that we do n’t live in a fiat - money system , but in a credit - money system which has had a relatively small and subservient fiat money system tacked onto it .
We are therefore not in a “ fractional reserve banking system ” , but in a credit - money one , where the dynamics of money and debt are vastly different to those assumed by Bernanke and neoclassical economics in general . [ 10 ]
Calling our current financial system a “ fiat money ” or “ fractional reserve banking system ” is akin to the blind man who classified an elephant as a snake , because he felt its trunk .
We live in a credit money system with a fiat money subsystem that has some independence , but certainly does n’t rule the monetary roost — far from it .
The best place to start to analyse the monetary system is therefore to consider a model of a pure credit economy — a toy economy in which there is no government sector and no Central Bank whatsoever — and see how that model behaves .
The first issue in such a system is how does one become a bank ? — or a “ cavalier of credit ” in Marx ’s wonderfully evocative phrase ?
The answer was provided by the Italian non-orthodox economist Augusto Graziani : a bank is a third party to all transactions , whose account - keeping between buyer and seller is regarded as finally settling all claims between them .
Huh ?
What does that mean ?
To explain it , I ’ll compare it with the manner in which we ’ve been misled to thinking about the market economy by neoclassical economics .
It has deluded us into thinking of a market economy as being fundamentally a system of barter .
Every transaction is seen as being two sided , and involving two commodities : Farmer Maria wants to sell pigs and buy copper pipe ; Plumber Joe wants to sell copper pipe and buy pigs .
Money simply eliminates the problem that it ’s very hard for Plumber Joe to find Farmer Maria .
Instead , they each sell their commodity for money , and then exchange that money for the commodity they really want .
The picture appears more complicated — there are two markets introduced as well , with Farmer Maria selling pigs to the pig market in return for money , Plumber Joe doing the same thing in the copper market , and then armed with money from their sales , they go across to the other market and buy what they want .
But it is still a lot easier than a plumber going out to try to find a pig farmer who wants copper pipes .
In this model of the economy , money is useful in that it replaces a very difficult search process with a system of markets .
But fundamentally the system is no different to the barter model above : money is just a convenient “ numeraire ” , and anything at all could be used — even copper pipe or pigs — so long as all markets agreed to accept it .
Gold tends to be the numeraire of choice because it does n’t degrade , and paper money merely replaces gold as a more convenient form of numeraire .
Importantly , in this model , money is an asset to its holder , but a liability to no -one .
There is money , but no debt .
The fractional banking model that is tacked onto this vision of bartering adds yet another market where depositors ( savers ) supply money at a price ( the rate of interest ) , and lenders buy money for that price , and the interaction between supply and demand sets the price .
Debt now exists , but in the model world total debt is less than the amount of money .
If this market produces too much money ( which it can do in a fractional banking system because the government determines the supply of base money and the reserve requirement ) then there can be inflation of the money prices of commodities .
Equally if the money market suddenly contracts , then there can be deflation .
It ’s fairly easy to situate Bernanke ’s dramatic increase in Base Money within this view of the world .
If only it were the world in which we live .
Instead , we live in a credit economy , in which intrinsically useless pieces of paper — or even simple transfers of electronic records of numbers — are happily accepted in return for real , hard commodities .
This in itself is not incompatible with a fractional banking model , but the empirical data tells us that credit money is created independently of fiat money : credit money rules the roost .
So our fundamental understanding of a monetary economy should proceed from a model in which credit is intrinsic , and government money is tacked on later — and not the other way round .
Our starting point for analysing the economy should therefore be a “ pure credit ” economy , in which there are privately issued bank notes , but no government sector and no fiat money .
Yet this has to be an economy in which intrinsically useless items are accepted as payment for intrinsically useful ones — you ca n’t eat a bank note , but you can eat a pig .
So how can that be done without corrupting the entire system .
Someone has to have the right to produce the bank notes ; how can this system be the basis of exchange , without the person who has that right abusing it ?
Graziani ( and others in the “ Circuitist ” tradition ) reasoned that this would only be possible if the producer of bank notes — or the keeper of the electronic records of money — could not simply print them whenever he / she wanted a commodity , and go and buy that commodity with them .
But at the same time , people involved in ordinary commerce had to accept the transfer of these intrinsically useless things in return for commodities .
“ Therefore for a system of credit money to work , three conditions had to be fulfilled : a ) money has to be a token currency ( otherwise it would give rise to barter and not to monetary exchanges ) ; b) money has to be accepted as a means of final settlement of the transaction ( otherwise it would be credit and not money ) ; c ) money must not grant privileges of seignorage to any agent making a payment . ” [ 11 ]
In Graziani ’s words , “ The only way to satisfy those three conditions is …:
“ to have payments made by means of promises of a third agent , the typical third agent being nowadays a bank .
When an agent makes a payment by means of a cheque , he satisfies his partner by the promise of the bank to pay the amount due .
Once the payment is made , no debt and credit relationships are left between the two agents .
But one of them is now a creditor of the bank , while the second is a debtor of the same bank .
This insures that , in spite of making final payments by means of paper money , agents are not granted any kind of privilege .
For this to be true , any monetary payment must therefore be a triangular transaction , involving at least three agents , the payer , the payee , and the bank . ” ( p. 3 ) .
Thus in a credit economy , all transactions are involve one commodity , and three parties : a seller , a buyer , and a bank whose transfer of money from the buyer ’s account to the seller ’s is accepted by them as finalising the sale of the commodity .
So the actual pattern in any transaction in a credit money economy is as shown below :
This makes banks and money an essential feature of a credit economy , not something that can be initially ignored and incorporated later , as neoclassical economics has attempted to do ( unsuccessfully ; one of the hardest things for a neoclassical mathematical modeller is to explain why money exists , apart from the search advantages noted above .
Generally therefore their models omit money — and debt — completely ) .
It also defines what a bank is : it is a third party whose record - keeping is trusted by all parties as recording the transfers of credit money that effect sales of commodities .
The bank makes a legitimate living by lending money to other agents — thus simultaneously creating loans and deposits — and charging a higher rate of interest on loans than on deposits .
Thus in a fundamental way , a bank is a bank because it is trusted .
Of course , as we know from our current bitter experience , banks can damage that trust ; but it remains the wellspring from which their existence arises .
This model helped distinguish the realistic model of endogenous money from the unrealistic neoclassical vision of a barter economy .
It also makes it possible to explain what a credit crunch is , and why it has such a devastating impact upon economic activity .
First , the basics : how does a pure credit economy work , and how is money created in one ?
( The rest of this post necessarily gets technical and is there for those who want detailed background .
It reports new research into the dynamics of a credit economy .
There ’s nothing here anywhere near as poetic as Marx ’s “ Cavaliers of Credit ” , but I hope it explains how a credit economy works , and how it can go badly wrong in a “ credit crunch ” )
How the Cavaliers “ Make Money ”
Several economists — notably Wicksell and Keynes — envisaged a “ pure credit economy ” .
Keynes imagined a world in which “ investment is proceeding at a steady rate ” , in which case :
“ the finance ( or the commitments to finance ) required can be supplied from a revolving fund of a more or less constant amount , one entrepreneur having his finance replenished for the purpose of a projected investment as another exhausts his on paying for his completed investment . ” [ 12 ]
This is the starting point to understanding a pure credit economy — and therefore to understanding our current economy and why it ’s in a bind .
Consider an economy with three sectors : firms that produce goods , banks that charge and pay interest , and households that supply workers .
Firms are the only entities that borrow , and the banking sector gave loans at some stage in the past to start production .
Firms hired workers with this money ( and bought inputs from each other ) , enabling production , and ultimately the economy settled down to a constant turnover of money and goods ( as yet there is no technological change , population growth , or wage bargaining ) .
There are four types of accounts : Firms ’ Loans , Firms ’ Deposits , Banks ’ Deposits , and Households Deposits .
These financial flows are described by the following table .
I ’m eschewing mathematical symbols and just using letters here to avoid the “ MEGO ” effect ( ” My Eyes Glaze Over ” ) — if you want to check out the equations , see this paper :
1. Interest accrues on the outstanding loans .
2 . Firms pay interest on the loans .
This is how the banks make money , and it involves a transfer of money from the firms deposit accounts to the banks .
The banks then have to acknowledge this payment of interest by recording it against the outstanding debt firms owe them .
3 . Banks pay interest to firms on the balances in their deposit accounts .
This involves a transfer from Bank Deposit accounts to Firms ; this is a cost of business to banks , but they make money this way because ( a ) the rate of interest on loans is higher than that on deposits and ( b ) as is shown later , the volume of loans outstanding exceeds the deposits that banks have to pay interest on ; 4 .
Firms pay wages to workers ; this is a transfer from the firms deposits to the households .
5 . Banks pay interest to households on the balances in their deposit accounts .
6 . Banks and households pay money to firms in order to purchase some of the output from factories for consumption and intermediate goods .
This financial activity allows production to take place :
1. Workers are hired and paid a wage ; 2 . They produce output in factories at a constant level of productivity ; 3 . The output is then sold to other firms , banks and households ; 4 . The price level is set so that in equilibrium the flow of demand equals the flow of output
The graphs below show the outcome of a simulation of this system , which show that a pure credit economy can work : firms can borrow money , make a profit and pay it back , and a single “ revolving fund of finance ” , as Keynes put it , can maintain a set level of economic activity . [ 13 ]
These stable accounts support a flow of economic activity in time , giving firms , households and banks steady incomes :
Output and employment also tick over at a constant level :
That ’s the absolutely basic picture ; to get closer to our current reality , a lot more needs to be added .
The next model includes , in addition to the basic system shown above :
1. Repayment of debt , which involves a transfer from the Firms ’ deposit account to an account that was n’t shown in the previous model that records
Banks unlent reserves ; this transfer of money has to be acknowledged by the banks by a matching reduction in the recorded level of debt ; 2 . Relending from unlent reserves .
This involves a transfer of money , against which an equivalent increase in debt is recorded ; 3 . The extension of new loans to the firm sector by the banks .
The firms sector ’s deposits are increased , and simultaneously the recorded level of debt is increased by the same amount .
4 . Investment of part of bank profits by a transfer from the banking sector ’s deposit accounts to the unlent reserves .
5 . Variable wages , growing labour productivity and a growing population .
The financial table for this system is :
As with the previous model , this toy economy “ works ” — it is possible for firms to borrow money , make a profit , and repay their debt .
With the additional elements of debt repayment and the creation of new money , this model also lets us see what happens to bank income when these parameters change .
Though in some ways the answers are obvious , it lets us see why banks are truly cavalier with credit .
The conclusions are that bank income is bigger :
If the rate of money creation is higher ( this is by far the most important factor ) ;
If the rate of circulation of unlent reserves is higher ; and If the rate of debt repayment is lower — which is why , in “ normal ” financial circumstances , banks are quite happy not to have debt repaid .
In some ways these conclusions are unremarkable : banks make money by extending debt , and the more they create , the more they are likely to earn .
But this is a revolutionary conclusion when compared to standard thinking about banks and debt , because the money multiplier model implies that , whatever banks might want to do , they are constrained from so doing by a money creation process that they do not control .
However , in the real world , they do control the creation of credit .
Given their proclivity to lend as much as is possible , the only real constraint on bank lending is the public ’s willingness to go into debt .
In the model economy shown here , that willingness directly relates to the perceived possibilities for profitable investment — and since these are limited , so also is the uptake of debt .
But in the real world — and in my models of Minsky ’s Financial Instability Hypothesis — there is an additional reason why the public will take on debt : the perception of possibilities for private gain from leveraged speculation on asset prices .
That clearly is what has happened in the world ’s recent economic history , as it happened previously in the runup to the Great Depression and numerous financial crises beforehand .
In its aftermath , we are now experiencing a “ credit crunch ” — a sudden reversal with the cavaliers going from being willing to lend to virtually anyone with a pulse , to refusing credit even to those with solid financial histories .
I introduce a “ credit crunch ” into this model by changing those same key key financial parameters at the 30 year mark , but decreasing them rather than increasing them .
Firms go from having a 20 year horizon for debt repayment to a 6.4 year horizon , banks go from increasing the money supply at 10 % per annum to 3.2 % per annum , while the rate of circulation of unlent reserves drops by 68 % .
There is much more to our current crisis than this — in particular , this model omits “ Ponzi lending ” that finances gambling on asset prices rather than productive investment , and the resulting accumulation of debt compared to GDP — but this level of change in financial parameters alone is sufficient to cause a simulated crisis equivalent to the Great Depression .
Its behaviour reproduces much of what we ’re witnessing now : there is a sudden blowout in unlent reserves , and a decline in the nominal level of debt and in the amount of money circulating in the economy .
This is the real world phenomenon that Bernanke is now railing against with his increases in Base Money , and already the widespread lament amongst policy makers is that banks are not lending out this additional money , but simply building up their reserves .
Tough : in a credit economy , that ’s what banks do after a financial crisis — it ’s what they did during the Great Depression .
This credit - economy phenomenon is the real reason that the money supply dropped during the Depression : it was n’t due to “ bad Federal Reserve policy ” as Bernanke himself has opined , but due to the fact that we live in a credit money world , and not the fiat money figment of neoclassical imagination .
The impact of the simulated credit crunch on my toy economy ’s real variables is similar to that of the Great Depression : real output slumps severely , as does employment .
The nominal value of output also falls , because prices also fall along with real output .
This fall in prices is driven by a switch from a regime of growing demand to one of shrinking demand .
Rather than there being a continuous slight imbalance in demand ’s favour , the imbalance shifts in favour of supply — and prices continue falling even though output eventually starts to rise .
The unemployment rate explodes rapidly from full employment to 25 percent of the workforce being out of a job — and then begins a slow recovery .
Finally , wages behave in a perverse fashion , just as Keynes argued during the Great Depression : nominal wages fall , but real wages rise because the fall in prices outruns the fall in wages .
This combination of falling prices and falling output means that despite the fall in nominal debts , the ratio of debt to nominal output actually rises — again , as happened for the first few years of the Great Depression .
Though this model is still simple compared to the economy in which we live , it ’s a lot closer to our actual economy than the models developed by conventional “ neoclassical ” economists , which ignore money and debt , and presume that the economy will always converge to a “ NAIRU ” [ 14 ] equilibrium after any shock .
It also shows the importance of the nominal money stock , something that neoclassical economists completely ignore .
To quote Milton Friedman on this point :
“ It is a commonplace of monetary theory that nothing is so unimportant as the quantity of money expressed in terms of the nominal monetary unit — dollars , or pounds , or pesos …
Let the number of dollars in existence be multiplied by 100 ; that , too , will have no other essential effect , provided that all other nominal magnitudes ( prices of goods and services , and quantities of other assets and liabilities that are expressed in nominal terms ) are also multiplied by 100 . ” [ 15 ]
The madness in Friedman ’s argument is the assumption that increasing the money supply by a factor of 100 will also cause “ all other nominal magnitudes ” including commodity prices and debts to be multiplied by the same factor .
Whatever might be the impact on prices of increasing the money supply by a factor of 100 , the nominal value of debt would remain constant : debt contracts do n’t give banks the right to increase your outstanding level of debt just because prices have changed .
Movements in the nominal prices of goods and services are n’t perfectly mirrored by changes in the level of nominal debts , and this is why nominal magnitudes ca n’t be ignored .
In this model I have developed , money and its rate of circulation matter because they determine the level of nominal and real demand .
It is a “ New Monetarism ” model , in which money is crucial .
Ironically , Milton Friedman argued that money was crucial in his interpretation of the Great Depression — that the failure of the Federal Reserve to sufficiently increase the money supply allowed deflation to occur .
But he a trivial “ helicopter ” model of money creation that saw all money as originating from the operations of the Federal Reserve :
“ Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $ 1,000 in bills from the sky , which is , of course , hastily collected by members of the community .
Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated … [ 16 ]
When the helicopter starts dropping money in a steady stream — or , more generally , when the quantity of money starts unexpectedly to rise more rapidly — it takes time for people to catch on to what is happening .
Initially , they let actual balances exceed long — run desired balances … ” ( p. 13 )
and a trivial model of the real economy that argued that it always tended back to equilibrium :
“ Let us start with a stationary society in which … ( 5 ) The society , though stationary , is not static .
Aggregates are constant , but individuals are subject to uncertainty and change .
Even the aggregates may change in a stochastic way , provided the mean values do not …
Let us suppose that these conditions have been in existence long enough for the society to have reached a state of equilibrium … ” ( pp. 2 - 3 ) One natural question to ask about this final situation is , “ What raises the price level , if at all points markets are cleared and real magnitudes are stable ? ”
The answer is , “ Because everyone confidently anticipates that prices will rise . ” ( p. 10 )
Using this simplistic analysis , Milton Friedman claimed that inflation was caused by “ too many helicopters ” and deflation by “ too few ” , and that the deflation that amplified the downturn in the 1930s could have been prevented if only the Fed had sent more helicopters into the fray :
“ different and feasible actions by the monetary authorities could have prevented the decline in the money stock — indeed , produced almost any desired increase in the money stock .
The same actions would also have eased the banking difficulties appreciably .
Prevention or moderation of the decline in the stock of money , let alone the substitution of monetary expansion , would have reduced the contraction ’s severity and almost as certainly its duration . ” [ 17 ]
With a sensible model of how money is endogenously created by the financial system , it is possible to concur that a decline in money contributed to the severity of the Great Depression , but not to blame that on the Federal Reserve not properly exercising its effectively impotent powers of fiat money creation .
Instead , the decline was due to the normal operations of a credit money system during a financial crisis that its own reckless lending has caused — the Cavaliers are cowards who rush into a battle they are winning , and retreat at haste in defeat .
However , with his belief in Friedman ’s analysis , Bernanke did blame his 1930 predecessors for causing the Great Depression .
In his paean to Milton Friedman on the occasion of his 90th birthday , Bernanke made the following remark :
“ Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve .
I would like to say to Milton and Anna : Regarding the Great Depression .
You ’re right , we did it .
We ’re very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n’t do it again . ” [ 18 ]
In fact , thanks to Milton Friedman and neoclassical economics in general , the Fed ignored the run up of debt that has caused this crisis , and every rescue engineered by the Fed simply increased the height of the precipice from which the eventual fall into Depression would occur .
Having failed to understand the mechanism of money creation in a credit money world , and failed to understand how that mechanism goes into reverse during a financial crisis , neoclassical economics may end up doing what by accident what Marx failed to achieve by deliberate action , and bring capitalism to its knees .
Neoclassical economics — and especially that derived from Milton Friedman ’s pen— is mad , bad , and dangerous to know .
