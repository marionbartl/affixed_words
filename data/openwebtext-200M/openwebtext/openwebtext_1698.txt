When I began investigating the mysteriousÃ‚Â death of Henry Glover , one of the most notable aspects of the case was the lack of documents .
Here was a New Orleans resident found incinerated in a car just a few hundred feet from a police station in September 2005 , shortly after Hurricane Katrina .
Yet there was no sign that anyone in authority had ever conducted any sort of investigation .
Ã‚Â
The New Orleans Police Department told me in 2008 that they knew absolutely nothing about GloverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s demise .

TodayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s indictment suggests that was not true .
TheÃ‚Â 11 - count indictment accuses police officers of shooting Glover and torching his corpse , physically attacking his brother and another man , and then attempting to conceal it all .
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s most striking about the charging documents is what they do not address :
The extraordinary number of officers in the department who were likely aware of these events as they unfolded .
To recap :
David Warren , the former officer indicted for allegedly shooting Glover with a .223 rifle round , was accompanied by another officer when he fired the shot .
At that point , a man named William Tanner tried to help Glover , driving him and his brother to seek medical assistance at an elementary school that had been commandeered by a SWAT team of officers .
( Tanner did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know that Glover had allegedly been shot by a police officer . )
The SWAT officers at the school failed to provide Glover with any medical assistance .
Instead , prosecutors say , Lt. Dwayne Scheuermann and Officer Greg McRae Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ kicked and hitÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Tanner and GloverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s brother , Edward King , without cause .

Numerous Ã¢â‚¬â€œ possibly dozens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of other officers were likely present at the site of the alleged beatings .
In an interview this week , a SWAT officer told me 50 to 60 cops were camped out at the school at any given time in the days after Katrina .
( The officer declined to comment directly on the Glover matter . )
After Glover died , prosecutors say in the indictment , Scheuermann and McRae set fire to GloverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s body as it sat inside TannerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 2001 Chevrolet Malibu , which was parked on a Mississippi River levee .
That spot lies a remarkably short distance from the NOPDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 4th District headquarters .
All my reporting shows many other officers were aware that a man had been reduced to ashes there Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s hard to fathom how cops stationed a few hundred feet away could have failed to notice such an inferno .
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet none of these officers apparently saw fit to speak out about what happened at the time , or to alert superiors to possible misconduct by their peers .
When I began looking into GloverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s death , nobody at NOPD had conducted any sort of probeÃ¢â‚¬â€ in fact the burnt car was still sitting in the weeds just down the street from the police station .
ADVERTISEMENT
His mother , Edna Glover , told me sheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢d gone to the department and made aÃ ‚Â police report , but had never received any real help in uncovering what became of her son .
In the months to come , perhaps sheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll finally get a full accounting .
And hopefully , somewhere along the way somebody will ask the question :
Who else within the NOPD knew about the sad and horrible death of Henry Glover ?

Sex , drugs and moral goals :
Penn study of reproductive strategies and recreational drug use
Why is there so much disagreement about whether using recreational drugs is morally wrong ?
A University of Pennsylvania psychology study shows that the debate about drugs might really be about sex .
The study compared two competing theories .
One theory -- the conventional wisdom in political science -- sees drug attitudes as primarily coming from people 's political ideology , level of religious commitment , and personality , for example , openness to experience .
The other theory , proposed by the researchers and driven by ideas from evolutionary psychology , holds that drug attitudes are really driven by people 's reproductive strategies .
When the Penn researchers questioned almost 1,000 people in two subject populations , one undergraduate and one Internet - based , a clear winner emerged between the competing theories : Differences in reproductive strategies are driving individuals ' different views on recreational drugs .
While many items predict to some extent whether people are opposed to recreational drugs , the most closely related predictors are people 's views on sexual promiscuity .
While people who are more religious and those who are more politically conservative do tend to oppose recreational drugs , in both study samples the predictive power of these religious and ideological items was reduced nearly to zero by controlling for items tracking attitudes toward sexual promiscuity .
" This provides evidence that views on sex and views on drugs are very closely related , " said Kurzban , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and director of the Pennsylvania Laboratory for Experimental Evolutionary Psychology at Penn .
" If you were to measure people 's political ideology , religiosity and personality characteristics , you can predict to some degree how people feel about recreational drugs .
But if , instead , you just measure how people feel about casual sex , and ignore the abstract items , the predictions about people 's views on drugs in fact become quite a bit better . "
From a theoretical perspective , the study also concludes that considering morality from the standpoint of strategic reproductive interests is a potentially useful way to understand why humans care about third - party behavior .
According to the researchers ' evolutionary model , people develop complex differences in their sexual and reproductive strategies .
One key difference that creates strategic conflict arises in people 's orientations towards casual sexual activity .
The relationships of people following a more committed , monogamous reproductive strategy are put at greater risk when casual sex is prevalent .
On the other hand , people pursuing a less committed lifestyle seek to avoid having their choices moralized , forbidden and punished .
The researchers cite prior work showing that recreational drug usage is often associated with promiscuity .
The results of the study imply that attitudes against recreational drugs are part of a larger attempt to advance the cause of committed , monogamous reproductive strategies .
" Condemnation of drug usage might be best understood in the context of strategic dynamics , with individuals influencing moral rules in a way that favors their own competitive reproductive strategies , " Kurzban said .
" We expect that this relationship between sexual strategy and moral stances will occur in other areas as well , such as attitudes toward prostitution , sexual education or abortion . "
The research team analyzed questionnaires from 516 undergraduate students from the University of Central Florida and 471 individuals recruited from a Web - based recruitment site , Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , or Mturk .
Participants reported their overall liberal / conservative political identification , rated their support or opposition to a number of current political issues and answered questions about their personalities , disgust sensitivity , moral views , sexual attitudes and level of religiosity .
The measure of recreational drug attitudes consisted of questions on the morality and legal status of using marijuana , cocaine and Ecstasy , as well as general attitudes towards recreational drugs .
BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced calls from opposition leaders on Monday for new elections , as bickering and fighting within her governing coalition has led to growing speculation in the German news media that a collapse of her government could be imminent .
Rocked by the resignations of a pair of high - ranking officials from her party and a significant setback in elections last month , Mrs. Merkel finds herself embroiled in possibly the worst political crisis since she became chancellor in 2005 .
The decision to push through Germany ’s share of a multibillion - dollar bailout for Greece and an even larger rescue package to defend the euro cost her dearly among parsimonious German voters , who are bitter at bailing out what they see as spendthrift neighbors .
Then last week the government proposed nearly $ 100 billion in belt - tightening measures by 2014 , intended to slow the growth of the country ’s debts .
Coming on the heels of the bailout votes , the budget cuts led thousands of Germans to take to the streets in protest over the weekend , leaving more than a dozen police officers injured here in the capital .
More Than 2 K Barrels Of Oil Will Continue To Flow , Even With Cap On
BP ’s successful capping of the damaged wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico is yet another temporary solution to the 12,000 – 30,000 or more barrels per day that have been spewing unto the ocean since April 20 .
According to the Deepwater Horizon respond command center , BP will be able to capture 90 percent of the oil with the new cap .
The other 10 percent of the oil will flow unto the water .
Ten percent is a low percentage estimate being made by BP — who has a bad reputation at presenting factual numbers .
When the math is done , however , the number of gallons that will continue to spew with the cap on will be : 2,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil per day .
That ’s still quite significant .
Originally , the American people were led to believe that only 5,000 barrels of oil per day were being poured on the Gulf .
But , the estimate went much higher as pressure to BP from environmental advocates forced the oil giant to explain why the spill was growing at the rate it did .
Scientists and BP later admitted that the damaged wellhead was spewing as much as 12,000 to 30,000 barrels of crude per day .
Some estimates put the leak at 56,000 to 84,000 barrels a day !
Having succeeded at placing the cap on the damaged blowout preventer , has given BP some relief since this bit of “ good news ” could ease tensions with the White House and the people on the Gulf .
However , there are still unresolved issues that need to be dealt with which require continuous news coverage :
1 ) The continued flow of 2,000 to 4,000 barrels of crude per day
2 ) The fast moving oil sheen to the beaches at four states
3 ) The death of sea life and migratory birds
4 ) The oil trapped in the marshes of Louisiana
5 ) The economic impact that will continue to take a toll on Gulf communities and businesses .
6 ) The potential health impacts on the fishermen who continue to lay boom .
7 ) The future health of oysters , shrimp , and fish from Gulf waters .
This spill has become the biggest environmental disaster in US history and it is now almost three times bigger than the Exxon Valdez in Alaska .
It will not be until August that this nightmare will be over .
That ’s when two relief wells will cement shut the damaged well .

Selections from the brief , reliably interesting interview :
Let 's talk about your TV show Bullshit !
Will you ever run out of theories to debunk and people to expose ?
If you build a kingdom on bullshit , you 're not in danger of running out of it .
Our producer says that Teller and I can take any subject in the news and do a credible show on it .
Sure , we like to have a villain , something to call " bullshit " on , but if we do n't , we can depart from that model .
Are there any groups you wo n't go after ?
We have n't tackled Scientology because Showtime does n't want us to .
Maybe they have deals with individual Scientologists — I 'm not sure .
And we have n't tackled Islam because we have families .
Meaning , you wo n't attack Islam because you 're afraid it 'll attack back …
Right , and I think the worst thing you can say about a group in a free society is that you 're afraid to talk about it — I can't think of anything more horrific . [… ]
You do go after Christians , though … Teller and I have been brutal to Christians , and their response shows that they 're good fucking Americans who believe in freedom of speech .
We attack them all the time , and we still get letters that say , " We appreciate your passion .
Sincerely yours , in Christ . "
Christians come to our show at the Rio and give us Bibles all the time .
They 're incredibly kind to us .
Sure , there are a couple of them who live in garages , give themselves titles and send out death threats to me and Bill Maher and Trey Parker .
But the vast majority are polite , open - minded people , and I respect them for that .
Today I awoke , tired at 3 pm , have to be at work soon , fuck everything except my cats .
I lurch towards the car in a daze , fuck , it 's going to be busy today at work , fuck .
A mailbox comes into sight as usual , just another bill I can't pay yet ...
No , wait ... what is this ?
Sometimes I love humanity and what they are capable of ...
Someone sent me this handmade card that seems like it took a while , I will keep this for the rest of my life , whomever you are , it means something to me unlike almost everything else I have in my life .
Thank you stranger , thank you .

“ This quantitatively confirms what many have suspected : Psychology is important to the economy and can sometimes lead to self - fulfilling prophecies , ” says Fabio Milani , assistant professor of economics .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Public attitude may be as important as public policy when it comes to the economy , according to UC Irvine ’s Fabio Milani .
A new economic model developed by the assistant professor of economics takes into account his finding that irrational optimism or pessimism is linked to a majority of booms and busts since the early 1970s .
Current macroeconomic models used to describe the American economy assume the market is a stable system , populated by rational individuals and influenced by random changes in supply , demand , policy , technology and other traditional variables , ” Milani says .
Milani adds into the equation the independent influence of shifts in expectations unrelated to fundamentals .
Long believed and widely assumed to play a role in economic fluctuations , these psychological shifts are hard to quantitatively prove and , as a result , have been ignored in modern macroeconomics , he says .
Milani looked at macroeconomic data from the early 1970s through 2009 on gross domestic product , inflation , and interest rates , and compared that to information to expectations about those same variables from the Survey of Professional Forecasters .
He was able to show where forecasts deviated from projections based on standard economic models .
The deviations , which he classifies as irrational optimism or pessimism , accounted for more than 50 percent of actual business cycle fluctuations that occurred during this same period .
“ This quantitatively confirms what many have suspected - psychology is important for the economy and , sometimes , it can lead to self - fulfilling prophecies , ” he says .
On average , he says , it takes several quarters before the effects of these errors of unsubstantiated optimism or pessimism die off .
What does all this mean ?
For policy makers , he says , it points to a need for more proactive fiscal and monetary policy strategies .
“ If you leave an economy open to market forces without intervention , it will be much more susceptible to these high levels of fluctuation that derive from psychological variables , ” he says .
For academics and economists the findings demonstrate a need to reexamine standard macroeconomic models that focus wholly on fundamentals and exclude behavioral elements and less - than - fully - rational expectations .
“ Economists have long been criticized for giving precedence to the elegance of their models and assumptions , rather than to realism , ” he says .
“ There is a lot more interest after the last recession , in moving away from the standard frameworks and focusing on some of these behavioral characteristics , which could be useful to better understand how the economy really functions and where it ’s headed . ”
The study is on file as a working paper with the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London and the Euro - Area Business Cycle Network , a joint venture between the center and European central banks .

The Best Sunscreen on Earth : Broccoli Juice
What 's better to wear at the beach than an SPF 45 sunblock ?
If you want to guarantee against burning , try a healthy slathering of broccoli juice .
Remember how your parents always urged you to eat your broccoli when you were a kid ?
They had the right idea :
Even if it did n’t appeal to your taste buds , it ’s common knowledge that the green veggie is loaded with vitamins , nutrients , and antioxidants that help protect against various kinds of cancer and other diseases .
Now , researchers have found another use for this remarkable vegetable – and this time , it ’s got nothing to do with the dinner table .
In an experiment performed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University , a number of participants slathered broccoli extract all over their skin before spending an afternoon lying out in the hot sun .
The rest of the participants coated themselves in traditional sunscreen – and came back the next day with a very painful sunburn .
The subjects who ’d rubbed themselves with broccoli extract , however , were no worse for the wear .
As it turns out , broccoli extract could be the best protection from the sun ’s rays available on earth .
Unlike regular sunscreen , it ’s not simply a shield to block dangerous UV rays from entering the skin .
Instead , the broccoli extract works within the body itself , creating enzymes that protect the skin from cancer and UV rays .
And unlike sunscreen , it does n’t simply wash off with your next shower – the protection benefits from the special substance last as long as three days .
There ’s one problem with broccoli juice that may keep it from appearing on the sunscreen shelf at your local drug store any time soon , though : Scientists have n’t yet found a way to get rid of its deep green hue .
But consumers may be willing to overlook that little problem – after all , being a little bit green at the beach is still better than turning lobster - red , right ?

As President Obama ’s Labor Department considers cracking down on private businesses that reward interns with credit rather than cash , Capitol Hill teems with unpaid interns who keep lawmakers ’ offices running .
Interns perform a variety of important office tasks , including answering phones , leading constituent tours , and running errands .
Many receive academic credit for their work as a part of their undergraduate or graduate studies , according to staff officials .
But top- ranking congressional Democrats , including those who pushed hard for legislation that raised the minimum wage in 2007 , say they ’re still comfortable with not paying interns who work in their offices .
Sen .
John Kerry , who supported incrementally raising the minimum wage from $ 5.15 in 2007 to $ 7.25 in 2009 , benefits directly from labor provided by unpaid interns .
“ It ’s no secret that good wages result in increased productivity , ultimately improving a firm ’s bottom line and economic development in their community , ” Kerry said in a 2007 press release .
“ In fact , the last time Congress raised the minimum wage , our country experienced the strongest economic growth in decades . ”
A Kerry staffer insisted that internships are an invaluable experience for those who volunteer for the positions .
“ I believe internship is an experience that comes before employment , ” said Kerry spokeswoman Whitney Smith .
“ I was an intern here , and I had an incredible experience , and it led me to the job I have today . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also strongly supported the 2007 minimum wage bill bill .
“ It is wrong to have millions of Americans working full - time and year - round and still living in poverty , ” Pelosi said at the time .
Interns in the press office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi work as many as 32 hours per week , according to Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly .
“ They know going into this that this is an internship , ” Daly said .
“ They are doing this to get experience with how things work on the Hill , to see how Washington works , and to be a part of it .
They really enjoy it . ”
Nathan
White , the press secretary for Rep. Dennis Kucinich , told The Daily Caller that it is the policy of his office to not discuss the terms of their internship program .
But the congressman ’s Web site provides some details .
“ By working in a congressional office , you will be exposed to the inner workings of legislative government and the procedures of a congressional office , ” the site reads .
“ All internships are unpaid . ”
Daly said he believes that comparing internships to paid positions is misguided .
“ I do n’t think it ’s the same thing , ” Daly said .
“ Almost all of [ the interns ] are in school full - time , and this is part of their requirement to have an internship .
Often I get letters afterwards , and they tell us how helpful it was and how much they liked it . ”
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that officials in Oregon and California are cracking down on employers who violate minimum wage laws .
“ Some of my friends ca n’t take these internships and spend a summer without making any money because they have to help pay for their own tuition or help their families with finances , ” one unpaid intern said in the article .
The cost of living in the District of Columbia last year was the fourth - highest in the country among major metropolitan areas , according to the ACCRA Cost of Living Index .
Housing on Capitol Hill often tops $ 1,000 per month .
“ We ’re trying to offer a strong opportunity to the folks back in Massachusetts and across the country who are interested in public service , ” said Kerry spokeswoman Whitney Smith .
“ They get a rich experience here that enhances their work . ”

Bad news :
Some companies are ignoring all unemployed applicants .
In a current job posting on The People Place , a job recruiting website for the telecommunications , aerospace / defense and engineering industries , an anonymous electronics company in Angleton , Texas , advertises for a " Quality Engineer . "
Qualifications for the job are the usual : computer skills , oral and written communication skills , light to moderate lifting .
But red print at the bottom of the ad says , " Client will not consider / review anyone NOT currently employed regardless of the reason . "
In a nearly identical job posting for the same position on the Benchmark Electronics website , the red print is missing .
But a human resources representative for the company confirmed to HuffPost that the The People Place ad accurately reflects the company 's recruitment policies .
" It 's our preference that they currently be employed , " he said .
" We typically go after people that are happy where they are and then tell them about the opportunities here .
We do get a lot of applications blindly from people who are currently unemployed -- with the economy being what it is , we 've had a lot of people contact us that do n't have the skill sets we want , so we try to minimize the amount of time we spent on that and try to rifle - shoot the folks we 're interested in . "
There are about 5.5 people looking for work for every job available , according to the latest data from the Labor Department .
Sony Ericsson , a global phone manufacturer that recently announced that it would be bringing 180 new jobs to the Buckhead , Ga. area , also recently posted an ad for a marketing position on The People Place .
The add specified : " NO UNEMPLOYED CANDIDATES WILL BE CONSIDERED AT ALL . "
When asked about the ad , a spokeswoman said , " This was a mistake , and once it was noticed it was removed . "
Ads asking the unemployed not to apply are easy to find .
A Craigslist ad for assistant restaurant managers in Edgewater , N.J. specifies , " Must be currently employed . "
Another job posting for a tax manager at an unnamed " top 25 CPA firm " in New York City contains the same line in all caps .
If the teabaggers would stop getting their views from Fox News and Glenn Beck and look at what 's around them , they 'd see that the very corporations they defend under the Rich People Create Jobs Doctrine are the ones actually screwing them over .
In August 2008 I walked out the door for the last time of a job I 'd held for eight years ; one I 'd hoped to remain in until I retired .
It 's not that it was a dream job ; my boss had issues with me for reasons I will never understand , particularly since on that last day he said " I wish we could have done right by you . "
But it was close to home , the pay was good , and the benefits were fantastic .
I was 53 years old .
It was the scariest day of my life .
For the rest of that day , I teetered between exhilaration at what would certainly come next and sheer terror .
After all , I might be 53 and fat , but I write a mean resume , I have " soft skills " up the wazoo , a master 's degree , drive , guts , and moxie .
On the other hand , I was a 53 - year - old web developer without ASP or C# or PHP .
When I interviewed for my current job , I did n't hide that I 'd been laid off .
When you work on grants , if the grants run out , heads get chopped .
My references were impeccable , and I actually made money on the deal , since I started work 4 weeks after my last day at the old job and had been hoarding vacation time for three years so I 'd been paid for six weeks of unused vacation .
I was lucky .
If I were in the same situation today , I probably would n't be so lucky , becauae now companies seem to be deciding that no matter why you are out of work , no matter if it was n't your fault , no matter if your employer 's management ran the company into the ground , or if the grants were n't renewed , or the company just could n't weather the downturn , these companies do n't care .
To them , you are untouchable Most of the jobs created last month were census jobs -- temporary jobs .
Businesses are just not hiring .
It 's not that their taxes are too high ; George Bush cut taxes on businesses for eight years .
It 's greed , plain and simple .
They are either working their existing employees to death or outsourcing the jobs to other countries .
It 's all part of the plan to restore this nation to what it was at the turn of the 20th centuries -- a small , preposterously wealthy " elite " , and the rest of us all rabble , scrambling around for scraps .

From the International Whaling Commission annual meeting in Agadir , Morocco :
One of the people I was n't expecting to see here was Junichi Sato , whaling campaigner for Greenpeace in Japan .
He 's one of the activists facing jail time for taking whalemeat from a warehouse back in 2008 - an action intended to draw attention to issues within Japan 's Antarctic whaling programme .
Evidence in the case has now been heard , and the judgement is expected in September .
Mr Sato and his fellow activist Toru Suzuki are looking at a possible penalty of 18 months in jail if convicted , which they expect to be .
The reason I was surprised to see him here is that at various times since the whalemeat " liberation " two years ago he 's been prevented from travelling , or speaking to the press or even to Mr Suzuki .
If the fact that his bail conditions permitted travel , I was even more surprised ( and pleased ) that he 's now allowed to talk to the press .
And after IWC member governments rejected the notion of a potential compromise agreement that would have cut the scale of Japan 's Antarctic hunt , I was interested to get his take on events , his reflections on anti-whaling campaigns , and his projections for the future .
So we had lunch .
For someone who believes he 's about to go to jail , he came across as relaxed and content in himself .
After two years of suspense , he confirmed , the court verdict will at least get some certainty back in his life , whatever it is .
I 've wondered whether in retrospect he might see the whalemeat removal as something of an own goal .
Coverage of the incident in Western countries endorsed the Greenpeace conclusions that here was clear evidence of wrong - doing in the government agencies that run whaling , and showed that whalemeat was in such oversupply that it had to be given away free to crewmembers and officials .
But in Japan it played rather differently .
The activists were largely painted as common criminals ; and the investigation that they were told would begin into the whaling agencies never materialised .
Greenpeace Japan lost about a thousand members as a result - roughly one - sixth of its membership .
But , he said - not many regrets .
A better understanding of international treaties and agreements on human rights law might have enabled him to tell his story better ; but as to the taking of the meat , it was vital to exposing the wrong - doing , he said .
The big news here - the failure of governments to reach a compromise - he views as a missed opportunity to take Japanese whalers out of the Southern Ocean .
Japan was prepared to reduce the scale of its Antarctic hunt to 200 minke whales per year .
Officials from governments at the heart of negotiations have told me they thought Japan would have gone lower still , had it had the right signals from the EU , Australia and the Latin American bloc .
These countries had wanted the promise of a complete phase - out .
But there is a view that going down to , say , 150 per year is effectively the same thing , as sending a fleet to the Antarctic for that few minke whales is simply not economic .
Mr Sato endorsed this view ; Japan accepting less than 200 , which could have been secured , would effectively have been promising a phase - out , he said .
If this is something of a rebuke for countries and environment groups that opposed the notion of a deal , his criticism of the Antarctic whaling programme itself is undiminished .
Any pretence that it 's really conducted for scientific research is fatally holed , he said , by the fact that Japan was prepared to downscale the size of the hunt so drastically ; if you really needed 850 for research , you 'd stick with 850 .
On the campaigning front , I reminded Mr Sato of a news conference he'd held back in 2007 at the IWC meeting in Anchorage , Alaska .
At that time , Greenpeace still mounted annual expeditions to the Southern Ocean to obstruct the Japanese hunt .
Some Japanese academics had begun to say that the annual confrontations on the high seas were counterproductive , and that anti-whaling organisations would be better off stopping .
At the time , Mr Sato did n't accept that thesis .
Now , he does - and indeed , Greenpeace is n't sending ships to the Antarctic any more .
The organisation 's goal is unchanged - an end to Japanese whaling , certainly in the Antarctic .
But it feels it can achieve more now by campaigning with words - by attacking the finances of the hunt , pointing up the reputational damage that Japan suffers as a result of the hunt , and so on .
Greenpeace Japan is a tiny organisation , and one of only a handful campaigning against whaling in the country .
Therefore , the bulk of activism on the issue , the bulk of the pressure , comes from the outside world .
But does the outside world including the activist community understand enough about Japanese society , I wondered , in order to apply that pressure effectively - in order to find the right places and the right times to push , and the right occasions for restraint ?
Mr Sato 's answer - and this should perhaps be salutary for many of the campaign groups here that declaim long , loud and often about what Japan ought and ought not to do - is no , they do n't .
We discussed two ways in which that manifests itself .
One is that change can be wrought much more slowly than in the West ; impatience is unlikely , therefore , to bring rewards .
The second , though , is that over the years , Japanese society and indeed the Japanese government has changed and is changing - as witnessed by the emergence of academics such as Jun Morikawa , whose recent book I discussed in a previous post , who are prepared openly to challenge the justifications put forward by the Japanese government for whaling .
This is n't the 1970s , Mr Sato acknowledged ; and campaigners who want to effect change in Japan should not see things in the same terms as in that era .
Lunches come to an end , and so do blog posts : and so , soon , may liberty end temporarily for Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki .
I hope our conversation provides readers as much food for thought as it did for me .
President Obama will address the nation Tuesday night to talk about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as the White House prepares a plan to require oil giant BP to set up an escrow account to pay for lost income to local businesses as a result of the April 20 explosion .
The 8 p.m. ET speech will take place from the White House shortly after the president returns from a two - day trip to the Gulf .
The president is expected to address efforts to contain the spill , the timeline for capturing the oil , the long - term recovery and restoration of the Gulf region and regulatory reform efforts at the Mineral Management Service .
" This is an ongoing crisis , much like an epidemic , " David Axelrod told NBC television 's " Meet the Press . "
The 10 - 15 minute speech will provide more details about a BP escrow fund the president wants established for fishers and trawlers whose livelihoods have been shot as a result of the spill .
The administration wants a third - party reclamation process rather than BP managing distribution of funds .
The next day , the president will make clear in his meeting with BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg and others about his expectation of BP 's responsibility for caring for people affected by the spill .
" Our mission is to hold them accountable in every appropriate way , " Axelrod said .
The speech comes as the Obama administration faces criticism for a slow reaction time to the Gulf spill , including the approval for the construction of barriers and assistance to the states .
At the same time , frustration is growing about the slow pace of the cleanup and BP 's inability to stop the flow while the estimates on the leak have grown exponentially .
On Sunday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter signed by 54 Democratic senators to BP CEO Tony Hayward demanding his company create a $ 20 billion account to pay for economic damages and cleanup costs .
Currently , lawmakers are debating how much to change the law that limits a company 's liability to $ 75 million .
" Establishment of this account would serve as an act of good faith and as a first step towards ensuring that there will be no delay in payments or attempt to evade responsibility for damages , " the 54 senators wrote .
" Although creating this account at this level in no way limits BP 's liability , we believe it will do more to improve BP 's public image than the costly public relations campaign your company has launched , " the senators wrote .
BP 's board is to meet on Monday to discuss deferring its second - quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known .
The amount of money set aside will be part of White House discussions with BP executives on Wednesday , but Axelrod said it should be " substantial . "

10 One Laptop Per Child
The developing world may be falling behind when competing for resources , but it has n’t even started regarding technology .
The “ One Laptop One Child ” project aims to fix this .
Its goal is to create a rugged , low - cost , low - power , connected computer for children in the third world .
Its XO laptop is about the size of a small textbook , with built - in wireless and a screen readable in direct sunlight ( for children who school outdoors ) .
The computer is extremely durable , energy efficient , and has a childlike industrial design to discourage gray market trafficking — whip this out at the boardroom and everybody will know who ’s NOT getting to use it .
XO laptops have already been delivered to children in Afghanistan and East Africa , with additional shipments scheduled for the Palestinian Occupied Territories .

9 Solar Powered Lightbulb
Though we can’t really fathom it , much of the world is still prisoner to darkness .
Nokero ’s N100 solar - powered light bulb may change that .
This clever product stores electricity from daylight , one of the few commodities rural India , Africa and most of the third world has abundantly .
Designed specifically for use in developing nations , the LED bulbs can provide four hours of light when the battery is fully charged .
That may not sound like much to you or me , but consider the scarce wood burning fuel this replaces .
The N100 is constructed from impact - resistant plastic and includes four solar panels , five LEDs and replaceable NiMH batteries said to last two years .
Complete units cost $ 15 apiece , but may someday cost as little as $ 6 per unit in bulk .

8 Concrete Canvas Shelters
UK firm Concrete Canvas knows too well that “ temporary ” tent cities for refugees offer little protection from the elements , and a more sturdy solution is needed using local materials .
Their solution is Concrete Canvas , an ingenious material for rapidly deployable hardened shelters that require only their product , water and air for construction .
Just pump up the air bladder to provide temporary scaffolding , put the Concrete Canvas on top of the air bladder , and pour fresh or even salt water on the canvas .
Let the canvas dry for 24 hours .
Then remove the air bladder and you have a sturdy ( 25 or 54 sqm ) shelter that can last up to 10 years .
It ’s even waterproof and fireproof .
Two people with no training can assemble the smaller CCS25 version in 24 hours .

7 Universal Nut Sheller
Prior to Jock Brandis’ Universal Nut Sheller , growing and harvesting peanuts in Africa was a time - and - labor intensive affair relegated to women and children .
However , his simple hand - powered device – capable of shelling 50 kilograms ( 110 lb ) of raw , sun -dried peanuts per hour – is now making African nut farming plausible .
The device requires less than $ 50 in common materials to make , lasts 25 years , and just one sheller can serve the needs of a 2,000 person village .
Thus it was no surprise when it won the 2006 Popular Mechanics Breakthrough award .
The Full Belly Project in North Carolina , USA , is working to establish businesses that manufacture and distribute the Universal Nut Sheller , since the machine can quadruple farmer incomes and encourage nut farming , which prevents erosion and returns nitrogen to the soil .
Field feedback indicates that the machine works well with shea nuts in Uganda , but Ghana residents report that the Universal Nut Sheller broke the peanuts into unacceptable sizes .

6 Pot -In - Pot Refrigerator
In 2001 , Nigerian Mohammed Bah Abba won the 2001 Rolex Awards for Enterprise with his invention of a simple cooling system to preserve food in rural areas with no electricity .
His solution was a Pot - in - Pot refrigerator , which relies on the concept of evaporative cooling .
The system works by putting a smaller clay pot inside a larger one , separating the two by constantly moist sand .
Evaporation causes a cooling effect in the inner pot .
Eggplants are reported to stay fresh for 27 days , nine times their usual expiration date .
Tomatoes and peppers can last for up to 21 days ( I ca n’t even get that to happen in my own refrigerator ! )

5 Bike Powered Water Pump
UK Engineering student John Leary knows his “ Gilligan ’s Island ” , and the world may be better off for it .
When challenged to design a product from only waste materials , he created a bicycle - powered water pump for irrigation and water distribution in Guatemala .
NGO Maya Pedal learned of the product and assisted in distribution , since its goal is to improve the daily lives of locals without finicky ( and expensive ) fossil fuel machines .
The product works by plugging a normal bike ’s rear wheel to a friction drive , connected to an electrical pump .
The back tire contacts with the former armature of the motor , and the wheels are moved by raw muscle power .
The machine can pump 40 liters of well water per minute , and locals love the design because it ’s so portable ( when you ’re done pumping , just flip the frame upside down and the pump sits atop the back wheel , so you can ride off to the next well ) .
The machine is now in regular production in Guatemala .

4 Free Wheelchair Mission
Okay , the wheelchair did previously exist , but not one this cheap , and 20 million people in the world need one .
NOW .
After seeing a disabled Moroccan woman drag herself across a busy street , MIT grad Don Schoendorfer and his wife Laurie decided to do something about it .
They reasoned that the key issue was wheelchair affordability , so they developed one with the lowest possible cost .
The resulting FWM wheelchair uses elements already in existence , components currently in manufacture and off - the - shelf parts already being produced in very high volumes .
By using this approach , FWM has an extraordinarily low $ 59.20 manufacturing cost .
The FWM wheelchair is manufactured in China for maximum economy , packed in bulk in 40 ’ ocean - going containers , and shipped directly to the receiving country for highest efficiency .
As of this writing , FWM has delivered 481,655 wheelchairs to 77 countries , all at no cost to the recipients .

3 Hippo Roller Water Project
In some African villages , fetching potable water can take most of an entire day , and is typically a chore left to women and children .
The Hippo Roller is a simple tool for transporting water from distant watering - holes back to homes and villages – an alternative to the traditional 5 - gallon - barrels - on - heads approach .
The product itself is similar to a barrel with a handle that you push ahead of you like a steamroller ’s drum , and has a capacity of 90 liters / 24 gallons .
That ’s nearly a 5X increase in productivity .
In the past 15 years , the Hippo Roller Water Project has distributed over 30,000 rollers , directly benefitting over 200,000 people .

2 Rocket Stove
A rocket stove is a super - efficient heater invented at the Aprovecho Research Center to reduce biomass fuel requirements in developing countries .
It combines the stove ’s air - intake with the fuel - feed slot in an opening terminated by a combustion chamber , which in turn leads to a chimney and heat exchanger .
Rocket Stoves are commonly used today in Lesotho , Malawi , Uganda , Mozambique , Tanzania , and Zambia .
The stoves are easy to build using local materials , and accept small diameter fuel such as twigs and branches .
The resultant heat is directed to a very small area , and greatly reduces the amount of wood fuel needed for cooking and boiling water .
Aprovecho won the 2009 Ashden International Energy Champion Award for its Rocket Stove technology .

1 Lifestraw
In 2009 , an estimated 5,000 deaths from unsafe drinking water occurred every day .
This is down from 6,000 in 2007 , and Vestergaard Frandsen ’s Lifestraw played its ’ part in the decline .
The Lifestraw is a personal , low - cost water purification tool , with a service lifetime of 700 liters , or about one year of water consumption for a single person .
Unlike other water purification products , Lifestraw is intuitive to use , can be worn around the neck , and requires no training , special tools or electricity to operate .
The sucking action of the straw pulls the water through a filter that traps 99.999 % of waterborne bacteria ( such as Salmonella , Shigella , Enterococcus and Staphylococcus ) and 98.7 % of waterborne viruses .
The Lifestraw has won countless awards , including Time Magazine ’s “ Best Invention of 2005 ” , “ Europe ’s Best Innovation ” by Reader ’s Digest , and “ Innovation of the Year ” by Esquire .

+ Corn Sheller
Designing products for developing nations is a unique challenge because inventors are creating technologies for cultures of which they have little , or no , experience .
Ignorance of daily life and values in developing countries can pose difficulty envisioning how people might use an invention , or whether said invention fills a need at all .
Case in point : Compatible Technology International visited Guatemala and observed women hand - shelling corn .
They saw how labor - intensive the manual shelling process was , and , being engineers with a problem in their sights , they quickly developed a corn sheller out of a piece of wood with a hole in the middle .
The women pushed the ear of corn through the hole , shaving the kernels from the cob MUCH more quickly .
So the engineers crafted and donated several of their devices , convinced of their good deed .
But when they returned months later , they found the women still hand - shelling corn .
The women told them , ‘ Thanks for your invention , it ’s much easier .
But this is the time we use to talk about men , school , and kids , and your device makes our work too fast for that . ’
( Take heart guys , Edison had a similar experience selling a vote counter to the US Congress – of course they were talking about bribes and war , not ‘ men , school and kids ’ . )

Die USA bewerten den tödlichen Ausgang des Konflikts um die Hilfsschiffe für Gaza als schweren Schlag für ihre Nahostpolitik .
„ Wir unterstützen den Ruf des UN - Sicherheitsrats nach einer schnellen , objektiven , glaubwürdigen und transparent Untersuchung “ , sagte Außenministerin Hillary Clinton am Dienstag in Washington .
Sie befürchtet , dass der Zwischenfall die Beratungen im UN - Sicherheitsrat über Sanktionen gegen den Iran kompliziert und Amerikas Vermittlungsbemühungen zwischen Israelis und Palästinensern erschwert .
In den Analysen der großen US - Zeitungen wird die Eskalation jedoch vor allem als gravierendes Problem für Israels Regierungschef Benjamin Netanjahu geschildert .
Er gerate zunehmend in internationale Isolation , schreibt die „ Washington Post “ , und verärgere , wie die „ New York Times “ betont , die Türkei , „ Israels wichtigsten Freund in der muslimischen Welt “ .
Die ersten Reaktionen des US - Präsidenten Barack Obama werden als zurückhaltend dargestellt .
In einem Telefongespräch mit Netanjahu hatte er um eine vollständige Aufklärung gebeten und den Verlust an Menschenleben beklagt .
Ein für Dienstag geplanter Besuch Netanjahus bei Obama wurde abgesagt .
Das Weiße Haus betont , das sei auf Netanjahus Wunsch geschehen .
Er habe seine Nordamerikareise wegen der Krise abbrechen und nach Hause zurückkehren müssen .
In den jüngsten Monaten hatten konservative Politiker Obama kritisiert , weil er nachdrücklich einen Stopp des Siedlungsbaus im Westjordanland und in Ostjerusalem verlangte und damit einen offenen Konflikt mit Israel auslöste , das Republikaner oft „ unseren engsten Verbündeten “ nennen .
Die Berichte , Analysen und Kommentare zu der Konfrontation nehmen breiten Raum in den US - Medien ein .
Im Vergleich zur Berichterstattung in Deutschland findet die israelische Darstellung der Abläufe mehr Gehör .
Es werden gleichermaßen Bilder toter und verwundeter Aktivisten auf den Schiffen sowie Fotos israelischer Soldaten mit schweren Schlagverletzungen gezeigt .
Den Augenzeugenberichten der auf den Schiffen mitfahrenden Journalisten werden die Augenzeugenberichte israelischer Journalisten gegenübergestellt , die den Militäreinsatz begleiteten .
Mehrere Blätter stellen die Frage , ob die Blockade des Gazastreifens noch sinnvoll sei .
WASHINGTON – The Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance of the AFL - CIO announced the unexpected death of its national president , John Delloro , who died of a heart attack .
Delloro was elected APALA president in 2009 and was one of the youngest leaders ever elected to this position .
Delloro also served as executive director of the Dolores Huerta Labor Institute , where he was a member of the American Federation of Teachers .
“ We are all saddened by the sudden passing of John Delloro , a brilliant young labor leader , who made incredible contributions to APALA and to the U.S. labor movement , ” said Luisa Blue , APALA first vice president .
Delloro was a student leader and activist at UCLA , where he received his BA in psychology in 1994 , and his MA in Asian American Studies in 1996 .
Soon after , Delloro was introduced to APALA as a participant in the APALA Organizing Institute , a program that has trained the next generation of Asian Pacific American union organizers and community activists .
Delloro ’s first position in the labor movement was organizing hotel workers in Las Vegas with the Culinary Workers Union 226 .
He went on to organize clerical workers with AFSCME , and health care workers with SEIU 399 in Los Angeles , Calif .
While at SEIU 399 , he created a member organizing program that trained hundreds of rank - and - file members that actively participated in union - support and community organizing campaigns .
In 2003 , he was promoted to the Southwest Area Manager of SEIU 1000 , the largest state workers union in the country at the time , with close to 100,000 members .
Under Delloro ’s leadership at the Dolores Huerta Labor Institute , the program strengthened labor studies on all nine campuses , and has exposed thousands of community college students to unions .
Since 2007 , he also taught Asian American Studies at UCLA , and inspired and mentored hundreds of students .
Delloro broke ground when , as president , APALA and the AFL - CIO convened the first National Asian Pacific American Workers ’ Rights Hearing in Washington D.C. in November 2009 .
Following the hearing , Delloro was a principal author in “ Breaking Ground , Breaking Silence : a report from the first National Asian Pacific American Workers ’ Rights Hearing . ”
That same year , Delloro received the Unsung Hero Award from the Asian Pacific Americans for Progress .
As a nationally recognized union leader , labor educator , organizer , teacher and mentor , John Delloro touched the lives of many and will be remembered for his compassion , his generosity of spirit , and for his visionary leadership , ” said Kent Wong , APALA founding president .
People ’s World correspondent Rosalio Muñoz remembered Delloro at demonstrations , picketlines and Facebook .
“ I knew John , not well , but at events we got to chatting .
John was modest , bright in spirit and intellect .
I first met him when he helped lead , with then - Assembly member Judy Chu , a rally supporting the striking Southern California grocery workers in the heart of the Asian Pacific American community of the San Gabriel Valley .
He was representative of the new generation of labor activists . ”
John Delloro is survived by his wife Dr. Susan Suh , a sociologist and community activist , and their two young children , Mina and Malcolm .
The Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance ( APALA ) , AFL - CIO was founded in 1992 as the first and only national organization for Asian Pacific American union members to advance worker , immigrant and civil rights .

Another Nail in the Pageview Coffin
This weekend , msnbc.com launched a sweeping redesign of the most important part of their site : the story page .
The result is something unlike anything any other major news site is offering and is a bold step in a direction no competitor has gone down ( yet ) : the elimination of pageviews as a primary metric .
For many years , I ’ve railed against tricks like pagination and “ jump pages ” as a means to goose pageviews .
Honest people in the industry will tell you these are simply acceptable tricks to bump revenue a bit , while disingenuous or uninformed people will use “ readability ” as an excuse to make users click ten times to read ten parts of a single story .
For this latest redesign , msnbc.com has decided to de-emphasize page views entirely and present stories in a manner that maximizes enjoyment and as a result , total time on site .
What do I mean by this ?
Think of how a typical user session works on most news sites these days .
A user loads an article ( 1 pageview ) , pops open a slideshow ( 1 pageview ) , flips through 30 slides of an HTML - based slideshow ( 30 pageviews ) .
That ’s 32 pageviews and a lot of extraneous downloading and page refreshing .
On new msnbc.com story pages , the above sequence would register one pageview : the initial one .
The rest of the interactions occur within the page itself .
Can msnbc.com serve ad impressions against in - page interactions ?
Sure , and that ’s key to the strategy , but as a user , your experience is much smoother , and as an advertiser , the impressions you purchase are almost guaranteed to come across human eyes since your ads are only loaded upon user interaction .
This is the first time ( to my knowledge ) this sort of model has been deployed on a major media site with over a billion pageviews a month , and it has the potential to change the entire industry if it works .
It ’s also a big risk , as most advertisers are not used to thinking of inventory this way .
We like big risks with big payoffs though and we feel that when you take care of the user and the advertiser at the same time , you ’re probably onto something .
Ad model aside , there are also tons of other interesting things about the new msnbc.com story pages :
Every form of storytelling ( text , video , audio , slideshows , discussion , voting , and more ) is now available right within each story page itself .
The top navigation ( nicknamed “ the upscroll ” ) contains all basic elements when a page loads but if you scroll the page upward past its initial position , you get more interesting stories to read .
It ’s a great way of presenting a content - packed header without sacrificing screen real estate .
A social bar at the bottom of the screen , powered by Newsvine , which lets you easier share content via Newsvine , Facebook , Twitter , and other services .
An “ annotated scrollbar ” down the right side of the screen capable of teleporting you to any section of the page you desire .
Bigger , easier to read text .
Goodbye Arial , once and for all !
To be clear , the msnbc.com team is very proud of what ’s been launched so far , but is under no illusions that things are perfect yet .
Everyone involved in creating these new story pages is monitoring reaction closely and ready to modify anything that needs improvement .
Since we have plenty of thoughtful design and development voices here on Mike Industries , I ’d love to open this thread up for some reactions .
What is working for you , and what , if anything , would you change ?
The team is listening .
A father is behind bars , arrested for allegedly kidnapped his own children from California 14 years ago , and bringing them to Central Florida to live .
For years , investigators have been searching for him , but it was the social networking website Facebook that delivered the break it took more than a decade to get , MyFox Orlando reports .
Faustino Utrera is now charged with two counts of kidnapping , and two counts of violating child custody orders .
According to the Osceola County Sheriff 's Office , Utrera was at a bus stop on Wednesday at about 2:30 in the afternoon , waiting to pick up his 16 - year - old son from school , when he was taken into custody .
Faustino 's 16 - year - old son and 17 - year - old daughter had been attending celebration high school .
Investigators said the family of three had actually been living in the palm key mobile home park in Polk County .
Investigators said that in 1995 , Utrera took his two kids from the family 's San Bernardino , California home and disappeared .
Then just last march , investigators said the mother of the children was on Facebook and found her daughter .
When she began conversing online , her very own daughter , who had n't seen her since she was 3 years old , told her mom she wanted nothing to do with her and deleted her Facebook page .
San Bernardino authorities issued an out - of - state arrest warrant , and this past Wednesday , Osceola County deputies caught up with Utrera .
We know Faustino 's daughter is about to turn 18 , and she officially graduated from celebration high school on Thursday night .
For now , both children are in the custody of the State of Florida .

Bonus , Spezialangebote und sonstige Angebote bei Internet Casinos
Einige Menschen sind der festen Meinung , dass Internet Casinos und bestimmte Casino Spiele erst so richtig gut mit unglaublichen Bonusangeboten werden , doch das stimmt nicht ganz .
Zuerst einmal versprechen viele dieser Angebote mehr als sie halten können und sind einzig und allein dazu da , um unerfahrene Spieler anzulocken .
Es gibt eine ganz einfache Regel hierzu , die besagt „ Was zu gut aussieht , um wahr zu sein , ist in der Regel dann auch nicht wahr “ .
Lassen
Sie sich niemals zu schnell auf irgendwelche Angebote ein !
Haben
Sie immer ein wachsames Auge auf die Details jeglicher Bonusangebote .
Im Kleingedruckten kann man nämlich die Geschäftsbedingungen nachlesen , die im übrigen immer frei verfügbar sein sollten .
Jedes seriöse Casinos kümmert sich um seine Spieler nach bestem Gewissen , dass sämtliche Geschäftbedingungen und Spielregeln normalerweise einfach und verständlich einsehbar sind .
Regeln werden bis zum kleinsten Detail ganz genau erklärt und manche Casinos gehen sogar soweit , dass sie Spielern auch noch Strategien für die einzelnen Spiele wie z.B. Automatenspiele , Video Automatenspiele , Roulette , Video Poker , Craps , Baccarat , Bingo oder Keno anbieten .
Sie haben es sich zum Ziel gemacht , dem Casinokunden ein unvergessliches positives Erlebnis zu bieten , damit Sie dann auch wirklich jeden Moment geniessen können beim Spielen der bekanntesten und meistgewünschten Casino Spiele der Welt .
Wie spielt man denn nun Internet Casino Spiele ?
Internetspiele wie z.B. Automatenspiele , Video Automatenspiele , Blackjack , Roulette , Video Poker , Craps , Baccarat , Bingo oder Keno haben vielmehr miteinander gemeinsam als man vermuten möchte .
Natürlich ist auf den ersten Blick schon klar , dass Craps nicht allzu viel Gemeinsamkeiten mit Video Automatenspielen hat …Sie werden jedoch überrascht sein , wie diese dann doch bei näherem Hinsehen Ähnlichkeiten zeigen .
Casino Spielregeln braucht man , um ein Spiel spielen zu können , sie sind jedoch keine Garantie auf einen Gewinn .
Wenn
Sie sich also wundern , wie man z.B. Baccarat oder Roulette spielt , dann müssen
Sie auch wissen , wie man sich zu benehmen hat , um am Ende keine böse Überraschungen zu erleben .
Einige Casino Spielstrategien beziehen sich ganz klar auf zwei Aspekte , und zwar sollten Sie auf jeden Fall natürlich genug Geld in Ihrem Casinokonto oder Bankkonto haben , da man natürlich nicht gerade dann aufhören möchte , wenn man eine Glückssträhne hat .
Doch Vorsicht !
Setzen Sie sich ein Budget und eine bestimmte Zeit , die Sie beim Spielen verbringen wollen und halten Sie sich daran !
So werden Sie dann an einem schlechten Tag nicht mehr Geld verlieren als unbedingt nötig .
Die Verwaltung Ihres Geldes ist wahrscheinlich die wichtigste Casinostrategie die wie Ihnen mit auf den
Weg geben möchten , da sie für den Anfänger genauso wichtig wie für den Experten ist !
Internet Spieletips
Die meisten Casino Spielregeln bringen
Ihnen bei wie man Wetten abgibt , wann man diese abgibt , aber auch , wann man diese nicht abgeben sollte .
Ganz ehrlich , Casino Spieletips und Strategien brauchen Sie , wenn
Sie sich gern von der Masse absetzen und reichlichere Gewinne als die anderen Spieler im Internet nach Hause bringen wollen .
Stellen
Sie sich doch ganz einfach einmal vor , dass Sie Ihre Zeit mit Automatenspielen verbringen .
Und auf einmal erdrehen Sie den Jackpot ... was jetzt ?
Was sollte man nun am besten machen ?
Weiterspielen , oder doch lieber sofort aufhören ?
Eigentlich sollte man sich schon ein wenig an die Faustregel halten , „ Wenn es am schönsten ist , dann sollte man aufhören “ .
Wenn
Sie nun weiterspielen würden , dann würden sich Ihre Gewinnchancen nicht erhöhen , ganz im Gegenteil , sie würden sich verringern .
Ein anderer guter
Tip ist auch , sich an seiner Geldbörse zu orientieren .
Wenn diese recht klein ist , dann sollten Sie auch nur kleine Einsätze machen .
Falls
Sie ein progressives Spiel spielen , dann setzen Sie natürlich die maximale Zahl an Münzen , damit Sie so sicher gehen können , sich auf jeden Fall ein kleines Stück des Jackpot - Kuchens abschneiden zu können .
Internet Casino Spiele machen Spass , können allerdings auch jede Menge negative Emotionen und Gefühle hervorrufen .
Sich auf Foren aufzuhalten und anderen Spielergemeinschaften anzuschliessen kann sich durchaus auszahlen , vielleicht sogar mehr als jede Theorie ihnen je vermitteln kann .
Und sollten
Sie dann irgendwann einmal gar nicht mehr weiterkommen , können Sie sich noch immer an den Kundenservice Ihres Casinos wenden , um herauszufinden wie effizient und hilfsbereit diese sind ?
Casino Spiele – Spielgeldmodus vs. Echtgeldmodus
He admitted with slight embarrassment that his English pronunciation and grammar were not great , and trying to communicate with his toddler in a language he himself is struggling with has led to problems .
“ One day I was trying to tell him this is how you button your shirt , ” he said , switching into Cantonese .
“ But then I could n’t say it in English , so I had to ring up a friend and ask . ”
I asked : Does n’t he think it is better to talk to his toddler in the language he is most at ease in ?
“ I think you ’ve lived abroad for too long — you do n’t understand what parents here have to think about , ” the boy ’s mother said .
“ Competition for international schools is fierce .
If we do n’t make sure he speaks English now , he wo n’t pass the interview . ”
I looked at her very cute toddler , who was busy chasing a ball on the floor , and felt a bit sad .
The boy is not yet two , and he was still babbling away in baby words .
Yet in this competitive world , it is considered better for him to be exposed only to English , a language that his parents are not confident speaking but one they believe is more valuable than their native tongue .
More and more , ambitious parents in Hong Kong are giving their children a head - start in English by putting them into English - speaking play groups , kindergartens and international schools .
At these elite institutions , Mandarin Chinese is sometimes taught as a second language .
As for the local Cantonese dialect , who cares ?
I am saddened .
What will happen to those age - old nursery rhymes our grandmothers taught us , the songs we sang at kindergarten , those Tang - dynasty poems that every preschool child was taught to recite ?

For extremely overweight or morbidly obese individuals who have made many unsuccessful attempts at losing weight , stomach staple surgery may be one of their few remaining weight loss solutions .
This is a major operation , during which a bariatric surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach where it meets the esophagus .
The procedure is done through the use of staples and a band that is filled with saline which can expand and contract .
The success of weight loss surgery often depends on the willingness of the patient to change his or her eating and exercise habits .
There are also significant side effects and risks associated with this surgery , which means that it should only be done after serious consideration of all the potential risks and rewards .
Vertical Banded Gastroplasty ( VBG )
In bariatric medicine , stomach stapling – also known as gastric stapling or gastroplasty – is a surgical technique which uses gastric staples to reduce the size of the stomach , creating a “ new ” stomach pouch .
The pouch will typically be big enough to hold one to three ounces of food at a time .
At the lower end of this “ new ” stomach , an opening of about two centimeters is created .
This slows down the passage of food , allowing the individual to feel full sooner .
As a result , the individual can eat only a small quantity of food at a time .
Sometimes stomach staple surgery is done in conjunction with another procedure called a malabsorptive operation , in which food from the stomach is diverted past much of the small intestine .
This dramatically limits the ability of the body to absorb calories and nutrients from the food , resulting in rapid weight loss .
After Stomach Staple Surgery
After stomach staple surgery , a patient will be forced to change daily eating patterns .
It will be necessary to eat food in smaller amounts and to chew thoroughly .
The patient will not be able to eat foods high in sugar or fat , because these foods empty from the stomach more quickly than foods high in protein or complex carbohydrates , thereby leading to uncomfortable side effects .
This is formally known as “ dumping syndrome , ” where food passes through the new stomach opening too rapidly , causing weakness , nausea , dizziness and vomiting .
The patient will also need to take nutritional supplements for the rest of his or her life , because there will not be enough nutrition in the reduced portions of food .
Regular physical activity will also be required , despite it not having been a part of the patient ’s life prior to the surgery .
Stomach Staple Surgery Cost
How much does stomach staple surgery cost ?
The price for bariatric stomach stapling averages between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 .
Stomach stapling is considered major weight loss surgery .
To be accepted for bariatric surgery , an individual needs to have a body mass index ( BMI ) of over 40 .
For males , this means being at least 100 pounds overweight for their height .
Females must be at least 80 pounds over the healthy weight range for their height .
Health insurance may or may not cover the operation , depending on the particular insurance plan .
Will Stomach Staple Surgery Lead to Permanent Weight Loss ?
In most cases , maximum weight loss is reached in 12 to 24 months after the surgery .
Unfortunately , some individuals will not be successful , as permanent weight loss depends greatly on an individual ’s motivation to make permanent changes to his or her lifestyle habits .
Even more than the surgery itself , these other factors remain the keys to successful weight loss and weight maintenance for the longer term .
Complete weight loss takes anywhere from 12 to 24 months after stomach staple surgery is performed .
But long - term success of weight loss surgery ultimately depends on the individual ’s motivation to change his or her lifestyle .
Is Stomach Staple Surgery Dangerous ?
While stomach stapling is a fairly straightforward procedure , it still carries risks .
After the surgery , consumption of sugar and fat can cause what is known as “ dumping syndrome , ” in which food moves through the stomach too quickly , leading to nausea , vomiting , muscle weakness , and even fainting :
In addition , from 10 to 20 percent of those individuals who undergo this form of gastric bypass surgery will require at least one follow - up operation due to complications .
For example , the staples can deteriorate and will need replacement .
In a small number of cases , stomach juices from can leak into the abdomen , requiring immediate emergency surgery .
In less than one percent of stomach staple surgery cases , infection can lead to death .
Clearly , the risks and rewards of this type of weight loss surgery should be considered very carefully through consultation with a bariatric physician experienced in bariatric gastric bypass before deciding to go ahead .
Make sure your surgeon is board certified , and ask to speak to other patients who have had a similar procedure performed to gauge their satisfaction .

Nothing but mad love for this song / video !
Eminem is back and stronger than ever .
The controversial rapper who struggled for years with an addiction to painkillers and anti-depressants is now clean and spitting rhymes fused with an edge of deep rooted empowerment .
Eminem , who nearly lost his life after an accidental methadone overdose , admitted to popping as many as 20 pills a day at the height of his problems .
A perhaps unlikely source , Sir Elton John , helped Eminem throughout his battle with coming clean .
John battled drugs and alcohol addictions early on in his career but has been sober since the 1980s .
The odd pairing first caused controversy when John made a surprise appearance with Eminem at the 2001 Grammy Awards .
Many protested the collaboration citing Eminem ’s lyrics at the time as being filled with hatred and homophobia .
But that all seems to be a thing of the past , as Eminem ’s new single Not Afraid is heightened with a true sense of maturity and a person who has risen from the ash of a dark journey in the theme of the song .
It ’s undoubtedly an anthem for anyone who has ever felt afraid to face the demons in their own life .
In an interview with BBC Radio in January , John said : “ I ’ve been helping Eminem over the last 18 months and he ’s doing brilliantly . ”

In an exclusive report for Military.com we reveal that US Spec Ops Command has abandoned the 5.56 version of the SCAR and will use FY 2011 money to buy more 7.62 Mk - 17s to fill a " capability gap " for a 7.62 battle rifle .

In a surprising reversal that follows years of effort to design a one - of - a- kind commando rifle , the U.S. military ’s Special Operations Command has abruptly decided to abandon the new SOCOM Combat Assault rifle – the “ SCAR , ” as the rifle is commonly known – in favor of previously - fielded carbines .
Details provided exclusively to Military.com reveal that SOCOM , the Tampa - based command that oversees the training and equipping of SEALs , Green Berets , Air Force Special Tactics Teams and Marine SOC groups , will stop purchasing the 5.56 mm Mk - 16 Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle and might require all units who now have them to turn the new weapons back into the armory .
“ The Mk - 16 does not provide enough of a performance advantage over the M - 4 to justify spending USSOCOM 's limited … funds when competing priorities are taken into consideration , ” officials at USSOCOM said in an email response to questions from Military.com .
“ Currently , three of USSOCOM ’s four components receive the 5.56 mm M - 4 from their parent service as a service common equipment item . "
A couple things to note here , so far SOCOM has purchased 850 Mk - 16s and 750 Mk - 17s -- way below their original requirement .
The weird thing to consider here is that the requirement was for a 5.56 and that was what was competed .
Now they 're buying a 7.62 that has no written requirement document attached to it .
Further , the SEALs are going to be particularly in the hurt locker on this one since the Navy does n't buy their guns , SOCOM does .
I hear that it was Naval Special Warfare that really pushed this program and that it was the USASOC that basically killed it .
More of the Mk - 16s were fielded to SEALs than any other unit within SOCOM .
Also of note : I hear that the services who have them will have to hand back their Mk - 16s when they 're back from deployment and pick up their old SOPMOD M4s or HK - 416s .
So so a final goodbye to your SCAR - 16 when you 're back from The Box .
Two well - informed industry analysts tell me that SCAR - maker FNH - USA will try to sell SOCOM on the idea of a Mk - 17 common receiver that can be turned into a 5.56 or other caliber by switching out part of the lower receiver .
So FNH - USA is positioning itself to rescue the Mk - 16 through the Mk - 17 .
But there 's no indication that SOCOM is biting .
There will certainly be more on this story as it develops , but I wanted Kit Up ! readers to be the first to know .
Have a great weekend !

Could Super Solar Flares Take Us Back To 5000 BC ?
London , UK - 17th June 2010 , 12:50 GMT
Dear ATCA Open & Philanthropia Friends
[ Please note that the views presented by individual contributors are not necessarily representative of the views of ATCA , which is neutral .
ATCA conducts collective Socratic dialogue on global opportunities and threats . ]
It is a very simple equation : Energy = Civilisation .
Without any form of energy we regress to circa 5000 BC .
Energy powers every aspect of our modern lifestyle : clean water , fresh food , lighting , comfortable shelter , mobility , communication , safety and security .
Our very own giant hot star , the sun , is earth 's primary source of energy .
On June 12th , at 00:55 Universal Time , an M2 - class solar flare sparked a bright flash of extreme ultraviolet radiation , propelling a shock wave through the sun 's atmosphere , and hurling a billion - ton Coronal Mass Ejection ( CME ) into space .
According to scientists at NASA 's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) , " The sun is waking up from a deep slumber , and in the next few years we expect to see much higher levels of solar activity ... at the same time , our technological society has developed an unprecedented sensitivity to solar storms . "
One needs to go back over 8,000 years in order to find a time when the sun was , on average , as active as it is at present !
The sun supports almost all life on earth via photosynthesis and drives earth 's climate and weather .
Solar flares have been connected with weather extremes , and there have been some powerful lightning storms in recent days :
1. BP temporarily suspended siphoning operations on its Gulf of Mexico oil gusher after a drill ship collecting the oil was hit by lightning ;
2. A 62 feet -- six storey -- tall statue of Jesus Christ in Ohio came to a blazing end when it was struck by lightning in a thunderstorm and burned to the ground ; and
3 . A bolt of lightning struck a local gasoline storage tank in North Carolina , erupting into a wall of flames that leapt as high as 100 feet and belched a plume of smoke in the shape of an arch across eight lanes of US interstate highway .
The one critical factor that did not operate according to plan in many of the recent severe lightning - strikes was the electrical grounding system , which was supposed to draw lightning away from the structures .
The sun has begun to awaken and possibly exhale a massive solar storm on planet earth 's electromagnetic field .
Are several interlocking factors in play that could bring life as we know it to a stand - still via a catastrophic disruption ?
Catastrophic Disruption
Our 21st century society is micro-managed by computers , 24/7 internet communications and interlocking electric grids .
All are extremely vulnerable to outside forces , both natural and man-made .
The National Academy of Sciences 2008 report titled " Severe Space Weather Events -- Societal and Economic Impacts , " predicts that our sophisticated technology is vulnerable to a severe solar storm .
In a worst case scenario , developed countries with high - tech cities could face blackouts and devastating financial costs 20 times higher than the economic damage caused by Hurricane Katrina .
Sometimes catastrophe records are shattered abruptly by a wide margin .
Now that it has been recalculated that the BP gusher is spilling over 60,000 barrels of oil a day since April 20th , as opposed to the original estimate of 5,000 barrels per day , this means we are adding the equivalent of one Exxon Valdez catastrophe every four days .
So far , that equates to more than 13 times the potency of Exxon Valdez in 1989 , and counting .
Coronal Mass Ejections ( CME ) and Electro - Magnetic Pulse ( EMP )
The most dangerous type of solar flares for humanity are the Coronal Mass Ejections ( CMEs ) that occur during the most active period of the sun 's 11 - year cycles .
This time , the zenith of CMEs is set for 2012 as the solar cycle # 24 reaches a crescendo .
A CME happens when gas erupts from the solar corona -- " crown " of outer atmosphere surrounding the sun -- and carries a massive amount of radioactive material that can reach earth in three to five days .
One potentially catastrophic disruption humanity is not prepared for is an Electro - Magnetic Pulse ( EMP ) or a burst of electromagnetic radiation from a major Coronal Mass Ejection ( CME ) from the sun .
This would create a sudden , massive fluctuation in the earth 's electromagnetic field similar to the detonation of a High - altitude Electro - Magnetic Pulse ( HEMP ) nuclear device .
The resulting electric and magnetic fields would then couple with electrical grid systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges .
Solar flares vary in strength , and are highly radioactive , with x-rays and extreme heat .
Their impact varies for the two sides of the same coin :
1. Humanity :
We are normally protected from extreme solar radiation by the earth 's atmosphere and magnetosphere .
Earth 's magnetosphere deflects huge bursts of energy and keeps us from cooking like food in a microwave oven .
However , strong solar flares can have a significant impact on degrading the earth 's magnetic field , letting the harmful rays through .
2. Technology : Solar flares can damage satellites and x-rays can disturb radio and other wireless communications .
Although there have been big sun storms before in history , we have never been this dependent on the technology they can disrupt .
Small microprocessors and chips that power our vehicles ; the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) that helps us navigate ; Internet , satellite and mobile phones can all be affected .
Immediate cash sources such as Automated Teller Machines ( ATMs ) and credit card transactions may also malfunction .
In the event of an EMP nothing using electrical or electronic systems may function correctly .
This means no power for :
i . Pumping fuel into vehicles ;
ii .
Recharging batteries for flashlights , radios , pocket computers or communication devices ;
iii .
Withdrawing cash or using credit cards to pay for food , fuel and services ; and
iv .
Transportation of food , essential goods and professionals for emergency and healthcare services .
Semi-Permanent Damage
If a truly massive Coronal Mass Ejection ( CME ) hits earth , it could practically take out the world 's electricity distribution on a semi-permanent basis .
It would take many years , if not decades , to repair the world 's electrical system , even if replacement parts were immediately available .
There would be massive damage to power generation , distribution facilities , substations and countless transformers and switching equipment everywhere .
When high power transformers used in substations or on utility poles are damaged , they must be scrapped or rebuilt .
If the factories that create or repair these electrical components are also without power , they will be unable to rebuild or repair electrical equipment .
With an AC power outage , there will be no diesel fuel available to fill the tanks of large heavy goods vehicles used to transport and install the massive electrical components .
It takes an enormous amount of power to bring a power plant online .
This power must come from another power plant .
If all power plants were knocked off line , or all those in a specific region , there would be no means to start them back up again .
It would take a year or two to get one operational again and additional years to power the rest .
So it might be a decade for human civilisation to achieve a semblance of what it was , prior to the paralysis caused by a massive electromagnetic pulse .
US Department of Defense ( DoD ) EMP Tests
Earlier this year , when the US DoD tested the effects of an Electro - Magnetic Pulse ( EMP ) generator , the expected EMP level required to disable vehicles based on previous studies was 30 to 80 kV / m ( kilo Volt per metre ) .
However , the DoD began testing at only 5 kV / m .
Driving a 2010 Toyota Prius through the path of the EMP generator pulse , the car dashboard immediately went blank and the Prius halted .
This is the result of using smaller microchips and circuits , which makes them even more susceptible to EMP .
Consider then that our entire 21st century civilisation is completely dependent on computers for power , lifestyle synchronisation , and everything else we do .
Yet we do n't have any backup in the event of a massive electromagnetic pulse .
Carrington Event
Bursts of electromagnetic radiation have occurred before , the most notable being the Carrington event when the most powerful solar storm in recorded history hit earth .
Just before noon on September 1st 1859 , Richard Carrington -- a 33 year old British astronomer -- was observing an image of the sun on a white screen and was drawing the sunspots and solar flares .
Suddenly , two beads of intense white light appeared over the sunspots .
In sixty seconds the light had significantly diminished , and within five minutes completely disappeared from the screen .
Just before dawn the next day , skies all over planet earth erupted in red , green , and purple auroras so brilliant that newspapers could be read as easily as in daylight .
Carrington wrote that the glow of the flare brought campers out of their beds .
They thought it was morning .
They began preparing breakfast !
Stunning auroras pulsated even at near tropical latitudes over Cuba , the Bahamas , Jamaica , El Salvador , and Hawaii .
Worldwide , telegraph systems -- the only equipment resembling today 's Internet and electrical grid in place at the time -- went berserk .
Carrington 's report makes reference to spark discharges that electrified telegraph lines , shocked telegraph operators and set telegraph paper on fire .
Even when the telegraphers disconnected the batteries powering the lines , aurora - induced electric currents in the wires still allowed messages to be transmitted !
On March 13th 1989 , during the solar maximum of solar cycle # 22 , the northeast US and eastern Canada experienced a geomagnetic storm as a result of a large solar flare .
This disrupted power in Quebec blacking out 6 million people for 9 hours .
Like the Carrington event , this also induced current into the lines , causing power surges that melted a transformer in New Jersey .
There were also 200 other incidents reported on the North American power grid including a nuclear power plant in New Jersey .
What would happen today if another solar flare the size of the 1859 Carrington Event were to hit earth ?
According to a report by the National Academy of Science ( NAS ) it could induce electrical currents that would knock out at least 300 main transformers cutting off power to 130 million people , all within 90 seconds .
Disruptions throughout the solar system suggest that the present solar cycle # 24 is likely to produce Coronal Mass Ejections ( CMEs ) rivaling that of the 1859 Carrington Event .
If this were to happen during dry conditions , many wooded parts would be totally in flames .
The smoke and heat could affect weather patterns in places far removed from the fires not to mention disruptions in the food supply chain .
Cascading catastrophic occurrences could happen concurrently .
There would be no help to call on , since everyone would be busy dealing with their own local emergencies .
Further :
1. Loss of ground cover ;
2. Failure of irrigation systems due to a lack of electric power ; and
3. Persistent use of herbicides which have destroyed natural ground cover ;
would set us up for dust storms that might dwarf the ones in the 1930s during the Great Depression .
We would , as before , probably see mass migrations to more sustainable regions .
Why The Sudden Commotion ?
Some scientists believe an incoming brown dwarf star , several times the mass of Jupiter , is responsible for disrupting our solar system 's heliosphere .
The brown dwarf has disturbed Pluto 's orbit .
It is also disturbing the orbit of Jupiter and the rest of the celestial bodies in our solar system .
The sun is emitting Coronal Mass Ejections ( CMEs ) during the last few months that are having a significant impact on the earth 's geomagnetic axis and electromagnetic field .
Conclusion : Prevention and Precaution
We must implement measures to protect our electrical power grids from a catastrophic Electro - Magnetic Pulse ( EMP ) event caused by a super solar Coronal Mass Ejection ( CME ) .
Without intervention our modern civilisation remains utterly defenceless .
Clean water , fresh food , lighting , comfortable shelter , mobility , communication , safety and security , would no longer be available or accessible , without electricity .
The electrical power grids enable the superior quality of lifestyle and advanced standard of living within our 21st century tightly networked civilisation .
Without modern technology at our fingertips , we would collectively revert back to sub- standard survival living circa 5000 BC within a matter of weeks .
We no longer have skills or equipment to live as we did a thousand years ago .
In such a scenario , sustainable off grid communities -- cities or regions using alternative energy sources -- may fair better .
Avoiding some of the damage , they may be able to sustain some degree of normalcy , working infrastructure and capability .
The electric grids around the world are dynamic and real time , having no storage .
Production is dynamically orchestrated to meet current demand .
Given that we do not have storage of energy and depend on a real time system , this is a severe vulnerability which also decreases efficiency .
However , backed with USD 75 million in US Department of Energy smart grid demonstration grants , the first large - scale distributed battery storage project is being started in the US .
The main US agency for watching the sun is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's ( NOAA ) Space Environment Center ( SEC ) .
The SEC warns of impending solar storms so electric power , cell phone and satellite companies ought to take precautions .
Tens of millions of dollars in protective measures properly implemented prior to an EMP event are likely to result in trillions of dollars saved following an EMP event .
Ideally , all modern electronics ought to be EMP hardened , which is not possible .
Given the practical constraints , parliamentary measures to protect the most critical infrastructure -- such as generators , substations , power transformers and switching equipment of our national grid(s ) -- must be implemented as soon as possible .
By protecting the national grid(s ) through EMP hardening of critical electrical - electronic devices and equipment we can reduce the power grids ' vulnerability to damaging surges .
NASA also advises :
1 . The private sector ;
2 . Air travel industry ; and
3. Electric power utilities
to take special precautions for the future when a colossal solar storm surges through earth .
Smaller components and communications equipment -- necessary to maintain continuity of operations during an emergency -- also need to be protected from an EMP event .
The time to initiate pre-emptive action is now , before a super solar flare takes us back to circa 5000 BC ?

A NYC Cop Officer David London , Beat an Iraqi War Veteran Walter Harvin , Senseless for not showing him his ID .
Prosecutors have released potentially explosive evidence against an NYPD officer on trial for beating a man with his baton .
The video taken from security cameras shows the 45 - year - old housing cop beating an Iraq war veteran with is baton .
It happened at an Upper West Side public housing development .
The victim , 28 - year - old Walter Harvin had just returned from Iraq and was at his mom 's apartment complex .
The video is high quality and crystal clear that Housing Officer David London led an unprovoked attack on the Iraqi war veteran .
Even beating the ex-soldier after he 's cuffed .
The officer is charged with 2nd degree assault and filing false records .
Prosecutors say London tried to cover - up the July 2007 assault by lying on official documents .
Right now the Manhattan criminal jury is tackling the question on whether London committed an act of police brutality or used necessary force to subdue a suspect .
The Iraq veteran suffers from PTSD .
If the officer is convicted , he faces 7 years in prison .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has hinted at a whole new approach to climate change - a greener ETS , passed sooner than planned .
The federal government has officially delayed its ETS until at least 2013 after failing to convince the Liberals to pass it .
But Mr Rudd changed tack during a media conference with a well - known advocate for action on climate change today .
He opened the door to passing an ETS after this year 's election , and with the help of the Australian Greens , not the Liberals .
A recent poll shows Labor is losing votes to the Greens , who have soared to a record level of support .
Starving people in drought - stricken west Africa are being forced to eat leaves and collect grain from ant hills , say aid agencies , warning that 10 million people face starvation across the region .
With food prices soaring and malnourished livestock dying , villagers were turning to any sources of food to stay alive , said Charles Bambara , Oxfam officer for the west African region .
" People are eating wild fruit and leaves , and building ant hills just to capture the tiny amount of grain that the ants collect inside .
" The situation here in Chad is desperate .
There is not enough food in the country , over 2 million people here are not getting enough , " said Bambara .
In Niger , which the United Nations classifies as the world 's least developed country , starving families are eating flour mixed with wild leaves and boiled plants .
More than 7 million people – almost half the population – currently face food insecurity in the country , making it the hardest hit by the crisis .
According to UN agencies , 200,000 children need treatment for malnutrition in Niger alone .
" Niger is at crisis point now and we need to act quickly before this crisis becomes a full - blown humanitarian disaster , " said Caroline Gluck , an Oxfam representative in the country .
With food prices spiralling , people are being forced to slaughter malnourished livestock , traditionally the only form of income .
" When you walk through the markets , you can see that there is food here .
The problem is that the ability to buy it has disappeared .
People here depend on livestock to support themselves , but animals are being killed on the edge of exhaustion , and that means they are being sold for far less money .
And on top of that , the cost of food basics has risen , " explained Gluck .
Compounding the crisis , thousands of animals have starved to death as villagers use animal fodder to feed themselves .
Oxfam has launched a £ 7 m emergency appeal to try to avert a humanitarian catastrophe , after failed harvests and widespread drought brought severe hunger and malnutrition across the region .
Save the Children has launched a separate £ 7 m appeal .
" This is just the beginning of the traditional hunger period , and people have already been forced to sell their livestock .
This is very early for the alarm bells to be ringing , before Niger has even reached the start of the most critical part of the food calendar .
You can imagine three to four months down the line how shocking the situation will be , " said Gluck .
" Yesterday I saw women sifting through gravel at the side of the road , trying to find some grains that may have been blown from aid trucks , " said Gluck , as hungry and impoverished villagers flocked to the country 's capital , Niamey , in search of food .
Gluck has likened the developing situation to that of the 1984 famine in Ethiopia , during which an estimated 1 million people died due to drought and a slow response to the crisis both within the country and internationally .
" West Africa has traditionally not been very high on the developed world 's priority list .
The question now is how many people do we have to see die before the world will act ? " she said .
Gary Lauder
Two weeks ago , we wrote about Gary Lauder , a venture capitalist in California who had devised a new take on the stop sign , which he presented at a TED Talk in February .
“ By bringing a vehicle to an unnecessary stop , energy is wasted on multiple levels , ” he said .
“ Efficiency is more than just about the vehicle , it ’s also about the road . ”
Mr. Lauder ’s suggestion was his “ Take Turns ” sign , a mashup of a stop and yield sign .
“ The text and the design are familiar enough , ” he said .
“ If the bottom were to get lopped off by a van , it could still be understood . ”
The post got some great comments .
Ken from western Massachusetts suggested different wording for Mr. Lauder ’s sign .
“ The wording ‘ Take Turns ’ is ambiguous , ” wrote Ken , “ and will be especially confusing to non-English speaking and foreign drivers .
My first thought was that only turns are allowed at the intersection .
How about “ Four - way yield ” or something like that ?
Even better would be a sign without words . ”
Or how about no signs at all ?
Rich from State College , Pa. , wrote that some European countries have abandoned road signs altogether , something we ’ve covered in Wheels .
“ Essentially , a four - way stop without the stopping , ” Rich writes .
“ Major roads are given right of way over all minor roads , but you can enter a major road without stopping if no one else is coming .
Essentially , a yield sign for people entering major roads .
People understand it and it works , and you end up stopping a lot less . ”
Erica Endicott of Atlanta was one of several commenters who reminded us that cars were only part of the traffic equation .
“ Please consider pedestrians as well , ” Ms. Endicott wrote .
Others offered reminders to watch out for cyclists , also .
“ There are more people at intersections than just those traveling in cars , ” she continues .
“ Walking up to a corner with this sign , I would expect motorists who are looking for other cars , but ignoring the people not cloaked with two tons of steel — and they ’re the ones who are more vulnerable . ”
Meanwhile , Billy Dean del Rio of Cheyenne , Wis. , says that there is already a sign to cover what Mr. Lauder is talking about : “ I ’m not sure why we would need this sign when we already have tried and proven ‘ Yield ’ signs .
That sign says it all : “ Yield if there is traffic .
If there is no traffic , you may go through or turn . ”
But perhaps familiarity breeds disregard .
Burt Scott of Heath , Tex. , wrote that his previous hometown of Garrett Park , Md. , used its own creative sign : “ At Least Slow Down . ”
Do you have a design idea to replace the current stop sign ?

The Party , examines the intricate relationship between the Communist Party and the Chinese government , exposing how a political machine subverts the will to properly govern a billion people .
It 's also filled with all kinds of fascinating details about China .
Here are some of them .
1 . In China , senior politicians are " addicted " to dyeing their hair black .
Their hair turns white only when they 're shipped to jail or they retire .

2 . A red phone , called " the red machine , " sits on the desk of the people who run China 's largest fifty companies .
These encrypted phones only have four digits and only connect to other red phones , allowing the all - powerful men who run China unfettered access to each other .

4 . The Communists believe they are democratic , believing that " Democratic government is the Chinese Communist Party governing on behalf of the people . " ( Page 20 )
5 . The Communist Party does not have a Web site .

7 . " There are now more billionaires in China than in any country other than the U.S. " ( Page 30 )
8 . " Forty - five percent of loans made before 2000 [ went ] bad . " ( Page 45 )
9 . As befitting a Communist nation , China has a central office that handles staffing for most of the major political appointments .
" A similar department in the U.S. would oversee the appointment of the entire U.S. cabinet , state governors and their deputies , the mayors of major cities , the heads of all federal regulatory commissions , the chief executives of GE , Exxon - Mobil , Wal - Mart and about fifty of the remaining largest U.S. companies , the justices of the Supreme Court , the editors of the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post , the bosses of the TV networks and cable stations , the presidents of Yale and Harvard and other big universities , and the heads of think - tanks like the Brookings Institute and the Heritage Foundation .
Not only that , the vetting process would take place behind closed doors , and the appointments announced without any accompanying explanations why they had been made . "

( CNN ) -- " Star Wars " creator George Lucas wants to force a laser company to stop making a new , high - powered product he says looks too much like the famous lightsaber from his classic sci- fi series .
Lucasfilm Ltd. has sent a cease - and - desist letter to Hong Kong - based Wicked Lasers , threatening legal action if it does n't change its Pro Arctic Laser series or stop selling it altogether .
" It is apparent from the design of the Pro Arctic Laser that it was intended to resemble the hilts of our lightsaber swords , which are protected by copyright ... , " said the letter , dated last month and provided to CNN by Wicked Lasers .
The letter calls the company 's newest laser " a highly dangerous product with the potential to cause blindness , burns and other damage to people and / or property . "
Steve Liu , CEO of Wicked Lasers , said his 7 - year - old company has been selling similar lasers for years and has never compared the product to the Jedi weapon wielded by Luke Skywalker , Darth Vader and others in the " Star Wars " franchise .
" Most people feel it 's kind of ridiculous ... , " he said .
" We would never use any comparison like that to ' Star Wars ' or a lightsaber or anything like that . "
He called the $ 199 gadget 's design fairly typical for a handheld laser and said it is n't a copy of the lightsaber .
" Lucasfilm should n't be saying something like that , " he said .
" They 're a big company that needs to protect their trademarks .
Maybe they 're having to look like they 're protecting their trademark in case they need to [ protect it again ] later . "
The cease - and - desist letter does n't accuse Wicked of using the term " lightsaber " in its marketing -- which Liu said is primarily aimed at industrial , military and research customers .
But it notes coverage from technology blogs that have frequently made that comparison .
A headline from tech blog Gizmodo called the device " a real life lightsaber . "
The Daily Tech blog called it " perhaps the first consumer laser weapon " and said it " comes in sleek packaging that looks , unsurprisingly like a lightsaber . "
" These references make it clear that the public is being led to believe that the Pro Arctic Laser is an official lightsaber device and / or copied from our design , " the Lucasfilm letter said .
A Lucasfilm spokesman did not immediately respond to an e-mail request from CNN for additional comment .
It 's not the first time the company has sought help from the courts over perceived copyright threats to its lightsaber laser swords .
In 2006 , Lucasfilm filed suit against a Maryland - based company that produced lightsaber replicas , saying the products violated " Star Wars " trademarks .
Liu acknowledged that his company 's new Spyder III laser is dramatically stronger than lasers from the past .
Wicked Lasers advertises it as " the world 's most powerful portable laser . "
When coverage in the blogosphere increased orders , he said , Wicked altered the laser to add safety features .
A safety lock feature prevents accidentally turning on the laser , and an extra lens reduces its power by 80 percent until it 's removed .
Every laser is shipped with safety goggles , he said .
" You 've got a lot of people who think this is kind of a cool toy , so we 've decided not to ship the laser as it was originally advertised , " he said .
More than two weeks after receiving the letter from Lucasfilm , Wicked has not stopped selling or changed the laser .
The letter asked for written assurance of changes within five business days or threatened " the initiation of legal proceedings without further notice to you . "
Liu said he hopes it does n't come to that .
" Personally , they 're some of my favorite movies , " he said .

If you write software for Linux and you write them for Debian systems ( Debian , Ubuntu , and others ) you may want to provide your software asinstallation packages .
And one day eventually you will want to set up a repository so others can download and install your software without fuzz .
If you look at a Debian mirror ( e.g. http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ ) you will find out one day that packages and meta information is split up into two main directories on the root level :
We will do the same thing with our repository .
I assume you already have your software packed infiles ( read this article to find out how to do this ) .
To build our repository we need to If you have it simple your directory structure will look like this :
For each software you will eventually add directories in , if you love hierarchical order .
But those subdirectories are optional .
If you provide packages for different architectures give them distict names ( e.g. , etc. ) and put them into the same directory in thesubtree .
For the last step we need to prepare a configuration file for apt - ftparchive , let 's call it You can use this configuration almost right away , the only unfortunate thing here is theoption ( = your repository root ) :
This must be an absolute path name .
So , unless you 're also calledchange it .
Then run the following two commands to generate the metadata files of your repository :
Now you have all your files in place in thesubtree as well ( check forand thefiles , and see what is in there ! ) .
Running these commands will be necessary again each time you copy an updated version of anyfile into thetree of your repository .
If you want others to access your repository over the web you can set up an Apache web server and place your personal repository in a Virtual Host in there .
But that 's another story ... ( a rather simple one )
It 's interesting to note thatwill not descend yoursubtree if you forget about thesection in the configuration file .
Also , theshould n't be necessary , but thedirective seems to be ignored .
I believe these are bugs of the tool , correct me if I 'm wrong ...
What Actually Happened at the G20 Protests
There ’s been a lot of crying about “ thugs and anarchists ” in Toronto .
I live about 4 blocks from where some of the vandalism occurred , though I was n’t there at the time .
As best I can tell , what happened is that for about an hour , the Black Bloc protesters clearly and visibly prepared for action , with both the police and other , non-violent protesters able to see they were doing so .
The number of Black Bloc vandals seems to have been between 50 to 100 , certainly not more than 200 .
( The police had 20,000 men . )
The police actually withdrew , leaving behind police cars for the Black Block to torch .
Which they then did .
The Black Bloc then proceeded up Yonge street ( the main north / south street in downtown Toronto ) , vandalizing as they went , and eventually many headed over to Queen ’s Park , the Provincial capital .
Two hours after the first violence , the police finally take action , ensuring that there are plenty of videos of police cars burning and vandalism that would not have occurred if they had taken action earlier .
According to the police , rather than confront a maximum of 200 protesters , they withdrew behind the barrier around the G20 meetings and let them vandalize downtown Toronto for 2 hours .
At the end of the day the people who matter never even saw any protests and the 1 billion dollar police presence and suspension of civil liberties was “ justified ” by vandalism and burning police cars .
Simply put , the police decided that they could n’t spare say 2,000 out of their 20,000 men to stop 200 vandals .
This was a deliberate decision to allow downtown to be vandalized .
I leave it as an exercise for readers to decide if this was a matter of incompetence , or if it was a deliberate strategy .
And if it was deliberate strategy , just what they were trying to accomplish with their strategy .
Of course , along the way Canadian Civil Liberties observers were arrested as well , and protesters were not allowed to see lawyers .
I am ashamed to be Canadian today , and I am ashamed of my governments , at all levels .

Torchlight Sells 500,000 ; Developer Bought by Perfect World
Additionally , China - based MMO publisher and developer Perfect World has just announced ( via Joystiq ) that it has acquired a majority stake in Runic Games for around $ 8.4 million .
Runic is currently working on an MMORPG version of Torchlight , which is slated to be a free - to - play game likely supported by micro-transactions .
This is a popular business model in China and should be a successful partnership for both parties .
Perfect World was already lined up as the publisher for the Torchlight MMORPG , which is planned for a worldwide release .
It is unclear which entity controls the intellectual property , which could be of specific concern to Runic employees .
Runic Games , born of ex-Flagship Software employees , lost all of its work and intellectual property rights to Mythos , an action MMORPG it was developing for Korean company HanbitSoft .
When Flagship was closed , Mythos and Hellgate : London went over to HanbitSoft and Comerica Bank respectively and are in continuing development through its subsidiaries .
Torchlight is an isometric action RPG in the vein of Blizzard 's Diablo franchise .
Members of Runic Games worked of Diablo , Diablo II , and Hellgate : London .
The Mac version of Torchlight is currently exclusive to Steam , featuring Steam Play , which allows for dual - ownership across PC and Mac.
A DRM - free , boxed version of Torchlight Mac is forthcoming .
If the government approves the proposed amendment in the Food Act , Bulgarian children will enjoy GMO - free foods .
Photo by BGNES
A ban of all genetically modified products and ingredients for preparation of children foods in Bulgaria has been proposed Wednesday in an amendment in the Bulgarian Food Act .
The amendment , proposed by Desislava Taneva , chair of the Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Forests , from the ruling party GERB and two other MPs from the right - wing “ Blue Coalition ” , stipulates a full ban on the distribution and sale of food products containing genetically modified organisms ( GMO ) in child care centers , kindergartens , schools and the adjacent commercial outlets ( 100 m in range ) .
The sale of GMO foods and products will be allowed in separate and clearly marked areas , such as stands , shelves , etc .
Other points in the amendment include strict control of all stages of the producing and distribution of GMO foods and increased self - control in regard of GMO input of materials and ingredients in foods .
If approved , the amendment should lead to strict control on imported foods .
Documentation should provide results from lab analyses , as well as clear information on whether the products contain GMO .
Importers believe that the amendment will help consumers make a well - informed choice on the genetically modified foods and products , offered on the market .
Bulgaria suffered through a four month - long debate on whether to allow GMOs in the country , which stirred both civil society and political parties .
The debate started with the center - right government 's proposal to liberalize the rules for GMO tests in Bulgaria .
It was prompted by a letter from the European Commission warning that Bulgaria is breaching European Union law by banning experiments and release into the environment of several GMO hybrids - tobacco , vine , oil rose , fruit and vegetables .
The final outcome was an act that banned modified plants from release in the environment , confining them to labs only .
This morning , the Supreme Court decided the long - running Bilski case ( PDF ) on business method patents — a case with broad applicability to software patents .
As expected , the Court struck down the Bilski patent itself as an unpatentable " abstract idea " — but it also said that business method and software patents can be legitimate .
The case began when one Bernard Bilski tried to patent " a method for managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider . "
The application included some broad statistical algorithms for hedging risk , but then asserted broad ownership over the way that these principles could be implemented by others .
The Patent Office rejected the application on the grounds that it was not a tangible invention .
Two federal courts have agreed , and the Supreme Court today concurred .
Bilski's idea is an unpatentable abstract concept , not an " invention . "
But the meat of the ruling concerns the broader patentability of similar claims .
For years , the Patent Office has tried to rein in broad patents by limiting them to inventions that involve a machine or a transformation of one thing into another .
In other words , broad " process " and algorithmic patents have been frowned on .
Recently , the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ( which handles patent appeals ) tried to crack down on overbroad patents by claiming that the " machine or transformation " standard applied to all patents — a ruling that seemed to severely limit both business method and software patents .
In today 's decision , the Supremes refused to accept the machine / transformation standard as the exclusive rule for patents .
" Process " patents are still allowed , as " process " is one of the categories in the Patent Act .
" The Court is unaware of any ordinary , contemporary , common meaning of ' process ' that would require it to be tied to a machine or the transformation of an article , " wrote the court .
The same reasoning applies to business method patents , which can certainly count as a " process . "
Many Bilski watchers hoped the court would uphold the " machine or transformation test " exclusively and put the kibosh on business method patents and on software patents .
That did n't happen ; in fact , the majority opinion says that " the machine - or - transformation test would create uncertainty as to the patentability of software , advanced diagnostic medicine techniques , and inventions based on linear programming , data compression , and the manipulation of digital signals . "
" Machine - or - transformation " instead remains a valid patent test , but it 's not the only one that can be used .
Software patents and business method patents are still valid — but the Supremes did suggest that such intangible patents should be more difficult to get .
While saying that business method patents are allowed under the law , this " does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions , " said the opinion .
And the court explicitly invited the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to introduce further patent limitations .
Should have gone further
Justice Stevens , though concurring with the unanimous judgment , was disappointed that the court did not go further and strike down business method patents altogether .
( Ginsburg , Breyer , and Sotomayor agreed with Stevens . )
" The Court correctly holds that the machine - or - transformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes a patentable process ; rather , it is a critical clue .
But the Court is quite wrong , in my view , to suggest that any series of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of nature may constitute a ' process ' ...
The language in the Court ’s opinion to this effect can only cause mischief .
The wiser course would have been to hold that petitioners ’ method is not a ' process ' because it describes only a general method of engaging in business transactions — and business methods are not patentable . "
" The primary concern is that patents on business methods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition and innovation , " he continued .
" If business methods could be patented , then many business decisions , no matter how small , could be potential patent violations .
Businesses would either live in constant fear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of searching through patents that describe methods of doing business , attempting to decide whether their innovation is one that remains in the public domain . "
By explicitly refusing to lay down any ground rules for software and business method patents , the Supremes did little to bring clarity to the issue of when and how such patents should be granted .
Perhaps they should not be granted as often as they are , but what criteria and limitations should apply ?
The Software Freedom Law Center , which supports open source licenses , lamented the ruling .
" The landscape of patent law has been a cluttered , dangerous mess for almost two decades , " said Eben Moglen , Chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center .
" The confusion and uncertainty behind today ’s ruling guarantees that the issues involved in Bilski v. Kappos will have to return to the Supreme Court after much money has been wasted and much innovation obstructed . "
A huge contingent of Los Angeles Police Department officers were trying to maintain order Thursday night as some Lakers fans roamed downtown , jumping on cars , smashing windows and throwing rocks .
LAPD officer fired less - than - lethal weapons at a group of people who threw pieces of concrete at them .
Cars trying to make their way through the intersection of 9th and Hope streets were mauled by fans banging on their windows .
Police approached on horseback and then riot police pressed into the crowd .
The crowd retreated , knocking off side - view windows of cars and lighting fireworks as they went .
At 9th and Flower streets , a crowd bashed in the windows at the condo loft tower and ripped down the barriers that had been set up at the street .
Then they swarmed a pickup truck at the intersection .
Ten men hopped on top of it .
Crowds smashed windows at Pico Boulevard and Figueroa Street .
Others roamed on the 110 Freeway .
Belen Lopez , 20 , and her boyfriend were running down Hill Street , away from the riot police approaching on horseback .
" This is insane , " she said .

Due to receiving more than 200 letters thus far from those who submitted letters to the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support , I need to create multiple posts .
The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support is held a hearing on June 10 titled : Hearing on Responding to Long - Term Unemployment .
I asked readers of Rochester Unemployment Examiner to send me letters they wrote to the Committee that they also wanted to have published here .*
Below are some of those letters .
I ’ll be posting other letters as I receive permission .
There is still time to write ; you can submit letters to House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support is holding a hearing until the close of business on June 24 .
I want to thank all of you for including me in your letters to the Hearing .
I will do my best to reply to each and everyone of you in a timely fashion .
From M.H. in KS :
Re : Hearing on Responding to Long - Term Unemployment To ALL members of the U.S. Congress & the President of the United States of America I am a 57 year old male who has worked for over 43 years .
I have always paid my Income Taxes , and paid into the Social Security System , as outlined by our government .
Like so many MILLIONS of other Americans , through no fault of my own , I was laid - off from my most recent employer of over 16 years , on October 6th , 2008 .
I was the Quality Manager of a manufacturing company that went from a 24/7 operation to one 8 hour shift .
I am a divorced father with custody of my 14 year old daughter .
( Due to what will be stated in this letter , I MAY be forced to give custody to my ex-spouse … that , I should NOT be forced to do…my daughter deserves better from HER country ) I am not someone who has looked to my government to “ pay my way ” , and have never approved of what many Americans referred to as the “ American Welfare System ” .
Again , like millions of other hard - working , dedicated Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of our own , I have found that companies do not want to hire a 57 year old , divorced , white male , who has n’t worked for over 1 & ½ years .
The daily frustrations that I have experienced cannot be put into words .
One has to “ live it ” by being in this position and by reading comments from the “ still - employed ” Americans , who think that anyone who has n’t found new employment after this length of time , must be lazy , unmotivated , worthless , looking for the old Welfare scams , and only wanting to be on full - time vacation .
If they only knew how far from the truth this is for MOST , if not ALL of us .
I have sent resumes , had interviews , made phone calls , have visited companies that are n’t advertising any current openings just to have an application on file “ in case ” something becomes available …
I ca n’t even keep track anymore of the hundreds ( thousands ? ) of these over the last year & ½.
I have received Extended Benefits through the “ Unemployment ” system , Tiers I , II , & III , but the State of Kansas did not have a Tier IV , as some other states put into place .
I have exhausted all benefits made available to me , and am still unemployed as of this writing .
I was one of the “ lucky ” Americans , who after working many years , was able to live the so - called “ American Dream ” , of owning my own home , along with owning 2 vehicles .
Due to the state of the economy , and the decision by Congress to no longer “ HELP ” Americans such as myself , I was forced to file bankruptcy .
I lost my “ dream ” .. our 4 - bedroom home .. our new car .. health insurance ( as well as health , in general ) , dignity , respect , good credit rating , and many , many other things .
Not only did we have to move from our house ( our HOME ) to an apartment , I now can no longer afford to pay the rent , buy food , pay for gasoline for my “ used ” 2002 VW , or pay utilities ( which includes phone & computer , and they are my last resorts for further seeking of employment ) .
All of this because Congress has decided that I am not entitled to receive any further assistance from my country .
This is while I continue to read of the BILLIONS of dollars my country is giving to foreign countries to assist them through the “ disasters ” they have encountered … or “ bailing out ” the Banking & Auto industries with BILLIONS because “ we ca n’t afford to let them fail ” …
… What about us ???… the Americans who have encountered this “ disaster ” in our lives … do you honestly feel it ’s OK to let US “ fail ” , and that we do n’t need the help of OUR OWN COUNTRY ?
H.R.4213 does NOT address the “ Long - Term ” unemployed , those of us without further available “ Tiers ” .
It only addresses giving the “ shorter - term ” unemployed an additional amount of time to file for an extension of their benefits .
Even this has n’t PASSED Congress – YET .
While you ’re on vacation , or approving your own pay raises , some of us are on the brink of becoming completely homeless …
What did WE do wrong ??? … and “ vacation ” ?
What is that ?
I ca n’t even imagine that “ luxury ” anymore .
Do we NO LONGER EXIST to the people we elected to Congress to help lead our country .
If what I have read is correct , and I believe it is , those of us who have exhausted ALL benefits , are no longer “ on the books ” , so we are n’t included in the figures / Unemployment % reported to / by the Press .
We should be included , not FORGOTTEN !!!
What is the TRUE percentage if you INCLUDE us ?
We ARE unemployed … Why play with the numbers to make the economy look like it ’s improving , when in fact , it is NOT for some / most Americans … Tell the American public the TRUE NUMBERS …we DO exist , even if Congress wants to ignore us , or at a minimum , not want to deal with us .
As we all know , the oil damage in the Gulf of Mexico currently has the main focus of the Press , but please give the “ damage ” to the American people YOUR main focus …we deserve to NOT be forgotten .
There are internet blogs that I have read that are quite disturbing , and show the true desperation of some Americans .
Some have said they are going to commit crimes just to have a “ roof over their head ” and to have their children become “ Wards of the State ” so that they will receive care & housing that the parent can no longer supply …
Others have stated they are ready to commit suicide so that their children will receive life insurance and / or “ survivor benefits ” rather than see them forced to “ live on the streets ” …
How much of this do we need to see actually start happening before this desperation is realized ?
PLEASE help us…we NEED your help …we DESERVE your help …we were NOT the cause of the current state of our economy , or the loss of OUR AMERICAN DREAM ….
“ Jobs Programs ” will be a great benefit to the entire country , when & if they work , but that will take quite a lengthy time to re-employ all who have lost employment .
Of course employment several months ( or longer ) from now is better than “ not at all ” , but …PLEASE include a TIER V to the Extended Benefits program and add it NOW , and to ALL states … not after 3 months of additional debate , and to only a select group of states , using incomplete data of the TRUE Unemployment % … we can NOT survive that long without help from our country …
I could write for days on this subject , but I know it would most likely be placed to the side without review , so I will end here and state … …
I believe in MY country and hope that my country believes in those of us who needs “ her ” help … .
“… OF THE PEOPLE , BY THE PEOPLE , AND FOR THE PEOPLE … ” Respectfully & Sincerely
From L.T. in SC :
RE : Hearing on Responding to Long - Term Unemployment Dear Senator McDermott , I am writing this letter in response to ANOTHER 4 hour day at the Unemployment Office in South Carolina .
Suicide is becoming more and more attractive each day I survive .
I recently turned 53 and up until three years ago I felt my life fairly blessed .
I started working @ 12 as a babysitter and officially was on the Social Security books in 1973 .
In November of 2006 my beloved Mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer & given 6 months to live .
In January of 2007 I lost my job as a Licensed Customhouse Broker , ( my original license was issued in 1986 by the then U.S. Treasury Dept. , now “ Homeland Security ) , a career I had for over 20 + years .
In April 2007 my husband of 13 years abandoned me .
I ’ve lost my home , car , even my pets .
I have NOTHING .
I have little to no family as I was unable to have children and my family is extremely small .
In fact I only really have a Aunt in Maine , ( who is also suffering due to the economy ) and a sister in Charleston with two children ALSO not able to help me .
If not for the blessing of a friend I would be on the streets !
Literally !
I ’m sure you are not aware , ( it ’s another one of American ’s dirty little secrets ) , but there is NO WHERE for a WOMAN to go , ( shelter ) , unless they are physically abused or have children .
I do not fall under either of the two “ qualifications ” .
There ARE men shelters .
Can “ someone ” explain this to me ?
Never mind , that ’s another issue and not the purpose of this letter .
This being said my last date of “ employment ” was June 8th , 2009 .
I held a couple of jobs working for “ call centers ” , ( I would describe these positions very close to being operated the same way as “ sweatshops ” ) , but other than that I ca n’t get a job ANYWHERE .
I have moved four times in the past year , ( in South Carolina and Florida ) , living with friends .
No home .
No Job .
No Security .
No family .
No feeling of worth .
Unfortunately having had a somewhat unorthodox career I “ pigeon - holed ” myself where my skills are somewhat limited albeit I ’m pretty sure I could flip a burger .
Did you know that when you apply on - line , ( which 98 % of places I have applied to require ) , that McDonald ’s does not even offer an application or a place to “ paste ” a resume .
Instead you answer a 50 + “ assessment ” questionnaire .
I ’ve done so many with so many companies but I think a question such as “ Do you think smoking is harmful for your health ? ” is not only mundane but asinine as well .
So , here we are .
10 million , 20 million , 30 million ?
Really , does anyone really know how many of AMERICANS are unemployed ?
How many have just given up ?
How many HAVE committed suicide ?
My experience with the South Carolina Employment Commission , ( or whatever they are calling themselves now since the discovery of how inept the offices are ) , has been overwhelming .
I went from February of this year until May without receiving a single dime .
I myself initiated my four month quest by going into the Charleston , SC office , ( where I had lived for 20 + years ) , to ask WHY I had not been called in for an “ eligibility ” review .
Out of 16 weeks I was either in the Charleston or Greenville “ One Stop ” office 14 times !
By the way , The Greenville News , recently had a headline story that aside from the “ Commission ” being “ run amok ” the reporter also quoted that of the 1100 S.C. agency employees , 300 of them had returned to work after retirement .
These retirees returned to jobs that were NEVER posted for us regular folk .
In closing I am “ grateful ” my Mother did not live to see what has happened to my life .
I am “ grateful ” she will never have to know I had to pawn her jewelry in order to “ survive ” .
Most of all I am “ grateful ” she never had to see what America has become .
I grew up in Leesburg , VA ..
I know what goes on “ inside ” the beltway .
I watch CSPAN and see NOTHING going on .
I am pleased to see you are on “ our ” side .
Of course you are only one Senator and of course you have never experienced , ( nor will any of your children , grandchildren or great - grandchildren ) , experience what “ normal ” AMERICANS are losing or have lost .
This is NOT my America .
Greed and Politics have won .
No wonder the comparison ’s to the fall of the Roman Empire .
We ’re there !
WE NEEDA TIER V !
Thank you for your time and consideration in reading this letter .
I pray “ someone ” on your staff will point out MY letter and help me to regain a life and perhaps just a little bit of dignity .
Sincerely ,
From N.M. in FL :
URGENT — - URGENT — URGENT —- URGENT ——- URGENT WE NEED UNEMPLOYMENT AND COBRA 65 % DISCOUNT TO BE EXTENDED UNTIL THE END OF 2010 THE HEALTH CARE BILL DOES NOT KICK IN FOR 4 YEARS , IF PREXISTING CONITIONS WERE NOT BLOCKED FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS AND PRICING WAS FAIR AND UNEMPLOYMENT WAS EXTENDED OUT UNTIL THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS DOWN , I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET AFFORDABLE INSURANCE - BUT DUE TO THE WAY THE HEALTH CARE BILL IS - I CANNOT AND NEITHER CAN OTHERS .
WHAT GOOD IS THAT ?
WE NEED EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT TO A LONG TIER V.AND 65 % COBRA EXTENDED IMMEDIATELY .
IT IS URGENT THAT YOU EXTEND COBRA 65 % BENEFITS OUT FOR THE UNEMPLOYED .
IT IS ALSO URGENT THAT YOU IMMEDIALTLY EXTEND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR ALL AMERICANS WHO HAVE OR WILL BE ENDING TIER 4 .
TIER 5 FOR ALL IS A MUST AND VERY QUICKLY FOR BOTH .
PLEASE READ MY STORY I AM 63 YEARS OLD , MY 3 WEEKS OF EB EXPIRED JUNE 5 , 2010 ( I DID NOT GET THE 20 WEEKS IN FLORIDA , I ONLY GOT 3 WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE JUNE 5TH END DATE AND TIER 3 CAME IN SO I NEVER STARTED MY 20 WEEKS OF EB UNTIL TIER 4 RAN OUT . )
AND MY COBRA 65 % DISCOUNT EXPIRED MAY 31ST 2010 , UNLESS IT IS EXTENDED TO SAVE US I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO … WE TOOK OUR SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY ONLY SO WE COULD PAY OUR BILLS AND NOT DEPEND ON MEDICAID HOUSING ASSISTANCE ETC.WE THEREFORE LOST A LOT OF OUR FUTURE IN BENEFITS .
WE WERE PAYING $ 578.00 PER MONTH FOR THE TWO OF US .
I JUST RECEIVED MY CONVERSION PLAN FOR MYSELF AND IT IS $ 1288.00 PER MONTH FOR 1 PERSON .
MY HUSBAND IS ALSO UNEMPLOYED BUT HE GOES ONTO MEDICARE JUNE 1 , 2010 AND MUST BUY A SUPPLEMENT TOO .
I CAN ’T EVER PAY THIS $ 1288.00 THE ONLY OTHER WAY OUT IS TO DIVORCE MY HUSBAND AND GET ON MEDICAID .HOW SAD , HE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE .
I AM AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC AND NO ONE ELSE WILL COVER ME .
THE INSULIN IS OVER $ 200.00 A BOTTLE PER MONTH I USE 2 BOTTLES OF 70/30 AND 1 BOTTLE OF REGULAR - SO THAT IS OVER $ 600.00 A MONTH PLUS MY OTHER MEDICATIONS SUCH AS ADVAIR @ OVER $ 200.00 A MONTH AND AVAPRO 300 AT ABOUT $ 100.00 A MONTH .
I HAVE PRICED THIS ALL WITH A DISCOUNT CARD AND IT COMES TO OVER $ 600.00 A MONTH .
THERE ARE OTHER MEDS , BUT THEY ARE GENERIC BUT MY LIFE SAVING INSULIN , BLOOD PRESSURE AND ASTHMA DRUGS I CANNOT AFFORD .
IF UNEMPLOYMENT WERE EXTENDED OUT UNTIL WE CAN FIND WORK IN FLORIDA , A STATE WITH OVER 12 % UNEMPLOYED WE AND OVER 1 MILLION OTHERS IN FLORIDA WOULD BE SAVED FROM DESTITUTION .
I AM NOT ALONE IN THIS PLIGHT , MILLIONS WILL BE BEGGING IN THE STREETS , STEALING AND DYING JUST FOR MEDS & FOOD &HOUSING .
OVER GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE !!!
IF ANY OF YOU TRIED TO LIVE ON 275.00 A WEEK +$ 25 FOR EVEN A MONTH YOU WOULD KNOW HOW HORRIBLE IT FEELS .
WHY NOT TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE AND TRY IT FOR A FEW MONTHS .
IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT ANYONE FROM THE PRESIDENT TO CONGRESS AND THE SENATE COULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO THE PROUD AMERICANS WHO GAVE YOU YOUR JOBS , BENEFITS , PENSIONS , HOUSES ETC .
WE ARE PROUD AMERICANS , BUT WE NEED HELP FROM THE PEOPLE WE VOTED TO PROTECT US !
THIS GREAT COUNTRY HAS BAILED OUT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY , GIVEN MONEY TO COUNTRIES IN NEED , BAILED OUT OUR BANKS , AUTOMAKERS AND BIG BUSINESS - YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONSCIENCE AND HELP THOSE OF US STILL UNEMPLOYED .
YES , IT APPEARS THAT THEM FIGURES OF THOSE COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN , BUT THE TRUE FIGURES ARE NOT THERE , BECAUSE IT IS DOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER COLLECT .
MY UNEMPLOYMENT ENDS IN 1 WEEK , WHEN I FILE FOR MY 1 WEEK , THEN I WILL BE APPLYING FOR FOOD STAMPS , MEDICAID , RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ANYTHING ELSE I AM ELIGIBLE FOR - JUST TO SURVIVE .
I AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS DID NOT PLAN FOR THS - EVERYONES SAVINGS ARE GONE , OUR LANDLORD WAS NICE INTAKING PAYMENTS , BUT ONCE UNEMPLOYMENT IS GONE , THERE WILL BE NO WAY TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS UNTIL I CAN FIND A JOB WHERE I DON ’T HAVE TO LIFT 50 LBS AND STAND ON MY FEET ALL DAY ( I AM IN NO MEDICAL CONDITION TO DO THAT WITH HEART , DIABETIES , ASTHMA AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE —AND NOW I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO DOCTORS OR GET MEDICATION .
IS EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON BLIND TO WHAT IS HAPPENING ??
WHY IS IT THAT THERE IS FUNDING THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE REPAID FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR A COLLEGE DEGREE .
BUT IF YOU ARE IN YOUR 60 ’S AND WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE CAREERS BY TAKING A COURSE FOR YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE LISCENCE OR A REAL ESTATE LISCENCE , WHICH TAKES A MUCH SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET AND LESS MONEY HAS TO BE PAID FOR THESE LISCENSES , WE MUST PAY FOR THEM OUT OF POCKET ?
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT HELP US PAY FOR THIS AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY , THEREFORE ANOTHER AVENUE IS SHUT OFF FOR US .
IF THESE WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS WITH THE EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND 65 % DISCOUNT OF COBRA , MANY OF US WOULD BE MAKING MONEY NOW .
I WATCH THE NEWS AND EVERYDAY I SEE MORE ROBERIES , PEOPLE BEING SHOT AND KILLED FOR A FEW DOLLARS FOR FOOD ETC .
IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY ??
THE CRIME RATE IS UP AND IT WILL BE MUCH HIGHER AND DESPERATE PEOPLE DO DESPERATE THINGS .
WE DESPERATLY NEED THE 65 % COBRA EXTENDED NOW PAST 18 MONTHS - I END ON MAY 31,2010 AND THE HEALTHCARE BILL DOES NOTHING TO HELP ME UNTIL I AM ALMOST 68 YEARS OLD .I WILL NOT MAKE 68 IF THERE IS NO HELP AND UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENDED UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR SO WE CAN GET BACK ON OUR FEET -( I STILL BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY .
WITHOUT UNEMPLOYMENT I CAN’T PAY FOR COBRA .
HELP US !
PLEASE RESPECTFULLY ,
From V.M. in MI :
My situation is by no means unique : I am divorced ; 55 years old ; have been unemployed since November 2007 ; can’t afford health insurance and am too young for Medicare ; am on food stamps ; have used up most of my IRA ( for which I ’m penalized for early withdrawal ) , More than anything , I want gainful employment .
I ’ve applied for a variety of jobs–from entry - level to professional–and no luck .
I ’m an attorney and have a master ’s degree in business .
I ’m also an actor , artist , photographer , and writer , and I ’ve been doing some freelance jobs , but they are few and far between .
I cannot find one meaningful paid job in any of those categories .
The paid positions out there are part - time or temporary , have no benefits , and pay very little .
Clearly , employers are taking advantage of this situation .
I would be happy working as a file clerk , but rarely do I get an interview and when I do , the interviewers are often half my age and do n’t give serious consideration to my qualifications .
I never hear back from them .
Age discrimination is rampant .
When I hear politicians and others say that people like me are lazy and will be more motivated to find work if there were no more unemployment benefits , I wish that I could afford to move away to a country , such as Canada or New Zealand , that values its citizens and offers health care to everyone .
Why do our politicians not bat an eye when bailing out Wall Street and GM , and keep funding a war that has no end , but abandon those who desperately need an extension of unemployment benefits ?
We ’re not asking for handouts — we ’ve paid into the unemployment insurance I , and millions of others like me , need your help .
Thank you .
Kind regards ,
From G.H. in CA :
Senator McDermott and Members of Congress : I have been unemployed for almost two years .
I ’ve sent out more resumes than I can count , since losing my job as an executive assistant at a law firm in 2008 .
I ’ve had only two or three callbacks , and only one interview .
It is bleak .
I am almost out of unemployment .
Time is growing short for me .
For many people , it ’s already happened .
They ’re defaulting on the debts , losing their cars , their homes , their dignity .
I have solid resume , a broad and experienced skill set , a college degree , and have been working since I was 14 years old .
In fact , I held two jobs while also attending high school .
I worked full time while earning my college degree .
I can work .
I will work .
I like to work , and see the benefits of my labor .
I think that most people do .
The government and industry is failing us .
We need the lifeline of unemployment continued until the unemployment rate comes down , significantly .
Everybody knows it .
There are no jobs .
From M.C. in CT :
I and my wife have been unemployed , out of no fault of my own and have exhausted all our unemployment benefits as of last month or before .
I have lost so much in the last two years and now if you do not add ADDITIONAL WEEKS beyond continuing the programs I AND MY FAMILY WILL BE HOMELESS AND WITH OUT TRANSPORTATION AND CELLPHONES !
There are no jobs out there no matter what News stories try to portray !
Look in any major local paper at the job classifieds ( nationwide ) - 1/2 page or 1 page is the norm instead of 10 - 15 pages in the past !
Hundreds attend the few openings !
So please support the American people like you have the Banks / Wall St. and so many big $ $ bailouts and wars .
As we all know things will get better , but jobs are nowhere to be found now !
All you have to do is look at the market diving in the USA and worldwide when the latest JOBS NEWS CAME OUT THIS WEEK !
How can you ignore the AMERICAN PEOPLE who elected you ?
It will take support from Congress for the remainder of 2010 and early next year !
Do n’t let any Democrat or Republican state that you should n’t help because of the deficit or because unemployed people are lazy and milking the system .
I would love to see any of them try to live like so many Americans on unemployment or no funds coming in !
We the good people of America WANT TO WORK !
But we need the help of additional weeks now !
Help us out and expand tier 4 or add a tier 5 to do a long term extension .
THIS IS EMERGENCY SPENDING DIRECTED AT THE UNEMPLOYED ON MAIN ST !
Without additional unemployment benefit weeks added , every day / week / month the # will grow , its already huge but by Election time ! ~
LOOK OUT !
MILLIONS WITH NO SUPPORT AND HOMELESS .
We have used up all of our 401k , savings - lost our credit cards and credit and can barely feed ourselves .
I have had to go to food pantries and my kids are not eating well and you can see it in their physical look !
PLEASE HELP US I BEG YOU TO BE DECENT AND ACT IMMEDIATELY TO ADD A TIER 5 OR ADD TO TIER 4 !
Thank you M , S/ J /C and Emily OUR FAMILY IN NEED !

Language Throws a Curveball
Linguist Ray Jackendoff looks for the underlying mechanisms of speech and thought - and finds them in baseball
By Taylor McNeil
Baseball has been called a metaphor for life , but here ’s an interesting twist on that cliché .
Baseball , linguistics expert Ray Jackendoff says , illustrates how we use and think about language .
“ We say that we think in words , but what we experience when we hear these words in our heads is the sound patterns of the words , ” says Ray Jackendoff .

Most youngsters know how to play the sport — or at least the basics .
But think about all they have to know about the game , says Jackendoff , the Seth Merrin Professor of Philosophy and co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts .
“ You have to know about rules , teams , team loyalty , abstract things like balls and strikes , cooperation and competition , ” he says .
“ You ’re actually cooperating with the other team in playing the game , and at the same time you ’re competing .
You ’re also cooperating with your team and competing . ”
All that seems obvious .
The deeper question is how all those things are learned .
Baseball is a perfect example of what it means to be human : to have an innate ability to understand complex , multi- layered rules and actions , just like speaking a language .
“ In baseball , you sort of have a microcosm of all of this really complicated stuff in human thought , besides the physical part , ” Jackendoff says .
“ Things happen in multiple domains at once : there ’s the physical action of a ball being hit and a guy tracking it and catching it ; in the abstract domain , there is a fly out , so the batter is out . ”
“ We make up this artificial domain , and all of sudden it creates this logic of its own , ” he says .
It takes us back to that primary question : how do humans learn to communicate , and how exactly does that communication occur ?
That ’s the issue that Jackendoff has puzzled over throughout his career , in 12 books and numerous scholarly papers , as well as in his teaching .
Here ’s one way to think about it .
When we speak , we ’re making sounds that travel as vibrations through the air and are intercepted by other people , whose brains convert those vibrations into sounds , which are then interpreted as having meaning .
“ We make these noises , and the other person reads your mind , ” Jackendoff says .
The generally accepted view in the field of linguistics is that there is a biological predisposition to learning language — an ability hardwired in humans .
The theory was developed by Noam Chomsky , with whom Jackendoff did graduate studies at MIT .
But Jackendoff begs to differ from Chomsky in one key area .
“ Chomsky ’s conception of language is all based around syntax — around grammatical structure — and that meaning is built from the grammatical structure of language , ” he says .
That ’s missing the point , says Jackendoff , who argues that meaning “ is really the structure of thought , and you do n’t need language to have thoughts . ”
Take , for example , how chimpanzees organize as societies and solve problems — navigating around their world , knowing what foods are OK to eat and which to avoid .
“ It ’s obviously thought , ” Jackendoff says .
“ The kinds of things that they do require many of the same sorts of cognitive structures that humans require and that we happen to express in language . ”
OMG — Is This Language ?
At the beginning of his linguistics research career , Jackendoff quickly found himself veering off on a tangent , applying concepts from linguistics to music .
He had been a keen amateur clarinetist from a young age and , inspired by Leonard Bernstein ’s 1973 Norton Lectures on the possibilities of applying Chomsky ’s insights to music , he began working with a colleague , Fred Lerdahl .
The culmination of that collaboration , the 1983 book A Generative Theory of Tonal Music , was groundbreaking for its effort to develop a grammar for music , and spurred a great amount of work in the field .
( It also resulted in a conference at Tufts this past July , celebrating the 25th anniversary of the book ’s publication , with scores of speakers from around the world . )
A pattern soon emerged in his work .
Fully understanding the underlying structures that explain language meant exploring avenues outside the straight and narrow of the field .
Next stop : consciousness .
“ We say that we think in words , but what we experience when we hear these words in our heads is the sound patterns of the words , ” Jackendoff says .
“ It ’s in English .
It has stress , consonants and vowels . ”
But that ’s not the work of thinking .
“ What ’s doing the work is the unconscious part , where the thought is going on .
Words that you experience as your thoughts are the puppet show , and the real work is going on backstage . ”
In other words , it ’s not about the words in your head ; it ’s about the unconscious structures that are making the connections .
Picture this flashing on your cell phone : “ omg , where r u ? ”
The message is n’t in English , per se , but it can be quickly decoded .
It turns out that language is a lot like that .
“ We ’re finding more and more places where language is not explicit , now that we know where to look for them , ” Jackendoff says .
“ Imagine my wife says to me , ‘ Are you going to be near a mailbox today ? ’
I know what that means , ” even though it is not explicitly stated , he says .
Or think about a more subtle example : “ The light flashed until dawn . ”
“ Now , if you say ‘ the light flashed ’ it means once , and if you say ‘ the light flashed until dawn ’ it means multiple times — but you do n’t say multiple times anywhere in the sentence .
That ’s a piece of meaning that is nowhere in the words , ” he says .
“ What I ’ve come to believe is that meaning has its own structure , and the grammar is there to make it explicit enough to hearers so that they can figure it out .
But it ’s not all there in the grammar . ”
Who ’s on Second ?
This semester , Jackendoff is teaching a course called “ Cognition of Society and Culture , ” reflecting another of his interests : language ’s relation to culture .
“ As a linguist I ’m interested in a system of meaning , and therefore in a system of thought , and culture is one of the universes about which we think , ” he says .
“ There ’s all this understanding we have about how to function in society , ” he says , involving intentions , obligations , values , reciprocity and notions of fairness .
“ We must have learned it , but there must be some basis — it does n’t come out of nowhere . ”
Is it hardwired like the language instinct , or is it learned ?
“ In the case of social understanding , we find it in the primates in a way we do n’t find it in language , ” he says .
“ So there ’s an evolutionary foundation to build on in understanding human behavior . ”
Which brings us back to baseball .
“ There ’s the fundamental question of human creativity : how do we make up games ? ” says Jackendoff .
“ It ’s a whole new conceptual domain that has its own logic — here ’s what you have to do when there ’s a runner on second base . ”
There are multiple levels of meaning “ all going on at once that you need for your understanding . ”
He says he hopes to develop that premise more , “ as a way of dealing with the complexity of everyday human thought . ”
Who knew that the likes of Red Sox slugger David Ortiz could teach us so much about ourselves ?

When smart people make dumb arguments they tend to fall into one of a few categories .
I ’ve documented five of the most common bad arguments I see at websites where otherwise intelligent geeks , math nerds and skeptics hang out and discuss things .
Chances are you ’ve encountered at least one of these arguments , maybe you ’ve even used one of them yourself .
#1 : Occam ’s razor
In simple terms , the idea of Occam ’s razor is that , whenever possible , simple models are to be preferred .
Note that Occam ’s razor tells you absolutely nothing about whether a model or a theory is good or bad , useful or worthless .
It ’s is a rule of thumb .
And while not necessarily a bad one , in practice it tends to act like intellect retardant to put out active minds who question existing ( often simplistic ) , beliefs and scientific constructs .
Let me make this very clear : Occam ’s razon does n’t prove anything .
In particular , and despite how it is commonly used , it does n’t show that the more likely , or “ simple ” , explanation is the correct one .
Unlikely , complicated things happen all the time .
If you do n’t believe this , go flip a coin a thousand times .
I guarantee you that the exact result you get will only happen once in a godzillion tries .
In terms of ( absolute ) likelihood , explaining what you just observed with probability theory and stochastic processes is way more complicated than the assertion “ that ’s what God wanted ” , a theory which , if true , explains your effectively impossible result with 100 % likelihood .
I ’m guessing that ’s not the can of worms you hoped to open up with Occam ’s razor ?
# 2 : You ’re a hypocrite .
Yes , and so are you .
So what ?
Do I really need to explain why this agumentum - ad - hypocrisum ( note , made - up Latin ) is so bad ?
Given that accusations of hypocrisy are almost as popular as kittens in the blogosphere , I suspect I do .
So here goes : showing that your opponent is a hypocrite proves nothing except that they are human .
It does n’t make their arguments wrong , and only weakens them under very limited circumstances , like when you catch a sworn bretharian sneaking a pint of Häagen Dazs to keep from starving to death .
Beyond that , calling your opponent a hypocrite has less nutritional value than a peep .
# 3 : That ’s just an anecdote .
It does n’t prove anything .
Repeat after me : Anecdotes are evidence .
Nothing more , but certainly nothing less .
In the context of a common event followed by another common event ( I got a headache after stopping at three red lights in a row ) , anecdotal evidence is nearly useless .
In terms of more rare events ( I got kuru after eating my sister ) , anecdotal evidence can be extraordinarily powerful .
Taken to its extreme , discounting anecdotal evidence led ( presumably intelligent ) academics to hold firm to fallacies like the idea that fireflies can’t flash all in unison , long after anecdotal evidence had come in from reliable observers .
# 4 : No known mechanism
There are lots of intelligent ways to argue that homeopathy does n’t work .
You can cite studies ( although you may find that not all of them confirm your beliefs ) , or you can say that believers are the random subset of the people who have tried it and then afterwords felt an improvement .
I ’m not going to weigh in on the subject , except to note that one argument I see used fairly often is that homeopathy does n’t work because it can’t work , and it ca n’t work because we do n’t understand how it possibly could .
To see how bad this argument is you need to look at the assumptions behind it and view it in historical context .
What people are really saying with this argument is :
Our current scientific model is comprehensive and infallible .
It accounts for all observations , and it has no holes or leaks .
I ’m going to assume that you are able to see the problem with this mindset yourself .
I ’ll just note that one particularly unfortunate use of this argument led doctors to reject hand washing before performing operations or delivering babies .
After all , evidence that fastidious midwives had lower infection rates was purely anecdotal ( see above ) , and there was no reason to believe cleanliness could make a difference in the pre-germ era .
There was no known mechanism .
# 5 : Three guys with boards
I ’m calling this the “ three guys with boards ” argument in honor of those skeptics who , whenever someone mentions crop circles , declare “ it ’s a hoax .
Three guys with boards admitted they did it . ”
In fact , some guys with boards did indeed admit to creating a crop circle , and they showed us how they did it .
So what ’s wrong with this argument ?
The problems is that you ca n’t discount all anomalous observations as “ fakes ” just because some are known to be fakes , nor does the possibility of faking an event mean that all such events must have been faked .
Obviously , scientists do n’t like playing games of intellectual wack - a- mole .
If you research enough supposed “ unexplained mysteries ” , and come away convinced each time that the mystery is bogus , the tendency to dismiss other , similar claims outright is understandable .
That said , “ three guys with boards ” is still a dumb argument , especially when you are going against claims of specific evidence that ca n’t be easily explained away as a hoax .
For example , we have large , complicated , precisely implemented crop circles done in a short span of time and exhibiting strangely bent stalks .
This evidence may fall far short of irrefutable proof of alien intervention , but it does require much more than dismissively stating that we know they are all fakes .
We do n’t .
More broadly , any attempt to automatically sort new observations into known categories ( often categories that make us comfortable ) is a bad idea .
Unfortunately there are no shortcuts when it comes to evaluating data or evidence .
It has to be done the hard way , one piece at a time .

Lexi would suffer in many ways during her first year of high school , which ended Friday .
Her grades plunged .
She withdrew socially and coped with painful self - doubt .
Unlike 15 - year - old Phoebe Prince , the South Hadley High School student whose suicide in January triggered a criminal investigation , public soul - searching , and a new antibullying law in Massachusetts , Lexi ’s ordeal did not end in death or attract widespread attention .
But in many ways , her case illustrates forms of bullying that are far more common , and is more instructive of the difficulties that school administrators across the state are likely to face this fall as they try to comply with Massachusetts ’ new antibullying law .
“ I knew from the beginning , ’’ Lexi says now .
“ I knew it was basically everyone against me . ’’
Lexi ’s fears soon came true .
In the months that followed , according to her account , backed up by others , students taunted her at school .
Boys called her “ slut ’ ’ and “ whore , ’’ girls snickered .
Groups of students picked on her , surrounding her on the stairs or pushing her in the cafeteria .
She received threatening calls on her cellphone .
Anger and shame washed over her as she read .
The image Lexi had tried to cultivate for herself — of the pretty , polished , self - confident girl — suddenly felt false and foolish .
And her hopes of winning friends turned to dread .
“ You look like a rat that has been put on crack . . . in other words ugly as balls , ’’ read one of the long string of comments that had appeared below the pictures .
Lexi opened her laptop , signed on to Facebook and felt herself flush with humiliation .
On the screen were pictures a girlfriend had taken a few months before while horsing around , of Lexi making faces at the camera .
The pictures had been a joke between friends .
But now , posted online by a boy she hardly knew , they were an invitation for ridicule .
The first day of school , and the jitters that came with it , passed .
But then , after school on the second or third day , a friend sent a text to Lexi ’s cellphone : “ Go online . ’’
She had some idea what to expect at the school in one of the affluent suburbs west of Boston .
She knew it was respected for its academics .
But she also knew that in its social culture , looks mattered .
So the 14 - year - old rose early , and chose her clothes carefully .
She could n’t control much about the days ahead .
But she could make sure that she looked right , that her hair was sleek and straight , that she fit in .
Lexi felt excited , and a little bit worried , as she headed off to high school last September .
She knew it would take some getting used to — the unfamiliar schedule and the sprawling building , the blur of strange faces passing in the hallways .
First in a series of occasional articles on bullying , and its impact on students , families , and schools .
Lexi believes that when school started , her spurned friend set out to punish her .
Over the summer , she had decided to part ways with a girl she had known since grade school .
They had shared sleepovers , secrets , and favorite movies .
It was the same girl who had snapped the silly pictures that ended up on Facebook .
Lexi says she ultimately decided her friend had become a negative influence .
Lexi says that in her case , there was a backstory to the drama that enveloped her when school started .
Speaking generally about bullying , school officials said they are often confounded in trying to craft effective responses because in conflicts between students , it is common for both parties to consider themselves victims .
School administrators say they dispute aspects of Lexi ’s account .
But they declined to discuss what those aspects are or any specifics of her case .
They said speaking publicly would not be in the girl ’s best interest , despite the offer of a waiver from Lexi and her grandmother granting them permission to talk freely .
To corroborate their account , Lexi ’s grandmother provided the Globe with some 50 pages of e-mail correspondence with school officials about Lexi ’s experiences and the school ’s involvement with her case .
A parent of a student at the school who witnessed much of the bullying also confirmed many parts of Lexi ’s story .
To tell her story , the Globe approached Lexi and her grandmother , who is her legal guardian , after they and several dozen other families responded to a Globe request posted on Boston.com seeking students with stories about bullying .
The girl and her grandmother say they were willing to cooperate in hopes of raising awareness and helping others , and because of their frustration with the school ’s responses to Lexi ’s situation .
Each agreed to speak on the record , using their full name .
But out of consideration for her age , her situation , and her privacy , now and in the years ahead , the Globe elected to withhold Lexi ’s last name and the name of the school where she is a student .
Indeed , what happened to Lexi over the course of those months , and the seeming ineffectiveness of the school ’s responses , underscores the human complexity of problems lumped under the heading of bullying .
They include subtleties not easily addressed by regulation — the difficulty of distinguishing routine conflicts from more destructive , ongoing harassment ; the challenge of monitoring and controlling antagonism expressed over the Internet ; and the tricky landscape of adolescent relationships .
Under the law , all schools must develop procedures for dealing with bullies .
Teachers must report bullying , parents must be informed of it , and principals must investigate .
Yet , most all of those things happened in Lexi ’s case and still the bullying continued , even escalated .
“ This harassment is dangerous and needs to stop immediately , ’’ she wrote in an e-mail to the school a week into the year , according to correspondence she provided the Globe .
She was n’t about to sit and watch her granddaughter suffer at school .
So , almost as soon as the bullying started , she began calling and e-mailing school officials , sometimes daily , to report what Lexi had told her and to demand that they take action .
Evelyn is 65 , outspoken , tough , and practical .
She once owned her own business .
When Lexi was younger , she had taken legal custody of the girl from her mother , Evelyn ’s daughter , out of concern for the girl ’s welfare and safety .
She has kept close tabs on her , especially as the girl makes her way through adolescence .
Over the summer , Evelyn had applauded her granddaughter ’s decision to part ways with her childhood friend .
To encourage Lexi to expand her horizons and find new friends , she had insisted she go to a sleepover camp .
When Lexi thrived there , Evelyn had been thrilled and proud .
At night in her room , though , it was harder to fight off the frustration and helplessness that besieged her .
With Facebook glowing on her laptop , she would see taunting posts from classmates .
Sometimes , she would fire off angry replies .
She imagined classmates writing online messages about her , and she would feel torn — wanting to click on their pages to see what people were saying , but dreading what she might find .
At school , she says , she wore a kind of armor .
She kept her head high , her eyes cold .
Now she had been singled out in a new way .
It was tormenting for a girl who had wanted only to blend in , something that had never felt easy .
She lived with her grandmother , unlike most other kids she knew .
They rented a modest duplex , smaller than most homes in their neighborhood .
All Lexi knew was that it hurt .
The mockery on Facebook had set off a torrent of insults at school .
She says that both boys and girls — some students she knew and others who were strangers — called her ugly , annoying , a slut .
These , along with the stream of hurtful online comments , left her feeling threatened at school , Lexi says .
The Globe tried to contact the girl several times through her parents , who did not respond to phone calls requesting an interview or a note left at their home .
Lexi does n’t know if her theory is true .
If it is , what she described is a textbook case of bullying by girls , who frequently target former friends , use embarrassing photos , and criticize victims ’ looks , according to a study this year by the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center , a bullying research and education project at Bridgewater State College .
For Lexi , the string of small indignities continued .
A boy in her history class ordered her to change seats , telling her he did n’t like looking at the back of her head .
Lexi reported the incident , and he was punished with two sessions of detention , according to an e-mail from an administrator .
On the bus home the same day , another boy talked loudly about “ snitches , ’’ making sure Lexi could hear .
Lexi ’s friend started dreading school , and pleaded with her mother to let her stay home .
“ What kind of message are we giving these young women that they are to tolerate such harassment ? ’’ she wrote in one e-mail to the school .
Meanwhile , Lexi ’s friend ’s mother described weeks of daily taunting , boys calling Lexi and her daughter “ whore ’ ’ and “ slut . ’’
Their conduct went largely unchecked , she said , and amounted , in her view , to sexual harassment .
“ I was n’t even paying attention to classes , ’’ Lexi says .
“ I felt like I always had to be on the lookout . ’’
Her grandmother soon saw Lexi losing sleep and falling behind on her schoolwork .
The teenager withdrew , retreating to her room .
She did n’t want to talk about what was going on .
After class , as Lexi and her friend started down a crowded staircase , one of the girls from the class pushed a boy into them , Lexi and the friend ’s mother said .
Lexi lost her balance and grabbed a railing to stop her fall .
Her friend lurched forward into some other students .
In a science class that Friday , a group of girls including Lexi ’s former friend laughed at a question Lexi asked the teacher .
“ I do n’t think it ’s funny , ’’ Lexi snapped back .
The next day , Lexi ’s friend ’s mother told the school she planned to call police .
“ I encourage you to go to the police , ’’ came the school ’s reply , according to a copy of the e-mail she provided .
At school the day after the episode on the stairs , a boy called Lexi and two friends “ the three muska - whores , ’’ Lexi and the friend ’s mother said .
The school ordered the boy to serve two sessions of detention , according to Lexi ’s friend ’s mother , who spoke to the Globe on the condition of anonymity to protect her daughter from further harassment .
She said an administrator informed her of the discipline .
She was not the only student feeling victimized .
One of Lexi ’s close friends , who had stuck by her as others at the school turned against her , was enduring the same insults .
Evelyn and the other girl ’s mother kept in touch , comparing notes and sharing their frustration .
But the tensions only seemed to escalate .
On Monday , Sept. 14th , the start of the third week of school , Lexi says five boys surrounded her and her friend on a staircase .
The boys held up a cellphone that displayed the hated pictures .
They called her a bitch , said Lexi and a parent of a girl who was present .
Lexi told them to stop .
She threw a cup of iced coffee at them .
She was given a detention , but her irate grandmother refused to let her serve it .
It was not an unreasonable request .
But it left Lexi feeling worried about being viewed a “ snitch . ’’
As other students joined in the harassment , school officials sounded frustrated .
“ It would be very difficult to monitor or interfere with every student observed speaking with Lexi , ’’ an administrator wrote to her grandmother in late September .
“ I have asked her to report harassing behavior / remarks . ’’
Punishments followed , but not swiftly or consistently enough for the two families , who believe stronger action at the start might have stamped the problem out before it mushroomed .
Last fall , as the demands for action from Lexi ’s grandmother and her friend ’s mother piled up in school administrators ’ e-mail inboxes , the school wrestled with the conflicts , according to e-mails provided by both families .
After receiving the first reports of problems , officials called in the handful of students Lexi and her friend had said were bothering them , and called their parents , steps required under school policy “ before we can institute the punishment scenario , ’’ according to an e-mail from an administrator .
It is part of a school philosophy that is enshrined in the school ’s discipline code .
The school “ prides itself on maintaining an atmosphere [ where ] respect and thoughtful , civil behavior is the norm , ’’ states the first sentence .
The code bans harassment , online and in person , and goes further to condemn name - calling and taunting .
“ We take it on every single time , ’’ he said .
In an interview , the principal said the school addresses every report of bullying or harassment , with tactics ranging from conversations with students and parents to detentions , suspensions , and requests for police intervention .
The high school , it seems clear , was also struggling .
“ I was not only angry , but desperate , ’’ she says .
“ It was like a virus , and I think they could n’t control it . ’’
By the end of September , Lexi ’s friend ’s mother had had enough .
Because of the bullying , and the school ’s failure to stop it , she says , she moved her family to another school district .
A second mediation , between Lexi and her former friend , the one she believed had tried to punish her , was less successful .
“ I was yelling at her , saying , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ , and she was just sitting there , ’’ Lexi recalls .
“ I said , this is going nowhere , and I left . ’’
Lexi told her it was a lie , and she left the mediation feeling better .
The girl who had pushed Lexi on the stairs had been suspended .
School officials then proposed another step , a supervised mediation session where the two could work out their differences .
In the Sept. 23 meeting , Lexi says , the girl told her that she had been angry because she had been told that Lexi had said mean things about her .
That afternoon , her grandmother said , Lexi cried and fell asleep at 6 p.m .
An older boy pushed her so she stumbled into a table .
A week after her suspension , Lexi was in the cafeteria eating lunch with another girl , when a group of students approached .
They insulted her , she says .
She told them to leave her alone and got up and tried to walk away .
One day , after school , Lexi climbed into her grandmother ’s car and threw back her head in defeat .
“ Nobody believes me , ’’ Evelyn remembers her saying .
To some students who had harassed her , the punishment looked like confirmation of their slurs , and as the story spread , it stoked the fires again .
There were no cameras on the bus , and the driver saw nothing , she says .
She says she was told the boy denied it before he confessed .
Lexi denied the accusation .
Evelyn took her word , but the school did not .
Administrators denied her appeal , and suspended her and the accused boy for two days .
Then , in November , came a phone call from the school : A girl who rode the school bus with Lexi had accused her of inappropriate conduct with a male student on the ride home .
Evelyn did n’t think that things could get much worse .
“ Not once did I hear that from them , ’’ she said .
Evelyn says no one from the school ever raised concerns with her that Lexi , herself , was at times a bully .
Lexi and her grandmother say that the girl did not always play the meek , defenseless victim .
When antagonized , she sometimes lashed back , swearing at people who insulted her , or even pushing someone away from her .
Her grandmother says she wanted the girl to defend herself .
“ It ’s much easier for kids to see how they ’re hurt than how they hurt others , ’’ said a school administrator who oversees violence prevention .
Frequently , school officials said , the same students play both roles , acting as bully and victim — but they , and their parents , only see themselves as victims .
“ I ca n’t keep it from happening in the back seat of my car , with my two kids , and here we ’ve got 1,600 students , ’’ the principal said .
In an interview last month about bullying in general , school officials said the problem can be thorny , even with teacher training and an active peer mediation program , because adolescents ’ friendships come and go from day to day , conflicts between students often go back years , and student bystanders typically do n’t want to intervene when they see bullying .
When she did report problems , she says school administrators “ were always asking me what I could have done to prevent it .
I would say , ‘ Nothing , ’ and they would say , ‘ Well , there ’s always something . ’
It seemed like they were always trying to put it on me . ’’
The moment is burned in her memory , she says .
Tables full of students were watching .
“ I do n’t know how much more she can stand , ’’ Evelyn wrote to school officials in an e-mail .
Some progress Evelyn increasingly worried about her granddaughter ’s state of mind .
Every morning , she called to Lexi in her bedroom to make sure she was awake and felt waves of panic when the girl did n’t respond right away .
Weeks after her suspension , Lexi ’s report card came home with the first F’s of her life .
Evelyn increasingly worried about her granddaughter ’s state of mind .
Every morning , she called to Lexi in her bedroom to make sure she was awake and felt waves of panic when the girl did n’t respond right away .
Weeks after her suspension , Lexi ’s report card came home with the first F’s of her life .
The girl ’s therapist , at Evelyn ’s request , summarized the impact on Lexi of the harassment at school : feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness ; loss of motivation and interests ; social withdrawal ; difficulty concentrating due to emotional stress .
“ When people constantly put you down , it gets in your head , ’’ Lexi says .
“ You always try to fix it , even though there ’s nothing to fix .
. . .
They forget , but you ’re still worrying about it . ’’
Still , the 14 - year - old persisted , and found fragile cause for optimism .
By late winter , the worst of the teasing seemed to be over .
She made a few new friends , upperclassmen who assured her that things would get better .
A tutor helped her pull her grade up in math , to an A - minus from an F.
During February school vacation , she visited with friends from summer camp .
But the fallout continued .
Earlier this year , after one of Lexi ’s new friendships ended abruptly , her grandmother called the other girl ’s mother to find out why .
According to Evelyn , the woman said she was sorry , but she had to protect her daughter ’s reputation .
Reflecting on everything that happened , Lexi described what feels to her like a coldness in her peers .
“ It ’s hard to explain , ’’ she said one afternoon this spring , her feet in flip - flops pulled up in a kitchen chair .
“ I do n’t feel like they think I ’m a person . ’’
Her grandmother thinks Lexi should start fresh in a new school in the fall .
But Lexi , in spite of all she ’s been through , is n’t sure .
She does n’t think schools or laws can stop bullying .
But she believes in something simpler : time , and patience .
She holds onto the advice one of her older friends gave her , that “ nothing is forever . ’’
“ Everything goes away , ’’ she says .
“ You think it wo n’t end , but it will . ’’

The Secret Agenda of Gay Parents : First We Trick You Into Treating Us Like Human Beings ...
The stinking little douche who wrote this for a Catholic newspaper in Boston could n't bring himself to refer to gay parents as parents or refer to our children as our children .
Here 's how he gets started :
The question arises of whether children in the custody of ( one cannot say , “ children of ” ) same - sex couples should be admitted to Catholic parochial schools .
Michael Pakaluk is against admitting children with gay parents to Catholic schools .
The first problem , as he sees it , is the " inevitability of scandal . "
What kind of scandal ?
Gay dads blowing each other under the bleachers in the gym during home games ?
Lesbian moms seducing sexually - frustrated , bi-curious Catholic moms who are n't getting any at home ?
It was inevitable that either the teacher , or some parent , would deal with the two men in such a way as implicitly to teach my son , or other children in the class , that there is nothing wrong with same - sex relationships .
But this is scandal : that is , leading a “ little one ” astray in some serious matter by the example you set .
Yes , yes : we would n't want teachers and parents treating gay parents like human beings , now would we ?
( Please ignore that " do unto others " stuff in the Bible — Jesus is omniscient and everything , but he never could have imagined the existence of gay parents . )
Maybe Mr. Pakaluk would be more comfortable with same - sex parents if teachers agreed to spit in their faces whenever they 're forced to interact with one in front of the impressionable little children ?
The second reason is that parents are rightly given access to a child ’s classroom , and yet I could not trust the designs of the same - sex couple .
A mother or father may volunteer to read to the class or chaperone for a class trip .
If the homosexual parent does so , what guarantee would I have that he would not be an advocate for his lifestyle , implicitly if not explicitly ?
... I saw this happening in my son ’s school .
The same - sex couple was interestingly activist in hosting pizza parties , sponsoring tables at fundraisers , and volunteering when parental help was needed .
So let me see if I follow you , Mr. Pakaluk : Even if gay parents refrain from reading aloud from And Tango Makes Three or the Leatherman 's Handbook in front of a room full of third - graders — and even if we refrain from arranging pepperonis into meaty little rainbows on the pizzas we serve at our depraved " pizza parties " — just the presence of gay parents in the classroom " implicitly " advocates for " the gay lifestyle . "
I can see why you would object to that : the gay lifestyle is a depraved and deranged one , as everyone knows , and our lives are wholly dedicated to the pursuit of hedonistic sexual pleasures .
Reading to schoolchildren , acting as chaperones on class trips , and hosting pizza parties — we 're not doing any of that because , oh , we care about our children and we 're interested in helping out .
Those are all just ploys to mask our real agenda .
Which is to get hardcore gay pornography into the hands of Catholic schoolchildren who are n't lucky enough to have gay parents :
The third reason is that it seemed a real danger that the boy being raised by the same - sex couple would bring to school something obscene or pornographic , or refer to such things in conversation , as they go along with the same - sex lifestyle , which — as not being related to procreation — is inherently eroticized and pornographic .
He might expose other children to such things , as he might easily have encountered them in his household .
Pornography plays no role whatsoever in the " straight lifestyle . "
Straight parents do n't view pornography .
Straight parents do n't indulge in non-procreative sex acts .
Straight sex is n't " inherently eroticized " — let 's take a moment here to extend our sympathies to poor Mrs. Pakaluk — and straight sex does n't make a good pornographic subject because the procreative element ruins the fun for everybody .
Which is why there 's no such thing as straight porn .
Look , I 'm not interested in sending my kid — a baptized Catholic just like his culturally Catholic dad — to a Catholic grade school , and I 'm a little mystified by gay parents who want to send their kids to Catholic schools .
Even if I was n't worried about my kid being taught to " hate the sin " — the only upside Mr. Pakaluk can see to kids with gay parents attending Catholic schools — I would be concerned about my kid encountering ranting , raving sex- negative nut cases like Mr. Pakaluk here .
Odds are good that my kid is going to be straight when he grows up and Mr. Pakaluk is not the kind of heterosexual role model I want my kid exposed to .

Could n’t have said it better myself .
Over the past seven days I ’ve seen the city where I ’ve spent most of my life transform into a police state , to the point where I am honestly scared of the roving gangs of riot cops wandering around downtown , looking for trouble .
Think I ’m overreacting ?
Police yesterday were given sweeping powers of arrest for the duration of the G - 20 Toronto Summit — with no public debate , no prior notice .
One of the early arrests was a computer security professional and member of the hacklab .
to community .
His crime ?
Penetration - testing the “ security theatre ” around the event .
Having purchased a hacker - related book or two myself over the weekend I ’m expecting my door to be knocked down and my cat and I to be dragged off any minute now .
Even if I ’m lucky enough to escape such a fate , G - 20 panic has still made it all the way north to my sleepy condo , where additional security has been hired ( I have n’t verified their powers of arrest or if they ’re armed ) and the following memo distributed :
A recommendation was made to have residents of townhouses on the street sides remove any items that my be used as potential weapons from the patios .
This may include seasonal furniture , barbeques , propane tanks , gardening tools or ornaments , bicycles , etc .
Who knew that airborne garden gnomes were public enemy number one ?
As for the benefits to be reaped by our fair city I certainly can’t see any , at least beyond the overtime for police and the financial windfall for chain link fence moguls .
I ’ve heard the theory that our government deliberately chose the downtown core as the G - 20 site to show off our robust financial sector — too bad the hard - working folks who have actually made our economy so robust have been relocated or otherwise inconvenienced by the summit .
But what do I know ?
You can watch this televised debate and hear people who are smarter than me weigh in on the subject .
As a potential terror threat ordinary citizen the message to me has been made quite clear : Keep your head down , do what you ’re told and stay away from the security perimeter .
Culture of Fear , anyone ?
By day 57 ( June 15 ) , if all the oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico had been used for fuel , it could have powered 68,000 cars , and 6,100 trucks , and 3,100 ships for a full year , according to University of Delaware Prof .
James J. Corbett , who updates the numbers daily on his website .
That 's based on the average estimated spill rate of 30,000 barrels of oil per day .
On June 10 , the science team analyzing the spill updated their estimates to range between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels per day , nearly double their original estimated flow rate .
Corbett now includes calculations based on the new average on his website at UD .
Visitors to the website can choose the spill rate they believe is most accurate from a range of reported estimates , and the website will automatically calculate how many cars , trucks , and ships could have been powered for a year , based on Bureau of Transportation Statistics .
Corbett , a professor of marine policy in UD's College of Earth , Ocean , and Environment , works on energy and environmental solutions for transportation .
“ What he ’s doing is really admirable , ” said Bethany Kraft , executive director of the Alabama Coastal Foundation , a nonprofit environmental group .
“ He ’s taking things into his own hands instead of waiting for other people to do something about it . ”
Image Volunteers worked to assemble a boom behind barges set up at the mouth of Weeks Bay as part of a plan to keep spilled oil out .
Credit ... Chang W. Lee / The New York Times
Mr. Hinton went into action the first week of May , calling a town meeting to discuss ideas for protecting Weeks Bay , an estuary off Mobile Bay that supports 19 federally protected species , including bald eagles and wood storks .
The residents came up with a solution that is unique on the gulf , said Malissa Valdes , a spokeswoman for the unified command , which approves all responses in federally governed waters .
From the start , the townspeople were unsatisfied with the unified command ’s plan for Weeks Bay  a strand of floating surface barriers known as boom stretched across the bay ’s mouth .
Because of tidal currents , any oil on top of the water could splash over the boom , then into the bay and up the Fish and Magnolia Rivers into nurseries for area wildlife .
A plan to string boom across Mobile Bay failed when water shredded the barrier .
Mr. Hinton ’s solution was simple : run a wall of barges across the mouth of Weeks Bay to block the current , then run five layers of boom behind it  two to block the oil , and three strands of absorbent boom to soak up any oil that got through the containment layers .
The town bought the boom right away , before an increase in demand nearly quadrupled the price .
Money for the project came from the state , which received $ 25 million from BP for emergency response efforts .
Oil companies are supposed to have spill - response plans prepared before they begin drilling in American offshore waters .
Minerals Management Service safety regulators are supposed to scrutinize those plans before signing off on them .
But it ’s looking more and more like no one bothered to read BP ’s backup plan before the Deepwater Horizon rig began drilling 5,000 feet below the ocean ’s surface .
Here ’s the evidence :
1. BP mentions sea lions , seals , sea otters , walruses in its Oil Spill Response Plan for the Gulf of Mexico region .
The geniuses who wrote the plan either do n’t know jack about wildlife , or they cribbed text out of a plan for the Arctic region .
2. BP’s “ plan ” offers a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “ primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [ for ] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour , 7 days a week basis . ”
Apparently the site did n’t have a 100 - ton underwater containment dome in stock — it took rescue workers days to build one in an early attempt to stop the leak … which failed .
3 . The “ plan ” included no information about tracking sub - surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts , although more oil may be spreading below the surface than at the top .
4 . The “ plan ” includes no oceanic or meteorological data , despite the ocean - floor site in a hurricane - prone region .
5 . The “ plan ” directs BP media spokespeople to never make “ promises that property , ecology , or anything else will be restored to normal . ”
Sounds like weaselly responsibility - dodging , although this may be more honest than the company intended .
6 . The “ plan ” included no measures for preventing disease ( viruses and bacteria ) transmission to captured animals in rehab facilities .
This was found to be a major risk after the Exxon Valdez spill , according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) , which analyzed the response plan and culled these absurd lapses in common sense .
7 . The nearly 600 pages of the “ plan ” consist largely of lists , phone numbers and blank forms , according to PEER Board Member Rick Steiner , a marine professor and conservationist who tracked the Exxon Valdez spill .
“ This response plan is not worth the paper it is written on , ” Steiner said in a prepared statement .
“ Incredibly , this voluminous document never once discusses how to stop a deep water blowout even though BP has significant deep water operations in the Gulf . ”
Even if BP tried to craft a decent plan , all such contingency plans are basically “ fantasy documents , ” according to Rutgers sociologist Lee Clarke , who studies disasters .
“ These documents let everybody get through the day , ” he told Grist .
“ They provide comfort that risks are under control .
The plans are based on assumptions that you can control the uncontrollable , and the truth is there ’s nothing much that can be done . ”
Good times , huh ?
If the giant bleeding gash in the earth has you bummed out , go check out some constructive responses .

: ICFP contest entry the first
Welp , the 2010 ICFP contest happened .
I was on team CBV ( Cult of the Bound Variable ) with a bunch of CMU grad students and otherwise CMU - affiliated people .
We placed in the top 5 , which is exciting ; we wo n't know how we did beyond that until the ICFP happens and they announce the results .
My part in this included the following :
- Helping to decode the trit - strings .
I did n't take part in this until we managed to get to the point of having the server 's parser to query as an oracle ; then I worked on it with jcreed
- Writing lots of perl .
In particular , I wrote the perl code that drives our Mathematica - and - AMPL based solver ; it grabs a car , runs an SML program to get the matrices and output them as a Mathematica program , runs Mathematica to expand them into scalar equations in a format AMPL can work with , then runs AMPL on the result to try to solve it .
The only really interesting part here was gross parsing , the ease of which impressed at least one teammate enough that he 's talking about learning Perl .
Mission accomplished . ;-)
- I played with a lot of matrix math ; but this mostly ended up being for my own entertainment .
- I debugged some SML , in particular our car - with - fuel checker .
Debugging SML is much easier with exception backtraces turned on , let me tell you .
Also , I maintain that a function which takes the product of a list of matrices is Just Wrong if it throws an exception for the empty list , instead of producing an appropriate identity matrix ... but making it take an int for size , which is what I did , is admittedly awkward .
- I probably did other stuff I was too tired to remember ...
There are probably other interesting things I can say about the contest , but since I just wrote up documentation of the trit - encoding of cars , I wanted to write a basic post so that I could include it .
Maybe more will come later ; knowing me , probably not .
The following is copied from a blog comment .
" " "
As regards the ternary encoding : I was one of the rare people who really enjoyed puzzling through it , and in hopes that I can convince you that the encoding did have an underlying neat organization , I will present to you the schema I worked out for it , written in pseudo - ML - datatypes .
Note that the representation of the tuple ( ‘a * ‘b ) is just the representation of ‘ a , concatenated with the representation of ‘b .
car = chamber list (*
No , we do n’t know how to represent ‘ a list yet … *)
chamber = tank list * bool * tank list
tank = nat
bool = nat (* restricted to 0 or 1 , with 0 being true *)
Now here ’s where it starts to get weird :
nat = trit list
trit = 0 | 1 | 2
So a nat is just a list of trits .
But how is a list encoded ?
And how do you convert such a list into a numeric value ?
Tackling the second question first ,
value ( [ ] ) = 0
value ( [ 0 ] ) = 1
value ( [ 1 ] ) = 2
value ( [ 2 ] ) = 3
value ( [ 0,0 ] ) = 4
value ( [ 0,1 ] ) = 5
… and so on .
Now , on to how lists are encoded .
EDIT : see below for a better way to do this part .
I will call the encoding of list lengths “ wnat ” for “ weird nat ” , since that ’s how it looked to me at first .
wnat = 0 | 1 | 22 * nat
Where the numeric value of the wnat is 0 , or 1 , or the nat plus 2 .
And now we represent a list of N elements as the wnat N followed by the elements concatenated together :
‘ a list = N : wnat .
‘a ^ N
in very rough made - up notation .
EDIT : After comparing notes with someone in the
' a list = 0 | 1 * ' a | 22 * N:nat * ' a ^ ( N+2 )
As compared to the struck - through encoding I give above , involving an extra type of nats , this one feels much simpler .
END OF EDIT
That together should be enough information to encode and decode cars , and to get a sense of why I , at least , think the encoding is actually pretty elegant .

Thus :'a list = 0 | 1 * ' a | 22 * N:nat * ' a ^ ( N+2 ) As compared to the struck - through encoding I give above , involving an extra type of nats , this one feels much simpler .

" " " : per 's comment below , I had made an error , now fixed , by claiming 22N encoded a list of length N , when it is actually length N+2 ( since 0 and 1 already have their own separate encodings . )

Unraveling the problem to its mathematical core by Saturday night was crucial , as was writing automated scripts that could scrape for cars , solve them , and submit solutions without intervention .
Unfortunately , the solvers we were able to come up with on our own were not very sophisticated ( especially compared to what you guys were doing ) , but fortunately , many teams submitted many cars that were not mathematically interesting .
We solved over 2,000 cars using only 1x1 and 2x2 matrices .
Congratulations , CBV ! and I gave it a shot with two other Portland software guys .
Despite me coming down with acute appendicitis on the day of the contest , the other three team members managed to get to 16th place without using any external software .

I too enjoyed puzzling through the ternary encoding .
I love doing that kind of detective work .
When we figured out the natural number encoding
' a list = 0 | 1 * ' a | 22 * N:nat * ' a ^ N
jes5199
Anyway , congratulations on doing so well .
Being in the top five is a commendable feat .
We did n't think of integrating with a 3rd party math package like Mathematica or AMPL .
I can see why that would have made a huge difference in your score .

I looked at each other and said " that is exactly the kind of encoding a functional programmer would choose " .

Paul ( team vorpal ) Reply ) ( Thread From : _adept_ Date : June 22nd , 2010 02:54 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Correction :
Length encoded after " 22 " is ( number of elements in a list - 2 ) .
That is , 22{0} is a list of length ( 2+0 ) .

Thanks !
All credit goes to the people who did the actual work , I just did the perl hacking . ;-)
I am glad we had someone on the team who knew how to apply Mathematica +AMPL to the problem , and had a copy handy .
( And the AMPL company is letting us borrow a copy of the full version for free if we want to enter the termination competition with it . )
BTW , I can't remember how we LJ - met before -- was it a previous ICFP , or was it the MIT Mystery Hunt ?

Despite the fact that we do n’t all live in a nation where guns are freely available to all and sundry , most of us will have heard of the designers or the guns themselves on this list .
Here is a quick trip through the history of arms manufacturing .
10 Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling
The designer of the first successful machine gun , although not the first automatic machine gun .
It was , in effect , a gigantic revolver of six barrels operated by a hand crank .
A bin of several hundred loose rounds ( not belt - fed ) was set on top and gravity fed the ammunition into the breech , enabling someone who knew nothing of firearms to lay a sheet of lead into an advancing army , at about 200 rounds a minute .
To the Civil War soldiers accustomed to muzzle - loading single rounds at a time , this might well have been like seeing something out of Star Wars .
It had its drawbacks , though , primarily that so much black powder churned up into a huge cloud around the weapon , and all the enemy artillery and snipers honed it on it .
9 John Cantius Garand
The designer of the M1 Garand , which the U. S. military used to great effect in WWII , Korea and even Vietnam .
General George Patton famously called it , “ the greatest battle implement ever devised . ”
It was the first successful semi-automatic rifle to be issued to the military of any country .
It fired the 30 - 06 Springfield round , an extremely powerful piece of hardware , which had been the standard since 1906 , when it was patented for the bolt - action Springfield .
Soldiers entering combat were confident of themselves , because they had 8 rounds of serious firepower that they could fire as fast as they could pull the trigger .
No movement was required to operate the action of the weapon , and the weapon weighed around 10 pounds : light enough to carry easily , yet heavy enough to manage recoil .
8 David Marshall Williams
“ Carbine ” Williams went to prison in 1921 for selling moonshine , when the raid on his still resulted in an officer ’s death .
Williams swore that he was not guilty , and his trial resulted in a hung jury .
However , he then confessed to 2nd degree murder , having fired at a sound without knowing if it was a man or an animal .
He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years , but was pardoned after 8 years because , in the prison machine shop , he invented two brilliant principles for the military ’s firearms .
Most importantly , he invented the short - stroke piston for use in gas - operated small arms .
His patented design has not been improved on since 1940 , when he perfected it , and it was first used in the M1 Carbine .
The U. S. military had been searching for a lighter alternative of the M1 Garand , but still with long - range capability and stopping power .
Williams ’s short - stroke gas piston was the key .
He also invented the floating chamber , which greatly reduces recoil , and enabled the military to train its machine gunners with less expensive .22LR ammunition .
7 Paul and Wilhelm Mauser
Today , the Mauser bolt action is the most widespread of all bolt - action firearms .
It was adopted by the U. S. military for use in the Springfield 1903 , which became standard issue until the M1 Garand .
There are 3 major bolt actions , the Mauser , the Lee-Enfield , and the Mosin - Nagant .
The Mauser has one significant advantage on the other two : a third locking lug at the rear of the bolt .
The other two have only the two locking side lugs , and thus , cannot cope with the higher breech pressures of magnum rounds .
They are , therefore , inadequate for hunting rounds intended to kill large , dangerous game .
The Mauser ’s third lug gives it the strength to fire a round in any caliber currently produced , even the .700 Nitro Express , which is a rifle round almost as large as a 12 gauge slug , but extraordinarily powerful and designed to flip a charging bull elephant backward .
Either of the other two actions would explode in the wielder ’s face if such a powerful round were used .
The Mauser action is the most common bolt action in the world , present in nearly all hunting and military bolt - action rifles , and has not changed at all since the Mauser brothers perfected it in 1871 .
6 Sir Hiram Maxim
The designer of the first truly automatic machine gun , in 1884 .
The Maxim gun was the primary armament of all major armies in WWI , and probably caused more battlefield deaths than any other firearm in history .
The German and Russian versions were almost exact replicas , with only cosmetic changes .
It fired 600 rounds a minute , using the recoil of each round to open the breech and chamber the next .
This rate of fire was beyond belief to anyone in the world at the time .
It was , therefore , the first truly modern weapon of warfare , able to lay waste to entire land armies .
This necessitated the abandonment of the line - abreast approach armies had employed since antiquity .
Classical formation battles were now a thing of the past .
5 John Taliaferro Thompson
Thompson saw in the trench warfare of WWI that infantry needed a “ trench broom , ” a weapon that could sweep away all the enemy in front of the soldier , in the same way as the pump shotgun , but with even more firepower .
He used John Blish ’s delayed blowback breech lock , which enabled the different metals of the weapon ’s moving parts to slide together under the intense pressure of the round ’s discharge without sticking strongly together .
In 1919 , Thompson came up with the Thompson submachine gun , chambered in the man-stopping .45 ACP round .
Thompson ’s idea for a “ trench broom ” was now real , even if trench warfare had been made obsolete .
The Thompson could fire at 600 to 1200 rounds a minute , with sufficient power to stop a 1942 Ford Super Deluxe automobile .
4 Christian Sharps
Designer of the first successful breechloading rifle .
The 1819 Hall rifle was the first breechloader , but was still a flintlock or percussion cap weapon .
Sharps used the brand new self - contained cartridge in his design , which was single shot , employing the sturdy falling block action , and extremely accurate .
With only iron sights , experienced marksmen could hit game animals or enemy soldiers at 1,000 yards .
The cavalries of both sides of the American Civil War used it to great effect , and Sharps continued to improve on it .
The 1874 version is the most well known , chambered in the powerful 45 - 70 hunting cartridge .
3 Benjamin Tyler Henry
Designer of the first breechloading , lever - action , magazine - fed rifle .
The Henry rifle fired about 28 rounds a minute , with a 16 round tubular magazine , in the solid .44 rimfire .
He patented it in 1860 , and 900 were issued to the Union army in 1862 .
The Confederates could n’t believe what they were seeing , and lamented about “ that damn Yankee rifle that they load on Sunday and shoot all week ! ”
Because it used a self - contained cartridge , it was no use for the Confederates to steal them , because they had no ammunition for it .
It was the precursor to all lever - action rifles today , having been improved on very little .
2 Samuel Colt
He did not invent the revolver .
But as a boy he saw that almost all firearms were single - shot muzzleloaders , and thus , when a man had fired , he was a sitting duck for the next 20 seconds , provided that he could reload that quickly .
So he set about inventing “ the impossible gun , ” something that could fire repeatedly 5 or 6 times like Elisha Collier ’s revolving flintlock , but would still be more reliable and faster to reload .
The result was the 1836 percussion cap revolver , which saw widespread use in the American Civil War .
It was the first successful repeating firearm .
1 John Moses Browning
Browning patented 128 designs for firearms and associated apparatuses .
He invented the gas - operated machine gun , an improvement over Maxim ’s recoil operation .
All machine guns since 1895 have used Browning ’s gas operation .
He invented the 1911 model of the Colt .45 handgun , which is recoil - operated , and was standard issue for the U. S. military from 1911 until 1985 .
It is still used by many personnel today , and is one of the most popular handguns in the world .
His design has not changed at all functionally .
He invented the lever action shotgun , based on Henry ’s rifle design with a few moderations .
Then , 6 years later in 1893 , he invented the pump action shotgun .
The function of this action has not changed since .
Then , 7 years later , he still managed to top himself with the semiautomatic shotgun , the first ever .
It is recoil - operated , and remained in production , changing only cosmetically , for 98 years .
He invented the Browning Automatic Rifle , a fully automatic 30 - 06 and a street sweeper if there was one .
He invented the 1919 .30 machine gun , and then even topped this with the 1921 .50 BMG .
He also invented several cartridges still popular today , the ACP rounds in .25 , .32 , .38 , .380 , .45 ; and the .50 BMG .
Preface :
In this post , I describe my adventures figuring out how to write a syntax extension for the OCaml programming language and attempt to provide something of a tutorial on writing a basic extension .
I assume that you 're somewhat familiar with basic parsing technology and context - free grammars --- if not , a good tutorial on parser construction with a tool like Yacc would be worth a read first .
One of the oft - touted benefits of OCaml is Camlp4 , a pre-processor that facilitates extending the OCaml syntax to provide natural support for various constructions .
This has been used for a variety of purposes , such as database type - checking , monad sugaring , and logging .
In the hands of a capable author , a variety of wonders can be introduced to the OCaml language .
I 've used syntax extensions for some time now , particularly PGOCaml and pa_lwt , to make much life with OCaml easier .
I 'd never written one , however , and found the documentation and other relevant material rather intimidating .
Camlp4 documentation is somewhat hard to find , particularly for the current version ( with OCaml 3.10 , they made significant backwards - incompatible changes to Camlp4 ; much of the available tutorial and reference material was thus somewhat obsolete ) .
The documentation that was around I find difficult to start with , particularly since I want to understand what the code I write does and not just cargo - cult it .
But I finally bit the bullet and learned .
And when all was said and done , I have 13 lines of code which provide a small sugar --- sort of a minimal syntax extension .
This extension provides pattern matching over lazy lists , much like llists but far simpler ( and based on the Batteries lazy list module ) .
Here it is , in its entirety , and then I 'll explain how it works and what 's needed to get stared with the bare basics of extending OCaml syntax :
open Camlp4 .
PreCast ; ; open Syntax ; ; EXTEND Gram GLOBAL : patt ; patt : LEVEL " simple " [ [ " [ % " ; " ] " -> < : patt< lazy BatLazyList .Nil >> ] ] ; patt : LEVEL " : : " [ [ p1 = SELF ; " % : : " ; p2 = SELF -> < : patt< lazy BatLazyList .Cons ( $ p1 $ , $ p2 $ ) >> ] ] ; END
First , a bit of review on what Camlp4 is and does .
According to its wiki page , its name stands for the Caml Pre-Processor and Pretty Printer .
It has two main components ( that we care about ) : an extensible parser and an output or pretty - printing facility .
It also supports filters and transformations in the middle .
You can think about the extensible parser portion of it as being a form of a parser generator like Yacc or Menhir , but it allows grammars to be extended by loading more modules .
So when we use an OCaml syntax extension , we tell camlp4 to load the base OCaml grammar , load modules providing the extensions we want , and load a printer producing output that the compiler can compile .
Writing a syntax extension , therefore , is a matter of writing a module which extends the base grammar with additional productions and nonterminals to realize the desired syntax .
Back to the code .
The first two lines are just preamble stuff to make the Camlp4 APIs available .
Camlp4 .PreCast provides the core facilities needed to extend the OCaml grammar in Camlp4 ( I 'm not sure what all it does , or why it 's called PreCast ; the Gallium tutorial provides some info ) .
Syntax makes OCaml syntax elements available ( such as what we 're looking for --- the patt production in the context - free grammar defining the OCaml syntax , responsible for producing pattern - matching constructs ) .
After that comes the meat of the program .
The basic operation to add new syntax to OCaml is to “ extend ” the grammar ( surprise , surprise ) .
So what we 're going to do is extend the basic OCaml grammar ( defined by the module Gram ) with two new productions for the patt nonterminal ( new pattern matching constructs ! ) .
The GLOBAL line seems to tell the parser generator logic that patt is a global nonterminal ( as opposed to a local one , which I do n't fully understand but presume is a nonterminal used in a particular extension which wo n't clobber another local nonterminal by the same name in another extension ) .
To do this , we say
EXTEND Gram GLOBAL : patt ;
Next , we add our two productions .
The first oddity is the LEVEL directive .
The Camlp4 parser supports multiple “ levels ” of productions for a nonterminal .
These levels can be used to support things like operator precedence ( by having it try to match addition before multiplication --- thinking top - down , that 's the way you want it ) .
It tries all the productions in one level before trying any in the next level .
By looking at the base OCaml grammar in the Camlp4OcamlParser file in the OCaml source tree , you can find the nonterminals and levels where your new syntax should be inserted .
In this case , we want to add two productions in pattern matches : recognize [ % ] as the null lazy list , and recognize % : : as the lazy list cons operator .
So we put a production patt -> [ % ] on the simple level , used for basic objects , and the patt -> patt % : : patt production at the same level as the normal cons operator :: .
patt : LEVEL " simple " [ [ " [ % " ; " ] " -> ] ] ; patt : LEVEL " : : " [ [ p1 = SELF ; " % :: " ; p2 = SELF -> ] ] ;
The productions are written in a fairly straightforward fashion .
We write things that look like lists of lists of productions ( the code is itself parsed with a syntax extension providing extensible parser constructs , so this works ) .
It is effectively a list of levels , each of which is a list of productions .
We ignore that for now , and just use a list containing a single level definition ( which could contain multiple productions ) .
So the first one adds [ % ] to the simple level ; it 's added as two terminals because the lexer splits [ % ] into two tokens [ % and ] ; this is n't a problem , we 'll just recognize them in sequence , but it does allow [ % (* foo *) ] to stand for lazy nil .
For other production , we allow two patterns ( identified as p1 and p2 , both produced via the patt nonterminal referenced as SELF ) separated by the terminal % : : .
Of course , with our productions we need semantic actions .
The semantic actions are on the right - hand side of the arrow ( -> ) in the production definitions .
What these actions have to accomplish in our context is return the appropriate plain OCaml code for the new constructs .
We do this via another Camlp4 feature called quotations .
In this context , they let us generate new pieces of parsed OCaml syntax ( defined by the abstract syntax tree ) by writing out the OCaml code rather than constructing AST nodes .
So , we use the patt quotation , which I think tells Camlp4 that we 're constructing AST nodes to go inside a pattern match construct , and write out the real OCaml code referencing the relevant constructors in the BatLazyList module . [ % ] becomes a match against BatLazyList .
Nil , using OCaml 3.11 's lazy pattern match keyword to force lazy values transparently :
patt : LEVEL " simple " [ [ " [ % " ; " ] " -> <: patt< lazy BatLazyList .Nil >> ] ]
%:: translates to a match with BatLazyList .
Cons .
The $ p1 $ and $ p2 $ expressions substitute the matched head and tail patterns into the abstract syntax we 're generating :
patt : LEVEL " : : " [ [ p1 = SELF ; " % : : " ; p2 = SELF -> < : patt< lazy BatLazyList .Cons ( $ p1 $ , $ p2 $ ) >> ] ] ;
And that 's it ( well , with the closing END ) .
Build it with the following command :
ocamlc -c - I +camlp 4 - pp camlp 4 of pa_llist.ml
and then use it to pre-process and print a source file and see the new constructs get expanded :
camlp4 - I + camlp4 - parser o - parser op - printer o pa_llist .cmo test_file .ml
A few final notes :
You can build the syntax extension with ocamlfind .
the camlp4.extend and camlp4.quotations .
o packages are needed , along with the - syntax camlp4o option .
. the and packages are needed , along with the option .
It looked to me like it should be possible to put the level inside the list when defining my new productions , but it threw a warning and did n't work .
I 'm not sure what 's up with that .
Hopefully this helps someone break the ice with syntax extensions .
Once you get through what needs to be done , they seem to be really quite simple to create .
For further reading , see the documentation and tutorials on the Camlp4 wiki page , as well as Martin Jambon 's tutorial based on the old Camlp4 ( but still helpful for learning the concepts ) , the llists package which I used to get some idea of how to do this lazy list thing , and the files in the caml p4 / examples directory in the OCaml source distribution .
Finally finally : I 'm still learning this stuff .
If I 've gotten something wrong , please let me know .
A woman bank worker is claiming she was fired from finance giant Citibank for dressing too provocatively .
Debrahlee Lorenzana , 33 , told the New York Post she wore ordinary clothes , but her male bosses and co-workers still found her too alluring .
" Everything I wore was professional , things everybody wears in corporate America , " she said .
" The way they looked at what I wore was very disappointing . "
She started as a business banking officer in a New York branch in September 2008 and shortly afterwards male bosses began making sexist comments about her appearance , according to her employment case papers filed in a Manhattan court .
She was told " she must refrain from wearing certain items of clothing , in particular , turtleneck tops , pencil skirts , fitted business suits , or other properly tailored clothing , " the suit says .
" In blatantly discriminatory fashion , plaintiff was advised that as a result of the shape of her figure , such clothes were purportedly ' too distracting ' for her male colleagues and supervisors to bear . "
The single mother said " other female colleagues wore similar professional attire " , and that some dressed far more provocatively , the papers say .
But her bosses said that those women were unattractive and did not count .
She was also told that " as a result of her tall stature , coupled with her curvaceous figure , she should not wear classic high - heeled business shoes , as this purportedly drew attention to her body in a manner that was upsetting to her easily distracted male managers " .
Citibank said : " We believe this lawsuit is without merit and we will defend against it vigorously . "
PA Media
Like many of you , I 've been ( privately ) making fun of the strain of thought that Barack Obama is a Bad President because he is n't Doing Something !!!!
About the BP Oil Spill !
I 've been laughing even harder at those who acknowledge that he maybe can't personally pilot a top secret experimental navy sub down to the well and close it himself ( a la Bill Pullman in Independence Day ) , but castigate him anyway for not showing us that he " gets it " -- it being the scope of the disaster , the deep moral seriousness of the crisis .
Presumably , this would all be much easier to take if the president were openly panicking .
Or something .
The Care Bear Stare Model of American Politics once again rears its ugly head .
However , a friend writes that there might be something the President could and should do :
My father , who has worked in the petrochemical industry for decades , tells me that there is a well - established method for dealing with a problem like this : blowing up the well .
It 's been done before , successfully .
So why is n't this option being actively considered , despite the failure of every method tried so far ?
Because when a well is blown up , it can't ever be used again .
As a result , BP stands to lose a lot from doing so .
And they probably wo n't have to pay for all the harm done by the oil spill .
( Did you know the Exxon Valdez legal case just ended recently , after Exxon fought to keep every penny it could for years on end ? )
So in a case like this , it seems like there 's a good argument for the president stepping in .
BP has a poor incentive to do the right thing here .
Now , it might be true -- as Obama has said -- that the government lacks the expertise and equipment to cap a well .
But ( a ) capping a well and blowing it up are n't the same thing , and ( b ) if blowing it up requires expertise the government lacks , they could just hire the experts from ( say ) other oil companies .
As for whether the government has the authority to step in , I think the answer is yes .
There is an * ongoing * threat to property throughout the Gulf region , and the protection of property is well within what I consider proper government action .
Also , the seabed is not owned by BP -- it 's property of the government , leased out to BP ( or so I understand ) .
As I told my father , I do n't know enough about the risks of exploding a well to know for sure that it 's the best decision .
For all I know , there 's a chance it would make the problem even worse .
But it does n't seem like BP 's incentives are properly aligned for them to give it the proper consideration .
Unlike many in the blogosphere , I did not have enough boxtops to get my Petrochemical Marine Engineer Secret Decoder Ring , so I cannot weigh in on whether or not this is a good idea .
The economic pessimists are winning the argument in the U.S. Treasury bond market .
Yields on Treasury issues have fallen across the board Monday to their lowest levels in more than a year as some investors continue to seek a haven .
The 10 - year T - note yield ( charted below ) , a benchmark for mortgage rates , was at 3.04 % at about noon PDT , down from 3.11 % on Friday and the lowest since April 2009 .
The two - year T - note was at 0.63 % .
That ’s about half the yield investors were demanding as recently as April 5 .
Traders say some investors are taking their cue from budget - cutting promises made over the weekend by the world ’s wealthiest nations at the G - 20 group summit .
The biggest countries committed to slashing their budget deficits in half by 2013 .
The more the industrialized nations talk about reducing spending , the greater the risk that the global economy tilts back toward recession and deflation .
At least , that ’s how new bond buyers see it , said Tom Di Galoma , head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Partners in New York .
“ This is carryover from the ‘ double - dip , ’ deflation outlook ” that fueled heavy buying of Treasuries last week , Di Galoma said .
The 10 - year T - note yield was 3.24 % a week ago .
Economist Paul Krugman has been leading the pack of analysts warning about the risk of sinking into a new morass if governments and central banks pull back on policies to boost the economy .
“ We are now , I fear , in the early stages of a third depression , ” Krugman wrote in the New York Times over the weekend .
The first two U.S. depressions were in the years following 1873 and in the 1930s .
The stock market was n't buying the bond market ’s grim message Monday .
After slumping last week , stocks were up modestly with about an hour of trading to go .
The Dow Jones industrials were up 42 points to 10,185 .
Some of the fresh demand for Treasuries is tied to end - of - quarter book - juggling , as banks and other financial players look to bolster their balance sheets with liquid securities , traders say .
But buyers also must be betting that the raft of economic data this week wo n’t tell a story of a stronger recovery that could fuel a sudden snap - back in interest rates .
A tepid report Monday on May consumer spending helped bolster the econ bears ’ case .
On Friday the government will report on June employment trends .
The private sector is estimated to have added a net 111,000 jobs this month , up from a dismal 41,000 in May , according to economist estimates tracked by Bloomberg News .
Di Galoma thinks the 10 - year T - note yield will soon fall through 3 % .
Any backup in yields just brings out more buyers , he said .

A Washington cop tased a semi-naked man who took umbrage at being interrupted during some al fresco nookie in the Pacific Northwest state on Tuesday morning .
The deputy happened upon the 21 - year - old Patrick Bergin and his paramour at 2 am while responding to a complaint about loud music .
The pair were allegedly having sex outside " a house in the 14000 block of Vail Cutoff Road " in Yelm , the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports .
The PI reports that the pair appeared " highly intoxicated " but clearly not so intoxicated that they could n't manage the act of outdoor intercourse .
The pair reportedly begin to dress while the deputy demanded ID .
At this point , apparently , the woman screamed and took to her heels , while Bergin approached the deputy instead of sitting on the lawn as ordered .
Whether the lawn was messy is not recorded .
The deputy , believing he was about to be assaulted - the report does n't say with what - tased the wouldbe assailant .
However , Bergin pulled out the barbs , forcing the deputy to reload and give the randy outdoorsman a second charge .
" The second jolt was enough to convince him to cooperate with the deputy , " a spokesman said .
Bergin is under arrest for third degree assault , the report adds , though not it appears , indecent exposure .
The deputy then achieved his original mission of asking the homeowner to turn down his music .
A quick rustle through the weather charts show that temperatures in Yelm on Tuesday were a less than balmy 12 degrees centigrade . ®
Rehoboth Beach is n’t a topless one , but a few transgender women decided to go a little wild Memorial Day weekend and showed their surgically enhanced breasts off in the afternoon sun .
Because the ladies still have male genitalia , no laws were broken , say police .
Other beachgoers did n’t like the daytime strip show and , thinking the free - wheeling beachgoers were full - blown women , observers complained to a lifeguard .
" Passers - by came up to the lifeguard and said they were alarmed and unhappy with the females showing their breasts , " Police Chief Keith Banks told the News Journal .
" The lifeguard responded and saw that they were males . "
The lifeguard asked them to put their tops back on .
They initially refused , but covered up before police arrived .
But even if they had n't covered up , Banks said they were doing nothing illegal .
Since they ’re bottom half is still very male , they can't be charged with indecent exposure for showing their breasts .
“ A male is guilty of indecent exposure if he exposes his genitals or buttocks under circumstances which he knows his conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm to another person , ” according to Rehoboth law .
On the other hand , a female is guilty of indecent exposure is she exposes all of the above or her breasts .
Banks says there 's no need for a specific law to address the issue .
Rehoboth Beach commissioner Kathy McGuiness is n't so sure .
She says the matter will be discussed at a town hall meeting next week .
“ I hardly see us reversing the topless law .
I do n't think we are going to repeal it and allow women to go topless , McGuiness told the News Journal .
“ Now if someone is going to go through the process of having implants , then they probably should think about following the laws of the person they would like to become . ”
We do n't have as big a problem with ESPN college basketball analyst Doug Gottlieb as some others do .
He tends to make Big Controversial Statements , but a lot of the time , he 's willing to anger people rather than play the usual " hey , coach , great game ! " back - slapping role of the typical hoops analyst .
Though it appears that anger card is legitimate ; do n't question Doug Gottlieb , or he 'll come after you .

Australia 's peak science body stands to reap more than $ 1 billion from its lucrative Wi-Fi patent after already netting about $ 250 million from the world 's biggest technology companies , an intellectual property lawyer says .
The CSIRO has spent years battling 14 technology giants including Dell , HP , Microsoft , Intel , Nintendo and Toshiba for royalties and made a major breakthrough in April last year when the companies opted to avoid a jury hearing and settle for an estimated $ 250 million .

The BP oil spill has caused much outrage with the disaster still not over after several weeks have passed .
The debate over how it should be solved , the impact of it on environment and many other concerns seems not to end in the near future .
With that the call to boycott BP and to protest has also gained some voice .
And if you are among the ones who is mad at BP ( and who ’s not ? ) and want to protest , here ’s a different way you can do it .
Here are some anti BP and oil spill related t- shirts that you can wear to show your protest and raise awareness about the issue .
Check them out .

Foreign Affairs has confirmed that three Canadian citizens have been detained in Israel after military commandoes raided a convoy of ships taking aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip .
Ambra Dickie , a spokesperson for the ministry , said officials are working with authorities in Israel and the Canadian citizens will be provided with consular assistance .
The department is not releasing the names of the people being detained due to the Privacy Act , Dickie said .
However , the daughter of 53 - year - old Victoria , B.C. resident Kevin Neish , identified him as one of the three Canadians detained , and said he should be on his way home soon .
Jennifer Neish told The Canadian Press that Foreign Affairs confirmed her father is alive and well and will be deported from Israel within 72 hours .
Carlos Flores , a friend of Neish , said earlier on Tuesday that no one had heard from him since the Israeli raid .
" We are very worried about Kevin .
We do n't know if he is alive or wounded or has been arrested , " he told CTV's Canada AM early Tuesday morning .
Flores said Neish , a retired marine engineer , was to act as an " unarmed bodyguard " for journalists aboard one of the six vessels on the humanitarian mission .
Neish is a human rights activist who has assisted in similar missions in other countries , Flores said .
At least nine pro-Palestinian activists aboard the convoy of vessels were killed in Monday morning 's raid .
( CNN ) -- Users who rushed to snap up Apple 's iPad are complaining within days of the slate computer 's highly anticipated release that they 're having trouble connecting it to the Internet .
On Apple 's technical support Web site , there were 11 pages of comments Tuesday morning on a post saying Wi -Fi connections were weak or kept cutting out .
" Add me to the list with problems !
I 'm very disappointed that there 's no solution either , " one user wrote .
" Does anyone think this can be fixed with an update , or should I just get a refund while there 's time ? "
Versions of the iPad , a sort of hybrid between a laptop and a smartphone designed largely for reading , Web surfing and playing games , will eventually work with both Wi-Fi and 3G wireless connections .
But the versions released Saturday are Wi-Fi only .
Some users were saying their Wi-Fi connections were weak , while others were saying they were n't able to connect with Wi -Fi at all .
Some users say laying the iPad on a flat surface exacerbates the problem .
Apple did not respond Tuesday morning to a request from CNN.com for a response to the complaints .
On Saturday , when the company reported selling 300,000 of the devices , Apple posted a Web page outlining troubleshooting tips for " occasional problems " that included weak Wi -Fi connections or not being able to find a signal .
The tips include moving closer to a Wi -Fi router or hot spot and making sure the Wi-Fi router is plugged in and the power is turned on .
The Web page also suggests checking for sources of possible interference , like a microwave oven , and making sure you 're connected to the correct Wi -Fi connection if multiple ones are available .
It 's not unusual for users to have trouble navigating a new electronic device in its early days .
But reports from tech - savvy members of the online community suggest the problem is n't just operator error .
" Count me in as someone who 's having iPad Wifi issues as well , " wrote Michael Arrington , founder and editor of technology blog TechCrunch .
" The device works fine near the router , but on the other side of the house , nada .
But my Macbook pro and my Nexus
One and other various devices I 've brought into the house pick up wifi just fine in that area . "
The iPad is a lightweight , portable computer with a glass multitouch screen that wirelessly surfs the Web , displays photos and videos , runs apps and plays games and movies , among other potential uses .
Reviews in the tech community have ranged from " sensual " to " disappointment " in the hours since its release .
Some have raved that it 's close to being a " laptop killer , " meaning it can perform almost all the functions of the bigger portable computers .
There have been raves about its 1.5 pound weigh - in , making it easy to carry , and its ability to render reading material in color -- a potential boon for comics , newspapers and magazines .
Complaints , which predated widespread notice of the Wi-Fi issues , have centered around its lack of a camera , difficulty using its onscreen keyboard and the fact that users can't run more than one program at a time .
Like other Apple products , iPad does not run Flash , making some games and videos unusable .
We all remember our first time .

INFECTIOUS disease is taking an unexpected toll by sapping people ’s brainpower in the world ’s poorest countries .
So say Christopher Eppig and colleagues at the University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , who found that a country ’s disease burden is strongly linked to the average IQ of its population .
Building and maintaining the brain requires 87 per cent of all the body ’s energy in newborns and 44 per cent in 5 - year - old children .
Fighting infection also takes enormous amounts of energy , so children may struggle to do both at the same time .
Eppig reasoned that an increased risk of catching an infectious disease during …

About a week ago The New York Times ran this article on teachers juicing their students ' test scores .
Specifically the article is about Normandy Cross Elementary school just outside of Houston , where teachers awaited the results of state tests knowing success came with a nice little bonus for them : $ 2,850 .
Long story short the tests came back too good to be true and after an investigation resignations started coming in .
But did they do anything that goes beyond expectation ?
Tying teacher pay to student performance in this way seems doomed to fail , and the Times article cites sufficient examples of teachers playing with test scores to support that .
But the main reason I see linking raises to test scores as a plan doomed to failure is because that system seems not to acknowledge how whatever you can teach a kid this year is tied to what they learned or failed to learn last year .
Of the many things President Obama has done recently , I 'm most frustrated with what rarely gets discussed on national television : his education policy .
He 's not calling for a fundamental shift in the way we do education in the United States .
He 's calling for , among other things , reforming the NCLB act through improved assessments and an improved accountability system .
Check out his plan here .
The push for more assistance going to early education , and expanding Head Start , pre-school , and child care tax credits are all welcome moves .
I have no idea where the money to pay for these initiatives will come from , though , but that 's a different issue .
What I 'm considering here is whether improving assessments , the piece of his plan most relevant to teacher pay , will lead to more teacher 's looking to nudge test scores is an issue .
If you look at what the president says needs to be done to improve teacher retention and teacher preparation , it all rings true -- but nothing in the plan seems to account for why so many teachers leave after five years : terrible pay and often rough teaching conditions .
Those two facts alone would lead a teacher whose raise is tied to a student 's performance on a standardized test to consider cheating , maybe .
But it definitely will and has lead to classrooms where entire months are dedicated to teaching towards a test .
Testing as a means to assess what 's been learned is one thing ; testing as a means to assess the ability to prepare for that particular test is another .
I 've read in other places a call for states to " lift limits that stifle growth among successful charter schools , " and while I 'm a fan of some charter schools , I 've always seen them as a way to reduce the quality of public education .
In D.C. , the charter schools can admit students and then kick them out of the school based on their behavior problems .
Since public schools do n't have that luxury , you can't help but to increase the number of behavior problems in the public school as more and more parents look to private schools for a reprieve from the violence .
And even when charter schools work , it seems like they work because there is freedom in a charter school to basically do whatever you want as an educator .
Even
And even when charter schools work , it seems like they work because there is freedom in a charter school to basically do whatever you want as an educator .
Even here , in the July / August issue of The Atlantic where TNC talks about a program at a school in the South Bronx , the program is essentially a chance for the school to go completely out the box .
So is the push for more freedom among charter schools a passive way to promote a shift in the United States ' education culture ?
Why not just call for changes , fundamental changes , in the shape and operation of public schools ?
Still , the main difference among the three schools is the chaos that exists in the hallways at the public schools , the utter audacity of these 13- , 14- , 15 - and 16 - year - old mouths and the relative respect the students at the other schools seem to expect to have to give .
I 'm tired of seeing the reasons for this documented .
I began to list my own reasons , but the reasons are in every Kozol book , in just about every study on successful charter schools , in every study on successful schools in general .
This year I 've taught poetry at Hart Middle School in Southeast , a private school on Capitol Hill , and at the SEED School , a public charter school in Southeast .
The SEED School , a public boarding school , was featured on 60 Minutes .
You can check them out here .
All three schools were filled with students ( the ones I worked with ) who had a desire to learn and the capacity to get how language works and translate that into their own poems ; however , even though their creative abilities paralleled , their academic outcomes were wildly disparate .
The kids I work with at the D.C. Creative Workshop 's after school program at Hart - - all of them either Hart students or former Hart students -- rewrote Our Town and then made a movie out of it .
The trailer is just a glimpse of what access and opportunity can do .

Does anyone remember that Cosby show spin - off ?
With the Doug E. Doug , who played Popsicle in Class Act ?
There was an episode where the schools had a teacher draft and the top teachers were getting paid millions of dollars .
That 's my proposal for school reform .
Do n't pay me well because of how my class of students performed on a test -- pay me well because my education , my academic performance , and my past teaching experience all tell you in advance exactly what you 're getting .
President Obama , speaking in Pittsburgh , today :
But I also understand that throughout our nation ’s history , we have balanced the threat of overreaching government with the dangers of unfettered markets .
We ’ve provided a basic safety net — because any one of us might experience hardship at some time in our lives , and may need some help getting back on our feet .
And we have recognized that there have been times when only government has been able to do what individuals could n’t do and corporations would n’t do .
Not on that list :
Fix a leaking drill hole in the Gulf of Mexico .
That ’s how we have railroads and highways ; public schools and police forces .
That ’s how we ’ve made possible scientific research that ’s led to medical breakthroughs like the vaccine for hepatitis B and technological wonders like GPS .
That ’s how we have Social Security , a minimum wage , and laws to protect the food we eat , the water we drink , and the air we breathe .
That ’s how we have rules to ensure that mines are safe and that oil companies pay for the spills they cause .
Except that recent months have shown big government to be asleep at the switch on those fronts .
The other side of the aisle keeps arguing that we need bigger and more expensive government , but it never seems to be all that much better ; we find federal employees accepting gifts from those they regulate and watching pornography at work , taking all of five minutes to approve last - minute equipment design changes , going whitewater rafting with their wives as part of “ official business , ” EPA administrators making plans to attend Democratic fundraisers , etc .
Citing the oil spill while making the case for a more expansive and more powerful government does n’t require the audacity of hope , just audacity .
Review : Green Day Rock Band
by Brian Bentley [ Tuesday , 15th of June 2010 - 01:17 PM ]
t
that is both easy to jump into and addictive " > – and what you hate about Activision ’s Guitar Hero franchise – it feels repetitive and old .
Witha couple years past andon the way , it raises the question of how annual they expect to make the franchise and still get people to pay for iThis title is the spiritual successor to the infinitely popularreleased last year .
That release was a great boon and innovation for the folks at Harmonix .
This also provided a much - needed breather betweenand ( to be shown at this year ’s E3 ) .
Having a licensed title allowed Harmonix to play with the story telling and presentation .
Now , it ’s not your band ’s story unfolding into the future , but a narrative of one band ’s rise to stardom .
Not that Green Day did not reach stardom , but from the beginning I ’ve felt a slight disconnect with Green Day as a band to be the follow - up for such an iconic band such as The Beatles .
Much like the fab four ’s treatment , has local and online Quickplay , local and online Career Mode , Leaderboards , Achievements , etc .
Of course , Career Mode is where it ’s at giving you the opportunity to play three different venues .
Each venue is then broken down into sets of songs you unlock by completing the previous set .
Pictures and “ Cred ” are given for successful completion ( 3 stars ) of a song or set with an additional cred given for a 5 - star performance .
After a specified amount of cred is earned , Challenges may be unlocked .
Challenges could be as generic as earning 13 out of 15 stars in a three - song setlist or earning 56 stars as you play all 14 songs off of Dookie .
Completing a Challenge is satisfying and unlocks rewards for you to enjoy when you are n’t rocking faces off .
As a game in the music - related genre , graphics and animations do not play as pivotal a role as the sound does .
I mean , how clear can you make the red bar as it crawls down the path in order to be played ?
Not that Harmonix rested on their laurels ; they thankfully did away with “ stylized ” graphics as far as the track and notes were concerned .
And while the canned animations did begin to repeat often , you can tell a lot of care was put into breathing the trio ’s true essence into their AI counterparts .
To see Tré Cool come down during a Billie Joe solo opening and dance behind him put a smile on my face and began to endear the title to me .
Being another installment in the Rock Band franchise , explaining game play is easy enough .
Green , Red , Yellow , Blue and Orange are the hallmarks of Rock Band ’s easy - to - play , difficult - to - master play style .
The track layouts for each song continue to be a shining example of allowing you to feel the song as well as play it .
While the layouts felt good , the variety in those layouts from song to song felt familiar and boring .
Perhaps this is due to all the songs being from one band – but yet I did not share that feeling while playing .
In the beginning , guitar parts felt like the same three cords and the bass felt like just smashing runs over and over .
Thankfully , the layouts improved in variety as the band matured , but not enough overall to give me the feeling this band was a good fit for an entire title .
While I am not the biggest fan of Green Day , I have always appreciated their music and overall sound .
Songs on the disc span their entire catalog with Dookie and American Idiot ’s full lineup able to be played .
It was slightly disappointing and disheartening to find out that the only way to complete one of the final challenges ( play the entire 21st Century Breakdown album ) was to purchase the remaining songs from the album from the Rock Band store .
If it ’s a challenge on the disc , I should be able to complete it simply using what ’s on the disc .
My only other major complaint was with the difficulty settings .
I normally play the bass on Hard , but there are still times I have difficulty on Hard and occasionally must drop to Medium in order to pass a particularly difficult song .
As I mentioned before , the bass parts were littered with runs of tightly packed bars and my moderate carpal tunnel flared up , forcing the downgrade .
Unfortunately , dropping to Medium was completely unsatisfying .
It felt like I was doing the New York Times Crossword Puzzle and put it down to fill in a crossword found in a 6th grade Social Studies book .
I can appreciate the necessity to make the game accessible , but at the same time , I am unable to see how a new fan to the franchise would be able to start withand ever graduate from Medium to Hard .
Overall , is fun .
You remember their hits fondly and you ca n’t help but get pulled into it .
It ’s the same formula Harmonix has always used to create a good music game .
Unfortunately , it is also the game ’s downfall .
It ’s the same formula rehashed in a game released a week before E3 when we ’re all going to put hands on ( the hopefully innovative ) Rock Band 3 .
In the mean time , if you are a Green Day super fan or you absolutely must have the latest Rock Band , you will not be disappointed in your purchase of .
For rest of you in the majority , you may take more away from a rent , discounted purchase or picking and choosing certain songs to download off the Rock Band store , should they be released there .

The anonymous “ senior White House official ” who called Ben Smith last night to bitch about labor set off a firestorm .
Last night , Greg Sargent had an excellent analysis of what the race meant :
No matter what you read about this , the Halter challenge was a show of force by the left .
Period .
If you do n’t belive that , ask yourself why Lincoln suddenly found herself backing a tough - on - derivatives proposal in the Senate , why Obama had to cut radio ads and robocalls to save Lincoln , and why Bill Clinton had to come into the state to instruct voters not to listen to unions in order to save Lincoln ’s hide .
It remains to be seen who on the left will lift a finger to help Lincoln from here on out .
More on this tomorrow , but for now , it ’s clear that the Dem establishment threw its weight behind a candidate who polls show is less likely to win the general election — and Dems may have just lost themselves a Senate seat .
Today , Greg compiled some of the reaction to the deliberate White House attack on labor ( and it was deliberate .
The “ senior White House official called Ben . )
The White House political team has created a political problem , something the geniuses over there seem quite adept at doing .
Solving political problems , not so much .
But , creating drama and screwing over allies , that ’s where Team Obama excels :
* Markos says labor and the left wo n’t lift a finger to help Blanche Lincoln : “ So say hello to Sen . John Boozman , the next senator from the great state of Arkansas . ” * Jane Hamsher , on the anonymous White House official who urinated on unions for flushing $ 10 million “ down the toilet ” : Labor is not your bitch , and their money is n’t yours to direct .
They ’re supposed to take what , another six years of black eyes from Blanche Lincoln just because you say so ?
If their $ 8 million buys derivatives legislation and limits the damage that the Masters of the Universe can do to the world economy in the future , it ’s not only a bargain , it also means that a bunch of nurses and janitors have done more to rein in the banks than you and your entire pack of servile , visionless Wall Street lackeys has done since you took office .
*
Before you conclude that the talk about derivatives is just empty Netroots chest - thumping , listen to Marc Ambinder : Netroots pressure and labor pressure DID work .
It DID force Lincoln to introduce a tougher derivatives bill .
* Jed Lewison is appalled by the self - defeating nature of the White House ’s insulting of labor , saying it ’s “ weakening the Democratic coalition . ” * The AFL - CIO goes public with its pushback against the White House .
From union spox Eddie Vale , mocking the official ’s anonymity : “ My name is Eddie Vale of the AFL - CIO and I ’m proud to fight for working families and I do n’t hide behind anonymous quotes . ”
That the White House political operation decides to start a fight with its allies when the President ’s approval rating is hovering around 46 % – 47 % is ridiculous .
It ’s hard to convey just how clumsy and inept the White House political team is .
And , do n’t forget , the leader of this mess , Jim Messina , is rumored to be the campaign manager for the reelection .
Next year , he ’ll be asking for our help in the reelection and pretend that none of the slights ever happened .
It was a year ago this week when the Obama administration vociferously defended the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) with that infamous “ incest and pedophilia ” brief .
The gay community was the really first the constituency to realize how badly we were going to be treated by our “ fierce advocate . ”
We often said we were the canaries in the coal mine .
I think pretty much every other progressive constituency gets it now .
DALLAS ( AP )  Mark Cuban is defending his decade as majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks and rejects calls by minority owner Ross Perot Jr. that a court - appointed receiver be named to run the NBA team .
Cuban on Tuesday , in a court filing , responded to a May lawsuit filed by Perot that alleged the Mavs were insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency .
Perot 's lawsuit puts his Hillwood Investment Properties III Ltd. against Cuban - controlled Radical Mavericks Management LLC .
Perot in 2000 sold his majority stake in the team to Cuban , but still holds 5 percent .
Cuban maintains
Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some $ 100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development .
Perot spokesman Eddie Reeves said his boss had no comment on Cuban 's filing .

Dimona ’s Buried Nuclear Waste Spreads Cancer and Sterility in Southern Hebron and Negev
GAZA , July 6 , 2004 ( IPC + Agencies ) - - Nearly 70 cancer cases and the sterile rate soared to 62 % among males and females in the villages south of Hebron was mainly caused by the nuclear waste buried by Israel in Hebron 's mountains .
Many physicians and officials south of Hebron City , adjacent to the Negev Desert , warned of the growing number of people afflicted with cancer and attributed the cause to the nuclear radioactive wind the region .
The Palestinian villages located south of Hebron 's mountains witnessed a growing number of cancer cases and unprecedented mutation rates as most of the specialists said that it is likely due to environmental pollution .
The professor ( Y.A ) of physics and a specialist of atomic science said that the air in southern Hebron is contaminated by the nuclear radioactive leakage as the area is very close to the Israeli Dimona reactor and to the nuclear waste dumps in the area .
There are no cement blocks around the reactor operating to lower the hazardous impacts of such high radioactivity .
The professor recited the case of his mother who died of visceral cancer , and after a check up , the cause was mainly due the high rates of radioactive elements .
The radioactivity has a tremendous power that could penetrates to the genes of the human , affecting the chromosome that are inherited generation after generation .
Dr. Mahmoud Sa’ada , the co-founder of the Palestinian Medical Relief , was quoted by the Al Nakab daily as saying , “ I am a general physician who has been working for 30 years in Al Thaheryia adjacent to Hebron and I could ascertain that during the last years most of the cancer cases has no other diagnosis but nuclear radioactivity . ”
He added , “ now there are 70 cancer cases in Al Thaheryia admitted to Beit Jala hospital .
Recently , a baby was born with red colored half face , and after examining each case it ’s hardly to attribute the case to inherited deformations . ”
Meanwhile , the rate of sterility has been notably increased to 62 % in the villages south of Hebron due to the radioactivity .
Israel has always had a policy of nuclear ambiguity , saying only that it will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the region .
Late of last June , the Israeli cabinet approved to distribute iodine - based tablets to people living near the Israeli nuclear reactors to give them some protection in case of radioactive leakage .
The pills were to be given to people living near the Dimona reactor , in the southern Negev Desert and those close to the Nahal Sorek nuclear plant , southwest of Jerusalem , officials said on condition of anonymity .
I srael has had nuclear technology for decades but refused to comment on reports of obtaining nuclear weapons .
In 1986 , former Dimona technician Mordechai Vanunu provided photographs and descriptions of the reactor to The Sunday Times magazine in London .
Based on Vanunu 's material , experts said at the time that Israel has the world 's sixth - largest stockpile of nuclear weapons .
The Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei , is due to arrive in Israel on Tuesday to discuss a nuclear - free Middle East but the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said earlier today that Israel has no intentions of deviating from its present nuclear policy .
Sharon spoke to the Israeli Army radio hours before the visit of IAEA director , where he said that Israel 's ' nondisclosure ' policy would be maintained and that Israel has all the weapons it needs to protect itself .

Dimona Reactor … a Mystery Threatening the Middle East
Dimona Reactor … a Mystery Threatening the Middle East
International Press Center ( IPC )
September 18 , 2003
Preface
“ The Israeli nuclear reactor of Dimona is vulnerable to meltdown , like the Russian reactor of Chernobyl two decades ago , which caused a humanitarian and ecological catastrophe .
If Dimona melts down , it would affect an area 500 aerial kilometers in radius , reaching Cyprus and the entire neighboring region ” , warned Dr. Yousef Abu Safiya , Head of the Palestinian Environment Quality Authority .
A recent study conducted by the Jordanian authorities after a request from the Palestinian Environment Quality Authority revealed that the Israelis are aware of the possibility of a meltdown in Dimona reactor , which in turn would affect the whole region , mainly the Jordanian southern city of Tafila .
The study also showed that radioactive substances are leaking from the Dimona reactor in a way that has increased rates of cancer diseases among nearby populations , particularly those of Tafila City .
What make these assumptions largely based on solid ground are the latest satellite images of the Dimona reactor , which showed that its walls have cracks , which cut its assumed age into half .
With thorough investigation into Dimona Israel ’s nuclear plant , one can observe the following facts :
Location :
The location of Dimona 's reactor in the Negev desert is a delicate one , situated between Egypt , Jordan and the Palestinian Authority 's territories .
The reactor was built in 1963 , as part of a deal with France , who pledged to build the reactor in exchange for helping it and the United Kingdom in attacking Egypt in what was known as the 1956 - tripartite .
As for funding the reactor 's driving material , the United States took care of that , in addition to giving assistance with moving quantities of enriched Uranium to Israel .
The area on which the Dimona reactor is built on includes nine buildings , including the reactor building itself .
Each building is tasked with producing a certain type of materials used to produce weapons of mass destruction , such as Plutonium , Lithium and Beryllium , used to manufacture nuclear bombs , in addition to producing radioactive Uranium and Triennium .
The Dimona reactor is considered to be the most mysterious secrets of the " nuclear world " , as Israel categorically refused , since its establishment in 1948 and after building the reactor , any routine inspection that other reactors around the world goes through , which " forcibly " open their reactors ' doors in fear of the American waving of the " club " of international resolutions .
No Inspection Beyond this Point !
Israel might be considered the only state that opposes to the inspection visits conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) all over the world , added to its rejection , until this very day , to sign the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which was signed by all Arab states .
In spite of the complete American support for the Israeli policy , the Americans have expressed their concern over the reactor , as news revealed an American attempt to send some of its nuclear - program officials to inspect Dimona reactor apart from those working in the IAEA , but Israel refused to allow them in , continuing the reactor 's legacy of being " visitation - proof " , as only Israelis are allowed in .
The Fifth Nuclear Power
Israel is considered the fifth nuclear power in the world .
In addition to owning nuclear bombs that can be dropped from the air , its nuclear arsenal includes also nuclear warheads that can reach a distance of 1,500 kilometers , using the Israeli - made " Jericho " missiles .
Estimations show that Israel is in possession of 200 nuclear bombs , but Arab sources indicate that Israel own massive quantities of Uranium and Plutonium that enables it of producing an additional 100 bombs .
Israel , in the meantime , seeks to increase the production efficiency of its reactor to about three times its current efficiency –from 28 to 100 megawatts .
According to recent reports , the Israeli nuclear reactor consumed 1,400 tons of Uranium last year , which indicates that its efficiency might have reached 150 megawatts .
Dimona 's Hazards
In a study requested by the Palestinian Ministry of Environment Quality from the Jordanian authorities , it was revealed that the average manifestation of cancer in the Al Tafila governorate , south of Jordan , is higher than the other Jordanian governorates and surrounding Arab countries .
According to Dr. Abu Safiya , high cancer rates were recorded in all the southern Jordanian governorates , which confirmed the possible direction of nuclear dust that might be leaking from Dimona .
It was recently revealed that five Israeli families lost their sons who worked in Dimona reactor , and they filed charges in the Central Court in Tel Aviv against the Israeli government and the reactor 's administration , demanding compensations for the cancer that killed those workers due to radiation exposure .
According to the lawsuit , the prosecutors are relatives to five Israelis who worked for a long time in the nuclear " village " : Ze'eiv Schforn , born in 1931 and started working in Dimona in 1962 as the head of the supply crew .
He was diagnosed with abdominal caner in 1966 and died in 1967 .
The second employee was Simon Dray , born in 1942 and worked in Dimona from 1966 until 1992 in the cleaning and decontamination unit .
In 1996 he was diagnosed with pharyngeal cancer , and died in 1998 .
The third was Moshe Zegori , born in 1947 , and worked in the reactor from 1965 until 1985 , also in cleaning and decontamination .
Before he left his job he found out that he had a malignant tumor in his head , and died in 1987 .
The fourth employee was Yousif Cohen , born in 1938 , and worked in the reactor from 1970 until 1995 , in maintenance .
In 1997 he was diagnosed with several malignant tumors , and died in 1998 .
The fifth employee is still suffering from cancer in his body , and is constantly under treatment .
He worked in the reactor from 1969 until 1996 , in maintenance and mechanical engineering .
The prosecutors of those victims are demanding the Israeli government to take responsibility for their deaths , due to the radiation exposure they suffered inside the reactor , which caused fatal malignant tumors .
At the same time , they claim that the reactor 's administration did n't take enough precaution measures and never warned the employees about the radiation hazard .
Worn - out Reactor
As reports indicate , the reactor has become old now , as its isolation walls have worn - out , which might cause the leakage of some radiation from the reactor , a thing that will lead to devastating health and ecological damages to the surrounding area .
According to the reports also , the reactor suffers from a dangerous crack caused by " neutron " radiation , which caused structural damage , as neutrons cause small gas bubbles inside the concrete support , making it fragile and susceptible to cracking .
The United Arab Emirates - based " Al Bayan " newspaper revealed recently that a serious debate was going on now about whether to stop working in the reactor before the catastrophe occurs or not .
Additionally , a report made the by Israeli second TV channel mentioned that dozens of the reactor 's employees died of cancer , and that the reactor 's administration refuses to reveal the true number of casualties and fatalities .
The Dimona reactor was n't also immune to many working accidents that happened inside it , including the burning of hazardous and poisonous materials without providing the employees with suitable protective equipment , as many of them died because of that .
As well , quantities of radioactive heavy water and nuclear waste leaked into a natural geographical hill extending along the reactor .
Expired !
By continuing to maintain and operate Dimona reactor , Israel is committing a crime against humanity that will be added to the atrocities it perpetrated along its history .
Since 1971 , the reactor has never been provided with new cooling towers , even though the reactor 's efficiency has increased since then .
Dr. Abu Safiya pointed out that the most dangerous hazards of Dimona reactor is in the element producing Plutonium , which is used to make nuclear bombs .
It 's one of the resultant elements of Uranium DK dissipation , and it can be used to synthesize enriched Uranium .
It contains 20 % out of the 0.05 % Uranium , which is the highly radioactive substance that can be used in nuclear fission to manufacture either nuclear bombs or atomic fuel .
Abu Safiya warned that there 's a regional and long - term threat in Dimona reactor , represented in the presence of these nuclear bombs in the possession of a country such as Israel , a thing that raises questions about the inspection visits in Iraq and demanding Iran to be inspected too , as well as surprise inspections by the IAEA officials , while Israel publicly admit to possessing nuclear weapons .
In response to that , Shimon Peres , temporary chairman of the Israeli Labor party , claimed that there 's no comparison between Iraq and Israel , because , according to his claims , Iraq is ruled by a " dictator " , while Israel is a " democratic " state !
Right after this statement , Israel used poisonous gases in the city of Khan Younis , which caused dozens of Palestinian citizens to suffer from unconsciousness and severe illnesses , added to the spasms and hysterical conditions some of them suffered from after inhaling such internationally - banned gases .
Commenting on this incident , Dr. Abu Safiya said that " we ascertained that these are nerve gases , by analyzing a specimen of the Israeli bombs that did n't burn completely .
Through analysis , we revealed that it is composed of a group of nerve gases , due to which affected citizens suffered from spasms … this is an evidence against the state that Peres say it's " democratic " , which used internationally - banned weapons against the Palestinian people . "
Noteworthy that exposure to small amounts of radiation on the long run might pose a serious threat to embryos and children , as well as causing cancer .
Israel Least Damaged
Dr. Abu Safiya demanded the IAEA " if they truly seek integrity " to run checks in order to discover the level of radiation in the region around the Dimona reactor .
" If we conduct , for example , a Contour Survey for all directions to see the level of radiation and who 's affected the most , we would find that Israel is the safest , having its population localities in the north far from the reactor .
In addition , 95 % of the wind direction in Palestine is northwestern , which is opposite to the Israeli population localities , " Dr. Abu Safiya said .
The simplest radiation leak resulting from Dimona reactor is that of the depleted Uranium , which is of catastrophic implications , as it is considered one of the heavy elements that ruin kidney , liver and respiratory system functions , leading to death .
Only one atom of radioactive Uranium is enough to cause fatal cancer .
What About the Reactor 's Waste ?
As for the waste products resulting from nuclear enrichment operations in Dimona reactor , Dr. Abu Safiya said that it 's buried in areas near the Palestinian Authority controlled territories , as well as Jordanian and Egyptian ones , especially in those areas where the flow of aquifer water and direction of the wind is not in Israel 's favor .
A report by Israel 's second TV channel revealed that Dimona reactor 's waste products are buried in the areas east of the Al Bureij refugee camp and the town of Deir El Balah .
Currently , the Palestinian Authority for Environment Quality is trying to get a permission to get water analysis equipment inside Gaza Strip to check these areas , but Israel is refusing .
" During the current Intifada , Israelis have buried nearly 50,000 tons of industrial chemical waste in Gaza Strip , only 30 meters deep , on an area of 5,000 square meters , as they stole the arable soil and moved it inside Israel and buried industrial waste in its place .
This means that there 's 150,000 cubic meters of poisonous waste buried in Gaza , which is a catastrophe .
Moreover , Israel is n't affected by this waste because it was buried opposite to the flow of aquifer water , " Abu Safiya narrated .
In the West Bank , most of what 's buried is in the direction of the eastern hills , because it's not included in the Israeli - controlled lands , unlike the western hills .
Now , the eastern hills are polluted with chemical waster and pesticides .
Covering Up for Their Crimes
In Ramallah and Hebron , the Palestinian Authority had some basic equipment to measure radiation and environmental pollution .
These equipment did n't only check radiation , but pollution in general , such as soil , water , air and chemical pollution .
In this subject , Dr. Abu Safiya said that small devices were discovered inside helicopters , which is used to regulate the fan 's rotation , as well as providing the pilot with some technical data .
These devices , if exposed to a person or played with by children , might lead to death or blood and gene mutations , as it contains radioactive materials .
The Minister added that " after these devices wore out , the Israelis dump them in the Palestinian controlled lands , and we found three of these devices in Ramallah , one of which was in President Yasser Arafat 's office ' Al Moqata 'a ' . "
Such devices were also found during the Israeli invasion of Ramallah City on March 29 , 2002 , after the Authority received warnings of suspicious radioactive materials .
When specialists from the Authority of Environment Quality reached the area and checked these parts , they found out that it contained glowing radioactive materials .
The instruments those specialists had indicated that radiation levels exceeded the maximum limit .
When the manufacturing company was contacted concerning that , the company replied that these parts were sold to the Israeli Air Force , and that it 's used in helicopters of the type CH53 .
As soon as the Israeli occupying forces invaded Ramallah , the radiation checking equipment were destroyed , including those equipment used to check the radioactive parts .
Additionally , IOF blew up the environment laboratory in Hebron and Ramallah , and destroyed all the equipment by throwing them from the fifth floor .
Lately , a cargo of Israeli waste was uncovered in the city of Hebron , which was composed of 80 barrels , in addition to 120 others in the town of Al Ezareya , Jerusalem district .
Furthermore , IOF moved in a cargo of 2,500 tons of radioactive base coarse , and the radiation was further confirmed when it was checked .
The shipment was coming from Italy , and when the Israeli Ministry of Environment discovered that the radiation level of the base coarse was four times higher than that internationally allowed , the shipment was illegitimately diverted to Gaza City .
Unveiling the Hidden
The Israeli government has recently decided to boycott the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) after the latter made a documentary film about the Israeli nuclear weapons .
Sources in the Israeli Foreign Ministry explained that the film is Anti-Semitic –an accusation used by Israel to anyone or anything that they do n't like .
The BBC had broadcasted previews of the documentary film , in which the narrator 's voice is heard on the background of the Israeli reactor core in Dimona and the photo of Mordechai Vanunu , who revealed the Israeli nuclear secrets , and the narrator asks :
Which country in the Middle East possesses nuclear weapons without declaring that ?
Which country in the Middle East possesses the chemical and biological ability without declaring that ?
Which country in the world throws away the revealer of its nuclear secrets in jail for 18 years ?
As for the producer of the documentary , he interviewed several senior Israeli officials , including that chairman of the Israeli Labor party , Shimon Peres , who is also considered the godfather of the Israeli nuclear program , and the man who created the nuclear reactor in Dimona .
The producer asked Peres why Iraq are n't allowed to possess nuclear weapons while Israeli can , and the answer was clearly not satisfactory , and Peres found a claim to justify this question .
As for Mordechai Vanunu , who is staying in Israeli jails since 1986 , as the Israeli court indicted him of espionage , treason and selling Israeli nuclear secrets to the " Sunday Times " British newspaper , and was sentenced to 18 years in prison .
Now , he spent 16 years of it .
Vanunu said that the Israeli authorities prevented him from meeting his British lawyers .
" Now , Peres wo n't be able to lie to [ Ronald ] Reagan about not owning nuclear weapons .
Now everybody knows that , " Vanunu said .
Israel Protecting Itself
Israel surrounds itself with all means of protection .
For example , every Israeli citizen has a pill of " stable Iodine " , and can be taken anytime , as it gives radiation protection .
It was revealed that Israeli provided all its citizens with such a pill , under the pretext of fearing an Iraqi nuclear strike , but the truth confirmed that they dispensed it because of fearing the meltdown of their own reactor , not only Dimona , but the other research facilities around Israel .
On the Palestinian level , the Authority of Environment Quality has tried to take some kind of protection , and sent a letter to the IAEA and Arab Ministers of Health , considering that the Palestinians are the weakest point and closest to the reactor , as Palestinian controlled lands are only 50 aerial kilometers away from Dimona reactor , but all these letters were rejected !
Among the examples that might be shown to indicate the amount of damage caused to the Palestinians due to any nuclear meltdown , the explosion that occurred in the pesticide factory in the city of Al Majdal ( Ashkelon ) , where the stench of the pesticides reached Palestinian cities and towns due to thermal turnover and wind .
Here , Dr. Abu Safiya pointed out to the danger that might happen in case an amount of radiation leaks from Dimona reactor , which will jeopardize the entire surrounding region and on a large geographical scale .

What goes on in our mind when we learn a foreign language ?
Why do we find it so much harder than learning our mother tongue ?
And what can we do to make the often painful process of learning languages easier ?
These are just a few of the questions that have long fascinated the Czech psycholinguist Barbara Schmiedtová .
Still in her mid thirties , Barbara has taught and researched at many top European universities , and has published extensively in English , German and Dutch – all of which see speaks fluently alongside her native Czech – exploring the pioneering science of psycholinguistics .
Put simply , this is the study of what goes on in our head when we are speaking and understanding language .
When we met in Prague a few days ago , Barbara told me about the research she is currently carrying out at the University of Heidelberg in Germany , and about her particular interest in second - language learning .
“ A very important part of psycholinguistics is the area of language acquisition , which is my area , and acquisition is actually connected with two lines of research : first and second language acquisition .
First language acquisition mainly focuses on how children acquire their first language or first languages , and second language acquisition , which I ’m interested in , is how adult speakers acquire a second , third or another non-mother tongue . ”

“ Let me stress first that this is the very first research of its kind .
We are using so - called ‘ eye - tracking ’ , which is a very good computer , which is able to track eye movements .
We ’re working with this machine at the University of Heidelberg , and this enables us to look into the planning processes that take place immediately before we start speaking . ”
I was actually used as a guinea pig in one of your experiments , and I remember that you showed me and the other volunteers a series of thirty - second videos , where you were interested in what we were focusing on as we looked at what was happening in the film .
The example that you have developed most in your research is the scene where a car is driving along a road .
Behind some trees round the corner there are some houses , and you studied how people with different native languages and different second languages responded to that particular image : that is , where they looked most and how they described the scene afterwards .
And you found a correlation between their native language and where the volunteers looked .
“ The idea was to look at these pre-speaking processes and link them to what people prefer to say later in time and also to remember later in time .
So this particular scene , where a car was indeed depicted driving along a road , and in the background there were some houses , there were very clear differences , for example , between English and German - speaking native speakers , whose attention was completely different . ”
When you talk about their attention , you mean what they were looking at , which you can measure with the eye - tracker …
“ Precisely .
Yes .
So the attention is in terms of where they were looking and also how long were they looking into the particular area .
There was a significant difference between English and , for example , German native speakers .
The English preferred to look at the path , the way along which the car was driving , while German native speakers focused on the end point , which was , in this particular case , the house .
And interestingly , also later in time , about ten minutes after the experiment , when the native speakers had to perform a memory test , English native speakers remembered significantly fewer end points than German native speakers .
The explanation for this preference in our frame of research is not given by cultural differences but more by linguistically based , language - specific features , which in this specific case are based on the presence or absence of the ‘ ing ’ marker , which is productive and very deeply based in the linguistic system of the English language … ”
You mean the ending “ ing ” as in “ walking ” , implying continuity …
“ Precisely .
And progression – so right now something is the case and it ’s in the middle of it .
If you want to say it in more comprehensible terms , you could say that English native speakers have the option to focus and speak about the progression of a situation , while German native speakers do n’t have the option , and so they have to focus on something else , which is the end point . ”
So what you ’re saying is something really quite interesting – and controversial as well – because you ’re suggesting that there is some direct correlation between the way the language works and the way we think .
This implies that the established idea that you can say just about anything in any language does n’t really apply .
There are some things that are inherent to certain languages and connect to certain ways of thinking , which are reinforced by that language .
“ Yes , I would be in agreement to about 95 % .
It ’s not about whether you can say anything in any language .
The interesting thing is what you prefer to say that when you are under pressure , which is the normal situation , when you produce language .
So if you see a situation that is available to all of us , the question is which components of the situation , which pieces of information , will you select naturally in order to describe the situation ?
And there language - specific patterns of language production emerge and there languages differ .
So it is true that language does shape the way we think and we actually also perceive a situation , although the world out there is somehow common to us .
But if we have to describe something that is out there , language helps us to solve this very difficult task by giving us certain preferences .
And these processes are indeed – at least according to my point of view – language specific . ”
This must be something that it ’s very difficult to measure .
To what extent can you exclude the possibility that there ’s some cultural reason why people who have German as their native language would focus more on end points , whereas people who have English as their native language would focus more on the fact that the car is driving at that moment down the road ?
“ We work in about 14 different languages and they pair not according to the typological or commonly described typological differences , but according to other , let ’s say , cognitively based patterns .
So let me give you an example : English works in this respect similarly to Arabic .
So Arabic and English are very different where the cultural background is concerned , but they have one common feature and this is precisely the presence of a grammatical option , deeply rooted in the grammar , to express ‘ ongoingness ’ .
This would be one example , speaking against a culturally based account , and another one would be that , interestingly , Czech does not pair with the other Slavic languages that we study , for example Russian or Polish , but it does pair with German .
So it shows that German and Czech have in their grammatical system something in common that other Slavic languages apparently lack . ”

“ Well , I mentioned before the memory tests – these show how well people remember later on in the study of what they have seen before .
This is a very powerful instrument .
We found very robust differences between the languages .
Colleagues are also working on other non-linguistic tasks .
The most famous would be the categorization task , which means that if you look at a group of objects you categorize them by certain features .
It has been found by John Lucy , a very famous cognitive linguist from the States , that , for example , Japanese and Yucatec , ( which is a Maya language from Central America ) and English native speakers categorize objects by different features which are tightly linked to grammatical features in the given system .
So , if you see three objects , you can categorize them either by form or by shape , English native speakers prefer form over colour , while Yucatec or Japanese native speakers do it the other way round .
So these are cognitive categories that are persistent even in our linguistic categorization of the world .
So that would be an example for yet another technique to study these cognitive preferences . ”
This is all quite scientific , but are there also practical applications that you can imagine for this kind of research , for example in language teaching ?
“ Absolutely , and I think that for highly motivated and talented learners of a second language , this would be a domain that could be further explored , because I have found in my research that even extremely advanced second language users , whose foreign language is nearly native - like , still sound in certain aspects somehow non-native .
At least native speakers agree on this .
And these are exactly the domains that we are investigating .
We call it information organization , meaning : how do I structure the world around me for language production .
And there , the patterns for my mother tongue are extremely robust and highly preferred , and I think learners or users of a second language , who might be interested in attaining native - like proficiency in the foreign language , may be interested in getting instruction exactly in this domain . ”
So you think that if students could become aware that this is how you think in your native language and this is how people think in the goal language , the language you are trying to learn , that they could actually teach themselves to cross that frontier and speak as natives ?
“ Maybe .
But so far , highly motivated and talented learners have not been given the chance . ”
Is the next step maybe going to involve putting nodes on people ’s heads and measuring which part of the brain is working when a particular thought process is going on in a particular language ?
I know this is a science that is still very much in its infancy .
Is that a path that you think psycholinguistics is going to follow , so that you will be able to see exactly what part of the brain is working when a particular sentence is spoken in a particular language ?
“ These methods , we call them neuro - imaging methods , look into the processes that take place in the brain and the localization of these processes in the brain .
There is a big future for psycholinguistics in these methods .
However , at the moment they are quite crude , because the differences we ’ve been talking about are extremely subtle and it ’s hard to detect them in terms of neural processing or neural activities .
However , there are first studies that actually show that there are , for example , language - specific differences in the processing of colours .
So there are the first pioneering studies in this direction , but we are not quite there yet . ”
My guest in Czech Books this week was the psycholinguist , Dr Barbara Schmiedtová , who has written and researched widely in the fascinating field of language acquisition and currently teaches at the University of Heidelberg .
Gaza City : Hamas movement on Thursday accused Egyptian security forces of killing four Palestinians by pumping poisonous gas into a cross - border smuggling tunnel .
" Hamas holds the Egyptian side responsible for the killing of four innocent workers after Egyptian security forces pumped poisonous gas into one of the tunnels , " Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told reporters in Gaza .
" We demand an investigation into the incident and for those responsible to be brought to justice . "
Following the incident on Wednesday night , Egyptian security officials said their forces had destroyed four smuggling tunnels along the Gaza - Egypt border but were not aware of any casualties .
Palestinian medics working for the Hamas - run health ministry said the four had died from suffocation and that there was evidence of poisonous gas .
Gaza 's 1.5 million people have largely relied on a network of hundreds of tunnels beneath the border with Egypt since Israel and Egypt tightened an already strict closure of the territory after Hamas seized power in June 2007 .
Most of the tunnels are used to bring in basic goods like food , household appliances and livestock , but Hamas and other militant groups use their own more secretive tunnels to bring in arms and money .
Abu Zuhri said the territory 's reliance on the tunnels had been imposed on it by the border closures , which keep out all but basic humanitarian aid .
" The alternative is not to kill innocent citizens but to open the crossings , " he said , adding that some 40 workers had been killed by Egyptian security forces pumping poisonous gas and sewage into the tunnels .

The stowaway was arrested after landing at Heathrow Airport
A 20 - year - old Romanian man had a lucky escape after stowing away on a plane flying from Vienna to London .
The man hid himself in the rear wheel compartment of the plane which landed at Heathrow Airport on Sunday .
He was taken into police custody in London but later released without charge .
He had bruises and hypothermia from outside temperatures as low as - 41C , Austrian media reported .
He survived because the plane flew at a low altitude to avoid stormy weather .
The man apparently got under a fence at Schwechat airport in Vienna and climbed into the undercarriage of the first plane he saw without knowing its destination .
The plane belonged to a sheikh from the United Arab Emirates and had been standing empty on the tarmac at Schwechat airport since Thursday .
It flew without passengers to Heathrow , where the Romanian was picked up by police and arrested for stowing away .
' Very lucky '
He could have been charged or fined or given a fixed penalty , the Metropolitan Police told the BBC .
But he was cautioned and freed with no further action being taken , PA news agency reported .
The man could also have been handed to the UK Border Agency .
But it is understood that there is no immigration issue and that the agency will not seek to deport him , according to PA .
As Romania is part of the EU , the man is free to enter the UK .
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) said the stowaway was " very lucky " to be alive .
" If they do n't find the right part to stow away , they can be crushed when the undercarriage comes up , " he said .
He added : " Because of the altitude and temperatures during the flight , there is a severe risk to them through exposure and lack of oxygen .
" If that does n't kill them , then they could be unconscious when the aircraft descends , and that can mean that when the undercarriage opens again , they will fall out . "
According to Austrian media reports , the man just wanted to get out of Vienna and look for work .
Romania is a member of the European Union , so Romanians can travel to the UK for holidays .
However , controls on Romanians working in Britain remain in place .
You can't beat a good compiler ... right ?
Posted by Louis Brandy on 07 June 2010
Right !
Sort of .
It is extremely well worn conventional wisdom that for your " average " programmer , it 's pretty much impossible to beat a good optimizing compiler at writing fast code .
For those who skip the " understanding " part , and jump straight into the " application " part , this rule of thumb tends to be grossly misunderstood , and misused .
For these people , compilers are so smart , and so good , that micro-optimization is basically impossible ( uh , no ) , or too hard ( no ) , or even that they make assembly knowledge unnecessary or obsolete ( not even close ) .
This tends to lead to a mentality that optimization can be left to the compiler and often results in people warning others to not bother with micro-optimizations at all .
Optimization , today , is largely about writing some naive code , looking at the assembly output , figuring out what you want to improve on , and then getting ( or , often , tricking ) the compiler into doing what you want .
After several iterations of this , you end up with the code you want , and you gain all the benefits of having a compiler in the loop ( portability , future - proofing , and so on ) .
This process , though , obviously involves a great deal of low - level knowledge : assembly , cpu architecture , micro-optimizations that are likely to work , etc .
As an aside , I have a question : how exactly does one go about learning how to go beyond standard C into hardcore optimization ?
For me , it 's been a long road of trial & error , and random discovery .
It seems to me that there is probably good resources out there for getting started on optimizing code ( let 's say in gcc ) .
Know any ?
All the code I used can be found here : http://github.com/lbrandy/simple-optimization-test ( see signalblur .c ) .
I ran all of these tests on Linux using gcc 4.3.3 and - O3 .
UPDATED : I changed the code to use c99's restrict keyword , instead of gcc 's restrict_
Getting yourself into trouble
Here is a naive ( and contrived ) one dimensional filter routine .
# define LENGTH 5000 // a bad impersonation of a gaussian filter const float filter [ ] = { 0.01f , 0.2f , 0.58f , 0.2f , 0.01 f} ; void naive ( float * in , float * out ) { int i , j ; for ( i=0 ; i< LENGTH - 4 ;i++ ) { out [ i] =0.0f ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 5 ; j++ ) out [ i ] += filter [j ] * in [ i+j ] ; } }
This is an interesting example because it contains a fatal flaw that might not be obvious .
Take a second to understand what this code is doing .
It 's fairly simple , but critical to the rest of the discussion .
Let 's look at the assembly output of this , built using - O3 .

From the assembly , we see that the compiler has done quite a bit ( if you do n't know assembly , do n't worry , I 'll do my best to explain ) .
First we see all of the address calculation involved in loading the filter coefficients has vanished ( it is loading each one directly , e.g. flds 0x8048918 ) .
Second , notice that the ( fixed sized ) inner loop has been completely unrolled , resulting in each of the 5 multiplications and additions per iteration .
So far so good .
There is , however , a very alarming surprise is this code .
That is the quantity of store instructions ( also loads ) .
After every iteration of our inner loop ( each filter coefficient ) , the result is stored .
You can see 5 different store instructions ( fstps , fsts ) per iteration of this loop .
Why ?
Let 's have a look at the code again :
void naive ( float * in , float * out ) { int i , j ; for ( i=0 ; i< LENGTH - 4 ;i++ ) { out [ i] =0.0f ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 5 ; j++ ) out [ i ] += filter [j ] * in [ i+j ] ; } }
To the inexperienced , it might be bewildering why the optimizing compiler would generate 5 store instructions for out [ i]= in the inner loop .
Why would n't it just accumulate the answer in a register , and then store only the final result ?
The answer is : aliasing .
The problem here is that compiler cannot assume that the pointers in and out are disjoint .
It must store the result into out [ i ] each iteration because out [ i ] may be in [ i+j ] in the next iteration of the inner loop .
With a bit of thought , it becomes clear how this code requires these stores to be correct in cases like out pointing one float ahead of in .
Another hard - learned tidbit : wasteful store instructions are terrible because stores can be incredibly expensive ( far worse than an extra add or multiply ) .
Fixing it with restricted pointers
There are several ways to fix this problem , but in the spirit of teaching the art of optimization , I 'll go with the use of the restrict qualifier ( this is a gcc directive , but most compilers have some support for restricted pointers ) .
The only change I made is to add restrict to the function declaration :
void naive_restrict ( float * __restrict__ in , float * __restrict__ out ) { int i , j ; for ( i=0 ; i< LENGTH - 4 ;i++ ) { out [ i] =0.0f ; for ( j = 0 ; j < 5 ; j++ ) out [ i ] += filter [j ] * in [ i+j ] ; } }
This directive tells the compiler that you , the programmer , promise that in and out are disjoint , and no aliasing will occur .

Now , you do not have to be an assembly expert to see how much more streamlined this code is .
It consists almost exclusively of loads , multiplies , and adds with a final store at the end .
This does exactly what we 'd originally hoped .
It realizes it can keep a temporary running sum and only store once at the end .
We should also note that if you violate the restricted pointer promise , this code will not be correct !
It should n't surprise you to see how much faster this version is , either :
naive : 0.672957 naive_restrict : 0.160432
Going Forward
It 's almost 5 times faster than the non-restricted version .
Though I have n't actually done it , my overwhelming suspicion is that this code still has a ways to go in terms of speed .
The next step would be the use of SSE instructions .
Maybe next post .
The take - away from examples like this should be that optimization cannot be " left " to the optimizing compiler .
You have to know what you are doing to get a compiler to make fast code .
And if you really know what you are doing ( which means knowing assembly and the underlying architecture quite well ) , you can usually get a modern optimizing compiler to do exactly what you want .
You have to be in the loop .
Truly optimized C code ends up looking nothing like C at all .
With careful hand holding , you can get a compiler to make fast code .
In that case , it can become difficult to beat a compiler with hand - optimized code .
But that is not because the compiler is so good , but because you are so good at getting the compiler to make the code you want .
How These Roles View Themselves and Each Other
If you ask a UX Designer and a UI Developer who is the principal designer of the user experience , expect to hear a resounding “ I am ! ” from both of them .
As I ’ve worked with and listened to UX Designers and UI Developers , I ’ve noticed how they view themselves and each other .
I am reminded of the crime shows on TV and who is the primary crime solver on each of them .
You get a very different impression depending on which show you watch .
The CSI shows would lead us to believe that the forensic scientists solve the crimes — including the arrest and interrogation of suspects .
Quincy ME tried to convince us that it was the coroner .
And patrol cops , detectives , profilers , prosecutors , and defense attorneys might emerge as the central crime solvers , depending on what show you watch .
In short , if you ask a UX Designer and a UI Developer who is the principal designer of the user experience , expect to hear a resounding I am ! from both of them .
UX Designers see their validity as coming from the user research that informs their designs .
“ We ’ve talked to the customers , and we know what they want . ”
UI Developers see their validity as coming from their knowledge of the underlying technology ’s capabilities and constraints , along with their knowledge of how to use the widget library at their disposal .
And the tension between the people in these two roles has been known to generate hard feelings .
UX Designers resent the disregard developers sometimes give their designs .
And UI Developers feel that UX wireframes are too static and do n’t take into account what they discover during the process of building a user interface .
As a design comes to life , the developers gain new insights — either while interacting with the back - end processes or by testing the interactions they are building .
Another source of resentment that sometimes arises is UX Designers ’ feeling that they ’re getting left out of the development process as their wireframes move into production and would like to be more involved when changes are necessary .
Conversely , UI Developers feel left out up front , where they feel they could provide informative inputs about what the available technology and tools can do and what they constrain .
Complementary Roles
The professional value UX Designers offer includes their processes and the artifacts they create that help inform and validate design and development around user needs .
I think the two roles have distinct areas in which they respectively add their unique value .
The professional value UX Designers offer includes their processes and the artifacts they create that help inform and validate design and development around user needs .
When we create a wireframe or prototype , it ’s our way of communicating data - driven — or at least process - driven — design considerations .
Such a design artifact should be a straw man that starts a collaborative process of review and refinement .
( Sometimes , being a UX Designer feels like being a forensic sketch artist who draws a nose , any nose , so a witness can say broader , thinner , whatever . )
The best case is when a design deliverable both visually communicates data - driven requirements and provides a working space for collaborative input .
The professional value UI developers offer is their use of technology to actually make the best user experience happen .
In that role , the UI Developer is a rightful participant in the design process .
Bringing a conceptual design to life is a creative function , and a UI Developer can help the design mature and emerge by applying his or her own creativity to the process .
If a UX Designer were to insist that his wireframes were unquestionable blueprints , we ’d lose the insights that could come from a UI Developer ’s craftsmanship in building that blueprint into a functional structure in which a user would want to work .
So , as UX professionals , our ultimate value is that we follow a process that includes data gathering , data validation , collaborative design , and usability testing of our designs .
Our process can channel the talents of UI Developers and support their involvement in design by informing them of user needs , then validating that the emergent design meets those needs .
If we think of ourselves just as better UI Designers , we might lose the value proposition to talented UI Developers who can both design and code .
There has just recently been a new video posted up which features our first look at Momo in action , check it out below :
Thanks to Tristen for the tip .
A new study from Harvard Business School has found something we at Reason have argued for years : instead of providing profound economic stimulus , federal spending tends to crown out private investment , making local economies worse off in aggregate .
Spending takes tax money from the community ( and elsewhere ) , decreasing economic growth potential as well .
From the Harvard website :
Recent research at Harvard Business School began with the premise that as a state ’s congressional delegation grew in stature and power in Washington , D.C. , local businesses would benefit from the increased federal spending sure to come their way .
It turned out quite the opposite .
In fact , professors Lauren Cohen , Joshua Coval , and Christopher Malloy discovered to their surprise that companies experienced lower sales and retrenched by cutting payroll , R&D , and other expenses .
Indeed , in the years that followed a congressman ’s ascendancy to the chairmanship of a powerful committee , the average firm in his state cut back capital expenditures by roughly 15 percent , according to their working paper , “ Do Powerful Politicians Cause Corporate Downsizing ? ”
“ It was an enormous surprise , at least to us , to learn that the average firm in the chairman ’s state did not benefit at all from the unanticipated increase in spending , ” Coval reports .
Over a 40 - year period , the study looked at increases in local earmarks and other federal spending that flowed to states after the senator or representative rose to the chairmanship of a powerful congressional committee .
Employment among 16 - to 19 - year olds in May grew by just 6,000 , the smallest increase since 1969 , when teen jobs fell by 14,000 , according to government data analyzed by employment firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
In May 2008 and 2009 , teen employment grew by over 110,000 .
“ It ’s certainly a preliminary strong indication that it ’s going to be a tough job market for teens , ” said John Challenger , CEO of Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
Jobs traditionally given to teens are apparently going to older workers who are willing to take low paying job to make ends meet .
Employment among 20 - to 24 - year - olds grew by 270,000 in May , an unusual spike , considering that employment in the same age group fell by 261,000 in May 2009 .
" Also impacting the job market for young adults are the large number of older adults who are willing to accept even a temporary , seasonal position simply to generate some income , " said Steven Rothberg , chief executive officer of CollegeRecruiter.com , an online entry - level job - posting site .
" We 're seeing experienced candidates taking jobs normally reserved for college grads and college grads taking jobs normally reserved for college students , " said Rothberg .
But there 's still a possibility for a turnaround , Challenger said , since June is traditionally the month when employers do the majority of their summer hiring .
A strong June or July could still lift total hiring for the season , even if it looks unlikely now .
Another reason for slower hiring , experts said , is that the establishments that usually add summer help are also the places where Americans hit by the recession may be cutting back on spending .
The majority of young Americans aged 16 - to 24 - years old worked in the leisure and hospitality industry last year at establishments such as theme parks , hotels and restaurants .
The other popular industries were in retail and in education and health services , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Employers may prefer the older workers , experts said , because they get a more experienced employee for their money .
“ They feel like they get someone who 's more mature , " said Challenger , " and has better work habits , no question . "
HAVING RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM CAT TECH , WHERE SHE'D MAJORED IN NAPPING AND LISTENING FOR THE CAN OPENER , CISSY IS CURRENTLY RESEARCHING HER MASTER'S THESIS ON RIPPING UP TOILET PAPER .
Modern life presents us with numerous ways to cheat : texts , direct messages , or plain old - fashioned affairs .
But is infidelity really betrayal ?
Radical couples therapist Esther Perel reveals why it might be exactly what your relationship needs

Is anyone monogamous any more ?
Truly monogamous ?
We may not be having serial affairs in the John Terry / Tiger Woods mode .
We may not find ourselves transgressing as dramatically as Iris Robinson .
Or as publicly – and ineptly – as Ashley Cole .
But we are probably less monogamous than we used to be , are n't we ?
We 're perhaps having extended flirtations ; serious and not - so - serious dalliances ; special , ostensibly platonic lunch dates with people we see more regularly than we'd like our partners to know .
We are , at the very least , testing the borders of fidelity via the medium of text message , or Facebook connections , or Twitter exchanges ; the Vernon Kays of the non-celebrity sphere .
And some of us are having fully fledged , old - fashioned , impassioned affairs .
Ask around and you 'll see .
I asked : friends , friends of friends of friends , online contacts and distant colleagues .
I asked some youngsters , some older people , some women , some men .
I asked them about the grey areas of their connections with people who were not their partners ; I asked what qualified as flirtation and what crossed the line .
I asked them how often their extended flirtations became affairs .
I asked those who were having affairs how they had them .
( I changed their names ; sometimes I switched genders .
Many of the stories are secondhand – one of them could be one of yours .
Or one of mine . )
Joe is not sure if the iChats he exchanges with his colleague Maggie qualify as merely flirtatious or as something more charged , less moral , potentially dangerous .
He would n't want his girlfriend , Isabel , to know about them , obviously .
But does that make him an adulterer - in - waiting ?
Does the iChat exchange make Joe less faithful to Isabel than he used to be ?
Claire thinks she could be on the verge of cheating on her husband , Mike , with Al , a man she re-met on Facebook three months ago .
Al and Claire were friends at university ; there was always an attraction there , although they never acted on it .
Ten years after graduation , at the precise point at which Claire and Mike decided to start trying to get pregnant , Al got in touch , and he and Claire began emailing regularly .
Those messages have become increasingly suggestive ; Claire 's now wondering whether to do as Al wants and meet for a drink .
Tony sent his ex-girlfriend Tracey a direct message when he found her on Twitter , telling her that he had n't stopped thinking about her in the seven years since they split .
Tracey direct - messaged him back several times ; she has n't yet told him she 's pregnant with her first child .
She 's not sure she wants to .
Nic does n't think kissing counts as cheating , especially if both parties are in a relationship ( " Equal power ! " ) and a bit drunk ; and Steph says it does n't count if it's with a celebrity .
Chris wants to leave his long - term girlfriend for the woman he met before Christmas – the woman he 's since begun to think of as the true love of his life .
They have n't had sex because they 've agreed that having an affair is not a stable way to begin a new and committed relationship .
" Because it is n't an affair , " says Chris .
" It 's just that we 're in love . "
Graham recently downgraded his extra-marital affair from a physical relationship to an intensely emotional engagement conducted entirely by text .
He thinks that 's best for his marriage .
Elizabeth , on the other hand , is delighted to discover that a very physical affair with a younger man has cheered her up so much that she finds herself being much nicer to her boyfriend and children .
" I had the perfect affair , " she likes to tell close friends .
It was so much better than the one she had three years ago .
And Michael is actively looking for a mistress .
" I am recruiting , " he says .
He has no intention of leaving his wife .
He does n't want to try dating sites designed for people seeking illicit affairs ; some of his friends have done just that , but Michael thinks they 're for amateurs .
He wants " to do it the old - fashioned way … "
THere are few reliable statistics relating to rates of infidelity .
It 's not the kind of thing people tell the truth about , or have ever told the truth about .
Psychologists think men traditionally overstate their infidelities , while women understate .
The most regularly invoked figures suggest that roughly 30 - 40 % of those in a marriage or long - term relationship will be somewhat unfaithful at some point .
Couples counsellor Andrew G Marshall , author of How Can I Ever Trust You Again ?
Infidelity : From Discovery to Recovery in Seven Steps says he 's seeing more of it in his practice .
( Although he adds : " That may be because I 'm looking for it .
And it may be because all the technology that makes it easier to cheat also makes it easier to get found out . " )
Relate 's Denise Knowles says she 's treating more people as a consequence of affairs , too .
Logic would suggest we 're having more affairs than ever .
We 're presented with more opportunities to cheat .
We work more and travel more , and consequently are more absent from our homes .
The evolving landscape of technology means we are connected – sometimes intensely and continuously – with many more people than before .
Technology also means that the very definitions of infidelity have broadened .
Emotional infidelities are increasingly an issue ; entire affairs are played out online ; intense relationships – which may or may not blur the line on friendship , who knows ?
– flourish via the intimacy of the text message exchange .
And yet we 're still incredibly reverent about , and attached to , the ideal of monogamy .
Both the major political parties are attempting to enshrine monogamy in pro-family policy ; both made monogamy a cornerstone of their election campaigns .
En masse we are critical of other people and their infidelities .
We 're fantastically sanctimonious regarding celebrity transgressions .
We were glad that John Terry was stripped of his captaincy ; delighted that Tiger Woods lost his endorsement deals as a consequence of his alleged infidelities ; overjoyed that Cheryl gave Ashley the boot .
We condemn the unfaithful publicly and gossip about them privately .
We condemn ourselves when we transgress ; we lose ourselves to guilt and suffer identity crises : how could we do this ?
This is n't who we are !
Why are we living this dichotomy ?
Why do we support the idea of monogamy so heartily while not managing to be monogamous ?
Why do we persist in having affairs , persist in believing in monogamy , when we 're not comfortable with or especially capable of either ?
Esther Perel thinks she knows .
She 's a New York - based couples therapist ; a Belgian - accented , 52 - year - old minx of a shrink .
She 's a self - styled " voice on erotic intelligence … a sexologist " , and she peddles what is possibly the most insightful , revelatory and controversial line on sex and love and marriage of our times .
I first met her three years ago in her offices – a suite of rooms on Fifth Avenue right next to New York 's Museum of Sex – to discuss Mating in Captivity : Sex , Lies and Domestic Bliss , the book she 'd just published about sex in long - term relationships .
Then , her main point was that eroticism comes not from closeness , not from intimacy , but from precisely the opposite .
From distance , from moments of jealousy , from a constant awareness that you do not own your partner no matter how long you 've been together ; that other people fancy them , that they always have the potential to sleep with someone else .
I remember at the time being both genuinely shocked by her thinking and completely poleaxed by how right it seemed .
It was instantly familiar .
It resonated like the chorus of an incredibly good pop song .
Perel 's newest obsession is infidelity .
She began writing about and considering it in earnest as far back as 2002 ; after the 2007 publication of Mating in Captivity she discovered that faithless love was all anyone really wanted to talk about , and demand for her unique perspective escalated .
She 's been chairing workshops on it and speaking at conferences about it ever since .
Perel began refining her ideas on affairs and monogamy , and concluded that pervading notions and received wisdom on both are unhelpful , outdated , reductive and ineffectual .
Perel believes that if we can revisit our ideas on infidelity , start properly understanding why we do it , become more tolerant of the fact that we do it , then we 're in with a better chance of maintaining a happy marriage .
When I interview her via Skype ( which is how , she says , she spends half her life these days .
" I even see patients like it .
We will get very intimate , just you wait and see ! " ) , I ask her : why are we all so obsessed with affairs ?
" Because it 's important ! " she says .
( Perel , who was an actor before she became a psychotherapist , is not afraid of ramping up the impact of her discourse with high drama . )
" I do n't think there is another facet in relationships that can illicit so much fear , gossip and fascination .
It tops them all . "
Infidelity , she says , is one of the great recurring themes of the human experience .
" And we are not monogamous !
We are not !
Monogamy is human , but human beings are not monogamous !
By nature !
Historically we have always been unfaithful – and always condemned infidelity .
For a glimmer of passion , or whatever , people have been willing to risk everything .
Women more so than men . "
Really ?
Female infidelity is a riskier business than male infidelity ?
" Of course !
Still , today , there are eight countries where women can be killed for being unfaithful .
And before , there was no contraception !
Everything about female sexuality was more dangerous .
Rates of female infidelity have grown enormously , in accordance with women 's economic independence .
In Latin American countries it 's a social phenomenon .
When I went to Argentina all they wanted to talk about was female infidelity .
It 's [ a marker of ] acute social change .
It 's not just a few women .
It really toppled the traditional male privilege .
What does it mean when this happens in a society where it was never accepted , where men were allowed to roam around but women never could ?
When women begin to do what was traditionally a privilege of men , what does it do ?
It does everything !
It changes the dynamic of power ! "
So infidelity might be considered an important indicator of social evolution ?
" Definitely .
You can always use infidelity to track social changes .
And yes , female infidelity is a statement of female empowerment ; but then again , infidelity is a statement of empowerment for anyone who practises it .
It is a rebellion . "
This is what Esther Perel does .
She re-spins affairs , throws new light on them , offers completely new perspectives .
She can make affairs seem positive : " I have a client who says it is a facelift and antidepressant in one – but much cheaper ! "
She can make them seem inevitable , the consequence of our intense , heightened , essentially unrealistic expectations of romantic love : " The men and women I work with invest more in love and happiness than ever before , yet in a cruel twist of fate it is this very model of love and sex that 's behind the exponential rise of infidelity and divorce .
Fascination and disillusion stare at each other . "
She can transform the revelation of infidelity into the catalyst for the rebirth of a relationship : " The standard ideas that affairs deplete intimacy , that affairs deplete the marriage , they are always harmful – I say : this is one possibility .
But there are others .
Affairs also are enormously enlivening .
Re-eroticising .
They balance the marriage .
People who have affairs do n't always want to leave the marriage .
Sometimes , often , they are looking for a way to stay ! "
And perhaps most surprisingly , most controversially , she takes the traditional cliche of the faithless man or woman and refashions it : " When you have an affair , this is rebellion !
This is not a mild act !
We have affairs to beat back the sense of deadness .
We have affairs not because we are looking for another person , but because we are looking for another version of ourselves .
It 's not our partner we seek to leave with the affair , it 's ourselves .
It 's what I 've become that I do n't like .
It 's how I 've truncated myself .
That there are parts of me that I have been so out of touch with , for decades …
And of course , we live twice as long .
We are different with different people . "
Whatever else , Perel says , we do not have affairs simply because we are bad by nature ; or deceptive , or selfish , or cruel .
" It 's not just about right , and wrong , and moral .
Particularly in America and in the UK , this is what we say about affairs .
It 's wrong .
We talk about cheater .
Philanderer .
Liar . Narcissist .
If it 's not all those condemning words , then it goes to pathology .
Borderline personality disorder .
Childhood trauma .
Addiction .
We hide behind moral condemnation , or pathologising .
This is not helpful , and not true .
If it is true , then there are a lot of us suffering with childhood trauma and borderline personality disorders , and we have been suffering from them throughout history !
We need to start to understand infidelity in terms of the complexities of life today .
We need to think in terms of the failed ambitions of love . "
Esther Perel is an impassioned , intoxicating speaker .
She talks fast and hard and she weaves her clients into her monologue .
She references them constantly : anonymously , brilliantly , luridly , with compassion and as excellent , gossipy snippets .
They are her characters , and her living proof that her theories have merit .
Sometimes , as she 's telling me their stories , I get goosebumps .
Sometimes I feel a bit teary .
Sometimes it's as if Perel 's talking to me – about me – and no one has ever understood me quite as well .
At other times , Perel loses me altogether .
I 'm on nodding terms with the misery infidelity causes .
I 've seen it , lived it ( from both , equally grim , perspectives ) , and propped up close friends who were suffering because of it .
I am not sure if this misery comes from those artificial social constraints , from the kind of ill - advised , fiercely held false ideas about relationships that Perel hopes to debunk ; or if it just really , really hurts when someone we love sleeps with someone else .
However we learn to think about it , wo n't that always be the case ?
Wo n't it always just really hurt ?
Perel says she does n't want to diminish the trauma of infidelity .
She invokes her clients again , recalls how " destroyed , completely destroyed " a male patient she had seen only that week was by the revelation of his wife 's affair .
She says that in the aftermath of an affair , both people are in crisis ( " Yes , it is a crisis of two people .
Not just of the person who was cheated upon " ) and that she would n't expect anything else .
" At that point it is my role to contain them , to give them structure , to slow them down .
And to say : ' You ca n't decide the future of your marriage on the heels of the revelation of an affair . '
Because in that first stage , with the whole turmoil , the tendency in the condemning society is to say : ' Leave ! '
I 'm saying : ' This is the one moment when you should not leave . ' "
I can engage with the idea that a more tolerant view of the person who has committed the infidelity could be helpful in many ways .
I can see that it might even help the person who was cheated upon – it could make them feel less stigmatised , not quite so much of a cuckolded cliche , could n't it ?
I can also imagine that if the pressure to leave a relationship the moment an affair is uncovered were removed , some of the blind panic that currently surrounds infidelity might be diffused – because yes , affairs are much more disruptive when they precipitate the end of a relationship .
And , long term , if we could abandon truisms like " once a cheater , always a cheater " , a relationship that 's endured an affair would have a better chance of surviving .
Perel says : " After the affair has been discovered , what needs to happen is we have to find a way to integrate the story of the affair into the story of the marriage . "
To ensure , in other words , that the marriage is not defined by the affair , but that it becomes part of its continuum .
I can – I do – accept these ideas .
But still , even as I subscribe to Perel 's thoughts , even while I am convinced that her ideas are brave , wise , smart and certainly worth pursuing , I also have moments where I struggle to see beyond the pain and unhappiness even a notional infidelity entails .
Moments when I wonder if all we are doing here is seeking to excuse shoddy behaviour .
What does Esther Perel hope to achieve ?
Simply , she says : " There must be a response to infidelity that is more creative than divorce . "
She does n't think every relationship should and can survive an affair .
Sometimes , she says , affairs are initiated as an exit strategy by the husband or wife , and so must result in a divorce or a split .
But more often than not infidelity is surmountable in a relationship .
Marriage counsellor Andrew G Marshall agrees with her in this respect , at least .
" The most miserable couples I ever see are the couples who are trying to recover from an affair , " he tells me .
" But equally , the happiest couples I end up with are the couples who have recovered from an affair .
Affairs make you scrutinise every element of your relationship , more so than any other issue .
And so if you do survive them , you will be stronger and happier as a result than you ever were before . "
Perel adds : " Less innocent , perhaps .
But stronger , more powerful , more connected . "
Perel thinks we have to work toward renegotiating our ideas of monogamy .
We need to see it as an exclusive emotional commitment , but not an arrangement that necessarily denotes sexual exclusivity .
She thinks that , in time , we 'll come to accept affairs in the same way that we 've come to accept premarital sex and homosexuality : not as deviancies , weaknesses or sin , but as part of who we are and how we love .
How , I ask , is this different from the somewhat annoying , ultimately discarded vision of free love propagated in the 60s .
" Free love did n't believe in the old model .
Free love wanted to throw the old model out .
Free love saw it as reactionary , as constraining , bourgeois .
The new model is an attempt to reconcile our needs for commitment and our need for freedom .
Our needs as part of an individualistic society , which talks about individual fulfilment and personal happiness and more is better , and our need for secure attachment and a stable family . "
She points out that , while we often talk critically about the idea of " having our cake and eating it " with reference to affairs , in every other aspect of our lives – in work , in our homes , in our social lives , in our experiences of the world , in our constant quest to improve ourselves and our quality of life – we are encouraged to have as much as we possibly can of everything .
OK : but what about jealousy ?
" Aha ! " Perel says , and she laughs .
She begins telling me about a man , a patient who , after 30 years of marriage , discovered that his wife was having an affair ; after the initial meltdown , the couple decided that while they very much wanted to stay together , they also wanted to try having sexual relationships with other people .
His wife has since begun to feel jealous when her husband goes away on business trips .
" And , of course , the view is that jealousy is a negative emotion , it 's a primitive emotion .
But I said to her : are n't you happy that you feel jealous ?
In truth it says that you care for him again , despite the affair you had .
Jealousy goes hand in hand with passion .
Is jealousy intrinsic to love ?
Yes !
It 's an indicator .
If you cheat on me , am I just pissed because it 's a sloppy thing to do ?
Or am I jealous , jealous that you had with someone else what I want to have with you , or what we used to have that was special ?
Because that 's a very different thing !
I do n't know that you can have romantic love that does n't involve jealousy .
The question is : how much ?
And what do you do with it ? "
And Perel 's got me onside again .
If I find her version of future monogamy challenging and a little bit odd , I think she is right about the role jealousy plays – the role it should play – in our long - term relationships .
We talk a little about the new , shadowy areas of human relations : the texts and email and iChats that may or may not qualify as cheating .
Perel thinks that a flirty text message exchange can be as potent an infidelity as a fully fledged , physical affair .
" So you do n't touch ?
Sometimes this can be far more erotic than sex – because it all works in your imagination . "
Furthermore , this rapidly expanding field of infidelity is yet another reason for us to redefine monogamy .
" Do we have to put monogamy on a spectrum ?
Do we need to think : what does monogamy mean to me ?
Does it mean no sex with other people ?
Does it mean not to look at other people ?
Does it mean not to fantasise about other people ?
Does it mean not to Facebook your exes ?
Not to text your friends ?
Where is the line going to be drawn ?
Monogamy today is no longer going to be assumed .
It 's going to have to be negotiated . "
Perel 's ideas on infidelity are infinitely more useful than anything else currently doing the rounds .
They would , at the very least , shake up lazy wisdom on what it means to cheat and be cheated upon .
They would provoke debate , move things on .
I think they should be given clinical currency .
Perel 's beginning to construct a book around them , and I hope she finishes it soon .
Before shutting down our Skype connection , Esther Perel says this : " At all four corners of the world , at this very moment , someone is either cheating , or contemplating cheating , or listening to the stories of someone else who is cheating , envious of that person who is in the throes of an affair – or maybe they are the lover in the affair …
With every marriage , with every relationship , comes the possibility of an affair .
It always will . "
She 's right .
She 's absolutely right .
And we have to find a way to live with that .
I recently received the following alert from the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) …
AAAS PolicyAlert — June 4 , 2010 Climate Change Education Challenged .
A petition has been submitted to the Mesa County ( Colorado ) School Board to prohibit “ the teaching of man-made climate change theory as scientific fact in the students ’ curriculum . ”
The petition , which has 700 signatures , was circulated by a movement called Balanced Education for All ( http://www.members - aaas.org / l.jsp?d=4954 . 550777.654. 2aatBFCrt9Q. A ) , a group denying the reality of and human role in climate change , which also submitted a petition to “ create and enforce a policy that prohibits teachers from applying their political views to the teaching and grading of students . ”
School Board members accepted the petition but took no action .
The petition is part of a larger campaign by the Independent Women ’s Forum , a non-profit based in Washington , DC , “ challenging public schools to provide balanced education on the issue of global warming . ”
The group is promoting a documentary ( http://www.members - aaas.org / l.jsp?d=4954 . 550776.654. 2aatBFCrt9Q. A ) , Not Evil , Just Wrong , that claims to “ confront erroneous claims of environmental extremists , ” and offers an allegedly “ compelling and scientifically accurate film about the true relationship between humans and the environment . “
Here we see that climate science deniers are employing the same pseudoscientific & intellectually dishonest tactics often used in the past by creationists as they misrepresented evolutionary science : the “ teach the controversy ” and “ teach all views ” canards .
Of course , these slogans imply that there actually is a supposed controversy about climate science within the scientific community – that is , the notion of human - influenced global warming is somehow “ controversial ” among scientists , when in fact it is n’t .
The whole point of these kinds of arguments is to sow doubt & suspicion about climate science in particular and , among some extreme anti-science ideologues , about all of science in general .
In addition , note the language in the petition which implies that when teachers try to teach actual , substantiated science that they are actually pushing a political agenda .
This kind of argument is intended to poison the well and explicitly politicize the issue of climate change science so that anyone who , likely for ideological reasons , does n’t like the science can just dismiss it as part of a conspiracy .
Do n’t fall for it .
Fortunately , we ’ve seen all these tactics before from creationists & various other pseudoscientific woo-woos , so hopefully we can recognize & fight this junk when those with an anti-scientific agenda push it .
When confronted by those who would distort & misrepresent climate science , or someone who is legitimately confused , a great way to fight back is to download the free app for the iPhone or iPod Touch called Skeptical Science !
One of the main differences among soccer balls is how much the air flow follows the ball 's surface .
Turbulent air flow would hug the curvature of the ball , reducing drag .
In this high - speed video of the Jabulani ball , however , Caltech scientists demonstrate that the air flow actually separates after about halfway across the ball .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The World Cup is in full swing , complete with an official new soccer ball named Jabulani , meaning " to celebrate " in Zulu .
The players , however , are n't exactly celebrating .
Instead , many of them are complaining that the ball 's trajectory is too hard to predict , and that the ball itself is too hard to control , resulting in wayward passes , shots flying off target , and goalkeepers looking silly .
So what exactly is it about the new ball that 's provoking all the controversy ?
To find out , Caltech engineers in the lab of Assistant Professor of Aeronautics Beverley McKeon put an official Jabulani through its paces in the Lucas Adaptive Wall Wind Tunnel .
And what they found there may explain the seemingly unpredictable nature of the Jabulani .
To start with , the classic black and white soccer ball , stitched together from 32 panels of pentagons and hexagons , has deeper grooves .
The Jabulani , which is made from only eight panels thermally bonded together , has more shallow grooves , as well as tiny raised patterns along its surface .
Heavily textured surfaces can result in more turbulent air flow around a ball , which , McKeon explains , reduces drag at the speeds typical of a soccer ball kick and allows a ball to travel farther .
( That 's the reason golf balls have dimples , for all you putting aficionados out there . )
As a soccer ball slows down after it's kicked in the air , the air flow around it changes from turbulent to smooth .
It is likely that the details of this transition are different for the traditional soccer ball than for the Jabulani , which from the point of view of a soccer player translates into a ball that 's behaving unpredictably .
It 's also possible that wind , spin , or other influences can have a stronger effect on the Jabulani 's trajectory .
As the ball hurtles through the air , the varying air flow around it can send it on unexpected paths , to the consternation of many soccer players .
Members of the media gather to cover the test .

Still , the Jabulani is n't so unpredictable that players can't learn to control it .
" It seems like anytime the ball is changed , it takes a while for people to adapt , " McKeon says .
And from a fluid mechanics standpoint , the Jabulani 's also pretty interesting .
Studying the air flow around soccer balls is a natural extension of McKeon 's research , in which she and her colleagues study how surface roughness affects air flow , using spheres as test models .
They 're looking at how they can control air flow just by changing the texture of a surface .
Their work has many applications in aircraft design , for example .
The team that conducted the test includes postdoc Michele Guala , graduate student Ian Jacobi , and Melissa Christensen , an undergraduate from UC San Diego working in McKeon 's lab this summer .

It is both the best and worst of times for libertarians .
On the plus side , real , live politicians who might conceivably get elected call themselves libertarians .
On the negative side , true libertarians have lost their ancient luxury of being able to avoid any responsibility for the gaffes and errors of political leaders .
Libertarianism rests on two bedrock beliefs : human freedom is a great good and the public sector tends to screw things up .
The first belief is based more on faith than empirical result ; the second derives from millennia of human experience .
The increased appeal of libertarianism today reflects a nonpartisan view that the public sector has been deeply problematic under either party .
It is a backlash against President Bush as well as President Obama .
( Ron Paul was , after all , the only Republican to vote against the 2002 Iraq war resolution ) .
Libertarians tend to think that the Bush years taught that all governments were flawed , not that everything would be better with a new leader who would expand the public sector .

Showing a remarkable sense of timing , my colleague Jeffrey Miron has just published an excellent primer on libertarian thought : “ Libertarianism , From A - Z , ” an engaging arrangement of brief essays illustrating one libertarian ’s view on everything from abortion to zoos .
Professor Miron ’s libertarian mix of love of liberty and skepticism toward the state leads to his view that “ radical reductions in government make sense for any plausible assessment of the effect of most policies . ”
In some cases , like drug legalization , his views are clever if not nuanced - – “ the right policy toward drugs is legalization . ”
Professor Miron ’s writing on drugs is interesting not because his overall view is a surprise , but because he has spent decades marshaling arguments and facts in favor of drug legalization .
Drug prohibition , he asserts , “ harms the public purse , ” because of both the cost of enforcement and the lost tax revenues ; breeds “ disrespect for the law ” ; “ enriches drug traffickers ” ; leads drug dealers to resort to violence and causes some “ thrift - minder users ” to use more dangerous drugs that have “ the biggest bang - for - the - buck . ”
He also asserts that some people would benefit by using drugs and that the risk of imprisonment and higher prices that drug laws bring do excessive damage to drug users .
Professor Miron ’s warning that drug prohibition erodes civil liberties concerns anyone who worries about the millions of Americans who have become part of the prison system because of our drug laws .
I always find it refreshing to take a quick , clean intellectual shower in the cold , pure waters of libertarian thought , but I find myself most interested in the murky areas on the edge of libertarianism , which Professor Miron explores with aplomb .
Libertarians are rarely anarchists .
Almost all of them believe in some form of state power , at the very least the protection of private property and the enforcement of contracts .
Many of them , including Milton Friedman , are quite comfortable with larger exercises of state power , including the redistribution of resources to those who have less .
Professor Miron writes that “ antipoverty spending is the most defensible kind of redistribution , ” because “ the goal of this redistribution – helping the poor – is reasonable and the costs of a well - designed limited antipoverty program ( e.g. , a negative income tax set on a state - by - state basis ) are modest . ”
But once the need for public action is accepted , things start getting very muddy and we ca n’t rely on either a love of liberty or fear of the state for guidance .
Consider the purely hypothetical case of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The traditional libertarian would argue that regulation is unnecessary because the tort system will hold the driller liable for any damage .
But what if the leak is so vast that the driller does n’t have the resources to pay ?
The libertarian would respond that the driller should have been forced to post a bond or pay for sufficient insurance to cover any conceivable spill .
Perhaps , but then the government needs to regulate the insurance contract and the resources of the insurer .
Even more problematically , the libertarian ’s solution requires us to place great trust in part of the public sector : the court system .
At times , judges have been bribed ; any courtroom can be influenced by the best lawyers that money can buy .
Andrei Shleifer and I have argued that the early regulations were appealing precisely because of a sense that the courts could n’t be counted upon to protect private property .
I have been learning from Jeff Miron ever since he hired me in 1989 as his research assistant in Cambridge .
I may not always agree with him , but I can think of no one who is better suited to write an introduction to the economics of libertarianism .

Rodrigo played the male lead in the Hulu series REPRISAL for producer Warren Littlefield .
He will next be ... Born : August 22 , 1975 in in Petrópolis , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
My daughter has been to nine foreign countries and about a dozen states .
Not bad for someone who has n’t even had her fourth birthday yet .
We just got back from Brazil a couple of weeks ago , and she is flush with tales of that adventure .
But of all her previous journeys , she will tell you two things :
1 . In Germany there was a castle with a BIG bed in it .
2 . At our hotel in Peru , there was a dog named Fanu .
What about tangoing with her daddy in Buenos Aires ?
How about stomping around the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle ?
Whirling along with the glockenspiel in Munich ’s Marienplatz ?
Nothing .
So why did we bother bringing her at all ?
The same goes double for her little sister , who still lives in a world with a now but no then .
If they ca n’t remember any of it , then what ’s the point of traveling with very young kids ?
Here are five .
1. Early childhood experiences shape who we become .
In those first three - or - so years of childhood , why do we celebrate birthdays ?
Eat Thanksgiving dinner together ?
Go to museums or the beach or the park ?
Why do n’t we just leave kids in their cribs until they can demonstrate that our efforts to entertain and enrich them will be rewarded with a place in their permanent memories ?
Because babyhood experiences obviously count for something .
In fact , those hazy early years are among the most formative in a person ’s life .
What better time to introduce a child to the world ?
2 . Being a parent does n’t mean you hit the pause button .
I would never claim that our children drive our travel decisions .
If that was the case , we ’d just go to the nearest hotel with a pool for every vacation .
The destinations we choose are selected because they are on my husband ’s or my wish list .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
Putting our suitcases away for the next decade makes about as much sense to me as giving up coffee until my kids are old enough to drink it .
We travel internationally because we are fanatical about it .
And by bringing our kids along , we do n’t have to put the brakes on doing something we love .
3 . Because it ’s more fun with kids .
Why do n’t we just leave our kids with a babysitter while we travel ?
Because we happen to be rather fond of the little scamps and like having them around .
And the feeling seems to be pretty mutual .
4 . Because passports do n’t work on a one - punch system .
The most frequent criticism we hear about our family journeys is that we are cheating our kids out of the chance to truly experience destinations because we are taking them while they ’re too little to appreciate it .
Hogwash .
There is n’t a country on this planet with a “ no readmission ” sign up at its border .
Just because they visited somewhere with us as toddlers does n’t mean they ca n’t return there when they are old enough to plan their own vacations .
If they want to experience a place through more mature eyes , they can go back .
Heck , we might even go with them if they ’ll let us .
5 . Because families have a collective memory .
Families are so much more than the sum of their parts .
The things we choose to do together become part of everyone ’s story .
They form a family identity that bonds us together .
Our kids do n’t have to remember anything now for the memories of a trip to be important .
As they grow , there will be tellings ( and retellings ) of our adventures .
They will see themselves in pictures .
They will know that they were part of all the fun .
Until then , we will remember it for them .

During the election campaign , there were high hopes for the Liberal Democrats in the library at Goldsmiths college in London .
Manoj Kerai was supposed to be finishing his anthropology master 's thesis and revising , but he kept jumping up from his desk to hand out Lib Dem leaflets and buttonhole people about their policies .
He was n't even a party member , yet he says he spoke to " hundreds " of students .
Sometimes he emphasised the party 's opposition to the Iraq war and university tuition fees .
Sometimes he simply urged people to " vote Lib Dem to stop the Tories " .
Two days after the election , with a Lib Dem - Labour alliance seemingly a possibility , he finally joined the Liberal Democrats .
Three days later , his party went into government with the Conservatives .
Kerai 's political feelings since have been " mixed . . .
I am willing to give the coalition a chance .
I 'm happy to carry on campaigning for the Lib Dems .
But I 'm not a big fan of the Conservatives .
The Lib Dems are closer to Labour .
A lot of people on the left will never vote for the Lib Dems again .
The coalition is either going to make or break the party . "
Has he thought about resigning his membership ?
" No . " He pauses .
" Not yet . "
Kerai's anxieties do not surprise David Steel , the former Liberal leader , and the last politician before Nick Clegg to secure a place for Britain 's long - marginalised third party in a coalition government , the short - lived Lib - Lab pact of 1977 - 8 .
" The Lib Dem rank and file are nervous , " Steel says .
" Quite a lot of the parliamentarians are nervous – about how the coalition will turn out . "
In the Observer last month , he described the Lib - Con deal as " collaboration with the enemy " , and his misgivings were echoed by both Clegg 's key predecessors as party leader , Charles Kennedy ( " I felt personally unable to vote for this outcome " ) and Paddy Ashdown ( " Am I happy about helping the Tories to form a government ?
No. " )
The Lib Dem activist and blogger James Graham adds : " The MPs I speak to say , ' It 's not a question of following the coalition agreement to the letter ; it 's a question of : what 's the issue I 'm going to have to rebel on ? ' "
The day after the coalition was announced , a Lib Dem activist called Joe Edwards expressed this disquiet most vividly , perhaps , on the website Graham manages , Social Liberal Forum : " I did not join the Lib Dems to put David Cameron into 10 Downing Street .
I certainly did not spend so much time , energy and money to see George Osborne in No 11 .
And most of all I did not campaign and post leaflets to see a bald Eurosceptic Yorkshireman become foreign secretary .
This coalition is the worst of all outcomes and Nick Clegg and others will get all they deserve . "
The resignation at the weekend of David Laws , the chief secretary to the Treasury and one of the most high - profile Lib Dems in the government , following revelations in the Tory - supporting Daily Telegraph about his expenses , will have done little to settle Lib Dem nerves .
Laws was the ostentatiously stern frontman for the coalition 's programme of drastic spending cuts , and yet , only three weeks into the government , he was shown to have broken the politically sensitive rules over when MPs should receive public money .
The whole episode has made the Lib Dems look , at best , amateurish and vulnerable ; at worst , deeply hypocritical .
And yet , mixed up with the current worry , anger and bafflement over the coalition , and sometimes warring with these feelings inside the heads of individual Liberal Democrats , there is also an enormous excitement .
" The coalition is the opportunity , for the first time in my lifetime , to deal with the argument that a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a wasted vote , " says the Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes .
Last week , left - leaning Hughes announced his candidacy for the party 's deputy leadership , a position he is likely to win .
He is regarded as the champion of Lib Dems who are uneasy with Clegg and Cameron 's double act .
But Hughes outlines the coalition 's potential almost breathlessly : " [ It may lead to ] the implementation of huge amounts of our policies .
For example , this may well be the greenest government Britain has ever had .
There 's guaranteed reform of the second chamber . . .
A government that is less oppressive . . . A [ possible ] shift in the centre of gravity of British politics away from the extreme right . . .
We 've just had two fantastically positive meetings in my constituency .
People came with all their doubts about the coalition .
But they went away excited .
Now we 're in government people can come and engage with us , bring us their issues , and we can do something for them .
It 's for real ! "
A fortnight ago , Clegg gave his first proper speech as deputy prime minister .
It was a perfect spring morning in north London ; the venue – a college in once - Blairite Islington – showed a cheeky confidence , and the big political correspondents , before the election usually late for or absent from Lib Dem events , waited respectfully in their seats for half an hour for Clegg to arrive .
Then he spoke with an intoxicating energy and optimism : " This government , " he said , " is going to transform politics . . . repeal all unnecessary laws which inhibit your freedom . . . end the culture of spying on its citizens . . . reduce the power of political elites . . . "
To anyone of a vaguely liberal disposition , it felt almost too good to be true .
And so it proved when the speech ended and the question - and - answer session began .
Clegg , as he often does when interrogated , offered wandering and equivocal responses : " . . .
Of course there are several hurdles to navigate . . .
We are looking at this in the round . . .
What I 'm establishing today is the principle . . . "
Afterwards , it was hard to say whether the Lib Dems were at the beginning or the end of a golden phase in their history .
Small – or smallish – political parties may be more susceptible than large ones to sudden boom and bust .
But the Liberal Democrats ' recent trajectory has been especially dizzying .
A year ago , Clegg was an underperforming and inexperienced party leader , nicknamed " Invisible Clegg " at Westminster and dogged by the widespread sentiment that the Lib Dems should have picked Vince Cable as leader instead .
Then came the first election debate and Cleggmania ; his party 's seemingly historic breakthrough in the polls ; the anticlimax of their election results ; the even more unexpected success of their coalition negotiations ; and now their prominent role in a government which commentators forecast lasting anything from decades to a few months .
So what will the coalition do to the party ?
The early evidence is contradictory .
In polls since the election , the Lib Dems have slipped , and Labour has gained by almost exactly the same amount .
But the shift has not been as large as many critics of the Lib - Con deal predicted : between 2 - 4 % .
And in the one significant electoral contest since the general election , last week 's delayed ballot in the seat of Thirsk and Malton in prosperous Tory north Yorkshire , the Lib Dem proportion of the vote rose while the Labour vote sharply fell .

One guide to the Lib Dems ' longer term prospects may be their Liberal predecessors ' experiences of coalition government .
" I had a long chat with Nick [ Clegg ] before the election , because he wanted to know more about [ the Lib - Lab pact of ] 1977 - 8 , " says Steel .
Then as now , a two - party administration was forced to squeeze public spending painfully despite a sluggish economy .
Successes were achieved in both areas – by 1978 Britain was no longer the spendthrift , drifting country it had been two years before – but the Liberals received little credit .
The government was dominated by wily Labour veterans Jim Callaghan and Denis Healey ; when their luck and judgment deserted them , in the winter of 1978 - 9 , the Liberals , despite having no one in the cabinet and little say in government policy , were punished by voters much more than Labour .
" We got tarred , " Steel says , " with the brush of having kept an unpopular government in power . "
At the 1979 general election , the Labour vote actually rose , while the Liberal vote dropped by a fifth and effectively gave Margaret Thatcher her famous victory .
The Lib Dems have far more MPs now than the Liberals did during the Lib - Lab pact , more public support , and a much stronger role in the government .
But taking part in coalitions as a more - or - less equal partner also proved disastrous for the Liberals .
Between 1915 and 1922 – such dusty dates still haunt Liberal Democrat publications - the party governed with the Conservatives , in adminstrations led by the great Liberal statesmen Herbert Asquith and David Lloyd George .
Yet the pressures of office in a time of war and recession , and the not - always - collegiate behaviour of the Conservatives , saw the Liberals shrink from having 272 MPs to 115 , split into two factions ( the Liberals and the National Liberals , one inside the government and one outside ) , and decisively lose their place to Labour as Britain 's second political force .
Over subsequent decades , the Liberals played intermittent and increasingly minor roles in a series of Conservative and Labour - led coalition governments ; split again ; saw MPs and members defect to the Tories ; and , by the 1950s , came close to extinction as a national party .
Ideology played a large part in the Liberals ' long history of failure as coalition partners .
Pacifism , free trade , whether to back Labour or the Conservatives – all these divided the party at different times when , in the treacherous world of coalition politics , a united front should have been the priority .
But the issue that most consistently split the Liberals , and which creates tensions in the Liberal Democrats still , is the party 's attitude to the state .
" There is this faultline in the party , " says historian David Marquand .
" There are social liberals , who want to use the state in an active way to enable citizens , and there are classical liberals , who are much more suspicious of state intervention . "
From the late 70s until recently , the former group , which includes Ashdown , Hughes and figures such as Kennedy and Shirley Williams who were originally members of the Labour party , was in the ascendancy .
But over the last few years the latter group , led by Clegg , Laws and Cable , has strengthened and steadily shifted the Lib Dems rightwards .
In 2004 all three men contributed essays to The Orange Book : Reclaiming Liberalism , a surprisingly sharp - toothed volume which attacked " nanny - state liberalism " , and called for the civil service to be " drastically pruned " and the NHS to be replaced by " a system of competing insurance schemes " .
The book 's mixture of free - market toughness and liberalism on social issues was strikingly similar to the political recipe that Cameron and other Tory modernisers were beginning to concoct .
" A fresh axis is establishing itself , " wrote the perceptive Conservative commentator Ferdinand Mount , whose cousin is Cameron 's mother , in the Daily Telegraph in 2005 .
" Cable would not look ill at ease in a Cameronian government . . .
The electoral system is now so skewed [ against the Tories ] that . . . we might have to contemplate a Tory - Lib Dem coalition . "
Yet to many Lib Dems , and to a public not accustomed to paying close attention to the third party 's ideological development , the Lib Dems remained – and remain even now – a broadly anti-Tory enterprise .
" The balance of the parliamentary party is left of centre , " says Hughes .
" We 've got to keep our links with unions , council tenants , public - sector workers . "
Steel says : " I regard myself as a Keynesian liberal and so does a huge chunk of our electorate . "
Polls have consistently shown Lib Dem voters and activists defining the party as leftwing rather than rightwing , sometimes by a margin as great as eight to one .
During the Thirsk and Malton election , the difficulty for the Lib Dems of simultaneously representing both this centre - left liberalism and the centre - right liberalism of the coalition was often obvious .
The afternoon before polling day , the Lib Dem candidate , a personable district councillor called Howard Keal , told me , " It 's marvellous to be [ campaigning ] on the doorstep and to be able to point to achievements in government . "
But then he rather spoiled this impression of coalition harmony by giving as his example : " We 've booted [ the Conservative ] inheritance tax cuts for the wealthy into the long grass ! "
How would he sum up the mood of Lib Dems locally ?
His smile froze .
There was a long pause .
A whole verse went by on the pub jukebox .
" Mostly , it 's positive .
There 's a relatively small minority who are still coming to terms with the new political landscape . . .
I would never have imagined in my wildest dreams that we would be forming a coalition with the Tories . "
Having done so , the Lib Dems probably have no choice but to try to make it work , at least in the short term .
" If there 's another election in the next year , " Williams told the New Statesman recently , " my party will be crippled – we 're not rich . "
Clegg 's initially underwhelming leadership did damage to the party 's finances from which it has yet to fully recover : in 2009 the Lib Dems received a quarter less in donations than they did in 2005 .
Some in the party regard the next general election with dread , whenever it is .
For all the policy concessions won by the Lib Dems in the coalition negotiations , Conservatives are in charge of most of the big ministries , and control 90 % of government spending , according to the Institute for Government .
The readiness of the Tories to offer the Lib Dems equal billing at government press conferences and in government policy statements , despite the Lib Dems having less than a fifth as many MPs , may not be purely an act of generous and daring political " partnership " , but also a political bait which the Lib Dems are too eagerly swallowing .
One way for the Tories to escape their still - toxic reputation for cold - hearted public spending decisions may be to make Lib Dems such as Laws and now Danny Alexander the Treasury 's best - known axemen .
And the cuts could do particular damage to the Lib Dems , strongly associated as they are with compassion by many voters .
" It looks like a matter of how many seats we 're going to lose , not gain , " says Graham .
" We 're probably talking about being left with about 30 . "
That 's barely half the party 's current total .
To retain more , he says , the Lib Dems will need to win the proposed referendum on voting reform – no pushover in a country usually wary of constitutional change – and the Conservatives are likely to campaign against it .
Ominously too , at last month 's local elections , a series of well - known Lib - Con councils were swept from office by Labour after a few years in power .
Even before Clegg and Cameron held their first joint , joshing press conference in the 10 Downing Street garden , there were signs elsewhere in Britain , little noticed by commentators amid the early promise and novelty of the Lib - Con experiment , that such an alliance might be electorally disastrous .
Graham is not that pessimistic .
" There 's a long game and a short game here , " he says .
" The party gets five years to advance its agenda in government .
Then there is a trough of unpopularity as the coalition ends .
Then a resurgence .
It will be Nick Clegg 's successor that gets the big chance . "
Or , in another optimistic scenario , the strains and messy compromises of coalition government could split the Conservatives – already divided between supporters and opponents of Cameron , and supporters and opponents of the coalition deal – and the Liberal Democrats could take advantage .
Or , finally , the Lib Dems could become like the Free Democrats , a German party in which the famously Europhile Clegg takes a keen interest : small , socially liberal but rightwing on public spending , and so nimble at coalition - building that they have been in power with one of the German main parties , both centre - right and centre - left , in every decade since the second world war .
Perhaps the Lib Dems are not as naive about coalitions as generally supposed .
Towards the end of our interview , I ask Simon Hughes , who has been manoeuvring to maximise the third party 's leverage since becoming a Liberal in the early 70s , how he sees Labour developing over the next few years .
" The Labour leadership , I hope , will be intelligent , progressive , " he says .
" I 've shadowed David Miliband .
We get on personally very well . "
Could he envisage the Lib Dems being part of a different coalition in the future ?
" Absolutely . "
He elaborates carefully : " If there is a balanced parliament next time , and if Labour and the Lib Dems make a majority , and the Lib Dems and the Tories do n't , then the presumption [ about who we go into government with ] works in a different way . "
Maybe after the next election , there will be a Lib Dem coalition that goes down better with Manoj Kerai and the other anti-Tory students in the Goldsmiths library .
Assuming , that is , the coalition 's cuts have n't shut the library in the meantime .

This cheery news from the SunHerald ( hat tip reader Dwight Baker ) :
The National Center for Atmospheric Research models showed Thursday that oil could enter the Gulf ’s loop current , go around the tip of Florida and as far north as Cape Hatteras , N.C. According to researchers , oil could threaten East Coast beaches by early July , but they cautioned the models were not a forecast .
The oil could then head by Bermuda on its way to Europe .
Martin Visbeck , a research team member with the University of Kiel in Germany , says it is unlikely any oil reaching Europe would be thick enough to be harmful .
The Compassionate Care Center of Michigan in Dryden is angling for a legal fight as medical marijuana dispensaries that have popped up across Michigan await their first test case .
The Center , in an unmarked , upstairs apartment in this tiny southern Lapeer County community , exists in the margins of the law that voters overwhelmingly approved in 2008 legalizing the medical use of marijuana .
It ’s a co-op of sorts , and some of its members cheerfully admit that medical marijuana dispensaries want to test their legality in Michigan courts .
May they get their wish .
Michigan ’s “ Medical Marihuana Act ” needs clarification .
As approved by voters , and under administrative rules written by the Michigan department of Community Health , the law has no provisions for medical marijuana dispensaries .
The law does allow patients registered with the state to grow up to 12 marijuana plants for their own use , and possess up to 2.5 ounces of dried marijuana .
Registered caregivers may grow up to 12 plants for each of a maximum of five patients , as long as the caregivers are registered to do that for their specific patients .
Caregivers may not sell the marijuana they grow , but the law does allow them to receive compensation for the service they provide .
There ’s the dispensary loophole .
At the Dryden dispensary and others in Michigan , the operators say they are merely selling to registered medical marijuana patients the excess product that caregivers have on hand .
Patients with their state of Michigan marijuana cards are arriving from far and wide to get the herbal drug their doctors have recommended to treat their medical conditions , such as chronic pain .
The state health department does not take a stand on these dispensaries , saying only that the medical marijuana law does n’t address them .
President Barack Obama , by the way , has told federal authorities to back off from busting people in the medical marijuana community in states where the drug is legal — even though marijuana remains an illegal drug under federal statutes .
So , the question of dispensaries in Michigan has become a local matter .
In Dryden , the Village Council passed an ordinance governing dispensaries after the Compassionate Care Center had opened .
Clearly , this center and others in Michigan are pushing the boundaries of an overly vague state law .
The act , for example , legalizes the cultivation , possession and use of medical marijuana for registered patients , but does not state where growers may get their seeds , or patients get their drug .
By magic , perhaps ?
Or from dispensaries that are opening up in the gray areas on the edges of the law .
Without question , they are offering their clientele a service .
The doubt lays in whether they may legally do so .
So , yes , we do hope these dispensaries get their wish .
“ That ’s what we ’re waiting for , for someone to come in and say , Nope , you ca n’t do that .
You ’re under arrest . ’
Because that ’s the test case , ” registered caregiver and medical marijuana patient Mark Carter told The Flint Journal for a story earlier this month .
Carter says he grow marijuana only for patients registered to him , but he ’s willing to selling the extra he has , through the dispensary , to patients who need it .
It ’s hard to say whether that test case will come from Dryden , though .
There , the village enacted a dispensary ordinance .
Police had n’t complained of problems with the dispensary .
Somewhere in Michigan , some day , medical marijuana advocates hope , a police raid will come .
And begin to clear some of the haze that shrouds parts of state law .
While many believed " aptitude " will soon replace " apt - get " given the fact that it 's a lot " smarter " , it seems that 's not the case in Ubuntu - in fact it 's quite the opposite : aptitude has been removed from Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat though it is still available in the repositories .
This comes as a surprise , especially since Debian officially endorses aptitude over apt - get .
Update : apparently the reason for this is to free up some 13 - 14 mb of space from the CD .
There was an attempt to remove aptitude a few releases back , but it was saved by the fact that it did n't take too much space on the CD .
But for some unknown reason , the meerkats did n't like aptitude so it was removed from Ubuntu 10.10 as you can see HERE Update : apparently the reason for this is to free up some 13 - 14 mb of space from the CD .
Commission rules prohibit diluting wastes with clean material because that would increase the volume of contaminated material , but mixing dirtier materials with slightly dirty ones would not increase the volume , experts said .
One possible solution , outlined by the commission staff , is a site - by - site analysis to judge which places licensed for A waste could handle blended material .
By one estimate , the states have collectively spent about $ 1 billion in the last 25 years looking for places to put wastes , and some have entered into multistate compacts to handle the material .
A site in Barnwell , S.C. , which used to serve the whole civilian nuclear industry and hospitals , universities and other waste generators , closed in 2008 except for wastes from South Carolina , New Jersey and Connecticut .
A compact in the Pacific Northwest opened a repository at Hanford , the federal nuclear reservation in Washington , and another may open in Andrews , Tex. , which would serve Texas , Vermont and perhaps other states .
The size of the market is not clear , but the Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that Barnwell was charging as much as $ 1,625 per cubic foot of waste .
Even with waste reduction technologies , the amount of waste per year amounts to thousands of cubic feet .
Studsvik , a Swedish company with operations in Tennessee , cooks wastes into smaller volumes to reduce storage costs and opposes the idea of dilution .
Rebecca Kelley , a spokeswoman for Studsvik , said that with the higher - level waste blended in , the radioactivity emitted might meet the initial rules for the lowest category .
However , she said that the higher - level waste stayed radioactive longer , and that after 100 years , it could still be 450 times more radioactive than the standard for the lowest category .
The fear is that an “ inadvertent intruder ” would decide , some decades or centuries hence , to build a house on top of the dump and excavate the wastes .
Class A waste is safe enough to go in shallow trenches .
EnergySolutions stressed that it mattered only what standard the waste met when it was packaged for burial , and not how it got that way .
“ If it ’s A , it ’s A , ” said Dale Didion , a company spokesman .
“ How it gets to that really , really low level , as long as it ’s at low level , really does n’t matter . ”
Pennsylvania , with nine operating reactors and no place to put the wastes , supports the company ’s request .
Utah opposes it , arguing it violates the premise under which the site was licensed .
Blending might raise new safety questions , but the commission chairman , Gregory B. Jaczko , pointed out that permanent burial offered advantages over above - ground storage .
The commission has no timetable for making a decision , and the agency is not even certain whether its existing regulations already allow the kind of blending that EnergySolutions is proposing .

REBELS AND OUTLAWS
Rebels against the machine
The common view of the Luddites is of mindless machine wreckers .
In fact the Luddite movement was a highly politicised response to the assaults of a new ruling class .
Here Suzanne Jeffrey tells the real story
' Luddite ' is today used as a term of abuse .
In their time printers at Wapping and the miners have been labelled as Luddites , accused of trying to resist the inevitable march of progress in the form of new technology , and so called ' cleaner ' , more efficient industries .
This common image of the Luddites as backward looking machine - wreckers is one consciously fostered by most historians .
But to properly understand them we need to locate them historically .
The Luddite years were indeed turbulent times .
The assassination of the prime minister , Perceval , on 11 May 1812 , was greeted with undisguised popular elation .
People celebrated in the streets , and as the assassin was taken away , shouts of ' well done ' and applause were heard from the crowd .
The only disappointment lay in the fact that the motive had been a personal grudge rather than a political one .
The background to such political turbulence lay in the enormous changes being wrought in people 's lives at that time .
Manufacturing industry developed rapidly , bringing with it not just new machinery , but the wholesale introduction of the capitalist system of factory production .
For working people , this meant not just reduced wages or the need to acquire new skills , but an assault on every aspect of their lives .
As the division of society into big capitalists and propertyless proletarians speeded up , millions faced an increasingly precarious existence of poverty and unemployment .
Luddism appeared as the only way of defending themselves against the new capitalist order being built at that time .
Pitted against them were the combined forces and legislation of the old landed aristocracy , fearful of a Jacobin revolution of the type that had toppled their fellow parasites in France only years before , and the new rising , powerful class of factory owners with their philosophy of economic freedom and free trade .
Together they introduced the Combination Acts , which outlawed any kind of union organisation .
The penalties for breaking the law were severe , from transportation to Australia with hard labour , to the scaffold .
The Luddites faced the most determined and brutal opponents .
King Ludd does not appear to have been a real person , but rather a name used by the Luddites to avoid detection by the authorities .
It was supported by a host of other names capturing the spirit of resistance such as General Justice , Thomas Paine , A True Man , No King and Joe Firebrand with accompanying addresses like Robin Hood 's Cave and Sherwood Forest !
The story surrounding the name Ludd is somewhat confused , but one suggestion is that it was the name of a young apprentice framework knitter , Ned Ludd .
He had been told by his master to work faster and when Ned refused , his master reported him to the magistrate who ordered a whipping for the boy .
On hearing this , Ned is reported to have picked up a hammer and demolished the frame .
Whether this story is true is not important .
What is significant are the demands and ideas of the Luddites illustrated in the many letters sent to the manufacturers , signed by Captain Ludd or one of his many counterparts .
The following is a typical example .
' The General Agitators [ assert ] ... that Charles Lacey [ local manufacturer ] has been guilty of diverse , fraudulent and oppressive acts -- whereby he has reduced to poverty and misery 700 of our beloved brethren and has obtained the sum of £ 15,000 .
It appears to us that the said Charles Lacey was actuated by the most diabolical motives and therefore do adjudge the said £ 15,000 to be forfeited and do hereby command Lacey to disburse the said sum , in equal shares among the workmen . '
Hardly the words of uncouth , illiterate workmen motivated purely by fear of new machinery !
Luddism commenced in Nottingham in March 1811 among the framework knitters sometimes called stockingers .
They were highly skilled , making exquisite stockings worn by the wealthy .
They faced , not the new machinery but the increasing control of merchant capitalists over their industry .
They had begun to raise rents on the frames and introduce low paid unskilled labour .
The main disturbances began with a demonstration followed at night by framebreaking .
Such activities warranted little comment , as they were not unusual for the time .
However although this was not initially an organised movement , the threat of the Combination Acts quickly drove it to develop a high level of organisation and become much more political .
By November 1811 Luddism had become a disciplined force .
Each attack revealed planning and method .
The men were disguised , communicating to each other by watchword or pistol fire , and only frames using unskilled labour or with higher rents were attacked .
A calling card explaining their purposes was left in each workshop attacked .
In December 1811 , the Leeds Mercury commented on the strength of organisation of the Luddites and was prompted to declare ' the insurrectional state to which this country has been reduced in the last month has no parallel in history since the troubled days of Charles I . '
Such activities produced some successes .
Many merchants reduced rents and thus increased wages .
But just at the moment Nottinghamshire Luddism became inactive , Luddism in Yorkshire and Lancashire was triggered off by its example .
Reports from Nottingham had been eagerly followed in Yorkshire , the local newspaper being read aloud in the workshops .
The first accounts from Yorkshire came in mid-January 1812 , thereafter Yorkshire Luddism appears full grown , modelled on the discipline and tactics of Nottinghamshire , but accompanied by a great many threatening letters more insurrectionary in their terms than anything earlier .
A letter which appeared in Leeds targeting the Prince Regent called on people to follow ' the noble example of the brave citizens of Paris who in the sight of 30,000 Redcoats brought a tyrant to the ground ; by doing so you will be aiming at your own interest . '
The target of Yorkshire Luddites were the gigmills where machinery was replacing their jobs as woollen cloth - finishers .
Both Yorkshire and Lancashire Luddism , however , faced not just small manufacturers but the large landowners who were both ruthless and determined .
The attack at Cartwright 's Mill of Rawfolds in 1812 has become legendary and demonstrated the problems faced by the Luddites .
The owner , who claimed he wanted to ride in the saddle up to his girth in Luddite blood , had his mill protected by armed soldiers and his own armed workers .
He had barricades of spiked rollers on his stairs and a tub of oil of vitriol ( hydrochloric acid ) at the top , for use if the Luddites penetrated the mill .
About 150 Luddites took part in the attack , led by George Mellor , a young cropper from Huddersfield .
After a brave fight , the Luddites were defeated and had to retreat , leaving behind two fatally wounded men .
The actions of John Booth , one of the dying Luddites , sums up the courage and determination of the movement .
At the moment of death Booth signalled to the priest Hammond Robertson .
' Can you keep a secret ? ' said Booth .
' Yes , yes ' replied the eager Robertson ' I can ' .
' So can I ' replied Booth , and shortly after died .
In the end the Luddite movement could not confront the massive forces mobilised against it .
By the summer of 1812 there were no fewer than 12,000 troops in the ' disturbed counties ' , more than Wellington had under his command at the same time in the Peninsular Wars .
Frederick Engels described the situation in which the Luddites were born as one in which ' the conflicts arising from the new social order were only just beginning to take shape ' and goes on to say this was ' even truer for the means of resolving them ' .
As the ruling class forced the working population into a life of degradation , poverty and alienation the means of resolving that conflict , a large urban industrial working class , did not yet exist .
But in a society which presented ' nothing but abuses ' , the Luddites fought with the methods available to them in a courageous and inspiring way .
Luddism should not be a term of abuse , rather we should embrace it as a part of our tradition .

Do you remember the '90s ?
It was a glorious time in history when comic book print runs exceeded a million copies , the first appearance of Cable was still making an impact , Dennis Miller interviewed Rob Liefeld and Marvel made memorable swimsuit specials .
It was also a magical era when the idea of buying a pack of cards with the chance of grabbing a photo of a comic book creator like Tom Yeates or Todd McFarlane with no shirt on made perfect sense .
[ Asst Ed. Note :
It still makes sense to me ! ]
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2010/06/09/comic-book-creators-trading-card-past/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ; digg_url = ' http://digg.com/comics_animation/Hilarious_90s_Comic_Book_Creator_Trading_Cards_PICS';
Eclipse Enterprises honored the industry in 1992 with their Famous Comic Book Creators trading card series and made such opportunities available to the general public .
Some legends like Will Eisner and Jack Kirby appeared in more conservative attire , opting for sweaters , while some younger go - getters left less of their bodies to the imagination .
I can only speculate about what circumstances might have led to Eclipse acquiring the photos for its more topless images , but the 110 - card set spanned decades of fashion choices and mustache styles .
Click on past the jump and you can unearth a gallery of this magic for yourself .
Here in Canada there is n’t much choice in the way of Internet service providers — there ’s Bell in the east , Telus in the west , Videotron in Québec , Rogers in Ontario and Shaw elsewhere .
But your choices in any one location are usually limited to DSL or cable , and often just one of each .
Thankfully such is not the case for yours truly , a Rogers cable Internet customer for a few years in the late 1990s , then again from about 2004 until yesterday .
Well actually , 30 days from yesterday — I have an extra month of paid service to reconsider , whether I want to or not .
So why the switch ?
One reason is purely pragmatic .
I ’m going with a company called Teksavvy who are themselves wholesalers of Rogers cable Internet — I ’ll be getting a better level of service from them than I do with Rogers for $ 17 CAD less each month .
Another reason is political .
While I ’ve heard nothing but good things about Teksavvy Rogers has been rightfully accused of all kinds of shady business practices in recent years , including but not limited to :
I ’d like to believe that as a Teksavvy customer my online rights will be respected more than they were with Rogers , though if Bill C - 32 becomes law it probably wo n’t matter .
What does matter is that my monthly Internet bill will no longer support this country ’s Hearst dynasty , but instead a company more deserving .
And I ’m pretty stoked about that .

“ Wow ! ” “ Amazing ! ” “ Unbelievable ! ” “ What are the chances of that ? ”
Most , if not all of you , have uttered words like this at some time in your life .
The paradoxical title of today ’s Numberplay , then , is true : rare coincidences are really common .
Why should this be ?
After all , rare should be rare , should n’t it ?
People who are prone to magical thinking seize on such commonly experienced rare coincidences and ascribe cosmic significance to them , invoking Divine Providence or Pre-arranged Destiny or Synchronicity or some other favored pseudoscientific explanation .
But if these coincidences are so common as to happen to everyone , then how significant can they be ?
It ’s like that pearl of wisdom that I first heard from a treasured friend , The Talking Moose , on an old Mac computer over 20 years ago : “ Remember that you are a unique individual — just like everyone else . ”
Today , we ’ll see how the commonness of rare coincidences can be fully explained by nothing more than an interaction of mathematics and human psychology , creating a few distinct patterns of fallacious thinking , which I ’ll give as label and problem .
1
The first one is Too Many Targets .
1. Suppose there are a thousand possible rare events , each of which can happen with the “ unbelievable ” probability of one in a million on a particular day .
How likely is it that you will encounter one such unbelievable event in a year ?
In a lifetime of 80 years ?
How many such events will an average person see in his or her 80 - year lifespan ?
In fact , the number of possible events that we would consider “ rare ” are much much more than a thousand .
There are so many of them that it would be fruitless to try and list all of them before they happen , and so we do n’t think about them .
We just reserve our oohs and aahs for the ones that do happen .
Gary ’s graphic says it all .
You throw a dart at random on to a dark wall , and shine a flashlight to see where it went .
Wow , it hit a bull ’s eye !
Amazing !
Very few of us bother to turn on the light switch .
The flashlight of our selective attention blinds us to the underlying reality .
It turns out that the whole wall is tiled with bull ’s eyes !
Moreover , throughout your life you take thousands of potshots at them .
In his book “ Unweaving the Rainbow ” Richard Dawkins coined a technical term for the target - studded wall of potential coincidences .
He calls it a PETWHAC — “ Population of Events That Would Have Appeared Coincidental . ”
In most circumstances , the PETWHAC is huge .
After all , in today ’s Age of Information age we are bombarded every day with thousands of facts , names and numbers that can become fodder for coincidence .
Sometimes you do n’t find coincidence , coincidence finds you .
This brings us to our second label .
It ’s called You Are The Chosen .
2. Imagine that you are following a series of eight important ballgames .
The day before each ballgame , you receive an e-mail accurately naming the team that is going to win .
It ’s uncanny !
The e-mail admits that similar predictions have been sent out to other people , but that each prediction is “ personalized ” and is solely dependent on the receiver ’s psychic persona .
Believing that you are attracting good luck , you willingly part with a small amount of money , say $ 10 , to be tipped off about the next game .
After all , you stand to win a lot more with the bookmakers .
Assuming the games are fair with each team equally likely to win , and the scammers are guessing too , how could such a scam be carried out ?
How many people will they have to e-mail to earn $ 500 on the ninth game if half of the eligible people fall for the bait ?
How many more games on average after the eighth before the e-mail oracle fails ?
3 . The above problem had a real world counterpart in the recent World Cup .
An octopus named Paul correctly predicted the results of each of the eight games that Germany played .
What do you think is the most likely explanation for Paul ’s success ?
There are many other fallacious reasons why coincidences seem so common .
Among them are Overestimating the Odds , Making A Good Story , Parallel Thinking , In - Step Emotional Time Constants , Subconscious Cues , Publicity Seeking and of course , the age - old favorite – There ’s A Sucker Born Every Minute .
I wo n’t dilate on them here , but you can try and guess what they might be .
If this topic is a hit , I may give you more puzzles based on it next time .
I ’d love to hear about examples of coincidences in your own experience and the possible or real reasons for them .
You can also try to come up with oxymorons such as the title of today ’s Numberplay and the sage utterance of the Talking Moose .
In parting , I ’d like to put forth what I think the proper emotional attitude to such coincidences should be .
Do rational explanations of coincidences take the magic out of life ?
Do they , in fact , “ unweave the rainbow , ” as the poet Keats accused the scientist Newton of doing , in a diatribe that inspired the title of Dawkins ’s book ?
Not at all !
If you are anything like me , you have been as moved and have shed as many tears watching and reading fictitious stories as you have in real life , even though you knew that the stories were n’t true .
Enjoying the wonder of something has nothing to do with intellectually believing that it is true or cosmically significant .
So I say , let ’s enjoy the coincidences that come our way .
It ’s an emotional response that ’s wired into our brains , a throwback to the times when we lived in small groups and encountered only a small fraction of the information we do today .
Be liberal with “ Wow ! ” and “ Amazing ! ” and “ Unbelievable ! ”
Enjoy them to the fullest .
Just do n’t take the coincidences seriously .
They usually mean absolutely nothing .
May your coming week be blessed with many interesting coincidences .
And may you not assign cosmic significance to them .
1 . That ’s my version of “ chapter and verse . ”
Well - explained and correct solutions to the questions posed in this post will be highlighted in a couple of weeks and referenced and discussed in the subsequent Numberplay column .
Mitchel Stein sent in a video a woman took of the “ USA ” section of the ethnic food aisle in a German grocery store .
It ’s an interesting look at what types of foods / brands are associated ( at least in this store ) with the U.S. :
I suspect that a lot of citizens of the U.S. would n’t necessarily think of those items if they tried to think of quintessentially American foods , much like foods defined as Chinese often are n’t found in China ( e.g. , the fortune cookie ) .
It ’s a good example of the social construction of national foods — that is , a set of food items become associated with a particular culture or nation , which may or may not align with the foods members of that culture most prefer or eat most frequently .
Also , apparently we in the U.S. are most associated with processed sweet / dessert items , and BBQ sauce .
Though I was super excited to see Head Country BBQ sauce , since it ’s made in northern Oklahoma !
About Money Origami or Orikane
Its a weird and wonderful art , Dollar Bill Origami / Money Origami or Orikane as its actual known .
Its an old skill only known by a very few and only truly mastered by a handful of people .
Orikane was general kept as an underground trick by the super wealthy and elite who wanted that touch of panache to impress the fattest of cats .
You see , the best and most technical folds are those that are practiced on the most expensive bills and notes across the world .
Fascinating is n't it .
So why are women still such a minority in math - oriented sciences ?
The most balanced answer I ’ve seen comes from two psychologists at Cornell , Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams  who , by the way , are married and have a daughter with a graduate degree in engineering .
After reviewing hundreds of studies in their new book , “ The Mathematics of Sex ” ( Oxford ) , they conclude that discrimination is no longer an important factor in keeping out women .

They find consistent evidence for biological differences in math aptitude , particularly in males ’ advantage in spatial ability and in their disproportionate presence at the extreme ends of the distribution curve on math tests ( the topic of last week ’s column ) .
But given all the progress made in math by girls , who now take more math and science classes than boys and get better grades , Dr. Ceci and Dr. Williams say that differences in aptitude are not the primary cause of the gender gap in academic science .
Instead , they point to different personal preferences and choices of men and women , including the much - analyzed difference in the reaction to parenthood .
When researchers at Vanderbilt University tracked the aspirations and values of mathematically gifted people in their 20s and 30s , they found a gender gap that widened after children arrived , with fathers focusing more on personal careers and mothers focusing more on the community and the family .
Dr. Ceci and Dr. Williams urge universities to make it easier for a young scientist to start a family and still compete for tenure , but they do n’t expect such reforms to eliminate the gender gap in academic science .
After all , the difficulty of balancing family and career is hardly unique to science , and academia already offers parents more flexible working arrangements than do other industries with smaller gender gaps .
The gap in science seems due mainly to another difference between the sexes : men are more interested in working with things , while women are more interested in working with people .
There ’s ample evidence  most recently in an analysis of surveys of more than 500,000 people  that boys and men , on average , are more interested in inanimate objects and “ inorganic ” subjects like math and physics and engineering , while girls and women are more drawn to life sciences , social sciences and other “ organic ” careers that involve people and seem to have direct social usefulness .
You can argue how much of this difference is due to biology and how much to society , but could you really affect it by sending scientists and engineers off to the workshops mandated by the bill now in Congress ?
Christina Hoff Sommers , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the editor of a recent book “ The Science on Women and Science ” ( AEI Press ) , says the workshops ’ main effect would be to provide jobs for researchers and advocates promoting a myth of gender bias .
She criticizes the National Science Foundation for sustaining this industry over the past decade with more than $ 135 million from its Advance program promoting gender equity .
I was just updating my Arch linux operating system when I was prompted to replace DrScheme with something called Racket .
I was curious and said yes .
It turns out that PLT Scheme is now called Racket : http://www.racket-lang.org/
I opened up the ( new ? ) interactive utility , which , by the way , I was cautious about when I first started messing with Scheme but now I have come to enjoy working in : Instead of DrScheme I found DrRacket .
The new Racket homepage has some short code that you call play with and so I started playing .
Nice !
Here is a little snippet to make a Sierpinski Triangle :
I do n’t have much time now to go through the new Racket documentation but I hope — AND ASSUME — that DrRacket will work will all the examples from the book How to Design Programs .
By the way , they do have the book listed in the documentation section of the Racket website .
I ’ll also show here a screenshot with a small temperature converter exercise from HTDP that works no problem with Racket :
Somalia is the only country in the world where there is no government .
Some of my children sell nuts in the street to earn some money .
We can't afford to send them to school
Ladan Barow Nur
In pictures : Life in Mogadishu
Seventeenth century philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote that " life is solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short " , if there is no central authority .
Few Somalis have probably heard of Hobbes but most would agree with his description - except for " solitary " , as family and clan ties remain extremely strong .
The last government , of Siad Barre , was toppled in 1991 .
Since then Somalia has been divided into a myriad of different fiefdoms controlled by rival warlords , who occasionally clash for territory .
So what is life like after more than a decade without a government ?
No public spending
Driving 50 km ( 30 miles ) from one of the airstrips near the capital , Mogadishu , to the city , you pass seven checkpoints , each run by a different militia .
Life in Somalia is ' poor , nasty , brutish and short '
There is no pretence that any of this money goes on public services , such as health , education or roads .
Much of it is spent by the militiamen on khat , an addictive stimulant , whose green leaves they can chew for hours on end .
Those who can afford it travel with several armed guards - and then you can pass the road - blocks unmolested .
I am from Somalia and to live without government is the most dangerous system
Abdow , Vingaker , Sweden
Life in Somalia :
Have your say
While Siad Barre is commonly referred to as a dictator and people were press - ganged into fighting wars with Somalia 's neighbours , some now remember with fondness that schools and hospitals were free .
It is now estimated that only about 15 % of children of primary - school age actually go to school , compared with at least 75 % even in Somalia 's poor neighbours .
In Mogadishu , many schools , colleges , universities and even government buildings , have become camps for the people who fled to the capital seeking sanctuary from fighting elsewhere .
Kidnappings
Makeshift shelters made from branches , orange plastic sheets and old pieces of metal cover what were once manicured lawns outside schools and offices .
Somalia is a pure free market
Somalia - based diplomat
" Some of my children sell nuts in the street to earn some money .
We can't afford to send them to school , " says Ladan Barow Nur with resignation , as she cooks chapattis for the evening meal on an open fire just outside her tent .
" My husband helps shoppers carry their goods in the market but it 's not enough .
We 're always hungry . "
Facts and figures about life in Somalia
At-a-glance
Some schools , universities and hospitals continue to operate but they are mostly privately run and charge fees .
The many thousands of people like Mrs Ladan are unable to pay the $ 3 it costs to see a doctor and so people die of diseases which could be easily prevented or cured .
Market forces
" Somalia is a pure free market , " one diplomat told me .
And the central Bakara market certainly looks to be thriving .
Some businesses , such as telecoms , are also doing well , with mobile phone masts and internet cafes among the few new structures in Mogadishu , a city where many buildings still bear the scars of the heavy fighting between rival militias of the early 1990s .
This large pile of notes is worth about $ 210
Speaking from a theoretical point of view , some economists might say so , but in the very harsh reality of Mogadishu , it means guns and other military hardware are freely available in a market not far from the city centre .
I was advised that it was too dangerous to visit , as customers were constantly firing the weapons to make sure they work before buying them .
The cost of an AK - 47 is the equivalent of a survey of business confidence in more stable countries .
Following the election of a new president in October , the price fell , as people anticipated that militias may soon no longer be able to operate with impunity .
But a month on , with a government still not named , nor a clear plan for how or when President Abdullahi Yusuf and his team will even go to Mogadishu , let alone get anything done , the price of a weapon has been creeping higher .
Passports for sale
The lack of a government also means that the US dollar is the currency of choice - even refugees beg in hard currency .
Somali shillings are still used but the notes only come in one denomination - 1,000 , worth seven US cents .
Somalia 's passports are a DIY affair
At first , some traders in Mogadishu refused to accept the new notes but now they are all used side - by - side .
Similarly , the printing of passports has been privatised .
For just $ 80 and in less than 24 hours , I became a Somali citizen , born in Mogadishu .
As I had omitted to travel with any passport - sized photos , my supplier kindly left the laminate for that page intact , for me to stick down at home .
For a slightly higher fee , I was offered a diplomatic passport , with my choice of posting or ministerial job .
There is nothing you can do when kids with guns steal everything you have , even your clothes
Former Somali army major
And some fear that in the absence of any other authority , terror training camps could be set up in Somalia .
Although Somalis are able to survive and some are even prospering , everyone I spoke to in Mogadishu is desperate for a return to some semblance of law and order - schools and hospitals can only follow security on the new government 's to - do list .
" I just want a government , any government will do , " one man told me .
We all seem to enjoy criticising our governments but life in Somalia shows the alternative is far worse , as Hobbes wrote 350 years ago .
A former Somali army major , now a refugee in London , summed up life without a government very well .
" There is nothing you can do when kids with guns steal everything you have , even your clothes .
I 'm from a small clan , so I was unable to fight back , " he said .
" Here , there are rules which people respect and so you can get on with your life in peace . "
Good news if you are willing to join CN , a specialized movie tracker that ’s yet to have a public open signup .
CN staff are once again looking to bring in some fresh new blood into the tracker and have re-opened online invite applications .
Potential new members are now able to fill & submit the application form and if successful they will get invited in by tracker staff themselves .
As mentioned before , invite apps are one of the safest ways to get into private torrent trackers without having to worry about your inviter being a trader , cheater or a scammer .
Coming back to CN , it ’s a pretty decent movie tracker .
It has a large collection of films both old and new ( SD , HD rips included ) and runs on a heavily customized tracker script with tons of features , add - ons and other gizmos not usually found on other similar sites .
If you download a lot of movies over BitTorrent , you might want to check this site out .
You can find over 12500 movie torrents which include quite a few packs and over 400 internal encodes exclusive to CN .
As we highlighted in a previous post , this is a private tracker with a lot of BRRip and BDRip torrents ( in addition to other HD and non HD releases including Blu Ray and DVDRip releases ) .
However , CN is not all about content .
The site has a wide focus on community and features lots of activities , points systems and bonuses that promote member activity beyond just downloading movies .
We strongly recommend you go through the FAQ ( / faq. php ) once you join the site – a good summary of site features and how everything works is described in detail there .
Initially , CN was known ( and criticized on a lot of BitTorrent forums ) for it ’s tight rules regarding publicity – members were not allowed to post full tracker name or URL in public .
However , CN administration 's stance towards ‘ being underground ’ has slowly changed over time .
Although never directly opened public signups they have in the past recruited members via E-mail , via IRC invite giveaways and of course , via invite applications .
They ’ve always been cool with us posting full URLs whenever it came to one of these events ( which I ’m sure resulted in lots of new members getting into the tracker ) - this IMHO is a step in the right direction .
Too much secrecy can easily kill a tracker due to lack of members and activity .
Speaking of invite applications , the current version of the form does not appear to be that tough .
Most of the questions in it revolve around your personal preferences when it comes to watching movies – a basic knowledge on BitTorrent ’s best practices should easily get you inside .
Quoted below is the news post announcing the re-opening of invite apps :
Invite Applications : ON
As stated in the title , we have decided to let some more users in so make sure you tell your friends they now have the chance to try their luck , here : https://www.cosanostra.mn/applyforinvite.php
As a side note , we are not that strict when reviewing the applications but please tell them to spend some minutes writing something acceptable or we simply ignore it .
Note that these will only be open for a limited time .
If you are interested in joining CN , go ahead and fill out the application form .
Allow some time for your application to be processed though – each submission needs to be manually checked by staff and this might in some cases lead to delays .
Good luck .

You can setup virtually any Mac as a home theater media center , all you need is the right tools .
Yes , that means your MacBook Pro , MacBook , Mac Mini , iMac , even Mac Pro , can all turn into a media center , and it ’s a lot easier than you might think .
For the purpose of this article , we are going to assume you have an HDTV that supports HDMI input , and , preferably a Mac that supports HDMI output with audio ( for Mac ’s that do n’t support direct HDMI output with audio , read on anyway there is a solution for you too ) .
When you are finished with this article , you will be able to have a complete Mac Media Center hooked up to your TV , creating an awesome home theater , and you ’ll be able to control the whole thing wirelessly from your couch .
Setting up a Mac Media Center
Here ’s what you ’ll need to setup a media center with your Mac :
HDTV that accepts HDMI input
that accepts HDMI input Mac that supports video / audio output ( newer Mac models that support full HDMI highly recommended , the New Mac Mini is perfect )
is perfect ) HDMI cable ( and / or other appropriate cables if your Mac does n’t support direct HDMI out )
( and / or other appropriate cables if your Mac does n’t support direct HDMI out ) Apple Remote Control
Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Wireless
Mouse – these are optional but highly recommended if you want to browse the web and play games on your media center
and Apple Wireless
Mouse – these are optional but highly recommended if you want to browse the web and play games on your media center Plex – Plex is arguably the best media center software solution and runs right on top of Mac OS X as an application .
It ’s got a beautiful interface , vast media support , and is free to download .
What ’s not to love ?
Step 1 ) Get the proper Video Output Adapters
So first things first , get your cable situation squared away .
Newer Mac ’s support full HDMI out with audio and video carried over the same cable , but on many models you ’ll still need an adapter .
For instance , my MacBook Pro 2010 model only needs a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and a standard HDMI cable , because it supports full HDMI output .
The new 2010 Mac Mini supports direct HDMI output with no additional cables at all , so you ’d only need an HDMI cable .
Your cable requirements are going to vary from machine to machine , so determine which output adapter is needed for your Mac .
Step 2 ) Download and Install Plex Media Center Software
Plex is really great media center software that runs right on top of Mac OS X .
Features of Plex Media Server include :
Easily catalogue , organize , and access all of your media files : movies , music , pictures , etc , directly within Plex
: movies , music , pictures , etc , directly within Plex Automatically download movie , TV show , and album artwork , episode information , IMDB ratings , and more
, and more Plays HD video content nearly flawlessly
content nearly flawlessly Plug - in video support for Hulu , Netflix , Youtube , MTV , Vimeo , and more
Diverse codec support for various video and audio file types
for various video and audio file types Interface is completely skinable allowing you to change the appearance to another theme that fits your setup , TV , or preferences
allowing you to change the appearance to another theme that fits your setup , TV , or preferences Subtitle support for foreign language movies

and awesome visualizers for music Weather updates for whatever regions you specify ( it will automatically detect one by default )
for whatever regions you specify ( it will automatically detect one by default ) RSS feeds support
Works with the Apple Remote , Wireless Keyboard , or Wireless Mouse
Support for hardware accelerated H.264 video playback on Nvidia 9400 M , GT320 M , GT330 M chipsets
As you can see Plex is full featured , and that ’s exactly why we ’re using it for our Mac Media Center .
If there is an app that is easier to use and as full featured as Plex , I have n’t found it yet .
Setting it up is an absolute breeze .
How to setup Plex :
Download the latest version of Plex
Drag the app to your Applications folder
Launch Plex
Let it sync with your Apple Remote ( it may want to install 3rd party drivers as a bug fix , no problem )
Using your keyboard ( or Apple Remote ) , navigate and select your Video source destination ( directory , hard drive , whatever )
Watch movies , TV shows , play music , whatever
Yes , it ’s that easy , seriously .
Plex will automatically pull your music library from iTunes too , so there ’s practically no setup .
Here ’s a screenshot of the media browser interface :
Step 3 ) Connect your Mac Media Center to your TV
This step is pretty straight forward , you just need to be sure you have the proper cables .
For for the sake of this tutorial we ’ll pretend we have a new 2010 Mac Mini , all this machine requires is an HDMI cable to connect from the Mini to an HDMI port on your TV .
Step 4 ) Enjoy your Mac Media Center !
Once you have Plex running and your Mac connected to the TV , that ’s all you have to do !
Now it ’s time to sit back and enjoy your media center .
You can also further customize Plex by downloading additional plugins , you can access these directly through the Plex application .
So that ’s it .
Now for some Questions and Answers …
How do I browse the web or play games on my Mac media center ?
Just quit out of Plex and launch Safari or a game .
Once your Mac is connected to your TV , the TV is basically a large external monitor for the Mac , so you can treat it as such and play virtually any game , browse the web , or anything else you ’d otherwise use a Mac for .
Why just focus the media center on newer Macs with HDMI out ?
The reason we recommend newer Mac ’s that support full HDMI video / audio exporting is just ease of setup .
In fact , you can setup the exact same media center on a Mac that does n’t support full HDMI output , you ’ll just need additional items .
What can be done with just an HDMI cable on newer Mac ’s requires additional cables to perform the same task on an older Mac ; for example , an older Mac might need a mini-DVI to DVI adapter , than a DVI to HDMI adapter , plus the HDMI cable , plus an additional AUX cable to output audio .
The exact requirements will depend on your Mac model but it ’s not complicated as long as you know what you need .
In other words , if you have an older Mac , do n’t get discouraged , just get the right adapters and the rest of this guide works the same for your media center too !
My Mac does n’t export HDMI , what can I do ?
If your Mac does n’t support direct HDMI output , you can use a DVI to HDMI adapter to still output to HDMI , just remember that you will need an additional cable to carry the audio signal from your audio output jack to audio input on the TV , since DVI does not transmit audio .

Mr. Barbour , 62 , is proof that if you hang around long enough , even a good old boy lobbyist and political party animal can come back into fashion  or at least be recast by circumstance .
A self - described “ fat redneck , ” he speaks in a marble - mouthed Mississippi drawl , loves Maker ’s Mark bourbon , resembles an adult version of Spanky from the Little Rascals and fits no one ’s ideal of a sleek new political model : squat , big - bellied and pink - jowled , he looks as if he should have a cigar in his mouth at all times ( and occasionally does ) .
Mr. Barbour , one of the few politicians whose standing was enhanced by his response to Hurricane Katrina , has eagerly taken on the post of de facto director of tourism for the Gulf Coast , a task only slightly less daunting or thankless than heading a public relations campaign for BP .
He has complained bitterly about what he calls the news media ’s exaggerations and distortions about the spill .
“ I ’ve heard reports that this would be a threat to Europe , ” he railed to The Sun - Herald newspaper .
“ That ’s about the same as saying I ’m going to grow wings and take flight . ”
Unlike his counterpart in Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , Mr. Barbour has mostly been spared the day - to - day incursion of oil along his state ’s shores .
That has allowed him to promote his bona fides on popular Republican causes ( he remains enthusiastic about offshore drilling , an important source of jobs in his state ) and bogeymen ( White House - backed “ cap and trade ” energy policies ) .
Mr. Barbour has been generally muted in his criticism of BP and was among the first Republicans to object to the Obama administration ’s insistence on a $ 20 billion BP escrow account to settle damage claims .
He has also warned against efforts by the left to turn the spill into a regulatory cause célèbre .

Young ladies , you 're in your teens now and already you have no doubt run into some guys who are being suspiciously nice to you .
Likely you have figured out that in many cases , this has nothing to do with them being nice guys and everything to do with them desperately wanting you to touch their boner .
What you may not realize is that over the next few years , a string of rejections will cause many of these men to start hating you .
Some of them hate you already , because they grew up hating their mothers and it kind of carries over .
Boys are like that .

Hello , my name is JP and I have a problem .
I think that my idea matters .
I think that by keeping it secret , I ’ll be able to develop it into a mega - corp capable of crushing Apple , Microsoft , and Google !
Why do I still suffer from this syndrome ?
Repeat after me : “ My idea sucks , and no one cares about my idea .
Maybe if I bust my ass , I can turn my crappy idea into a decent product that somebody will pay me their lunch money . ”
I know the reality though .
Ideas really are worthless , or maybe they ’re just a multiplier .
Execution is everything .
Let ’s also end this notion that in order to share an idea , we have to get the other party to sign an NDA .
People have requested this of Reflect7 , and I flat out refuse .
Most ideas are lame .
Something along the lines of “ I want to create a social a site like Facebook , but for cats !
Everyone loves kitties !!
LOLZZ ” It opens up an unnecessary potential legal liability .
If your idea is so easy to steal , your competitors will do it once you release it anyway .
Also ,
If you ’re trying to engage in a partnership , you want mercenaries , not missionaries .
A NDA is not a way to start a relationship .
I like what Chris Dixon suggests that you should share your idea with anyone who will listen :
There are lots of benefits to talking to people .
You ’ll get suggestions for improvements .
You ’ll discover flaws and hopefully correct them .
You ’ll learn a lot more about the sector / industry .
You ’ll learn about competitive products that exist or are being built .
You ’ll gauge people ’s excitement level for the product and for various features .
You ’ll refine your sales and investor pitch .
You might even discover your idea is a bad idea and save yourself years of hitting your head against the wall .
In terms of the risk of someone stealing your idea , there are at best a handful of people in the world who might actually drop everything and copy your idea .
First of all , most people will probably think your idea is stupid .
This does not mean your idea is stupid .
In fact , if everyone loves your idea , I might be worried that it ’s not forward thinking enough .
He wrote another post on actually developing these ideas .
But , when it comes down to it , your idea sucks .
Share it with anyone and everyone .
Get feedback .
Your idea sucks , now go do it anyway .

Do n't ask GOP pollster about Brown poll
The public release of a poll intended to convince Scott Brown that it was politically safe to support " do n't ask , do n't tell " has produced a bitter round of recriminations among the pollster , the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign and the Republican consulting firm that commissioned the poll on HRC 's behalf .
The pollster , Neil Newhouse , was hired by the DCI Group — a powerhouse Republican consulting and lobbying firm — to conduct the poll for Brown on the assumption that it would " never see the light of day , " he told POLITICO .
But after Brown voted against repealing " do n't ask , " HRC — DCI 's client — released the poll to the Boston Globe , prompting a furious reaction from the pollster and offering a glimpse into where exactly hired guns draw the ideological line .
" Public Opinion Strategies recently conducted a survey in Massachusetts for DCI which you yesterday released , purportedly as the client of the project and ' straw - buyer ' of the poll , " Newhouse wrote to Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese , claiming he never knew HRC was the client .
" Public Opinion Strategies has never conducted polling for the Human Rights Campaign and never plan to ; further , we have never accepted money from your organization and do n't intend to start now .
This survey was completed for DCI and apparently was conducted under false pretense . "
" Our firm was misled as to the client of this survey and will refuse to accept payment for the survey and assume ownership of the survey and its data , " wrote Newhouse , who also polls for Brown and for former Gov. Mitt Romney , telling POLITICO that he believed that the client was DCI itself , not another group .
The poll found that 77 percent of Massachusetts voters backed repealing the bill and advised that a vote for repeal " would reinforce the positive image he has among those I ’s and D’s who voted for him in January . "
DCI officials did not respond to inquiries about the details of the flap , or whether they believed Newhouse knew the ultimate client .
But the firm took full blame for the conflict .
" When DCI asked Neil Newhouse to do survey work regarding the repeal of ' do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ' we assured Neil his work would remain private .
It did not work out that way , and we regret that outcome , " said a DCI spokesman , Geoffrey Basye .
Newhouse told POLITICO that he is " upset that it was used to try to embarrass our client , Scott Brown — and that somebody decided that even though I was assured by [ DCI Chairman Tom ]
Synhorst that this would never become public information . "
" We would not do work for Human Rights Campaign .
As a Republican pollster , that ’s not an organization we ’d work for , " he said .
But HRC Communications Director Fred Sainz said HRC had never made any effort to disguise that it was the client and accused the pollster of hypocrisy , though he said he did n't have any direct evidence that Newhouse knew HRC was the client .
" I guess it ’s one thing to take gay money when it ’s under the table , but it ’s an entirely different thing when your other client happens to be a contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency , " he said .

A comic appears despite Wes turning into a bat while Tony punched a wizard .
A Pakistan - born American citizen accused of plotting to detonate a car bomb near Times Square pleaded guilty on Monday to the first of a series of charges related to the failed attack , according to published reports .
Faisal Shahzad , a 30 - year - old Connecticut resident , entered a guilty plea on one count , but planned to admit guilt to nine other related charges .
He told the judge his plea was “ guilty and a hundred times more ” and warned of future attacks , according to the Associated Press .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shahzad was indicted last week on the 10 counts , which include conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction .
The former financial analyst for Affinion Group Holdings Inc. allegedly received explosives training from a terror group in Pakistan , but his explosive - packed SUV failed to detonate on May 1 , as it sat in a parking lot near Times Square .
Reports said Shahzad had been put on a no - fly list in the frenzied hours before his arrest , as investigators struggled to close a net after picking up a treasure trove of clues left by the failed attack .
Even so , Shahzad was captured after boarding an Emirates Airlines flight to Pakistan , despite being on the no-fly list .
The plane was headed down the runway when security agents flagged it down , boarded and made the arrest .
In response to the failed bombing , New York City police and the mayor ’s office have argued for a dramatic expansion of the city ’s surveillance grid , which was modeled after the massive spying infrastructure in London .
The plan also calls for private businesses to allow police direct network access to their cameras : a first for the city .

Despite the complete failure of empirical evidence and the actual climate supporting the hypothesis of IPCC Climategate science and its climate models , the world 's " elites " have a very personal , vested interest in maintaining the fear about climate change .
Why 's that ?
Hey , comrade , the gig is good !
" Tony Blair is set to earn millions of pounds advising an American businessman on how to make money from tackling climate change ...
The former prime minister will be paid at least £ 700,000 a year to act as a “ strategic adviser ” to Khosla Ventures , a venture capitalist firm ... the Californian company bankrolls businesses hoping to profit from technology that helps reduce global warming and carbon emissions ...
Mr Blair secured the job thanks to his “ influence ” and high level international contacts , whom he will be expected to lean on to open doors ...
He has told friends he needs £ 5 million a year to fund his lifestyle . "
Why 's that ( number two ) ?
The AGW gig is easier than shooting - fish - in - a - barrel .
" The couple [ Al Gore and his wife ] spent $ 8,875,000 on an ocean - view villa on 1.5 acres with a swimming pool , spa and fountains , a real estate source familiar with the deal confirms .
The Italian - style house has six fireplaces , five bedrooms and nine bathrooms . "
As it is obvious to any person possessing an IQ north of double digits , elites are very concerned ... just not about the climate or warming / cooling .
It 's all about money , material goods , fame and power .
It 's as simple as that .

Early detection is the key to the successful treatment of cancer .
But not every lump turns out to be a malignant tumor .
To find out whether cancerous cells are present , doctors usually conduct a biopsy and examine the removed tissue under the microscope .
This process is not only very stressful for the patient but also highly time consuming .
Research scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems IPMS in Dresden are aiming to considerably speed up cancer diagnosis .
They have developed a microscope head with a diameter of just eight millimeters which can optically resolve and magnify tissue cells measuring just 10 to 20 micrometers .
Fitted in the tip of an endoscope it will be used for in vivo cancer diagnosis , inserted in the body as in a minimally invasive surgical operation .
The scientists envision that the MEMS ( micro- electro - mechanical system ) microscope head will eliminate the need for biopsies .
Diagnosis in real time would enable doctors to decide on the necessary course of treatment more quickly .
» Microscopic image recorders that can be used on endoscopes have not been available up to now .
We have developed the first laser - based sensor for this purpose , « says Dr. Michael Scholles , business unit manager at the IPMS .
» In classic endoscopy using macroscopic imaging , the job can be done by CCD or CMOS image sensors , as used in digital cameras and cellphones .
For endomicroscopy , however , MEMS - based image sensors are highly advantageous because they can magnify even the smallest object fields , such as cells , without the need for a large lens .
We have combined the sensor with a microscanner mirror to achieve the required resolution of 10 micrometers and can therefore massively magnify the tiniest structures . «
But how does the system function ?
The laser itself is located in the operating theater .
The laser light is conducted via a transmitting fiber to the microscanner mirror fitted in the tip of the endoscope .
This deflects the laser beam and illuminates the suspicious tissue specifically .
A glass - fiber bundle in the tip of the endoscope transmits the reflected light to the external sensor , which thus receives a signal containing the image information .
A detector precisely measures the position of the scanner mirror , indicating which area of the scene is being illuminated at the specific point in time .
A two - dimensional image can thus be completely reconstructed by combining the position and image sensor signals .
» An important aspect of the development was to produce a suitable microassembly for the endoscope head .
Here we faced the challenge of making the complete system suitable for installation in the endoscope , and we managed to do it .
In future our microscope head will be produced in large quantities in an automated process for subsequent installation in endoscopes , « explains Scholles .
The expert envisages a wide range of applications for the system : » It could be used not only in medical and biological microscopy but also in technical endoscopy , for instance to examine cavities in buildings or to inspect the insides of engines and turbines . «
The microscope head has already been produced as a demonstrator and can be seen at the Optatec trade show in Frankfurt from June 15 to 18 ( Hall 3 , Stand D50 ) .

Susan Spicer did not intend to be the face of the restaurant rebellion against BP over its role in the Gulf oil spill .
But that ’s what can happen when you file a lawsuit .
Ms. Spicer , long a respected New Orleans chef , spent most of Monday huddled with her lawyers , trying to map out a strategy after word got out that she was suing BP and several other companies on behalf of Gulf restaurant owners and seafood suppliers .
“ I just hope that my motivations will not be misinterpreted , ” she said from her restaurant Bayona in her first interview since the suit was filed Friday .
“ It ’s more about solidarity in this region than about getting my piece of the pie .
I ca n’t say I expect to see a dollar out of this thing .
I am just angry . ”
Ms. Spicer ’s attorney , Serena Pollack , filed the suit in New Orleans federal court late Friday asking that the court grant class - action status for restaurants and seafood sellers who have suffered in the wake of the April 20 drilling rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico .
The lawyers are arguing that Ms. Spicer and other chefs in Louisiana and the region have built a reputation and a business using fresh , local seafood that is specific to the Gulf of Mexico .
Since the oil rig accident , that seafood has either become unavailable or significantly more expensive .
In addition , customers are and will continue to be unwilling to pay higher prices or wo n’t want to eat what is available for fear of contamination from petroleum or the chemicals used to manage the spill , the suit said .
Ms. Spicer decided to step forward not because her restaurant is about to go under but because other businesses are .
“ I really do believe there are people that are certainly more in need than Bayona will be , ” she said , adding that there is plenty of good seafood coming from Lake Pontchartrain and unaffected parts of the shoreline .
But some places are being hit harder than others , she said .
“ We are already seeing casualties right and left , human casualities , business casualties , cultural casualties , ” she said .
Ms. Spicer , whose company is the lead plaintiff , opened Bayona in 1990 and quickly established herself as a chef who respected the New Orleans culinary canon but was not going to be held hostage by it .
At Bayona , she offers global food and serves ahi tuna and Pacific salmon .
But her longtime signature dish is grilled Gulf shrimp and black bean cake , and she usually serves Gulf oysters , often stuffed with Italian sausage , spinach and fennel .
Her recent cookbook , Crescent City Cooking , has dozens of recipes based on Gulf seafood .
Earlier this month she opened Mondo , a casual , pan-cultural restaurant that is as likely to serve plantains as beignets .
She has also recently gained some popular cultural currency , both as a Top Chef judge and as the inspiration for the chef in the HBO series Treme who struggles to hold onto her restaurant in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
Ms. Spicer is a culinary consultant for the show .
Ms. Spicer said she was taken aback by the attention the suit is getting , particularly from bloggers and journalists who have argued that she does n’t serve that much local seafood or that she is in it for the money .
“ I was a little blindsided by all of this , ” she said .
“ But I think it needs to be done and I hope more people will join . ”
It ’s not clear how wide - ranging support for the suit will be .
Frank Brigtsen , who runs two restaurants , would not comment on the suit .
Emeril Lagasse said he was not joining at this time .
“ We are continuing to closely monitor the situation and the oil leak ’s impact on Emeril ’s restaurant business , ” Jeff Hinson , Mr. Lagasse ’s public relations manager , wrote in an e-mail message to the Times .
But the movement was getting some support from smaller businesses .
Franky and Johnny ’s , a neighborhood po ’ boy and seafood restaurant , has signed on .
And JoAnn Clevenger , who for nearly 30 years has run the Upperline Restaurant , plans to jump in , too .
She was n’t surprised larger restaurants were n’t .
“ Susan is an entrepreneurial chef .
She is not big business like Emeril .
For her and for other owner - operated businesses , what else are we going to do ? ” she said .
After Hurricane Katrina , small business owners felt like they could pick up the pieces , rebuild and pitch in to help others .
That ’s not the case with the oil spill .
“ That can - do spirit has been quashed , ” she said .
“ But what Susan is doing can give us that spirit back . ”
The suit is designed to include restaurant owners and retailers of seafood that is marketed and sold as local or from Louisiana or the Gulf of Mexico .
That means the suit could extend to chefs and seafood shops in all five Gulf states , some of whom have already filed separate suits .
The next step is a hearing scheduled for July 27 , when a federal panel of judges meets in Boise , Idaho , to decide whether all the claims relating to the oil spill will be consolidated and put into the hands of a special master .
The panel is also expected to decide where litigation about the oil spill will be held if it is consolidated .
Plaintiffs are fighting to keep it from being consolidated in Houston , where many oil companies are headquartered .
AN 89 - year - old great - grandfather got the shock of his life when he used the internet to try to find the answer to a crossword clue – only for pages of X - rated pornographic images to pop up on his screen .
Crossword fan Jack Sedgewick , from Roman Road , Basingstoke , was trying to find the answer to a difficult clue in The Sunday Express magazine crossword , and thought he would use the web for help .
But when he typed the two words into search engine Yahoo , rather than finding the answer , he was instead left disgusted by the images that came up on his PC .
The former engineer said : “ It has certainly shaken me .
It ’s terrifying to think that children could be searching other such innocent words and have this come up instead . ”
He tried using just one of the words to see if it made a difference , but was bombarded with even more disturbing images .
The grandfather of four , who only started using the internet for help with crosswords in the past few months , eventually found the correct answer of Onager , which is a wild Asian donkey .
But he has been left disgusted by his original findings , discovering a rather different kind of “ Asian ass ” than the crossword clue was asking for .
Jack said : “ I was so annoyed because as soon as I found out the answer I thought : ‘ I should have known that ’. ”
Elite to seek reassurances from Spanish leaders that ultimate agenda for global currency will not be derailed
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , June 2 , 2010
The presence of Spain ’s heavyweight political and financial leaders at this year ’s Bilderberg conference is not just because the secretive annual confab is taking place just outside Barcelona – it ’s because the Bilderberg elitists are panic stricken at the possibility that their embryonic global currency – the euro – could be heading for total collapse .
Highlighting once again how increased exposure of Bilderberg and their motives on behalf of activists over recent years has contributed towards the agenda becoming an open conspiracy , the London Times , perhaps the biggest establishment newspaper in the world alongside the New York Times and the Washington Post , was the first mainstream publication to break the silence on hundreds of global power brokers meeting in secret at the Hotel Dolce resort in Sitges over the next few days , with a report entitled Secretive Bilderberg Club ready for protests .
For the Times to name the most influential figures attending the event and reveal what they will discuss is a far cry from how the corporate media treated Bilderberg in the past , when they were loathe to even acknowledge its existence .
According to the report , David Rockefeller and his colleagues will be graced with the presence of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , who will give the opening address , as well as Miguel Angel Moratinos , the Spanish Foreign Minister , and Pedro Solbes , Spain ’s former Economy Minister .
One of the primary topics of conversation will be “ the future of the euro ” .
These three men will undoubtedly inform their globalist masters as to whether or not Spain is likely to go the same way as Greece , which if it happens would probably be the death knell for the euro single currency , and in turn a hammer blow to long term plans to implement a global currency , which IMF chief and BIlderberg member Dominique Strauss - Kahn recently told a gathering of elitists in Zurich was one of the prizes the elite wanted to plunder from exploiting the economic crisis .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Spain ’s economy is in tatters not only because of the global economic meltdown , but because of the country ’s disastrous efforts to implement the “ green economy ” that is mandated as part of what EU Commission chief and prominent Bilderberger Jose Manuel Barroso called the “ post - industrial revolution ” .
The impact of this deliberate agenda to lower living standards in the west is being felt most painfully in Spain , where the unemployment rate is around 18 per cent as a result of 2.2 jobs being lost for every “ green ” job created .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A newly leaked internal document from Spain ’s Zapatero administration outlines how Spain ’s “ green economy initiatives ” have been a financial disaster .
The report suggests that the real rate of job losses as a result of “ green ” policies is in actual fact worse than 2.2 jobs lost for every one gained , and that the “ green economy ” must be abandoned if the country is to save itself from economic ruin .
If Spain goes down then so does the euro , a scenario that petrifies Bilderbergers whose ultimate dream of a one world currency rests in shoring up confidence in the euro , to the point where the European Central Bank now routinely manipulates and intervenes in the forex markets on a weekly basis in an effort to prop up the ailing single currency .
Some countries are n’t convinced and are already running for the exit door , with Iran and some Gulf states dumping the euro and buying gold bullion .
In bailing out Greece the European Union broke the terms of its own Maastricht Treaty , and in doing so exposed the fundamental flaw of any overcentralized political or financial power structure – that it is only as strong as its weakest member .
This is why Bilderberg are panicking over the fate of the euro and looking towards Spain ’s political leadership for some kind of reassurance that everything is going to be OK .
If the euro were to go under , it would expose the inherent weakness of continental monetary unions and all but derail the wider agenda for a one world currency .
As the Guardian ’s Charlie Skelton points out , Spain will be hoping that the arrival of Bilderberg does n’t herald the same fate suffered by the last country to host the globalist summit – in 2009 the elite gathered in Greece and within 12 months the country was bankrupt and its people were rioting on the streets .
Bilderberg ’s 2010 conference runs from tomorrow until Sunday .

A fresh look at programming with names and binders ( accepted to ICFP 2010 )
Nicolas Pouillard and François Pottier
Abstract
A wide range of computer programs , including compilers and theorem provers , manipulate data structures that involve names and binding .
However , the design of programming idioms which allow performing these manipulations in a safe and natural style has , to a large extent , remained elusive .
In this paper , we present a novel approach to the problem .
Our proposal can be viewed either as a programming language design or as a library : in fact , it is currently implemented within Agda .
It provides a safe and expressive means of programming with names and binders .
It is abstract enough to support multiple concrete implementations : we present one in nominal style and one in de Bruijn style .
We use logical relations to prove that ``well - typed programs do not mix names with different scope ' ' .
We exhibit an adequate encoding of Pitts - style nominal terms into our system .
A growing number of scientists are going where politicians fear to tread by calling for a wider public debate on the sensitive issue of the global human population , which is set to rise from the present 6.8 billion to perhaps 9 billion by 2050 .
Lord Rees , the president of the Royal Society , brought the subject up in his excellent Reith Lectures ; Sir David Attenborough has become a champion of those who believe population has been relegated as an environmental issue ; and more recently Professor Aubrey Manning , presenter of the BBC's Earth Story , has stated that the sheer number of humans on the planet is the greatest menace the world faces .
Scientists have a reputation for saying things as they are , not as they should be .
Politicians , forever looking for short - term solutions to keep them in office , do not , as a rule , look further than the middle distance .
Yet population is one of those over - the - horizon threats without enemies , as Lord Rees put it .
It is a disaster in slow motion , and all politicians seem to do is provide the sort of platitudes articulated by Michael Heseltine , who recently fielded a question on Radio 4 by saying that the problems associated with population never turn out to be as bad as predicted – which is probably true if you can enjoy your own Oxfordshire arboretum .
No doubt Heseltine and his fellow politicians who are in favour of doing nothing about population will cite the words of John P Holdren , President Obama 's science adviser , who wrote these words in 1969 when he was a young ecologist :
" If the population control measures are not initiated immediately , and effectively , all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come . "
Misery , what misery ?
You can of course imagine the political class arguing that scientists have consistently got it wrong about overpopulation .
But the next 40 years are going to be very different to the previous 40 years , and many scientists fear that there will indeed be extreme misery to come if the world does not take population more seriously .
The facts speak for themselves .
The UN estimates that the global population will rise from 6.8 billion in 2009 to 8.3 billion by 2030 , with much of the increase in the poorest countries , notably sub-Saharan Africa , which is set for a 51 per cent increase in the same period – four times that of the UK .
World food production will have to increase by 50 per cent to meet rising demand ; water availability will have to increase by 30 per cent ; and global energy demands by 50 per cent .
Politicians may think that science and technology will provide what is needed , as it has done in the past at a cost to the environment , but many scientists are not so sure .
Holdren himself came up with a simple equation to try to quantify the sustainability of a given population level : I=PxAxT – where I represents the impact on the environment , P the population size , A the affluence or level of consumption per head , and T the technology that determines how efficiently resources are used .
The equation simply says that the impact on the environment is a factor of the number of people , how much they consume and how efficient the consumption is .
It is a crude equation , but the aim was to show how we can limit the impact on the environment by intervening at any of these three levels .
What is clear is that a continuing increase in human numbers makes everything else we do to reach sustainability far more difficult .
As David Attenborough says : " I 've never seen a problem that would n't be easier to solve with fewer people , or harder , and ultimately impossible , with more . "
Just in case anyone thinks that this is just a problem for poor countries in Africa , they should read last week 's report on population by Forum for the Future .
Official statistics show that the UK population grew by 2 million between 2001 and 2008 , its fastest rate of growth since the post - war ' baby boom ' .
Over the period from 2008 to 2033 , the British population is set to grow from 61.4 m to 71.6 m , with 2029 being the year when there will be 70 million people living officially in Britain – there could be another 1 million or so living here illegally .
That means we will have to accommodate another city the size of Bristol every year .
About two thirds of this projected increase is expected to be either directly or indirectly due to future migration , according to Forum for the Future .
Politicians should be forced to debate this issue , rather than relying on people being cowed by suggestions that to do so is somehow pandering to illiberal , xenophobic and racist elements who have hijacked the subject for their own nefarious ends .

Course Outline
a collection of curriculum resources for secondary school educators who want to help students explore the literary phenomenon that is J.R.R. Tolkien .
These resources are grouped into nine thematic units focused on Tolkien 's two most famous works : The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings .
Each unit was designed to last one week , but we have included additional materials for teachers who wish to explore certain themes in depth .
With a slight change in emphasis , these resources can be adapted to existing courses in fantasy literature , British literature , mythology , and European history .
The Lord of the Rings is arguably the greatest work of imaginative literature ever created by a single author .
In formulating the following behavioral objectives , we tried to keep Tolkien 's artistic achievement always in mind .
As the course progresses , the student should be able to : Comprehend The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings at the level of plot , character , setting , and idea . 
Appreciate the astonishingly complex world in which Tolkien 's novels unfold .
Think critically and write clearly about Tolkien 's themes , with special emphasis on their contemporary relevance .
Understand how Tolkien 's fiction is informed by many literary and linguistic traditions , as well as by philosophical , psychological , sociological , and political issues that reverberate through the entire secondary school curriculum .
To help you and your students meet these objectives , we have furnished each unit with eight elements :
The heart of any given unit resides in the discussion topics and the suggested activities .
In each case , the first several topics and projects connect most directly to the learning goals .
The remaining ideas partake more of enrichment , but feel free to mix and match these materials to fit your specific curriculum needs .
Beyond the preliminary quizzes , the primary evaluation tool is the student 's own writing .
Each class member should keep a daily journal , either in a notebook or on - line , to record questions about the readings , reactions to the discussions , and responses to the activities .

Scientists creating advanced computer simulation of nuclear reactor
Oak Ridge National Lab leads effort using world 's fastest supercomputers to create virtual reactor
A team of four Energy Department national laboratories , three universities and three energy companies will receive up to $ 122 million over the next five years to develop a highly accurate computer simulation of a light water nuclear reactor .
The Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors ( CASL ) , led by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , is the first of three Energy Innovation Hubs expected to be announced this year by DOE as part of a plan to increase federal research and development spending on clean energy .
The consortium ’s goal is to create a virtual reactor that can be used to improve the performance and safety of existing reactors and to help design the next generation .
“ Before you go testing a new reactor design , you need to have that design validated against existing reactors , ” said Douglas Kothe , director of science at Oak Ridge ’s National Center for Computational Sciences and director of the consortium .
“ What we are building is a modern , high - fidelity simulation tool , rigorously validated , to push the state of the art . ”
To simulate the complex physics and chemistry of the reactor core , the consortium will have access to three of the most powerful supercomputers in the world : Jaguar , a 2,331 trillion - operations - per- second Cray computer and Kraken , a 1,029 trillion - operations - per- second Cray computer , both at Oak Ridge , and Roadrunner , a 1,375 trillion - operations - per- second IBM computer at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
At the time CASL made its funding proposals , these were the three fastest supercomputers in the world , as determined in the TOP 500 biannual list .
But in the most recent list released last week , China ’s Nebulae - Dawning supercomputer entered the rankings in the number two spot , just behind Jaguar .
Core members of CASL are Oak Ridge , Los Alamos , Idaho and Sandia national naboratories ; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the University of Michigan , and North Carolina State University ; and the Electric Power Research Institute , the Tennessee Valley Authority , and the Westinghouse Electric Co . A dozen other universities , companies and organizations in this country and in Europe also are contributing to the program .
CASL is DOE ’s Nuclear Energy Innovation Hub , an effort to use computer modeling and simulation to advance reactor design and engineering .
It will receive up to $ 22 million this fiscal year and up to $ 25 million each of the next four years of the program .
The program could be extended for another five years .
Other innovation hubs expected to be announced this year will focus on solar energy and on retrofitting existing structures to improve energy efficiency .
Most of the country ’s 140 active reactors are second - generation facilities , some of which have been in operation for 40 years or more .
A number of proposals have been made for third - generation designs .
Accurate modeling and simulation could help not only in development of those designs , but also could improve operation of current facilities , which have to operate within conservative parameters because of the lack of detailed understanding of core conditions in a reactor .
Better understanding could enable current reactors to safely remain in operation longer , make more efficient use of nuclear fuel and produce less waste , and increase power output .
The current fleet of reactors has been able to increase output by about six gigawatts by improving efficiencies , Kothe said .
“ We think that there is five or six , or even 10 or 20 additional gigawatts out there in the existing fleet , ” which would be the equivalent of adding another five or 10 reactors .
DOE has a long history of modeling nuclear reactions .
The need to simulate nuclear explosions to take the place of live weapons testing is one of the reasons the department ’s national labs have developed the world ’s fastest supercomputers .
There is a large existing body of software that will be used in creating the virtual reactor , Kothe said .
“ By no means does it make sense to start from scratch , ” he said .
“ There is too much that has been done in the past 40 or 50 years .
We have good software to start with . ”
The consortium ’s first task will be to take existing code that models a handful of phenomena and begin integrating it to enable more complex simulation .
“ The key is to simulate multiple simultaneous phenomena that are non-linear and interactive , ” he said .
The consortium hopes to release the first version of the virtual reactor this year and to improve it over the next four years .
As we said , it 's shockingly thin .
The screen is truly outrageous -- you basically cannot see pixels on it .
We 're not being hyperbolic when we say it 's easily the best looking mobile phone screen we 've ever laid eyes on .
The build quality is really solid .
The home button feels much snappier , and on the whole it just feels like a tightly - packed device , but it 's not heavy .
The side buttons are really nice and clicky .
iOS 4 is very familiar -- there 's not a lot added to fit and finish .
The general speed of the whole OS is way snappier .
The camera app in particular is noticeably faster -- shots get snapped in an instant .
We 've just gotten some face time ( ha ha ! ) with the new iPhone 4 , and let 's just say this : it 's incredibly sexy .
We 'll hand it to Apple , the phone is so thin it 's kind of mind - boggling .
The 3GS by comparison looks bloated .
Feast your eyes on the pics below , and check out the FaceTime video demo after the break !
Oh , and special thanks to hand models Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg .
Some takeaways about the device : More pics !
We 've also thrown in a video demo of the iPhone 4 running its FaceTime video chat app .

That sound .
Now , if you happen to like the vuvuzela , if you ’re feeling the South African Gees ( spirit ) , maybe you can follow these instructions to make the horns even louder .

Are you a World Cup fan annoyed by the constant sound of the South African vuvuzela horn ?
Wish you could remove that sound from your World Cup viewing experience ?
Do you want to learn a little bit about powerful modular effects routing can be on Linux ?
Either ?
Both ?
Call it “ football ” ?
“ Soccer ” ?
Any way round , we ’ve got you covered .
( Disclaimer : I have nothing in particular against the vuvuzela .
But here you go , anyway . )
Updated : Via comments , here ’s a Mac plug - in for filtering the horn , also a notch filter , and a sign that this is getting a little carried away .
( Mostly , I think this is a useful way to learn about JACK , something you can use after the World Cup .
But knowing football fans , “ after the World Cup ” may not be a phrase with any meaning at the moment . )
JACK is a powerful audio API on Linux , and thanks to rich application support for the tool , you can route sound arbitrarily between software tools , making everything on your computer into a kind of virtual studio .
( Mac users should check out the excellent JACK OS X implementation . )
Felix Kaechele , a German - based Fedora community member and Fedora Ambassador , uses JACK to filter out sound from his live World Cup feed .
If you ’re curious about how JACK works and how to add effects to your system ( or record a system audio feed , etc. ) , this is the way to go .
The trick here is that PulseAudio , the default sound API on Linux , actually gets routed right into JACK .
Read the full instructions here :
Vuvuzela Filter using Fedora [ Felix ’ Blog ]
JACK lets you patch software together for adding effects .
Via Felix ’ tutorial , the simple routing from the system right into a rack of effects .
Fedora is a superb distribution , and intelligent JACK packaging is a particular strong suit .
( Check out the Planet CCRMA project for more . )
But part of the strength of Linux is that it is open , so you ’ll find these same instructions work on other distributions .
In fact , so long as you replace “ yum install ” with “ apt - get install ” , you ’ll find most of these packages have the same name .
( Only “ ladspa - swh - plugins ” is missing on Ubuntu , though there are other LADSPA plugs available . )
Note that on vanilla Ubuntu , I did need to do one extra step when setting up JACK .
When you launch , JACK will actually advise you to do so right in the message window , but here it is , as a reminder :
Please check your /etc/ security / limits.conf for the following lines
and correct / add them :
@audio – rtprio 100
@audio – nice - 10
After applying these changes , please re-login in order for them to take effect .
These steps tweak real - time performance for better JACK sound results .
Also , I generally like to launch JACK Control with the following command , in order to disable PulseAudio :
pasuspender qjackctl
But in this event , you ’d actually install the Pulse module and route Pulse into JACK , as in the instructions .
Setting up Ubuntu is a topic for another article , but there ’s a preview .
But the musical applications here should be clear : JACK makes it easy to set up a modular rig .
Want to add effects to a Pd patch ?
Record audio from a system application for sampling ?
Route together some effects to make a virtual stompbox rig for your guitar ?
Having JACK is a bit like having an extensive patch bay for software .
Let us know how these tips work out for you , or if you ’ve got ideas of your own .
( And if someone wants to do a Mac version of the tutorial , let us know ! )

The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in The Hague ruled Thursday that Kosovo ’s declaration of independence in February 2008 did not violate international law .
Timeline of key events in Kosovo history 1389 : The battle of Kosovo that leads to 500 - years of Turkish Ottoman rule .
This war prompted the mass exodus of Christian Serbs which was referenced by 20th Serbian leaders as the 1990s Yugoslav war began .
1912 : Serbia regains control of Kosovo from the Turks .
1946 : Kosovo becomes is absorbed into the Yugoslav federation .

1999 : Serbian forces withdraw from Kosovo after weeks of heavy air attack from NATO forces .
2008 : Kosovo declares independence
The opinion from the United Nations ’ highest court is non-binding and does not grant the breakaway region formal independence .
The court said there is nothing in international law that prohibits declarations of independence and , as such , Kosovo 's separatist vote “ did not violate general international law . ''
Within hours of the ruling , Serbia denounced the court 's opinion and said it would never deal with Kosovo as an independent state .
Prior to Thursday 's ruling , Serbian Foreign Minister warned that if Kosovo 's " secession " drive is successful then " no frontier in the world or in the region would be safe , " according to the Tanjug news agency .
To achieve full statehood and independence , the Kosovo independence initiative will now move to the UN General Assembly where it must secure recognition from at least 100 countries before full statehood can be established .
Currently , Kosovo 's statehood is recognised by 69 countries .
That could prove to be a difficult challenge , as many of the UN ’s largest countries are facing their own secession movements and are unlikely to favour the court ’s opinion on Kosovo .
Russia , Spain , India and China are all confronting their own internal separatist movements and have publicly stated their opposition to Kosovo ’s independence .

GOP to attack Kagan 's gun control work for Clinton
Get ready for the next Republican attack line on Elena Kagan : 1990s gun control issues .
Kagan had a hand in multiple gun control measures during her stint in the Clinton administration , according to info from newly released Clinton library documents that was sent my way -- and I 'm told Republicans will grab on to the revelations to paint her as hostile to the Second Amendment .
But a high profile member of the Clinton administration , in an interview with me , dismissed the notion that her work on these issues suggests she 's hostile to gun rights .
As deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council under Bill Clinton , Kagan supervised work implementing the Brady law , which implemented a background check system , info from the newly released docs show .
Kagan also worked on a 1997 executive order related to the assault weapons ban -- an order that updated an earlier one prohibiting the importation of firearms not usually used for sporting purposes .
And she worked on various Clinton - era poroposals to strengthen regulation of child - safety locks and to toughen up restrictions on adults from making guns too readily available to children .
Republicans are going to grab onto these issues to raise questions about her commitment to the Second Amendment , I 'm told .
But Bruce Reed , who worked directly on these issues with Kagan , argues in an interview that she 's in no way hostile to the Second Amendment .
" In all these cases , Clinton had already settled views on these questions , " Reed tells me .
" Our job was to make sure the government 's policy reflected what he wanted .
He 'd already made up his mind on most of these contentious issues . "
Reed adds that the policies Kagan did help draft had bipartisan support and were n't even particularly controversial .
" We were facing a Republican Congress , " Reed says .
" The debates we had were kind of at the 50 yard line . "
Indeed , the Republican plan to revive 1990s - era arguments about gun control seems more about riling up the base and appearing to take a stand against Kagan , and does n't seem likely to create any real problems for Kagan with the mainstream .

MONTERREY , N.L. —
La violencia e inseguridad generadas por las disputas de los cárteles en , provocarán este año una caída de 50 % en la inversión privada , estimó ayer la Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana ( Coparmex ) .
El director del organismo en el estado , José Mario Garza Benavides , afirmó que en la actualidad prevalece una gran descoordinación entre las corporaciones policiales estatales , federales y municipales , para enfrentar a la delincuencia en la entidad .
Manifestó que Nuevo León es líder en actos delictivos , como robo , secuestro y la extorsión .
Estos delitos , dijo , se suman a los que genera la presencia de la delincuencia organizada , “ donde se están disputando los cárteles la plaza de Monterrey ” .
El líder empresarial advirtió que este indicador de inseguridad desincentiva las inversiones y además complica la recuperación de los empleos .
Enfatizó que “ hay inversiones frenadas por este problema , el año pasado con respecto al anterior bajó 50 % la inversión , y hoy las tasas de empleo son históricas , no sobrepasan 7 % ” .
Garza Benavides afirmó que “ creemos que este 2010 va a ser igual o más grave que el año pasado ” en materia de inversiones y de generación de empleos .
Manifestó que también ven con preocupación el aspecto del mando único de policía , puesto que la depuración policial en el estado ha fracasado .
“ Lo que nos preocupa son los tiempos en los cuales se pueden implementar este proyecto para garantizar la seguridad ” , dijo
El directivo de Coparmex sostuvo que “ vemos que existe gran descoordinación entre el nivel federal , estatal y el municipal , en el tema de las policías ” .
Las corporaciones policiales , dijo , no han logrado establecer una efectiva coordinación y , por ende , han aumentado los delitos .
Prueba de ello , añadió , es que Nuevo León está liderando hoy el robo de autos .

Supply of Apple 's existing Mac mini lineup has become increasingly constrained over the past two weeks as the company prepares to introduce refreshed models that may serve as a harbinger for some new I /O technology on the Mac .
The shortage has been verified four times over by AppleInsider , which has received numerous reports that suggest the constraints are indicative of new models on the horizon , rather than intermittent delays resulting from the onset of the back - to - school buying season , which sometimes sees Apple curb the flow of Macs to its distribution channels in favor of filling large orders to universities .
For example , one buyer for a higher - ed institution placed a bulk order for Mac minis two weeks ago through the school 's Apple rep , noting that receipt of the machines was required by June 1 .
Although the Apple representative initially indicated that the delivery date would not be a problem , the buyer last week saw his ETA pushed out from 1 - 3 business days to a definitive date of June 14 .
" Every time this has happened in years past , it means that the item we ordered would be revised , " the buyer told AppleInsider .
Meanwhile , another Mac consultant serving as a buyer for a separate firm ran into similar problems while attempting to secure some high - end Mac minis .
This person was informed by his supplier that the model was completely out of stock at the distributor , which had no ETA from Apple on when restocking would occur .
Similarly , a third person who regularly purchases Mac minis in bulk directly through the Mac maker was advised by his Apple contacts to only submit his latest order for what he absolutely needed " for the next few weeks , " serving as yet another hint that the days are numbered for existing models .
Those reports of Mac mini shortages were further corroborated by AppleInsider 's own routine checks while updating its Mac Pricing Guide .
As of this week , roughly half of the resellers who maintain a seat in the pricing guide began reflecting no inventory of either current Mac mini configuration and are recommending that customers call in to check on availability .
Calls to these resellers suggest new orders wo n't be filled until next week at the earliest .
All of these findings bear all the telltale signs that Apple is ramping down production of existing Mac minis and preparing its distribution for refreshed models .
In March , AppleInsider exclusively reported that next - generation Mac minis making their way through the Cupertino - based company 's verification tests were seen with an HDMI port in place of the existing model 's DVI port .
Apple 's existing Mac mini offers users the choice of DVI or mini DisplayPort for video output .
At least one of the Mac mini prototypes described by those privy to the hardware was said to include Nvidia 's MCP89 chipset , which is the successor to the existing MCP79 ( or GeForce 9400 M ) chipset found alongside Intel 's Core 2 Duo processors across the majority of Apple 's 2009 Mac product line .
Both tips came by way of the same people who accurately predicted in February that Apple was about to introduce advanced automatic graphics switching on its professional MacBook Pro line — a prediction which panned out when the company unveiled new models in April .
An unannounced version of the Mac mini has been spotted with an HDMI connector instead of a DVI .
Republicans are “ shamelessly ” defending and “ trying to reward ” the petroleum industry even with “ thousands of barrels of oil still gushing into the Gulf , ” a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) claims in a press release sent to RAW STORY .
“ If weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve learned one thing in recent months , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s that whenever thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a special interest with billions of dollars in profits at stake , we can count on Republicans to rush to their defense , ” Reid spokesman Jim Manley said in the statement .
“ You can set your watch by it . ”

The statement continues ,
Today , with thousands of barrels of oil still gushing into the Gulf , Republicans are shamelessly protecting oil companies from accountability for their greed , recklessness and negligence .
Not only are Republicans trying to block Democratic efforts to ensure that oil companies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not taxpayers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pay for the damage they cause , theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re actually trying to reward oil companies with a $ 47 billion giveaway .
And the Republican energy Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœplanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ released earlier this week is a grab bag for oil companies that would continue the same flawed energy strategy that led to the environmental and economic disaster in the Gulf .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The American people would be a lot better off if Republicans spent their time working with Democrats to hold BP accountable and ensuring that a disaster like this never happens again , instead of repeatedly protecting Big Oil and every other corporate special interest under the sun .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
On the other side , commentators have drawn parallels between Obama ’s handling of the slick , and his predecessor George W. Bush ’s botched management of Hurricane Katrina that devastated the same coastline in 2005 .
Political warning signs over the disaster are proliferating .
A recent CBS News poll showed only thirty - eight percent of Americans approve of the way the administration is dealing with the spill .
A Washington Post / ABC survey revealed more Americans disapprove of Obama ’s response to the oil spill than disapprove of Bush ’s Katrina performance .

Although Obama has been to the Gulf three times since the April 20 rig explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in US history , some critics charge he has been slow to lead .
But he rejected that criticism in the interview taped Monday , telling NBC that “ what I do have is dedication and commitment to make sure that people affected by this are going to get the best possible service from me . ”
And Obama said he is not focused on whether or not the disaster leaves him politically damaged .

“ I ’m not concerned about my politics right now .
What I ’m concerned about is what ’s happening in the Gulf . ”

CNN 's woes are not particularly surprising .
They have utterly failed to define themselves in this era of advocacy journalism .
Their approach to a middleground , news - centric broadcast is admirable , but poorly implemented .
If they were truly interested in focusing on straight news , they would abandon the pretense of balancing every story on the basis of partisanship and instead balance it on the basis of truth .
In other words , stop booking liars just to have a counter - argument .
If one guest says the moon is a barren , rocky satellite , you do not need an opposing guest to assert that it 's lime Jello .
Or if you do host the lime Jello spokesman , at least offer some post - debate analysis that makes it clear that the Jello argument is known to be false .
MSNBC has benefited in an ironic way by not having had a meteoric rise .
Their numbers have been depressed by poor cable coverage and placement on premium tiers .
As a result , they have had less distance to fall .
Their performance appears to be better on a relative basis simply by maintaining a steady course .
More surprising is the precipitous drop at Fox News .
They have been enjoying a surge in the past few years , even when their competition was hurting .
For them to get hit so hard this quarter is a significant development .
Fox has relied upon a fierce sense of loyalty on the part of their viewers to prop up their ratings .
I have described it as something of cult ( the Cult of Foxonality ) wherein
Fox viewers are actually more devoted to the network than to any political party of philosophy .
The ratings this quarter suggest that the hold that Fox has had on its audience is weakening .
As evidence of Fox 's diminishing influence , take a look at their biggest star , Glenn Beck .
He has lost fully one third of his audience since the beginning of the year .
Apparently people are tiring of his redundant , hyperbolic screeds pronouncing that half of the Obama administration are communists and the other half are Satanists .
He may also have lost viewers when he called the President a racist and when he insulted Christians by warning them to flee their church if it practiced social justice .
Beck has other problems as well .
He has undoubtedly been hurt by an advertiser boycott that has seen a couple of hundred advertisers swear off his program .
In the UK he is airing with no advertisers at all .
In this environment , how long can Fox News justify keeping him on the schedule ?
They waved off the ad boycott by bragging about his ratings .
With neither ads nor viewers , the only thing they have left is an unpopular clown act that is descending further into televangelism with every episode .
The dilemma for Fox News is complicated .
From the start they have been on a mission to advance the conservative philosophy of their owner , Rupert Murdoch , and his henchman , Roger Ailes .
Unfortunately for them , they have failed miserably in that regard .
They threw everything they had at the Democrats and still lost control of Congress in 2006 , lost the White House in 2008 , and lost the health care debate in 2010 .
Despite their ratings dominance they have not been able to convert it to their electoral advantage .
What happens when their ratings dominance is gone ?
The battle within the Fox executive suites will be one that pits the accountants against the ideologues .
And let 's face it , in the rarefied air of Fox News , the accountants are toast .
My money is on Fox News doubling down and expanding their partisan rhetoric .
That 's what they 've done in the past .
In the months leading up to and following the Obama victory in 2008 , Fox did n't bother to recognize a national trend .
Instead , they fortified their conservative flank by signing new long - term contracts with Ailes , Bill O'Reilly , and Sean Hannity .
They axed Hannity 's foil , Alan Colmes .
They hired reinforcements like Beck , Mike Huckabee , Karl Rove , Dana Perino , Judith Miller , and Sarah Palin .
They are not the sort of competitors that back down in the face of adversity - or reason .
If Fox does escalate the wingnut war , they are making a poor bet .
They already own the franchise on rightist zealots and are unlikely to gain viewers in that demographic .
More likely they can expect to see their ratings decline further .
Americans are sick of the divisive ravings of partisan shills who have to resort to making things up in order to sway the debate .
The good news is that since the audience for Fox News has declined , the collective IQ of the country has risen .
OK , I made that up , but it seems entirely plausible .
Fox
News viewers have been shown to be notably less informed , or more misinformed , than the viewers of other networks or the public at large .
So it stands to reason that the fewer people infected with Fox lies , the more intelligent we are as a nation .
And going forward that can only be a boon to the development of public policy and to democracy itself .

A unit in this building had its door kicked in .
A warrant was left on the kitchen table .
Occupants of the appartment are believed arrested
Three house where G20 protesters have been staying were raided last night ; activists staying at the houses were arrested .
Six or more arrest warrants were issued and at least four of the people named in the warrants have been arrested and charged with conspiracy .
" The people arrested were involved in Indigenous sovereignty organizing , environmental organizing , and anti poverty organizing , " said Mac Scott , a member of the Movement Defence Committee , which provides legal support for activists .
They " believe this is an abrogation of Section 2 of the [ Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom ] , " which guarantees Candians ' fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression , freedom of peaceful assembly , freedom of association and freedom of thought .
Police arrived at a house where 15 activists were staying at approximately 4:45 am .
" They did not have a warrant , we asked for a warrant .
They asked for identification , they asked us questions , we refused .
People were detained , people asked to call legal council .
We were refused to be allowed to call legal council , " said Niki Thorne , a resident of the house .
Even when a warrant was later provided , those being arrested were not allowed to fully read the warrant before it was taken away from them .
" They were kicking people out of bed , kicking pople awake , " she added .
" I was in a tent in the backyard .
We got woken up by two cops and put in cuffs , and there were probably at least six or eight police in the house , " said Marya Folinsbee , who was staying at the house and is a friend of the man who was arrested .
" They were trying to identify people .
They had a big stack of papers with names and face of activists , some were organizers and some were people just doing child care for the protests . "
The upstairs neighbours , a family with a young baby , were also visited by police .
" The neighbours who were not connected to the protest had a gun held to his head when he woke up .
It 's so fucked it 's so fucked , " said an shaken Folinsbee .
" They put neighbours who lived in the building in cuffs . "
One of the activists staying in the house was taken in his underwear into a paddy wagon waiting outside .
The others in the house gathered on the front porch and sang loudly so that he could hear .
Another house had its door kicked in and a warrant left on the table .
Two activists who live in the house have been arrested and a third person staying at the house was also been arrested , according to sources at the Toronto Community Mobilization Network .
Another unit in the same building also had it door kicked in .
Two other activists have been informed that there are warrants out for their arrest , and it is believed that they will be turning themselves in to police .
According to a tweet from the Movement Defence Committee the arrests were of " key organizers . "
" We have a message to all those today : rights have never been granted or given , they have won , " said Scott on behalf of the Movement Defence Committee .
Supporters of those arrested will gather outside the Toronto Film Studios starting at noon to provide solidarity .
The film studios have been converted into a temporary jail .
They are located at 629 Eastern Ave .
So far in this series we ’ve focused on a new way of understanding diabesity as an autoimmune , inflammatory disorder , and we ’ve looked in a general way at the underlying mechanisms ( inflammation , genetics , environmental triggers and leaky gut ) that contribute to diabesity .
Now that we ’ve laid that foundation , we ’re going to take a closer look at some of those mechanisms .
In this article , we ’ll discuss the three major dietary toxins that trigger diabesity :
Cereal grains ( especially refined flour )
Omega - 6 industrial seed oils ( corn , cottonseed , safflower , soybean , etc. )
Fructose ( especially high - fructose corn syrup )
CNA stands for Certified Nursing Assistant , pertaining to someone who makes a living by working with nurses , physicians , and other medical professionals in providing patients the health care they need .
As an assistant , he or she is under the watch of a Licensed Nurse and plays a vital role in most medical teams .
Becoming a CNA in USA requires obtaining a desire to help those who are disadvantaged , elderly , and unable to care for themselves .
It also requires obtaining a formal CNA education via a State approves CNA training program .
Every state has its own various requirements and demands pertaining to becoming a CNA .
There are many programs within each state to choose from , and each program also has its own requirements as well .
Read on for more detailed , in depth information as to how to become a CNA .
Realizing you want to help people who are otherwise helpless on their own is the first step in becoming a CNA .
Feeling compelled to do something to enrich the lives of others is a calling not everyone gets , and not everyone is cut out for the job , either .
If you feel your true life calling is to be a caretaker for those who cannot care for themselves on a daily basis , becoming a CNA by taking cna classes is probably perfect for you .
Researching the best cna classes within your state will provide you with an in depth look at the various requirements , program styles , costs , fees , and so on associated with the various programs .
You need to ensure the programs in which you are interested in have an accredited and State approved program credential in cna classes in your city
If you attend cna classes to study , you will be sadly informed that when exam time comes around , you will most likely not be allowed to sit for the State exams , therefore your education and time would have been wasted .
You can not be allowed to become a CNA without obtaining the proper education and passing both parts of the exam .
There are many colleges and universities that offer phlebotomy training .
However , you need to look for a phlebotomy facts which will give you an edge when you plan to venture out in the medical industry .
These schools offer the courses in this vital aspect of health industry .
During training , you will be taught about the significance of phlebotomy in the medical world .
Furthermore , you will also learn about the fundamentals of drawing blood , how to properly handle medical equipment , building rapport to the patients and comforting them to avoid nervousness and anxiety when the process takes place .
At the simplest level , a toxin is something capable of causing disease or damaging tissue when it enters the body .
When most people hear the word “ toxin ” , they think of chemicals like pesticides , heavy metals or other industrial pollutants .
But even beneficial nutrients like water , which are necessary to sustain life , are toxic at high doses .
In the Perfect Health Diet , Paul & Shou - Ching Jaminet apply the economic principle of declining marginal benefits to toxins :
It implies that the first bit eaten of any toxin has low toxicity .
Each additional bit is slightly more toxic than the bit before .
At higher doses , the toxicity of each bit continues to increase , so that the toxin is increasingly poisonous .
This is important to understand as we discuss the role of each of the dietary toxins listed above in contributing to diabesity .
Most of you wo n’t develop diabesity by eating a small amount of fructose , cereal grains and even industrial seed oils .
But if you eat those nutrients ( or rather anti-nutrients ) in excessive quantities , your risk of diabesity rises significantly .
This is especially true if you have any of the genes that predispose you to diabetes and obesity .
The primary effect toxins have on the body – whether dietary or otherwise – is inflammation .
And since we now know that diabesity is an autoimmune , inflammatory disease , it ’s clear that anything that causes inflammation is a potential risk factor for both diabetes and obesity .
The impact of each of these dietary toxins could fill a book .
And in fact , there are several such books and many other blogs that have covered this material in detail .
Rather than re-create the wheel , I ’m going to provide a brief summary and then link you to resources if you want more detail .
Cereal grains : the unhealthiest “ health food ” on the planet ?
The major cereal grains – wheat , corn , rice , barley , sorghum , oats , rye and millet – have become the staple crops of the modern human diet .
They ’ve also become the “ poster children ” of the low - fat , high - carbohydrate diet promoted by organizations like the American Heart Association ( AHA ) and American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) .
If you say the phrase “ whole grains ” to most people , the first word that probably comes to their mind is “ healthy ” .
But the fact is that most animals , including our closest relative ( the chimpanzee ) are n’t adapted to eating cereal grains and do n’t eat them in large quantities .
And humans have only been eating them for the past 10,000 years ( a tiny blip of time on the scale of evolution ) .
Why ?
Because plants like cereal grains are always competing against predators ( like us ) for survival .
Unlike animals , plants ca n’t run away from us when we decide to eat them .
They had to evolve other mechanisms for protecting themselves .
These include :
producing toxins that damage the lining of the gut ;
producing toxins that bind essential minerals , making them unavailable to the body ; and ,
producing toxins that inhibit digestion and absorption of other essential nutrients , including protein .
One of these toxic compounds is the protein gluten , which is present in wheat and many of the other most commonly eaten cereal grains .
In short , gluten damages the intestine and makes it leaky .
As we saw in the last article , a leaky gut is one of the major predisposing factors for diabetes and obesity .
Celiac disease – a condition of severe gluten intolerance – has been well known for decades .
These people have a dramatic and , in some cases , potentially fatal immune response to even the smallest amounts of gluten .
However , what is less well known is that wheat gluten triggers an immune response and gut inflammation in almost everyone – regardless of whether they are “ gluten intolerant ” or not .
Over 80 % of the population develops measurable gut inflammation after eating wheat gluten .
Dr. Kurt Harris , author of one of my favorite blogs ( PaleoNu ) , calls wheat one of the three “ neolithic agents of disease ” ( we agree on the other two as well ) .
For more information on the toxic effect of cereal grains , see Dr. Harris ’s two articles “ The argument against cereal grains ” and “ The argument against cereal grains , part II “ .
Industrial seed oils : unnatural and unfit for human consumption
Industrial seed oils ( corn , cottonseed , soybean , safflower , sunflower , etc. ) have not been a part of the human diet up until relatively recently , when misguided groups like the AHA and the ADA started promoting them as “ heart - healthy ” alternatives to saturated fat .
The graph below shows how dramatically seed oil consumption has risen over the past several decades :
Industrial seed oils are extremely harmful when consumed in excess .
I ’ve written about this at length in my series on essential fatty acids .
In the context of this article , researchers have shown that industrial seed oils have played a significant role in the current obesity epidemic .
A recent study showed that a diet with an omega - 6:3 ratio of 28 ( meaning 28 times more omega - 6 than omega - 3 fats ) caused obesity that progressively increased over four generations of mice .
This means that eating too much omega - 6 did n’t only cause obesity in the current generation , but it also predisposed future generations eating the same diet to developing obesity .
This is bad news for those eating a Standard American Diet , which contains an omega - 6:3 ratio that is very similar to what the mice in the study above were fed .
Omega - 6 seed oils have also been shown to cause inflammation , insulin resistance and impaired leptin signaling , all of which directly contribute to diabetes .
Finally , industrial seed oils have been shown to interfere with thyroid function by blocking the binding of thyroid hormone to its receptors .
The result is a higher fat mass and a less efficient metabolism .
For more information on how seed oils contribute to diabesity , see The Body Fat Setpoint , Part III : Dietary Causes of Obesity , Have Seed Oils Caused a Multi- Generational Obesity Epidemic ? , and my series on Essential Fatty Acids .
Fructose : the sweetest way to get diabesity
White table sugar is composed of two sugars : glucose and fructose .
Glucose is an important nutrient in our bodies and is healthy , as long as it ’s consumed in moderation .
Fructose is a different story .
Fructose is found primarily in fruits and vegetables , and sweeteners like sugar and high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
A recent USDA report found that the average American eats 152 pounds of sugar each year , including almost 64 pounds of HFCS .
Unlike glucose , which is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and taken up by the cells , fructose is shunted directly to the liver where it is converted to fat .
Excess fructose consumption causes a condition called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , which is directly linked to both diabetes and obesity .
A 2009 study showed that shifting 25 % of dietary calories from glucose to fructose caused a 4 - fold increase in abdominal fat .
Abdominal fat is an independent predictor of insulin sensitivity , impaired glucose tolerance , high blood pressure and high cholesterol and triglycerides .
In a widely popular talk on YouTube , Dr. Robert H. Lustig explains that fructose has all of the qualities of a poison .
It causes damage , provides no benefit and is sent directly to the liver to be detoxified so that it does n’t harm the body .
Another danger of fructose is that it reacts with polyunsaturated fats and proteins to form toxic compounds called Advanced Glycation End-Products ( AGEs ) in a process known as “ fructation ” .
( Who comes up with these words ? )
AGEs wreak all kinds of havoc on the body ; they damage DNA , speed up the aging process and cause high blood pressure and kidney disease .
And studies have shown that fructose is up to 10 times more likely to produce AGEs than glucose .
For more on the toxic effects of fructose , see The Perfect Health Diet and Robert Lustig ’s YouTube talk : Sugar , The Bitter Truth .
A toxin - free diet prevents and even reverses diabetes
In addition to all of the evidence above , we have two other lines of evidence that strongly indicate that cereal grains , seed oils and fructose contribute to diabesity .
First , diabesity is either non-existent or extremely rare in hunter - gatherer cultures that do n’t consume these toxic foods .
Second , two studies have shown that a paleolithic diet ( free of cereal grains , seed oils and excessive fructose ) produced dramatic improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic markers .
The first study , performed by Dr. Staffan Lindeberg and colleagues , found that a paleolithic diet was superior to the mediterranean diet in several ways .
These are summarized in Stephan Guyenet ’s article on Lindeberg ’s study :
Greater fat loss in the the midsection and a trend toward greater weight loss
Greater voluntary reduction in caloric intake ( total intake paleo= 1,344 kcal ; Med= 1,795 )
A remarkable improvement in glucose tolerance that did not occur significantly in the Mediterranean group
A decrease in fasting glucose
An increase in insulin sensitivity ( HOMA - IR )
The most remarkable outcome of the study is that , although 12 of 14 participants had elevated fasting blood sugar at the beginning of the trial , every single participant had normal fasting blood sugar at the end of the trial .
Dr. Lindeberg published a follow - up study in 2009 .
In this case they compared a paleolithic diet with a conventional ADA low - fat “ diabetes diet ” .
While the results were n’t quite as impressive as the first one , they were still very encouraging .
Participants in the paleolithic group :
Reduced HbA1 c more than the diabetes diet ( a measure of average blood glucose )
Reduced weight , BMI and waist circumference more than the diabetes diet
Lowered blood pressure more than the diabetes diet
Reduced triglycerides more than the diabetes diet
Increased HDL more than the diabetes diet
At the end of the trial , 8 out of 13 patents still had diabetic blood glucose levels .
However , in this study the patients had well - established diabetes for an average of 9 years .
Over time diabetes progresses to beta cell destruction , which reduces insulin output .
Once this point has been reached , dietary changes can be helpful but cannot completely reverse diabetes .
What this means , of course , is that the earlier you remove these toxins from your diet , the better chance you have of preventing and even reversing diabesity .
And while a paleolithic diet may not reverse diabetes in those that have had it for several years , it still produces significant improvements .
** A donut is the perfect diabesity food .
It ’s got refined flour ( cereal grains ) , industrial seed oils ( plus trans fats for an added bonus ) , and plenty of high - fructose corn syrup .
Issa would shift focus from corporations
Adding to a bit of a streak for House Republicans , Darrell Issa handed Democrats an amazing talking point in a speech to Pennsylvania Republicans on his plans if his party takes the House :
“ That will make all the difference in the world , ” he told 400 applauding party members during a dinner at the chocolate - themed Hershey Lodge .
“ I wo n’t use it to have corporate America live in fear that we ’re going to subpoena everything .
I will use it to get the very information that today the White House is either shredding or not producing . ”
( h/t Sargent )
UPDATE : Issia spokesman Kurt Bardella emails that Issa " never said he would n't subpoena corporations . "
" This is the same guy who led the investigation into Toyota - going so far as getting their CEO to testify before his committee , has been calling out GM for their deceptive ads and shredding of docs , investigated AIG 's counterparty payouts , opposed bailout of corporate America , opposed bailout of auto - dealers .
What he was talking about was not using his authority to go on fishing expeditions targeting corporate Aamerica as was the case under Waxman .
Just look at Issa 's record so far , he has been very aggressive investigating cases where there is evidence of something to investigate . "
Whoa !
Hey !
Look !
A comic on the internet !
Who knew this would happen ?!
This weekend is the San Diego ComicCon !
If you want to see what Wes and Tony are up to , come by Topatoco booth # 1231 and get your neck signed and a free high - five !
This article was first published in the New York Press .
Wall Street bankers and retired hedge fund billionaires have been talking about fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction , preparing the masses for austerity measures and cuts in social services — which we are told are regrettable , of course , but necessary nonetheless .
Well , here is the perfect welfare program for the bailout queens to show off their fiscally conservative chops :
Let ’s see them cut federal farm subsidies , which funnel billions of dollars to the richest Americans , including notables like Ted Turner , David Letterman , Scottie Pippen , Paris Hilton ’s grandpa , Charles Schwab , Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen and just about every single one of Sam Walton ’s degenerate heirs .
Most people know next to nothing about this $ 20 billion - a - year welfare for the rich program , probably because the billionaires want it that way .
Why get the masses worked up ?
Best to let them think the $ 200 billion they spent from 1995 through 2006 went to friendly farmers with cute farmhouses , rather than to Chevron or Kenneth Lay .
Better to let urban entrepreneurs call themselves backyard farmers and toil away for the locavore movement , than to realize that their rich neighbors are reaping actual “ farm ” subsidies .
Now , farm subsidies were n’t always this criminal and , until fairly recently , had been doing what New Deal programs were designed to do : help the little guy .
But the freemarket “ reforms ” of the Reagan - Clinton Era warped the welfare , redirecting farm subsidies from the have - nots to the have - mores , bankrupting all but the biggest farmers and depositing farm subsides into the bank accounts of the rich .
There ’s no need to go to Iowa to see this welfare - for - the - rich in action .
You can see it on the Upper East Side , where billionaire elites collect huge welfare checks from the government just for being rich , while a few blocks away , in one of the poorest , most ghettoized districts in the United States , the city ’s black population is being purged from food stamp rolls for smoking some dope .
Because , as Mayor Rudy Giuliani once wisely said , “ As soon as they stop being dependent on the government , they ’re moving in a much healthier direction . ”
Norman B. Champ Jr : Wall Street Welfare Prince
But brutal freemarket ideas do n’t apply to members of Manhattan ’s genteel farmer class , even billionaires like Norman B. Champ III , who received nearly a half - million dollars in welfare payments for poor farmers , despite the fact that he lives in a multimillion dollar co-op at 828 Park Avenue .
From 1995 to 2006 , he raked in a total of $ 405,807 in dairy , corn and soy subsidies via his stake in the Champ family ’s dairy farm in Missouri , his home state .
Handout - for - handout , even Reagan ’s mythic Cadillac - driving Chicago welfare queen and her $ 150,000 welfare scam got nothing on Champ , who could buy a Lamborghini and still have money left over to reupholster his private jet .
Norman B. Champ III , 47 , was born into a wealthy , upper - crust Missouri family and lived a privileged life ( the Champs had a Missouri village named after them in their honor : the Village of Champ ) .
He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University , went to England for a masters in war studies from King ’s College and earned a law degree — cum laude , of course — from Harvard , after which he finally settled down at Chilton Investment Company , a multi-billion dollar hedge fund .
He had added three titles to his name — Executive Vice President , General Counsel , Chief Compliance Officer — by the time the markets crashed .
He lost no time jumping ship to a cushy government job with the Securities and Exchange Commission , coming on board in January 2010 to start a new life as a financial regulator at the SEC ’s New York Inspections and Examinations Division .
He now leads a team of 100 hardworking investigators in a crusade to crack down on the shady dealings of his hedge - fund buddies .
An upper - crust billionaire type who lives in one of the nation ’s wealthiest ZIP codes and collects welfare meant for struggling farmers ?
Whatta champ !
He might not be what most of us expect a welfare queen to look like , but that ’s only because we have been duped by the whole poverty thing , convinced that the crumbs we throw the needy are a huge burden on our budget .
So we look for any way to cut them off .
For those who want to observe a real subsidy queen in his natural habitat , there ’s no better place than Park Avenue .
I am not trying to be ironic here .
The people are literally welfare queens :
They live where queens live and take money from the poor like queens do .
Map to the Subsidy Stars
Billionaires Leonard Lauder , Mark Rockefeller and his dad , David Rockefeller , are just a few of the more famous names exploiting their salt - of - the - earth legal status .
Over the past decade , however , millions of dollars in corn , dairy , peanuts , cotton , soy and livestock subsidy payments from the federal government have gone to countless rich rank - and - file Manhattanites few people have ever heard of :
It ’s all right there in the farm subsidy database maintained by the Environmental Working Group .
William Lesse Castleberry , a tax attorney who oversees leveraged buyouts , received $ 133,680 in cotton subsidies through an Arkansas farm .
Mary W. Heller , a photographer with a studio on East 74th Street , got $ 143,783 via a farm in Kansas for growing wheat and sorghum .
William Philip Walsh , who recently purchased a $ 2.9 million luxury condo with interior design done by Armani , was paid $ 212,463 to not farm his land .
Phyllis A. Joyner , a 77 - year old peanut farmer with a swanky Greenwich Village apartment and over $ 7 million worth of beautiful land in rural Virginia , received $ 239,624 for her peanut crops .
They ’re not your typical crusty overalls wearing farmers .
But then , the small family farmers we picture in our heads , who live on their land with their family and rise with the rooster to milk the cows , are n’t around much these days ( except maybe in Brooklyn backyard imaginations ) .
And if they are , they probably are n’t receiving any assistance from the federal government anyway , says Ken Cook , president of the Environmental Working Group .
“ American taxpayers have been writing farm subsidy checks to wealthy absentee land owners , state prison systems , universities , public corporations , and very large , well - heeled farm business operations without the government so much as asking the beneficiaries if they need our money , ” explained Cook in 2007 , when his organization published a database of farm subsidy recipients from USDA records .
It was n’t meant to be this way .
Farm subsidies first began as part of the New Deal and were designed to help small , family farms struggling through the Great Depression .
These days , this well - intentioned program exists only in name .
Successive deregulation and various other freemarket “ reforms ” have turned farm subsidies into just another welfare - for - the - rich program , bypassing the very farmers it was designed to help and depositing billions in taxpayer money straight into the bank accounts of corporations and wealthy Americans .
Here ’s what the New Deal program looks like today , after Reaganism had a couple of go ’s at it : From 1995 to 2006 , the federal government spent about $ 200 billion on agricultural subsidies , 75 percent of which ended up in the bank accounts of the richest top 10 percent of farmers .
It ’s welfare in reverse , taking from the many and giving it to the wealthy .
And the richer you are , the more assistance you deserve .
You can see this logic at work in Manhattan , where the fattest farm subsidy checks are mailed to the richest zip codes .
Like the $ 825,346.56 addressed to Kent M. Klineman at ZIP code 10020 , one of Manhattan ’s wealthiest , with an average income of more than $ 500,000 : 10 times higher than the rest of America .
In fact , Klineman , who got the cash from 1995 to 2006 for growing wheat and sunflowers and raising livestock on a South Dakota cattlebreeding ranch called Eagle Pass Ranch , just might be the most subsidized farmer in Manhattan .
But you probably would n’t have caught this 77 - year - old Harvard Law School grad ( this alma mater appears quite often among Manhattan ’s subsidy queens ) at the ranch , shoveling and trucking manure and inseminating the sows .
Judging by SEC records , Klineman is more of a wheeling and dealing finance type , running venture capital companies , private investment funds and assorted dubious finance companies .
Also keep in mind that in 1974 , Klineman was among 13 people indicted on various fraud charges in a 100 - million Madoff - style Ponzi scheme that involved selling millionaires and movie stars fraudulent shares in an oil - drilling outfit called Home - Stake Production Co. , by promising astronomical returns , which were paid out not from profits but from money put in by the newest round of sucker investors .
Liza Minnelli , Barbra Streisand , Bob Dylan , Barbara Walters and Mike Nichols , among others , were purportedly bilked for hundreds of thousands of dollars .
But it was n’t just naïve Hollywood entertainers that were scammed .
The heads of some of America ’s biggest corporations , including the president of American Express , the chairman of General Electric , and the chairman of Pepsi , were all caught up in the scam .
In the end , the scam ’s ringleader — Robert S. Trippett — got away with a scolding and a small fine , while charges against Klineman were eventually dropped .
But in the mid-90s , Klineman was implicated in another securities swindle , this time a mini version of an Enron stock pump - and - dump operation , which involved some two - bit computer company called EIS International .
Whatever scam they were running , a shareholder class action lawsuit against Klineman and his partners alleged that Klineman , who EIS ’s company ’s Treasurer and Director , intentionally disseminated misleading information to investors the the aim of inflating the company ’s stock and then cashed out just before the whole scam imploded , making over $ 1 million in the process .
A settlement was reached nearly a decade later , forcing Klineman and two of his business buddies to fork over $ 3.9 million ( plus a million or so in fees ) to the scammed shareholders .
Like Carlito , Klineman “ never convicted on no dope . ”
But even if he was slapped with a felony or two , there would be no reason for him to panic .
His sweet $ 69,000 a year farm subsidy would continue unaffected , regardless of his criminal history .
That ’s nice , because if Klineman was a food stamp pawn living in Harlem , or any other ghetto in America , he ’d have to deal with a harsh Clinton - era welfare reform that introduced poor people to the “ one strike you ’re out ” law that forbids states to provide food stamps or cash - assistance to anyone with a single drug - related felony conviction , permanently — as in for life .
“ No one , including pregnant women or people participating in drug treatment , is exempt from the ban . ”
New York was kind enough to begin the lifetime exclusion only after the second conviction .
“ What , you think you like me ?
You ai n’t like me motherfucker , you a punk . ”
Farmers have come to expect preferential treatment from the government .
While the rest of us are constantly slapped with new laws , regulations , taxes and fees , farmers have been left to do their own thing because they are too fragile to be squeezed for cash like the off - farm masses .
Aside from being exempt from things like zoning laws ( a farmer ’s property is taxed at a fraction of its market value ) , they get tax breaks , tax credits , tax abatements and all sorts of other perks that shrink their overall tax exposure to just about nothing , regardless of their wealth .
So not only do they milk taxpayers for billions in subsidies , they do not even contribute their fair share .
Subsidies and tax breaks ?
That ’s free money times two .
Naturally , the rich have been exploiting America ’s kindly treatment of its farmers from day one , widening loopholes , relaxing restrictions and turning farms into personal tax havens and petty cash machines that allowed them to give less , while taking more .
Even a Capitalist Hall of Fame family like the Rockefellers , known for their generous charities and contributions to culture , turn out to receive government welfare .
Mark F. Rockefeller , a fourth - generation industrialist , probably had taxes on his mind when he purchased roughly 5,000 acres of farmland in Swan Valley , Idaho , and started receiving subsidy checks at his capitalist lair in the Rockefeller Plaza .
Starting in 2001 , the federal government has been giving him $ 54,500 a year to not farm his land .
That ’s right :
The government gives your money to a member of the ultimate capitalist clan , which has a combined worth of more than $ 200 billion , to just laze around , not work and let his fields weed over .
It ’s what they call a “ conservation payment ” program , in which the government pays farmers to convert their land into something natural , like wetlands or whatever other eco-friendly habitat might be appropriate for the environment .
It worked out well for Rockefeller .
By some strange coincidence , his farmland happened to be right next to an upscale fly - fishing resort he opened up with his wife in 1999 .
The place , called South Fork Lodge , plays host to groups of rich , middle aged men who pay $ 1,000 a day to fish in elegance and beauty with a personal fly - fishing guide .
According to its website , “ South Fork Lodge rests on a dramatic bend of eastern Idaho ’s world famous South Fork of the Snake River in scenic Swan Valley .
As you prepare to spend your day on one of the most scenic and majestic fly - fishing rivers in America , you will marvel at the breathtaking views from your room or the Lodge patio . ”
What their guests probably do n’t know is that they ’ll be paying for some of those views twice : once to South Fork Lodge and once to Mark F. Rockefeller himself .
Rockefeller gets double the welfare by gaming the generous tax breaks built into agricultural land .
It appears that instead of having South Fork Lodge own the land surrounding the resort and suffer the full force of a normal property tax rate , Rockefeller has had the business buy up just enough property to house the hotel ’s various structures , while he purchased all the open space the resort needed — riverfront real estate for fly - fishing , outdoor activities and background scenery — in his own name and dedicated it to farming .
It ’s win-win for Rockefeller ’s business , allowing South Fork Lodge to offer commercial services on land for which he pays almost no taxes .
The lodge charges $ 1,700 per night for its outdoor safari type quarters , complete with servants and a personal chef , which they offer to guests who want to rough it in a “ gorgeous wilderness retreat nestled in the cottonwoods and aspens of the South Fork of the Snake River Canyon Section . ”
A tax free slice of Rockefeller heaven
Two of Rockefeller ’s spinoff businesses — which provide guided fly - fishing trips — also exploit the tax - free property , using it for private boat - launches , riverfront access and camping .
If you were wondering why wealthy guys like him would go all the way out to places like Idaho for a lousy couple of grand in subsidies , do the math :
He ’s making a fortune off the land .
Rockefeller pays a pitiful property tax of roughly $ 10 per acre , something like 1/60th of what it should be .
Adding up the 5,000 acres or so , he gets a massive tax break of $ 500,000 or more .
But rich subsidy queens do n’t need to travel far to filch their fair share of taxpayer wealth ; they can do it right where they live and work .
Failed dot - com entrepreneur Craig Winn lives in Albemarle , Va. , and paid $ 1,000 in taxes on a $ 3.5 million estate by converting its 50 acres into conserved farmland .
All his rich neighbors , including pop culture hacks Dave Matthews and John Grisham , enrolled their land in the tax saver program , too .
Hell , even Walt Disney
World became a farmer by putting some cows to pasture on its land in Orlando to shave millions off its tax bill .
Hewlett - Packard opened up a Christmas tree farm on its massive Houston campus , which saved it ( and cost Houston ) half a million dollars a year in taxes .
No wonder America is starting to feel like a third - world country .
Fighting two wars and bailing out banks is enough without having the rich plundering our country right out from under us .
It ’s not just property taxes , either .
In the past decade , two - thirds of corporations doing business on U.S. soil paid no income taxes .
The rich are n’t just not paying their fair share , they ’re not paying anything at all .

Nevada ’s Republican candidate for Senate does n’t seem to like to have her own words used against her :
Sharron Angle ’s campaign sent a cease and desist letter to Sen .
Harry Reid ’s campaign last week after a copy of her pre-primary election website was relaunched as www.therealsharronangle.com, which was later taken down .
After winning the June 8 primary , Angle took down her website and relaunched a new , glossier and trimmer version on Thursday .
Reid ’s campaign then launched a copy of Angle ’s former website and accused her toning down her rhetoric on the new website .
The two - page cease and desist letter , sent on July 2 by an attorney representing the Friends of Sharron Angle , said Reid ’s campaign had violated federal copyright laws and demanded Reid ’s campaign forward any names and e-mails that may have been collected by the copied website .
There were differences between Angle ’s former and new sites , namely a missing endorsements page and an edited , scaled - down version of her issues page .
For example , the new website made no mention of her position on Yucca Mountain , which is to keep it open , and her calls to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education .
While Reid ’s campaign said the cease and desist letter amounted to a frivolous lawsuit threat , the copied version of Angle ’s former website had been taken down since it went up on Thursday .
The web address for www.therealsharronangle.com is now directed to www.sharronsundergroundbunker.com.
“ Make no mistake , the Reid campaign was forced to take this site down because they were breaking several laws and trying deceive voters , ” said Angle spokesman Jerry Stacy .
“ You ’re going to see a lot of dirty tricks like that from Reid ’s campaign . ”
In a statement , Reid ’s campaign said , “ Sharron Angle is trying to silence , well , Sharron Angle . ”
Karlheinz Erb is a specialist on sustainable development and biomass flows .
His research indicates that humans are already using a very high amount of the Earth 's biomass flow , which could become problematic with the new found interest in biofuels .
What we find is that one species on the Earth is appropriating , that is , causing one quarter of biomass collateral flows on Earth .
This is a rather huge amount considering it is caused by only one species .
Secondly , of course , any energy that human society takes out of the ecosystem will be lacking for other organisms .
This is a very high figure , and we discover that geographical pattern is rather diverse .
Still , we see with future developments increased biomass demand will have large effects on the functioning of the ecosystem .
Definitely , yes .
One implication of it is , of course , with growth population there will be a higher demand of biomass .
It is then important to have policies which aim at controlling the population growth .
Population growth will have an effect on the ecosystem , and it�s very important to act on this issue .
Now , how to do ?
It is probably difficult .
Biofuels are a very intricate problem .
We are trying to go toward policies of biofuels from biomass in order to mitigate carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere .
Actually what we see from our study is that we are already using a high proportion of biomass production in the ecosystem .
In light of population growth people will need energy from ecosystem for food .
If specialized industrialized countries move toward energy for biomass for industrial processes this will first , of course , cause trade offs in food production , but in the end it will shift the climate problem .
It will probably help in this instance , but it will shift to other problems where there are United Nations conventions , for example , for the endangerment of biodiversity .

MANHATTAN — A Tea Party leader who said on Wednesday in a blog rant against the proposed World Trade Center mosque that Muslims worshipped a " monkey god " has apologized — to Hindus .
Mark Williams , a conservative radio host , self - proclaimed " founding Tea Party Patriot " and chairman of the Tea Party Express , wrote on his blog that the 13 - story mosque slated for the former Burlington Coat Factory building near Ground Zero was a monument " for the worship of the terrorists ' monkey - god . "
The original post is password - protected .
Excerpts were published on the Huffington Post .
Later Wednesday , Williams apologized in another blog post .
" In the course of the article I described the ' god ' worshiped by terrorists as ' a monkey god ' .
I was wrong and that was offensive , " Williams wrote .
" I owe an apology to millions of Hindus who worship Lord Hanuman , an actual Monkey God . "
He then describes Hanuman as a destroyer of evil and a symbol of perseverance , strength and devotion .
" So , again , to my Hindu friends I offer my sincerest apologies for my horrible lapse and my insensitivity , " he wrote .
" It was unintentional , inexplicably ignorant and I am ashamed at my offense toward you . "
He did not apologize to Muslims in the post .
But his earlier post about the downtown mosque provides a clue about his thoughts on Islam .
" It is a project of American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative , essentially the same group of apologists ( but under 2 different names ) for terrorists and the animals who use it as a terrorist ideology , " he wrote .
" They cloak their evil with new age gibberish that suggests Islam is just misunderstood . "
The statements elicited strong reaction from Islamic groups .
" It would be shocking if such ignorant comments failed to elicit a strong response not only from Tea Party leaders , but from other parties throughout the political spectrum , " Council on American - Islamic Relations National Legislative Director Corey Saylor said in a press release .
Daisy Khan , executive director of the Cordoba Initiative , said the center would be a positive addition to downtown .
“ We have a vision that is opposite the vision of the extremists , ” Khan told DNAinfo .
“ We want to be a driving force for the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan . ”
The mosque , however , has elicted mixed reviews in the neighborhood .

Two Choices : Restructure Debts or Debase Currencies
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

Last week , the European Central Bank pledged to spend as much as 750 billion euros ( about a trillion US dollars ) in an attempt to discourage market concerns about European debt , particularly that of Greece , Portugal and Spain .
The intended message was to show the markets - particularly bond market " vigilantes " speculating against European debt - that the ECB has deep enough pockets to thwart the mounting pressure on European debt and the euro itself .
ECB President Jean - Claude
Trichet has been quick to deny concerns that the move by the ECB will be inflationary , emphasizing that the intervention will be " sterilized " in order to prevent a major increase in the amount of euros outstanding .
This is " totally different , " he argued last week , from the massive increase in monetary base that has occurred as the U.S. Federal Reserve has bought up over $ 1.25 trillion in debt obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A " sterilized intervention " is one where the euros created through the purchase of distressed Euro - area debt will also be absorbed by selling other assets from the ECB 's balance sheet , in order to take those euros back in .
In order to evaluate the arguments being made , it 's helpful to understand the balance sheet of a typical central bank .
Whether in the U.S. , Europe , or elsewhere , the basic structure is the same .
On the asset side , the central bank has government debt that it has purchased over time .
A small proportion of total assets might be held in " hard " assets such as gold , but primarily , the assets of each central bank has traditionally represented government debt - mostly of its own nation ( or in the case of the ECB , euro - area governments ) .
As a central bank purchases these securities , it creates an equal amount of liabilities , in the form of " monetary base " ( currency and bank reserves ) .
Notice , for example , that the pieces of paper in your wallet have the words " Federal Reserve Note " inscribed at the top .
Currency is a liability of the Federal Reserve , against which it has traditionally held assets such as Treasury securities , and prior to 1971 , at least fractional backing in gold .
In this context , consider the ECB 's proposed 750 billion euro line of defense .
Essentially the ECB is saying " We stand ready to buy as much as 750 billion euros of distressed Euro - area debt in order to defend the euro . "
Simultaneously , despite the fact that Euro area countries are running large fiscal deficits , the worst being in Greece , Portugal and Spain , the ECB is saying " However , we intend to sterilize this intervention , which will ultimately require that we sell Euro - area debt into the market in order to absorb the euros we create . "
The only way that both statements can be true is for the ECB to admit " Therefore , we are fundamentally promising to debase the quality of our balance sheet , by exchanging higher quality Euro - area debt with lower - quality debt of countries that are ultimately likely to default . "
Far from being " totally different " from what the U.S. Federal Reserve has done , the ECB is essentially promising exactly the same thing - to corrupt its balance sheet and debase its currency in order to protect the worst stewards of capital from the consequences of bad lending and poor investment .
Over the shorter term , the Federal Reserve has promised to abet the ECB by entering currency swaps , essentially accepting euros from the ECB and providing U.S. dollars that the ECB can in turn use to buy up euros and European debt .
The promise , of course , is that the ECB will reverse these swaps at a later date , at the same exchange rate at which they entered into the transaction .
The problem here is that this is a very dangerous game for the ECB ( not to mention the Fed ) .
If the euro depreciates materially , the ECB will later be forced to sell euros into an already weak market ( effectively creating new currency to cover the loss ) in order to buy back enough dollars to reverse the swaps and make the Federal Reserve whole ( assuming the Fed will ultimately be made whole ) .
Presumably , the ECB hoped that the 750 billion euro figure would inspire shock and awe , but after a quick rally on Monday , the markets were neither shocked , nor durably awed , as investors began figuring out that the ECB was essentially promising to buy Euro - debt with Euro - debt , and to defend euros with euros .
In the end , as I 've argued repeatedly over the years , monetary policy is only as good as fiscal policy .
A central bank does not have wealth of its own .
It is a zero -sum entity that can only enrich those from whom it purchases debt by debasing the relative wealth of people who hold the existing stock of currency .
If a government insists on running deficits , engaging in wasteful spending , and dissipating public resources to bail out private bondholders , it has to find somebody willing to buy its debt .
If it does not , the central bank buys it , and dilutes the currency by doing so .
The situation is particularly insidious when the central bank buys low - quality debt , because there is no taxing authority behind it to provide a basis for confidence in the currency .
The Euro - area has a special problem in this regard , because the bailouts represent clear country - to - country transfers of wealth , and risk creating inflation for all the members of the European Community in order to defend the deficit spending of countries that simply do not have enough flexibility to cut those deficits .
Greece in particular is likely to experience so much loss of output that it will most likely lose on the revenue side much of what it cuts on the spending side .
For that reason , the deficits are likely to come down much slower than expected .
Germany , with its particularly strong aversion to inflation , is unlikely to accept the costs for long .
It is difficult to project the timing and events by which all of this will be resolved , but I increasingly suspect that the ( relatively ) stronger Euro - area countries will reject the prospect of providing continuing subsidies and accepting growing inflation risk as the cost of keeping deficit - prone member countries under the euro umbrella .
In short , I do n't expect that Greece or Portugal ( Spain is more uncertain ) will ultimately remain part of the euro .
At the point that Greek and Portugese debt has to be restructured ( which seems inevitable given the negative revenue effects of austerity measures ) , departure from the euro will give these countries a better ability to depreciate their currencies to a level that re-aligns internal wages and prices with competitive levels .
This will be a less disruptive solution than having to force - as austerity measures do - a massive internal deflation through wage reductions and spending cuts .
The unpleasant alternative is to hold the line on wages and prices within Greece , Portugal and other high - deficit countries , and suffer inflation throughout the entire Euro - area as those debts are monetized .
The only other alternative , which does not seem at all likely , is that other Euro - area countries will accept ongoing country - to - country transfers in order to finance the deficits of their neighbors .
Without a central taxing authority , the goal of a common European currency can only survive if the participating countries obey a rule that strictly controls the deficits of individual countries .
Without that , the whole system is compromised .
It should not be difficult to recognize that the confidence in any currency is tied to the confidence in the assets which stand behind it , and associated confidence in the restraint of fiscal and monetary authorities .
The bureaucrats in both the U.S. and European central banks have chosen to betray that trust .
It 's fascinating that they seem genuinely surprised when their generosity with other people 's wealth ( and their assurance of greater betrayal ) is met with contempt .
While I expect that the euro will survive by the coordination of its stronger members , it risks being debased by the unwillingness to accept debt restructuring sooner rather than later .
Market Climate
On Monday of last week , the Market Climate re-established its overvalued , overbought , overbullish , rising - yields syndrome .
Given the easing of interest rates in the preceding week , I had expected more latitude for upside before that syndrome reasserted itself , but yields shot back up on Monday , and investor sentiment did not ease nearly as much as anticipated .
Not surprisingly , much of the gains from Monday evaporated as the week continued .
The Strategic Growth Fund is effectively fully hedged here .
My impression is that the market remains in a tenuous state in that we have not meaningfully cleared the overextended syndrome that has been with us in recent months .
Even so , we 'll respond fractionally to any clearing that we do observe ( with a growing responsiveness as we move through the year ) .
We 're certainly not inclined to " buy the dip " to a material extent , and I continue to anticipate a second wave of credit difficulties in the months immediately ahead .
But I also believe that if we can move through 2010 without a second " crisis - level " wave of credit strains , we 'll be more able to rely on post - 1940 criteria in setting our investment positions , with less concern about the more hostile " post - crash " dataset .
Suffice it to say that we 're not about to lift a significant portion of our hedges early in a selloff provoked by fresh credit strains , but that I also do n't intend to specifically factor in concerns about a second - wave for an extended period if we do n't observe them .
In bonds , the Market Climate was characterized last week by relatively neutral yields and neutral yield pressures .
The Strategic Total Return Fund continues to hold a duration of just under 4 years , mostly in medium term Treasuries .
In response to the move by the ECB , we also scratched on our sell a few weeks ago of precious metals shares , re-establishing those positions early this week at about the same level that we sold them .
The Fund currently has about 3 % of assets in that group , which is not much , but we 're inclined to add exposure on weakness or retracement from last week 's spike .
We liquidated our small 1 % holding the euro early in the week ( same reason ) , shifting to the Swiss franc , which ominously continues to gain ground against the European currency .
A spike in the euro / Swiss franc exchange ratio would be a sign of speculative pressure that one would observe in an escalating crisis , as would a spike in eurocurrency rates denominated in euros , versus other inter - bank deposit rates .
On the inflation question , we continue to observe a debate between those anticipating inflation and those anticipating deflation .
From my perspective , this is a false dichotomy .
Certainly , we can expect a continued relative deflation in real wages - elevated unemployment has a remarkably inconsistent relationship with overall price levels , but the true " Phillips Curve " relation is between unemployment and real wages .
High unemployment is predictably associated with wage growth that falls short of growth in the general price level .
Whatever happens with the general price level , we can expect wage growth to be uncomfortably tepid in the next several years .
With regard to the general price level , observers frequently make the mistake of equating inflation with demand growth , which effectively assumes that the quantity of money ( or at least its marginal utility ) is constant .
This is a poor assumption in the present state of the world .
Think of it this way .
If you were in an elementary school lunchroom , and the kid that always has the Chips Ahoy cookies suddenly starts bringing in three times as many , you could predict fairly accurately that the value of a cookie relative to just about everything else would fall ( that is , the price of everything , in terms of cookies , would go up ) .
Moreover , this would occur even if nobody else was a bit hungrier .
When you substantially increase the quantity of something , you reduce its marginal value relative to everything else .
You do n't need strong demand for the price of goods and services to rise in terms of dollar bills .
All you need to do is to debase the marginal value of dollar bills by creating too many .
Over the past year , Ben Bernanke has pushed a monstrous sack of Chips Ahoys into the cafeteria .
In terms of general price inflation , the question is how eager people are for those Chips Ahoys .
If there is a crisis that makes people fear that everything else they might eat will give them food poisoning , the kid 's Chips Ahoys will hold their value even if he brings in three times as many .
But over time , well after the food poisoning scare is past , those cookies will be worth much less .
The bottom line is that we can expect real wages to stagnate for several years , as a predictable reflection of slack capacity in the labor market .
While credit concerns will be helpful in augmenting the demand for U.S. government liabilities as a default -( food poisoning ) - free alternative to other assets , there is a continued prospect for significant price inflation beginning in the second half of this decade .
With the ECB surrendering monetary discipline for the sake of short - term expedience , that prospect has become even more hostile .
I want to be clear that my concern about inflation is not very strong at present .
This is important , because investors seem to be chasing precious metals a bit too avidly here .
Commodities can experience extremely high levels of volatility .
Corrections can be both abrupt and deep , which allow for multiple entry points .
But it is important to recognize that this volatility can be quite painful , so very deliberate risk - management is important .
We 've generally found that chasing advances in commodities is unrewarding .
Again , our own holdings are fairly restricted here .
Reversing our recent sale simply maintains the very small exposure we 've held for several months .
Longer term , in the name of defending the holders of bad debt , the world 's major economies appear willing debase their currencies .
Most likely , we 've got several years ( not weeks or months ) before we observe a striking return of inflation , and there will be probably plenty of time in between where investors give up the concern entirely for a while .
As always , we try to look ahead at the major risks facing the economy , even if those risks take a while to fully emerge .
At present , I believe our monetary authorities are moving down an unfortunate path .
This will create opportunities as well , but we 'll move very deliberately .

I was going to post about something else today , but there is a news item floating around the internet and I want to give it my paw of disdain .
Sony Computer Science Laboratories has come up with a device that posts on Twitter for your cat during her daily activities .
The human latches the thing to the cat ’s collar and it collects data on what she is doing and Tweets accordingly .
As a cat ( and as one who already has a “ device ” - free Twitter account ) , I can assure you that this whole concept is a lotta baloney ( and I do n’t mean the tasty lunchmeat ) .
Let me name the reasons why :
This device spits out just 11 phrases .
According to my own Twitter account , over the past two years , I have Tweeted nearly 4,700 unique phrases .
Okay , some of them are re-Tweets , but I ’m sure that still leaves at least 3,500 original Tweets .
These phrases are human written .
No cat I know wants a human speaking for her .
The day that Sony — or some other company with more time than sense on its hands — comes up with a device that correctly discerns what we are thinking and then translates it into a human language such as English , Japanese or whatever , then they may be onto something .
Wait a minute — we already have translators to get our Tweets on the internet !
They ’re called “ servants , ” “ employees , ” “ administrative assistants ” or even less succinctly , the human we live with who gives us food and buys us cat trees .
If inventors are trying to replace some of these duties , why not replace all of them ?
Then we wo n’t need humans at all .
We can just have a little box around our necks that gives us food and spends extravagant amounts of money on us for our amusement .
Seriously , I do n’t know what these developers are thinking .
If they had looked at Twitter any time in the past , oh , three years or so , they might have noticed that there are already cats on there .
Thousands of cats .
Many of them , like me , also have thousands of followers ( but apparently none from Sony Computer Science Laboratories ) .
In fact , one of the most popular accounts on Twitter , period , is Sockington , a Boston - based former stray with over a million and a half followers .
None of these cats needed something strung around their necks to Tweet , and most of them have come up with 140 - character bursts of inspiration that would put anything pre-programmed to shame .
So guys , uh , please put your dumb idea in the litter box where it belongs and get working on a really useful idea … like a device that calls birds to your cat ’s favorite window — or even better yet , opens the window once the birds have appeared .

Environmentalists battling San Francisco's use of Hetch Hetchy Valley as the city 's main drinking water cache are taking a new tack - raising questions about the water 's quality in light of higher - than - normal rates of certain parasitic infections .
But officials with the city 's water and public health agencies insist that the water is safe and that the group 's alarms have a political goal .
The source of debate lies miles away among the rocks and fissures of Yosemite National Park .
Hetch Hetchy Valley , once a rich landscape of meadows and trees , was submerged in 1923 after San Francisco won its controversial bid , with congressional approval , to create a stable water supply and built O'Shaughnessy Dam on the Tuolumne River .
Restore Hetch Hetchy , as its name suggests , aims to return that valley to its natural state by demolishing the dam and releasing the billions of gallons of water that lie behind it .
Since San Francisco receives about 85 percent of its water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir system , the group argues for storing water in another spot downstream , such as Don Pedro Reservoir .
But Hetch Hetchy is unique :
Due to its remote and pristine location , federal regulators do not require the water to be filtered .
It is chemically treated with chlorine and lime .
Filtration system
Storing the river water at another location would mean building a large - scale filtration system , a project estimated to cost $ 310 million to $ 515 million , according to a 2006 Hetch Hetchy restoration study by the state .
Here 's where the giardia and cryptosporidium - the parasites - come in .
Folks at Restore Hetch Hetchy contend that San Francisco 's water should already be filtered because rates of infection by giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are higher in San Francisco and San Mateo ( also served by Hetch Hetchy ) than almost anywhere else in the state .
So , they say , the costs behind building a filtration plant should n't be one of the arguments against removing O'Shaughnessy Dam and allowing the valley to revert to its verdant past .
" This is a serious public health issue that needs to be addressed by the city of San Francisco , regardless of if we restore Hetch Hetchy or the Tuolumne River , " said Mike Marshall , executive director of Restore Hetch Hetchy .
" Hence , when evaluating the cost , a filtration system should n't be factored in . "
Whereas Restore Hetch Hetchy figures the restoration would cost about $ 1 billion , the state report by the Department of Water Resources said it would cost between $ 3 billion and $ 10 billion .
For years , Restore Hetch Hetchy has vowed to place an initiative to dismantle the dam and re-establish the valley on the ballot in San Francisco ; so far , the group has not succeeded .
' Great water '
Officials at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission , the city 's water agency , acknowledge Hetch Hetchy 's contentious past - environmental giant John Muir vehemently opposed the valley 's flooding .
This latest criticism of the water system , however , has " crossed the line , " said PUC spokesman Tyrone Jue .
" We encourage debate and dialogue , but I 'm ashamed that they 're spreading disinformation about our great water in San Francisco , " Jue said .
" This is nothing more than a smoke screen for the fact that they 've never come up with a source of funding for the $ 10 billion needed to tear down the dam .
" The public understands we have a great water supply and that we 're fortunate to have it . "
That said , San Francisco 's rates of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis , the intestinal diseases caused by exposure to their waterborne parasitic counterparts , are higher than in other regions of California .
Twenty - one residents out of every 100,000 contracted giardiasis in San Francisco in 2008 , compared with fewer than 6 in Contra Costa County and fewer than 4 in Los Angeles .
Since 2001 , giardiasis rates in San Francisco have declined ; but they remain above the rates in other areas .
The disease is usually caused by ingestion of fecal matter , either through contaminated water , anal to oral contact , changing diapers , handling animals or through food touched by infected food workers .
Symptoms include abdominal cramps , diarrhea , vomiting and fever .
Reasons for rates
Three factors are behind the elevated rates , city health experts say : San Francisco 's strong disease - surveillance program , broad access to health care , and a relatively high population of people with suppressed immune systems - specifically , gay men with HIV / AIDS .
" This is not a drinking water problem , " said June Weintraub , senior epidemiologist with the San Francisco Department of Public Health .
" San Francisco is off the charts " with other sexually transmitted diseases and those common among people with compromised immune systems .
Rod Adam , a giardia expert at the infectious disease department at the University of Arizona , concurs .
Adam said the prevalence of the disease in men between the ages of 25 and 54 , according to the city 's 2008 annual report on communicable diseases , hints that giardiasis is being passed from partner to partner in the gay community .
" It really does suggest a lot of this could be sexual transmission , " he said .
Mark Cloutier , former executive director of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation , is n't convinced the problem lies in San Francisco 's water supply , either .
But he believes the issue needs more scrutiny .
" If the rates are higher in San Francisco , we have to look at what makes San Francisco different , " he said .
" There needs to be more analysis . "
GLAAD thanks you for speaking out about NBC Today Show ’s " Modern Wedding Contest . "
This afternoon after GLAAD met with NBC executives and shared our community 's concerns , the network agreed to open the contest to same - sex couples .
The announcement comes a week after GLAAD learned that the contest had excluded gay and lesbian people .
Good As
You blog first alerted us to the problem after discovering the contest ’s application included only " bride " and " groom " as options for applicants to choose .
After we called the network with concerns , NBC argued that it was excluding same - sex couples because " the couple must be able to be legally married in New York , which is where the wedding will take place . "
GLAAD questioned the validity of that argument since New York State legally recognizes same - sex marriages licensed in other states .
Same - sex couples can now legally obtain marriage licenses in Iowa , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire and Washington D.C. NBC mistakenly equated the marriage license with the wedding celebration .
Same - sex weddings are entirely legal in New York State .
Our Call to Action prompted thousands of you to write to NBC and urge the network to give our community the same opportunity to share our stories of love and commitment and allow us the chance to participate in the contest .
This afternoon NBC and the Today Show did just that .
Following a meeting between GLAAD and NBC executives , NBC announced that after listening to community concerns it will open the contest to same - sex couples and extend the submission deadline until Monday , July 12 .
Couples now have until then to apply .
Finalists will be announced later this year and the wedding takes place live on the Today Show this October .
We ’re thrilled that Today Show 's ‘ Modern Wedding Contest ’ now recognizes what most fair - minded Americans have already concluded - a wedding celebrates love and commitment , whether the spouses are straight or gay .
NBC heard the thousands of viewers who contacted them and they have moved to make their contest a truly modern wedding where any couple can share their story .
NBC is living up to its own high standard of fairness and for this , we applaud them .
We encourage qualified same - sex couples to submit their applications before Monday , July 12 and we look forward to next year when same - sex couples will have the ability to apply to the contest from the beginning .
Thanks to the thousands of people who sent emails to the Today Show , blogged about it , and shared the Call to Action on Twitter and Facebook .
We could not have done it without you !
Lastly , we encourage you to support GLAAD today with a donation , so we can continue launching successful campaigns that amplify the voice of our community .

Gay and Lesbian People Need Not Apply : Call on NBC to Stop Today Show ’s “ Modern Day Wedding Contest ” from Denying Gay and Lesbian Couples the Right to Participate

UPDATE - JULY 7 , 2010 : NBC's Today Show Asks to Meet with GLAAD
NBC ’s Today
Show is taking applications for its “ Modern Day Wedding Contest ” through Friday , July 9th .
The winning couple will be awarded a wedding to be broadcast live on the Today Show in October and an all - expense paid honeymoon .
Unfortunately , the network has set up rules that deny committed gay and lesbian couples the ability to participate .
An excerpt from Today ’s Facebook page reads : “ TODAY is throwing a modern day wedding !
Whether your love blossomed over the Internet or you met the old - fashioned way , we want to hear from you ! ”
Read more about the contest .
GLAAD contacted the network last week to find out why its application listed only “ bride ” and “ groom ” as options for applicants since the Today Show welcomed same - sex couples to apply to its “ Hometown Wedding Contest ” in years past .
Good As
You blog alerted us to the application problem .
NBC sent GLAAD this statement regarding the 2010 Modern Day Wedding Contest :
“ For the TODAY show wedding , the couple must be able to be legally married in New York , which is where the wedding will take place . "
This is not a valid argument since New York State legally recognizes same - sex marriages licensed in other states .
Same - sex couples can now legally obtain marriage licenses in Iowa , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire and Washington D.C. NBC is mistakenly equating the marriage license with the wedding celebration .
Same - sex weddings are entirely legal in New York State .
As long as the marriage license is conferred upon the same - sex couple by another state , New York State recognizes the marriage as a fully valid and legal one .
NBC ’s exclusion of same - sex couples from its contest is not motivated by the law , but bias against these couples .
The Today Show is awarding a wedding celebration , not a marriage license .
If a same - sex couple won the contest , producers and the winning couple could easily work together to ensure that the couple properly obtained and complied with the requirements of a marriage license in one of the license - conferring jurisdictions .
The full wedding celebration would then take place on the Today Show .
Given these legal realities , GLAAD has urged NBC to amend its contest rules and allow same - sex couples to apply .
“ Today Show ’s ‘ Modern Wedding Contest ’ should recognize what most fair - minded Americans have already concluded - a wedding celebrates love and commitment , whether the spouses are straight or gay , ” said Jarrett Barrios , President of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) .
“ NBC should stop denying gay and lesbian couples the ability to share their stories of love and commitment and open its wedding contest to all couples . ”
Help us and take action now !
Click here to contact NBC and urge the network to open Today ’s “ Modern Day Wedding ” Contest to same - sex couples .
Call on NBC to demonstrate a commitment to fairness and inclusion by providing equal opportunity to qualified gay and straight couples alike .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 16/6/2010 ( 3759 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Editorial
In a refreshing display of principle and insight , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has come out in favour of a continuing role for Canada in Afghanistan after the military 's combat role comes to an end in 2011 .
It 's time now for Prime Minister Stephen Harper to end his silence and develop a plan on how Canada can meet its moral obligations in the wartorn country .
Mr. Harper has merely stated he is bound by the parliamentary resolution that will bring Canada 's troops home in 2011 .
DALE CUMMINGS / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS
June 17 2010 winnipeg free press dale cummings edit dinky IGNATIEFF / AFGHANISTAN / CONTINUING ROLE
That has been his curt refrain for the past two years , but Mr. Ignatieff has now opened the door for the government to do the right thing and revaluate its options .
It 's hard to understand Mr. Harper 's motive for insisting every one of Canada 's troops pack their bags and come home next year , but as time goes on , it will be reasonable to postulate he is motivated by budgetary restrictions , or by the fear the public will not support a post - combat role for Canada .
Either way , it 's an abandonment of principle , not to mention our allies and the Afghan people , for short - term political considerations .
Mr. Ignatieff is proposing that Canadian troops remain in Afghanistan to help train the country 's troops and police forces , while civilian aid workers would build up its educational , justice and governing capacity .
This is the very role suggested by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who said Canada 's abrupt departure would be a blow to the effort to stabilize the country .
Mr. Ignatieff has staked out a bold position and one that is not without risk , considering Canadians in general have grown weary of the conflict .
It does , however , provide one of the first clear delineations between him and Mr. Harper .
In fact , it almost seems like a reversal of roles , with the Liberals adopting a more activist foreign policy , while the Conservatives seem somewhat bored with world affairs .
There is no easy or cheap way forward , but it is a responsibility Canada assumed when it joined the coalition to oust the Taliban eight years ago .
Since then , Canadians have performed admirably in both the military and civilian spheres , but the job is not done .
Mr. Ignatieff plans to promote his Afghan plan and other aspects of his foreign policy across Canada this summer , which may be his first opportunity to look like a leader .
For his part , Mr. Harper needs to dust off his briefing books and develop a plan that will ensure Canada meets its obligations to its allies and the people of the Afghanistan .

( Newser ) – Just hours after Mexican singer Sergio " El Shaka " Vega denied reports he had been murdered , he was shot dead by a suspected drug crew on his way to a concert .
The popular star was a Grupero or narcocorrido singer who extolled the exploits of drug barons and their crews , and was the target of threats by rival gangs .
Gunmen in a truck opened fire on Vega 's red cadillac in Sinaloa state , causing the singer to crash .
The thugs then " finished Vega off " with shots to his head and chest , a passenger told a Mexican newspaper .
Earlier that day , Vega , 40 , denied reports he was dead .
" It 's happened to me for years .
Someone tells a radio station or a newspaper I 've been killed , or suffered an accident , " he said .
" Then I have to call my dear mum , who has heart trouble , to reassure her . "
He said he was entrusting his fate to God .
At least 7 Grupero musicians have been killed in the last 3 years by suspected drug hitmen , reports the BBC .

A good ten years into a regeneration project that was supposed to end in the last decade , this is the state of Ballymun before the cuts begin to bite .
Almost all the green space has been swallowed by development ; many of these new houses remain unoccupied .
The promised cinema , retail centre and centres of employment never materialised , of course , but construction of housing continues .
Acknowledging defeat last year , Treasury Holdings invited former retailers in the the almost deserted shopping centre ( gutted by buy - outs and closures ) to return on a “ temporary ” basis , until the new town centre was up and running .
A new Civic Centre was built at a cost of tens of millions , but planning notices ( invariably denoting extinguishment of right of way to accommodate development ) continue to direct residents to lodge objections at the council facility in Finglas .
Here , at the now - unoccupied flats on Sillogue Road , an unknown urban chronicler - in - graffiti sets us on our journey with a dash of cheerful fatalism :
Capturing that image was not without risk ; this is what hangs precipitously overhead :
This ground floor flat ’s boarding has been wrenched off by persons unknown …
… but almost all the metal firedoors , such as this one , which sealed the disused flats above have been professionally removed .
Presumably they were needed elsewhere and the council could n’t afford new ones .
It ’s an open invitation to squat in dangerous , structurally unsound and insanitary conditions :
Rubbish piled around the back of the tower blocks ; its volume has increased markedly since the Labour - controlled Dublin City Council voted to abolish the bin waiver just before Christmas .
Rather poignantly , the rubbish is dumped outside what used to be the garbage storage area fed by the chute system when the flats were in use .
It has lain rotting in the sun for weeks :
Recession ?
What recession !
P. Elliott & Company are still making out like bandits .
Despite bucking the construction downturn by remaining hugely profitable , the company laid off brickies and replaced them with sub-contractors on this development late last year .
The site was picketed as a result ; for all the neighbourhood ’s unjust reputation for lawlessness , the consequent Garda deployment at the small picket was the biggest seen in Ballymun for decades .
The hoarding which runs parallel to the Ballymun Road at Coultry has become something of a wailing wall for fringe republican groups ; this poster is typical .
Otherwise , political engagement with the community is minimal , bordering on non-existent .
These images may be graphic in their own way , but the detritus of a community eviscerated by neglect is as nothing compared to the effect on human lives .
Take a good look at these pictures ; when journalists , politicians and commentators talk , voices plangent with squirely concern , about fiscal consolidation , painful decisions and essential cuts , this is what they have in mind for you and yours , unless you happen to be one of them .
For a while in the 1980s and 1990s , Ballymun became something of a cause célèbre , an icon of “ social deprivation ” ( the phrase that briefly made it acceptable for liberals to take an interest in inequality without proposing to do anything about it ) , a towering confirmation of the doctrine that poverty was a state of mind .
What you see above is the end result of Capitalism With Irish Characteristics , what Labour and Fine Gael euphemistically refer to as “ developer - led planning ” ( a shibboleth and get - out clause rolled into one . )
A change of government will do little to cushion the impending blow .
Local , i.e.
Labour , government is just as culpable ( if not vastly more culpable ) for the state the community finds itself in today .
Can Ballymun take it ?
At every level of interaction with the state , Ballymunners have come to realise that their options are to keep their heads down and suffer , or resist and suffer more .
That ’s the great thing about capitalism .
It ’s all about choice .

* Medvedev says oil firm levy could pay for disaster fund
* Says to introduce pollution bill in Russia
* Calls for oil firms to pay levy for eco disaster fund .
TORONTO , June 27 ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called on Sunday for a special levy on oil companies to finance a fund to help clean up environmental disasters such as BP 's BP.L oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Medvedev , who heads the world ’s biggest energy producer , made a proposal for a global pollution fund at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto .
He said G20 leaders had asked experts to work on the idea .
“ One of the ideas , which still needs discussion , is for dues from major international companies which produce oil to be placed into a special consolidated fund or , and perhaps together with that , for the insurance of such risks paid for by those corresponding dues , ” Medvedev told reporters .
Russia has paid close attention to BP ’s reaction to the Gulf spill , the largest in U.S. history , partly because 25 percent of the British energy giant ’s global output comes from its Moscow - based TNK - BP joint venture .
The G20 rich and emerging economies called for oil companies to ensure rules were followed to prevent such oil spills in the future .
“ Following the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , we recognize the need to share best practices to protect the marine environment , prevent accidents related to offshore exploration and development , as well as transportation , and deal with their consequences , ” G20 leaders said in a communique .
Medvedev said Russia was ready to introduce pollution legislation in the lower house of parliament , the Duma , to protect its coast from oil spills , which environmentalists say routinely destroy the environment in Russia .
“ So as to set an example , Russia is prepared to send to the Duma a special bill on the defense of the sea from oil pollution , ” Medvedev said .
He gave no further details .

( CNN ) --
Before the explosion of social media , Ken Altshuler , a divorce lawyer in Maine , dug up dirt on his client 's spouses the old - fashioned way : with private investigators and subpoenas .
Now the first place his team checks for evidence is Facebook .
Consider a recent story of a female client in her 30s , who came to Altshuler seeking a divorce from husband .
She claimed her husband , an alcoholic , was drinking again .
The husband denied it .
It was her word against his word , Altshuler says , until a mutual friend of the couple stumbled across Facebook photos of the husband drinking beer at a party a few weeks earlier .
It was the kind of " gotcha moment " Altshuler knew would undermine the husband 's credibility in court .
His firm presented the photos to the judge , and the wife won the case in April , he said .
" Facebook is a great source of evidence , " Altshuler said .
" It 's absolutely solid evidence because he 's the author of it .
How do you deny that you put that on ? "
Social media stalking skills have become invaluable to the legal world for divorce cases in particular .
Online photo albums , profile pages , wall comments , status updates and tweets have become gold mines for evidence and leads .
Today , divorce and family law firms routinely cull information posted on social media sites -- the flirty exchanges with a paramour , unsavory self - revelations and compromising photographs -- to buttress their case .
Posting hugging and kissing photos online can show a happily married relationship , or it can expose a secretive affair .
At least 80 percent of attorneys surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited a growth in the number of cases that used social media over the last five years .
The study was released earlier this year .
Divorce attorneys say social media sites have opened windows for infidelity because it 's become easier to rekindle romance with an old flame or flirt with a stranger .
And the posted , shared , and tagged evidence of infidelity is precisely the type of evidence attorneys look for online .
" You need to familiarize yourself with privacy settings to ensure there is no way personal information can be accessed , " said Adam Ostrow , editor in chief of Mashable.com , a social media guide .
Facebook -- where attorneys find most of the evidence and leads -- has gradually relaxed privacy settings over the last year .
Attorneys say that enabled some members ' personal details to be leaked without the user realizing it , attorneys say .
On May 26th , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem and , in a blog , announced new tools making it easier for users to tighten privacy settings and block outside parties from seeing personal information .
" It 's becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out , " said Lee Rosen , a divorce attorney in North Carolina , who added he reaped the benefits of the tricky privacy controls in a recent case .
Rosen was investigating a North Carolina husband in his 40s accused of cheating on his wife .
The husband failed to set privacy controls on his Facebook wall , an area where users can post information .
Rosen noticed a suspicious message from the husband 's younger female co-worker .
The post was the hunch he needed to steer him in right direction .
Rosen reports about a quarter of his divorce cases use information found on social media sites .
Finding the Facebook profiles is so simple that Rosen says anyone could do it .
He goes to a site called Flowtown.com , a site intended for marketers but is useful for attorneys , too .
Type an e-mail address and the site generates various social media profiles .
If that fails , Rosen hires a private investigator .
At National Digital Forensics , Inc. , a North Carolina company that mines digital sites for information , requests for social media searches from divorce lawyers have surged , says president and senior digital investigator Giovanni Masucci .
The social media detective work requires different snooping skills , he says .
" For example , someone may be cheating , but they are married , " Masucci explained .
" If their status on the web page says single , that 's a major red flag . "
Masucci estimated about half the social media cases they investigate expose some kind of cheating .
The happy reality for divorce attorneys is that most clients are bound to be on Facebook or another social media site .
Facebook is more popular than ever , drawing in 400 million users , the company reports on its website .
Each user creates an average of 70 pieces of content monthly and has an average of 130 friends .
The most common way to gather information on Facebook relies on the battling couple 's mutual online friends who still have access to the spouse 's profile .
Many times the spouse will " de - friend " a partner but forget about their shared friends , who can play detective and access information on their profile .
Another way of exposing damaging information is searching the profiles of the suspected " other man " or " other woman " , says says Marlene Eskind Moses , a divorce attorney in Tennessee .
" It 's amazing how people tell their life stories , " said Moses , who represented a Tennessee woman who believed her husband was cheating on her .
After the wife found herself blocked from her husband 's Facebook page , she found the profile page of the other woman whom she suspected in the affair .
On that woman 's profile page , a public album of photos taken on a romantic getaway appeared .
Scenic shots of South Carolina 's mountains .
Her husband and another woman embracing in front of an art gallery .
Portraits of the couple with their faces nuzzled close together .
Elizabeth K. Englander , professor of psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts , says people divulge information on social media because they believe no one will ever see the information they post .
" The sense online is sort of like the mob effect , " Englander said .
" You feel like you 're one in a million , and so who will ever notice you ? "
But when someone does notice , that 's when some divorce attorneys pounce .
Information copied from social media sites can sway the outcome of alimony payment disputes and custody fights , attorneys say .
Some parents have even lost a child because of the behavior they exhibited online , the lawyers say .
The ultimate goal , after all , is to catch a spouse in a lie .
Sometimes it's a wife claiming she can't afford child support payments but subsequently purchased expensive jewelry and posted photos of the items on Facebook .
Or if a husband who claims he does n't have anger problems while his social media profile is loaded with expletives .
Once there is evidence of a person caught in an obvious lie , attorneys say , it undermines the rest of their credibility with the judge .
Attorneys advise users of Facebook and other social media who are headed toward a divorce or custody battle to edit their profiles , be cautious about updating statuses and double check to see who is really a " friend . "
Or to make things easier -- at least until the trial is over or a settlement is reached -- just get off Facebook completely .

LPN / LVN Certificate or Diploma
A licensed practical nurse ( LPN ) certificate is a nondegree diploma offered at hospitals , vocational schools , and community colleges .
In Texas and California , this role is known as a licensed vocational nurse ( LVN ) .
Both LPN and LVN programs prepare you to work under the supervision of RNs and perform the following key duties :
Take vital signs
Report patient conditions
Change wound dressings and insert catheters
Assist with tests , sample collection , and procedures
Administer medication and injections
Improve patient comfort
In addition to clinical applications , you ’ll also learn about general medical topics that include anatomy , physiology , nutrition , and emergency care .
Specialty certifications in areas such as IV therapy , long - term care , pharmacology , and breastfeeding support are also available .
Who it ’s for An LPN / LVN certificate is for students who want to enter the nursing field without the time and cost of earning a college degree .
In contrast to a CNA diploma , the LPN certificate represents mastery of a more comprehensive body of knowledge .
In many states , LPNs and LVNs qualify to supervise CNAs .
An LPN / LVN certificate could be right for you if you ’re in one of the following groups :
Recent high school graduates who want a nursing career without committing to a traditional college degree
CNAs ready to expand their responsibilities and job opportunities
Career changers who ca n’t afford the downtime required to complete a college degree
Prospective nurses preparing for admission into a registered nursing program Many LPNs eventually go on to earn advanced degrees .
Because of this , it ’s important to earn an LPN / LVN certificate from an accredited nursing program .
In many cases , credits earned in a nonaccredited program wo n’t be eligible for transfer to a higher degree .
Length of time Most LPN / LVN certificates can be completed in about 12 months , though your timing may vary .
State - approved programs provide the number of clinical hours necessary to meet the certification requirements of your state .
Depending on your criteria , programs can range between 7 and 24 months .
What you can do with this certificate With an LPN / LVN certificate , you ’ll be qualified to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses ( NCLEX - PN ) created by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing ( NCSBN ) .
Passing this exam and meeting your state - specific requirements will make you eligible for licensing .
With your certificate in hand , you can go on to find jobs in a number of different places .
According to the BLS , the majority of LPNs and LVNs work in nursing and residential care facilities .
Other common employment options include administrative and clinical positions in locations such as : Hospitals
Physicians ’ offices
Home healthcare services
Assisted living facilities
Clinical research facilities
Diagnostic testing centers
Government agencies
What you can earn
In 2018 , LPNs and LVNs earned an average annual wage of $ 47,050 .

Associate ’s Degree in Nursing
An associate ’s degree in nursing ( ADN ) is the minimum requirement for becoming a registered nurse ( RN ) .
As an RN , you ’ll have the credentials necessary to qualify for most nursing jobs that involve providing critical patient care and assisting physicians .
You ’ll find ADN programs at community colleges and some 4 - year institutions .
Some schools also offer online nursing degrees in hybrid programs that combine virtual instruction with on - site clinical training .
ADN programs will give you the knowledge and experience RNs need to perform the following duties :
Assist physicians during exams , surgeries , and other medical procedures
Dress wounds and incisions
Run and analyze diagnostics tests
Review patient treatment plans and chart progress
Supervise LPNs , LVNs , and CNAs
Provide patient education on self - care
The curriculum for an ADN also includes studying science - related courses such as anatomy , biology , chemistry , and physiology .
Who it ’s for An ADN from an accredited nursing school is a good choice if you want to become an RN without the commitment of a 4 - year degree .
It ’s important to note , however , that while this is the minimum education for licensing , employers are increasingly making bachelor ’s degrees a requirement for new hires .
In some states , RNs with associate ’s degrees will eventually need to earn a bachelor ’s in order to maintain their license .
The good news is that most bachelor ’s programs will allow you to transfer some basic credits earned from your accredited ADN .
An ADN might be the right choice if you ’re in one of the following groups :
Recent high school graduates who are planning for a long - term nursing career
Career changers who can make the time and financial commitment to earn an RN
Parents who want a career with flexible scheduling and financial security
CNAs and LPNs ready to fast - track into RN positions
Length of time ADNs typically require around 2 –3 years to complete .
State - approved programs will include the extensive on - site clinical training that aligns with your state ’s requirements for licensing .
What you can do with this degree Earning an associate ’s degree in nursing will make you eligible to take the NCLEX - RN , a prerequisite for RN licensure in all U.S. states .
With RNs in high demand , nurses can often then secure jobs that offer tuition reimbursement to continue their nursing education at a reduced personal expense .
After earning their license , the BLS says more than half of all RNs go on to work in hospitals , but you can use your credential in many types of environments .
Consider pursuing a career in : Ambulatory healthcare services
Physicians ’ offices
Nursing and residential care facilities
Government agencies and the military
Educational services and schools
Health insurance companies
Travel nursing organizations
What you can earn Salaries for nurses vary widely depending on their education , level of experience , setting in which they work , and any specialty they may have .
That said , the BLS reports the average annual salary across the U.S. to be $ 77,030 .
Those working in high - level roles within the government , research facilities , or pharmaceutical companies could earn significantly more .

Bachelor of Science in Nursing
A Bachelor of Science in Nursing ( BSN ) is a 4 - year degree designed for RNs who want to pursue supervisory roles and qualify for higher - paying jobs .
With a combination of academic classwork and on - site clinical training , you ’ll learn about scientific areas such as anatomy , biology , and chemistry , as well as specific duties related to patient care , laboratory testing , designing treatment plans , and assisting with surgery .
Some schools even offer programs that allow you to earn a BSN in a particular specialty of nursing such as acute care , geriatric nursing , infectious disease , pediatrics , and psychiatry , just to name a few .
Specializing can often increase your job opportunities and potential earnings .
Who it ’s for
If you ’re ready to work as a RN , a BSN could be right for you if you have the time and financial resources to commit to 4 years .
A BSN is also an ideal starting place if your ultimate goal is to earn a master ’s degree and work as an advanced practice nurse .
However , as the demand for nurses with BSNs grows , more schools are catering their programs to students beyond the categories listed above .
Depending on your situation , you can find a traditional program or one designed to apply education you ’ve already earned .
Traditional BSN Traditional BSN degree programs are intended for recent high school graduates who have little to no professional healthcare experience .
Requirements are similar to other bachelor ’s degree programs , though specific science prerequisites may be necessary .
LPN - to - BSN LPN - to - BSN degree programs , often called “ bridge programs , ” allow LPNs / LVNs to get degree credit for their previous education and experience .
For these students , earning a BSN usually requires taking liberal arts coursework not offered in LPN / LVN programs .
RN - to - BSN RN - to - BSN degree programs are designed for RNs who already have an associate ’s degree .
Graduates of accredited ADN programs often transfer educational credits to meet some of the BSN course requirements , meaning they can earn their bachelor ’s in a less amount of time .
Second degree BSN Second degree BSNs are meant for career changers who hold a previous bachelor ’s degree in a non-nursing field .
These programs allow students to satisfy some of the BSN ’s liberal arts requirements by transferring credits from their first degree , again lessening the length of time .
Length of time
Traditional BSN programs require 4 years of full - time study .
Students who have LPN or RN licensing , or bachelor ’s degree in a different field , might qualify for alternative BSN programs that could be completed in 1 – 2 years .
Since so many working RNs pursue BSNs for career advancement , there are many flexible part - time and online options , though they may extend your time to completion .
What you can earn
As with RNs with associate ’s degree , salaries vary based on a number of different factors .
While the average for all RNs is $ 75,510 , those in the top 10 % earn more than $ 106,000 per year .
With a BSN , you can often expect to make more than with an associate’s .
$ 75,510 Median Annual Salary
RNs
Master of Science in Nursing
A Master of Science in Nursing ( MSN ) is a graduate program of study designed for nurses who want to practice in a specialized role known as an advanced practice registered nurse ( APRN ) .
The curriculum is an MSN program is tailored far more than a general nursing degree .
You ’ll dive deep into a concentrated area of study while taking advanced courses in topics such as leadership , management , healthcare policy , and research .
Who it ’s for Requirements vary by program , but MSNs are typically designed for licensed RNs who have already completed a bachelor ’s - level education .
That said , some MSN programs offer admission to RNs with associate ’s degree ’s , allowing them to pursue a bachelor ’s and master ’s simultaneously .
You might qualify for an MSN program if you ’re in one of the following groups : Students with accredited BSN degrees and current RN licenses
RNs with extensive clinical experience but no BSN
Career changers with bachelor ’s degrees in non-nursing but related fields
Length of time Students who begin MSN programs with a BSN typically take about 2 years to complete their degree .
If you ’re pursuing an MSN without BSN credentials or with a bachelor ’s in another field , you can expect roughly 3 years .
What you can do with this degree With an MSN , you ’ll be prepared to work as an APRN in your area of concentration .
To do so , you ’ll need you hold a state license as an RN as well as a national credential in your specialty .
Specializations vary by program , but common options include the following :
Nurse practitioner A nurse practitioner ’s ( NP ) duties are similar to those of physicians .
While some states require NPs to work under a physician ’s supervision , NPs have more responsibility for diagnosing and treating patients than traditional RNs .
Clinical nurse specialist Working as a clinical nurse specialist ( CNS ) involves applying advanced training and education to a specific patient group or type of treatment .
The specialty area of a CNS can be defined by a specific population , disease , type of care , or treatment setting .
Certified nurse midwife
The role of a certified nurse midwife ( CNM ) includes working with mothers during pregnancy , birth , and postpartum phases .
CNMs are considered primary providers in all 50 states .
Certified nurse anesthetist A certified nurse anesthetist ( CNA ) works closely with physicians to safely administer anesthesia prior to procedures , monitor the patient during surgery , oversee the recovery , and develop plans for pain management .
Due to the risk factors involved with anesthesia , some hospitals may require their anesthetists to have doctoral degrees .
What you can earn
The salaries of APRNs vary depending on the exact job title , where they work , and level of responsibility .
As of 2018 , the BLS offers these general guidelines for average salaries : Nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists : $ 110,030 per year
$ 110,030 per year Nurse midwives : $ 106,910
$ 106,910 Nurse anesthetists : $ 174,790 $ 110,030 Median Annual Salary

Joint Master ’s Degrees in Nursing
Earning a joint master ’s degree in nursing could be right for you if you want to earn an MSN and a complementary degree in less time than completing 2 separate programs .
You ’ll get a solid education in nursing practice and theory while gaining advanced skills in another area that can help you tailor your career .
Who they ’re for Joint master ’s degrees are designed for nurses who want to guide their careers toward specific types of leadership positions .
Keep in mind that in order to pursue a joint degree you have to gain admission into each separate program .
These degrees are meant for very serious students only , as you ’ll need to work on 2 demanding course loads at the same time .
Length of time
It typically takes between 18 months and 3 years of full - time study to complete a joint master ’s degree in nursing .
While part - time and online options are available to accommodate working schedules , they ’ll likely extend your time to completion .
What you can do with these degrees
Any joint degree will expand your opportunities for advancement and higher earnings .
Specific roles will depend on the type of degrees you earn , but there are 3 common combinations .
Joint MSN / MPH
Pairing an MSN with a Master of Public Health ( MPH ) is designed for nurses who want to pursue leadership positions in community or public health organizations .
Joint MSN / MBA Combining an MSN with a Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) is sometimes known as being in the “ Nurse Executive Program . ”
Here , students learn the business skills necessary to hold executive - level roles in hospitals and other large healthcare organizations .
Joint MSN / MHA Earning an MSN with a Master of Health Administration ( MHA ) offers similar benefits to those of the joint degrees listed above , but the combination is a bit broader .
You ’ll be educated about making important decisions related to the management of various healthcare organizations and educational settings .
What you can earn
The BLS does n’t report data for jobs that specifically require joint degrees , however , roles that fall under the general umbrella of healthcare executives and administrators earn an average annual wage of $ 113,730 .
According to hundreds of salaries submitted to PayScale , chief nursing officers make an average of $ 126,318 a year .
Those who go on to become vice presidents or CEOs of healthcare organizations or related nonprofits might see their salary climb even higher .

Healthcare executives and administrators
Doctoral Degrees in Nursing
Doctoral degrees in nursing are terminal degrees intended to help students gain the knowledge necessary to teach at the university level , conduct research in the field , or pursue high - level roles similar to those for students with joint master ’s degrees .
Who they ’re for
In some programs , these degrees are only for those who have their master ’s .
In others , BSN graduates may qualify for programs that allow them to earn an MSN and doctoral degree at the same time .
No matter what type of program you choose , you ’ll need to enter with a degree specifically in nursing and clinical experience under your belt .
Length of time
On average , a doctoral degree in nursing takes anywhere from 3 – 6 years to complete , though your timeline depends on the type of degree you seek .
What you can do with this degree
Your career opportunities will vary , but there are 3 primary options based on your degree .
Doctor of Nursing Practice ( DNP ) A DNP is a practice - oriented degree that emphasizes clinical leadership and advanced theory .
It can help you qualify for higher - paying executive positions in hospitals and other healthcare organizations .
Doctor of Nursing Philosophy ( PhD ) A nursing PhD focuses on scientific content and the creation of new research in the field .
PhD programs typically include the completion of a dissertation and research papers .
This degree can help you qualify for leadership positions in research and academia .
Doctor of Nursing Science ( DNSc or DNS ) The Doctor of Nursing Science ( DNSc or DNS ) is a research - based doctoral degree .
Like a PhD , it prepares graduates for roles as nurse educators and researchers .
What you can earn
As with those with a joint master ’s degree , it ’s hard to say exactly what you might earn with a doctorate in nursing .
Salaries can vary by tens of thousands of dollars depending on your position , your employer , your location , and more .
Nurse educators at the university level earn an average annual wage of $ 80,380 , while executives in research facilities might make more than $ 150,000 a year .

Crawford Caligula and the GOP ran up a huge deficit , through the implementation of their only successful program , No Millionaire Left Behind .
Now those same Republicans have become deficit hawks , blaming Obama for the deficit and demanding immediate return to a balanced budget .
A balanced budget , like the one Clinton left and the GOP squandered on the road to trashing our economy , is a worthy goal .
However , this is the wrong time .
Robert Reich illustrates this point .
When I was a small boy at the start of the 1950s , my father gave me my first economics lesson .
“ Bobby , ” he said with obvious concern , “ you and your children and your children ’s children will be repaying the national debt created by Franklin D. Roosevelt . ”
I did n’t know what a national debt was , but I remember being scared out of my wits .
Dad was wrong , of course .
Even though the national debt then was a much higher percentage of the national economy than it is today , it shrank as the economy boomed .
My children have never mentioned FDR ’s debt .
My granddaughter ( almost 2 ) will never pay a penny of it .
Dad , now 96 and still in good health , recognizes how wrong he was then .
He admits FDR ’s deficit spending not only won World War II but it also got America out of the Great Depression .
But now another gaggle of deficit hawks is warning us against more federal spending .
“ The current federal debt explosion is being driven by an inability to stem new spending initiatives , ” warns Alan Greenspan in Friday ’s Wall Street Journal [ Murdoch delinked ] , calling for budget cuts and saying “ the fears of budget contraction inducing a renewed decline of economic activity are misplaced . ”
My dad learned from his mistakes .
Alan Greenspan obviously did n’t .
Contrary to Greenspan , today ’s debt is not being driven by new spending initiatives .
It ’s being driven by policies that Greenspan himself bears major responsibility for .
Greenspan supported George W. Bush ’s gigantic tax cut in 2001 ( that went mostly to the rich ) , and uttered no warnings about W ’s subsequent spending frenzy on the military and a Medicare drug benefit ( corporate welfare for Big Pharma ) — all of which contributed massively to today ’s debt .
Greenspan also lowered short - term interest rates to zero in 2002 but refused to monitor what Wall Street was doing with all this free money .
Years before that , he urged Congress to repeal the Glass - Steagall Act and he opposed oversight of derivative trading .
All this contributed to Wall Street ’s implosion in 2008 that led to massive bailout , and a huge contraction of the economy that required the stimulus package .
These account for most of the rest of today ’s debt .
If there ’s a single American more responsible for today ’s “ federal debt explosion ” than Alan Greenspan , I do n’t know him .
But we can manage the Greenspan Debt if we get the U.S. economy growing again .
The only way to do that when consumers ca n’t and wo n’t spend and when corporations wo n’t invest is for the federal government to pick up the slack .
For Greenspan now to say we do n’t need more stimulus — when 15 million Americans are still out of work , when retail sales are dropping , when the rate of mortgage delinquencies is still in the stratosphere , when Europe and Japan are tightening their belts — is like Tony Hayward saying the Gulf spill should n’t worry us .
America ’s long - term debt bomb is a future problem to be sure .
But it has nothing to do with current spending initiatives .
It will be due mainly to baby boomers ’ demands for health care .
Our immediate challenge is to get enough demand back into the economy to pull ourselves out of the deep hole Greenspan helped create … [ emphasis added ]
The Detroit Red Wings typically select small , skilled players with their first pick in the entry draft , due to their low drafting position .
This year , they had the 21st selection in the first round , their second - highest pick in 19 years .
It enabled the Red Wings to take a player with size and grit , as they chose Notre Dame center Riley Sheahan Friday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles .
“ He ’s a big , strong , power forward type of player , ’’ Red Wings assistant general manager Jim Nill said .
“ We took a big guy , finally .
None of this , ‘ He ’s a little weak , but he ’ll get stronger . ’
“ We ’ll be patient , but he ’s advanced physically , which is nice for a young player . ’’
The 6 - foot - 2 , 202 - pound Sheahan had 17 points ( six goals , 11 assists ) in 37 games as a freshman with the Fighting Irish in 2009 - 10 .
As the youngest player in the CCHA , some scouts attributed his modest offensive output to the tough adjustment he had to make competing against players who were , on average , several years older than him .
“ I ’m a big player and I like to use my size to my advantage , ’’ Sheahan said .
“ I ’m a pass first , shoot second kind of player .
I like to make my teammates better .
I can be responsible in my own end .
I think I can be a leader in the dressing room and that I have the respect of my teammates . ’’
Sheahan played on one of Notre Dame ’s top two lines and played on the power play and killed penalties , due to the team ’s rash of injuries .
He was forced to play defense for a couple of games due to the injuries .
He is described as having great instincts and playmaking skills , as well as being competitive and strong on the puck .
He needs to work on his skating .
“ I do n’t like to make comparisons with young players .
It ’s not really fair to them , ’’ Nill said .
“ But he does remind me of ( Detroit power forward ) Johan Franzen .
He ’s got a big , thick body .
He ’s been a big scorer .
That ’s what we project him to be . ’’
Sheahan was ranked 22nd among North American skaters in Central Scouting , down from his mid-term ranking of fifth .
He was ranked 19th by The Hockey News .
Prior to joining Notre Dame , Sheahan played two seasons with the St. Catharines Falcons in the Ontario Hockey Association Golden Horseshoe League , recording 27 goals and 73 points in 40 games in 2008 - 2009 .
“ He was one of the few freshmen playing college hockey last year , ’’ Nill said .
“ He was a big scorer in junior hockey where he came from .
For a freshman in college hockey , he played very well . ’’
A fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs , Sheahan said of the Red Wings : “ I ’m going to one of the best teams in the NHL .
I think about some of the great players they ’ve had -- Steve Yzerman and Pavel Datsyuk -- and I ’m really looking forward to it . ’’
He likely will remain at Notre Dame for at least two more seasons .
“ I like that they ’re patient with their young players , that they give you a chance to develop , ’’ Sheahan said .
This is the Red Wings ’ highest pick since they selected defenseman Jakub Kindl with the 19th selection in the 2005 draft , following the NHL lockout .
“ There were about three or four guys we knew were kind of sitting there .
You ’re just waiting to see who else is going to make picks , ’’ Nill said .
“ We got down to our last two guys and one of those guys went just before us ( Beau Bennett to Pittsburgh ) . ’’
Detroit has a pick in each of the final six rounds , which are on Saturday .
Wings lukewarm on Russian defenseman
Russian defenseman Evgeny Ryasensky , a 23 - year - old free agent playing in the KHL , was quoted in Soviet Sport as saying he intends to sign with the Red Wings and compete for a roster spot in training camp .
But Nill is n’t so sure that will happen .
“ His agent contacted us , so he ’s probably called every team , ’’ Nill said .
“ He ’s 23 , so he ’d still be on an entry - level deal which would pay him $ 60,000 in the minor leagues ( Grand Rapids Griffins ) .
If he does n’t make your team , is he going to want to stay and play for that ?
That ’s the risk you have to decide whether you want to take . ’’
This April 21 , 2010 , photo shows the Deepwater Horizon oil platform leaning on its side before sinking into the Gulf of Mexico .
Anonymous / ASSOCIATED PRESS
BP said Monday it hopes to siphon as much as half of the oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico and is getting ready to shoot mud into a blown - out well later this week to try and stop all of it .
BP PLC chief operating officer Doug Suttles said at a press conference that the company will never again try to produce oil from the well , though BP did not rule out drilling elsewhere in the reservoir .
" The right thing to do is permanently plug this well , and that 's what we will do , " Suttles said .
Meanwhile , scientists said they were concerned about the ooze reaching a major ocean current that could carry it through the Florida Keys and up the East Coast .
Suttles said a mile - long tube is funneling a little more than 42,000 gallons of crude a day from a blown - out well into a tanker ship .
That would be about a fifth of the 210,000 gallons the company and the U.S. Coast Guard have estimated are gushing out each day , though scientists who have studied video of the leak say it could be much bigger and even BP acknowledges there 's no way to know for sure how much oil there is .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
Suttles said the siphoning does appear to be removing some oil from the surface of the ocean and BP would be pleased if it eventually captures half of it .
" Our efforts offshore are making a big difference now , " he said .
In the nearly a month since an oil rig called the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana , killing 11 workers , BP has made several failed attempts to stop the leak , trying in vain to activate emergency valves and lowering a 100 - ton container that got clogged with icy crystals .
Chemicals being sprayed underwater are helping to disperse the oil and keep it from washing ashore in great quantities .
But millions of gallons are already in the Gulf , and researchers said that in recent days they have discovered miles - long underwater plumes of oil that could poison and suffocate sea life across the food chain , with damage that could endure for a decade or more .
Tar balls have been sporadically washing up on beaches in several states , including Mississippi , where at least 60 have been found .
Engineers finally got the contraption to siphon the oil working Sunday after several setbacks .
BP PLC engineers remotely guiding robot submersibles had worked since Friday to place the tube into a 21 - inch pipe nearly a mile below the sea .
Crews will slowly increase how much the tube is collecting over the next few days .
They need to move slowly because they do n't want too much frigid seawater entering the pipe , which could combine with gases to form the same ice - like crystals that doomed the previous containment effort .
The company said Monday that it has started drilling a second well to relieve pressure on the blown - out well and also getting ready to try a procedure known as a top - kill that uses a tube to shoot mud and concrete directly into a device on the well called the blowout preventer .
Both of those procedures should stop all of the oil .
As engineers worked to get a better handle on the spill , a researcher told The Associated Press that computer models show the oil may have already seeped into a powerful water stream known as the loop current , which could propel it into the Atlantic Ocean .
A boat is being sent later this week to collect samples and learn more .
" This ca n't be passed off as 'it 's not going to be a problem , " ' said William Hogarth , dean of the University of South Florida 's College of Marine Science .
" This is a very sensitive area .
We are concerned with what happens in the Florida Keys . "
Hogarth said a computer model shows oil has already entered the loop current , while a second shows the oil is 3 miles from it - still dangerously close .
The models are based on weather , ocean current and spill data from the U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , among other sources .
Hogarth said it 's still too early to know what specific amounts of oil will make it to Florida , or what damage it might do to the sensitive Keys or beaches on Florida 's Atlantic coast .
He said claims by BP that the oil would be less damaging to the Keys after traveling over hundreds of miles from the spill site were not mollifying .
Once it reaches the tanker , the oil is being separated from the natural gas and sea water .
The natural gas is being burned off , while the crude is being sent to oil terminals .
Meanwhile , scientists warned of the effects of the oil that has already leaked into the Gulf .
Researchers have found more underwater plumes of oil than they can count from the well , said Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia .
" The discovery of these plumes argues that a lot more oil and gas is coming out of that well every day , and I think everybody has gotten that fact except BP , " she said .

Shortly after midnight in the US state of Utah , Attorney General Mark Shurtleff picked up his Apple iPhone , opened up a Twitter " app " on his handset and began tweeting .
But Mr Shurtleff 's 134 - character composition was no ordinary post .
This was not a piece of miscellany from the 53 - year - old 's home life , a link chosen to amuse or interest his followers , nor even a political prod at his Democratic rivals .
Instead , Mr Shurtleff used Twitter to announce that most important of all things : the death of a human being , convicted murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner .
Utah has sentenced Ronnie Lee Gardner to death by FIRING SQUAD .
What is this ?
The 1800s ?
Nicolas Callegari , South African tweeter Read Nicolas ' tweets here
" I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner 's execution .
May
God grant him the mercy he denied his victims , " the attorney general wrote .
The message would have been seen by the 7,000 or so users who " follow " Mr Shurtleff on Twitter .
But thanks to the exponential way in which messages are spread on Twitter - being " retweeted " by those who find them interesting - the Utah politician 's words soon found their way to a wider audience .
' Final nod '
In all Mark Shurtleff sent three tweets around the time that a five - man firing squad put Gardner to death .
In his first , sent at 1318 local time ( 1918 GMT ) on Thursday , Mr Shurtleff acknowledged the gravity of the occasion .
" A solemn day .
Barring a stay by Sup Ct [ US Supreme Court ] , & with my final nod , Utah will use most extreme power & execute a killer .
Mourn his victims .
Justice " .
Later he posted confirmation that he had indeed given that " final nod " .
Fifteen minutes after that , at 0015 local time , his Tweet served a purpose more recognisable to regular users of the service : self - publicity .
" We will be streaming live my press conference as soon as I 'm told Gardner is dead .
Watch it at www.attorneygeneral.Utah.gov/live.html " he wrote .
Image caption Mark Shurtleff has twice won re-election as Utah attorney general
Mr Shurtleff was doing nothing unusual : politicians and news organisations now routinely send out tweets to alert people to the latest developments .
But as Twitter users digested endless breaking news flashes alerting them to the death of a man by firing squad in the United States , for some Mr Shurtleff 's remarks stood out from the rest .
Within minutes a line from the BBC 's news story was in circulation : " Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff used the Twitter micro- blogging site to say he had given the go - ahead for execution . "
Reacting to the news one British tweeter , Sam Delaney , under his username Fyshdesign , wrote simply : " That 's awful ! "
Switzerland - based Guy Ordway added simply : " Crikey " .
A Bangkok tweeter adopted Twitter parlance , dubbing the event the " twttrexecution " .
Another user , known only as Brenstrong , observed in a public reply that : " death penalty bad enough .
Firing squad !
And there 's an absurdity to a man 's demise being announced over twitter ... "
Gardner 's execution was not Mr Shurtleff 's first foray on Twitter .
He first made headlines in 2009 when he posted in public a message intended to be sent privately - revealing tentative plans to run for the US Senate .
He has now sent 632 tweets and appears to use the service regularly to update his followers on events in Utah .
For some at least , using Twitter to announce the execution of a man is just an extension of that public service .
Utah resident Davy , known on Twitter as jockhippie , summed up that train of thought : " Good job mark shurtleff !
using twitter ! "
Abstract Understanding the mechanisms underlying speciation remains a challenge in evolutionary biology .
The adaptive radiation of Darwin 's finches is a prime example of species formation , and their study has revealed many important insights into evolutionary processes .
Here , we report striking differences in mating signals ( songs ) , morphology and genetics between the two remnant populations of Darwin 's mangrove finch Camarhynchus heliobates , one of the rarest species in the world .
We also show that territorial males exhibited strong discrimination of sexual signals by locality : in response to foreign songs , males responded weaker than to songs from their own population .
Female responses were infrequent and weak but gave approximately similar results .
Our findings not only suggest speciation in the mangrove finch , thereby providing strong support for the central role of sexual signals during speciation , but they have also implications for the conservation of this iconic bird .
If speciation is complete , the eastern species will face imminent extinction , because it has a population size of only 5 – 10 individuals .

Introduction Speciation is the fundamental evolutionary process that generates biological diversity .
New species originate and remain thereafter separate if they are reproductively isolated , in other words , reproductive isolation separates evolving lineages by cutting off gene flow between them [ 1 ] .
Such reproductive isolation may be prezygotic , i.e. before fertilization , or postzygotic , i.e. after fertilization .
Prezygotic reproductive isolation occurs when individuals do not mate because of behavioural differences , most importantly mate choice [ 2 ] .
A premating barrier is often related to geographic variation in mating signals that influences mate recognition [ 3 ] – [ 6 ] .
Thus , geographic divergence in sexual signals is regarded as an important factor in species formation , with bird song being a particular useful model [ 7 ] .
The songs of oscine birds are unusual in that they serve a role in identifying conspecific mates , yet they are also culturally transmitted through vocal production learning [ 8 ] , a phenomenon which is thought to accelerate allopatric speciation [ 9 ] .
Darwin's finches of the Galápagos Islands have been inspiring evolutionary theory from the times of Darwin until today [ 10 ] – [ 13 ] .
The adaptive radiation of this group of songbirds is one of the key examples of speciation and their study has revealed many important insights into evolutionary processes [ e.g. 14 ] – [ 20 ] .
The males of all Darwin 's finches sing a single , structurally simple , and unvarying song throughout life that is culturally transmitted from one generation to the next [ 11 ] , and it has been shown that females use these songs for species recognition and mate choice [ 21 ] .
Thus , song divergence may constrain the mating of females to conspecifics and thus could potentially play a crucial role in speciation by promoting genetic isolation on secondary contact [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
The mangrove finch Camarhynchus heliobates ( Fig. 1 ) is not only the rarest of Darwin 's finches , but one of the rarest birds in the world with an estimated population size of about 100 individuals [ 23 ] .
Historically the species occurred on the Galápagos islands of Isabela and Fernandina but has now disappeared from the latter [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
To date , the surviving birds are confined to two geographically separated populations on Isabela , one on the west coast of the island and a second , very small population on the east coast [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] .
The habitat of this species is confined to small , disconnected patches of mangrove that are bordered by the sea on the one side and bare lava on the other .
The two remnant mangrove finch populations are geographically separated by more than 70 km of barren lava desert and volcanic mountains .
The presence of mangrove finches on the east coast of Isabela was discovered in 1900 [ 26 ] , thus the two populations have been separated for at least 110 years .

A mangrove finch , the rarest of Darwin 's finches .
The population of the Galapagos mangrove finch ( Camarhynchus heliobates ) has fallen to about 100 individuals , making it one of the world 's most critically endangered birds .
The species is now entirely confined to mangrove forests on the east and west coast of the island of Isabela .
The main reasons for the decline in the mangrove finch are probably the impact of introduced pest species .
The black rat ( Rattus rattus ) arrived in the Galápagos on pirate vessels perhaps as early as the 16th century , whereas feral cats ( Felis catus ) , the smooth - billed ani ( Crotophaga ani ) , two species of fire ants ( Wasmannia auropunctata and Solenopsis geminate ) and a parasitc fly ( Philornis downsi ) have been introduced by humans more recently .

During earlier surveys , between three and five singing males were observed on the east coast of Isabela [ 23 ] , and the songs of these males appeared to sound different from those of the west coast [ 25 ] .
Here , we report a systematic bioacoustic analysis of songs of the two populations .
In addition , we tested with playback experiments whether mangrove finches discriminate between songs from the two localities , which would affect mate choice and thus reproductive isolation .
To further investigate possible speciation in the mangrove finch , we also studied morphological and genetic divergence between the two remnant populations .
Materials and Methods Ethics statement
All work was conducted in accordance with the “ Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioural Research and Teaching ” published by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour , and with the appropriate licences and permissions by the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Foundation .
Song recordings and acoustic analysis Song recordings and playback experiments were carried out on the Island of Isabela ( Galápagos , Ecuador ) in February and March 2009 .
During an extensive survey of the east coast of Isabela in February 2009 we found only two males , which indicates a further population decline since the last survey in 2008 [ 23 ] .
The songs of both eastern males were digitally recorded with a Marantz PMD 660 solid state recorder ( sampling rate : 44.1 kHz ) and a Sennheiser Me67 directional microphone .
With the same equipment we recorded the songs of 20 of the estimated 40 remaining males of the western population .
Some males were colour - banded ( see below ) , and in addition three un - banded western individuals could be recognized by their unique plumage coloration .
Previous observations of marked mangrove finches showed a strong site fidelity , within and between years .
All the recordings were done within one week , and therefore , we are confident in identifying individual males based on the location of their territories in cases were un - banded birds were included in the analysis .
Up to 46 ( mean 16 ) of the highest quality song recordings of each bird were analysed using Avisoft - SASLAb Pro ( R. Specht , Germany ) .
Four acoustic parameters were measured from each song : song duration ( s ) , mean syllable duration ( s ) , syllable rate ( Hz ) and peak frequency ( Hz ) , and then average values were calculated for each male .
For the analysis of temporal parameters , we calculated spectrograms with a FFT - length of 256 , which yielded a temporal resolution 5.8 ms .
For the spectral analysis , the recordings were down sampled to 16 kHz , high - pass filtered ( f co = 0.4 kHz , Hamming window , 1024 coefficients ) , and measures were taken from spectrograms with a FFT of 1024 , which yielded a spectral resolution of 16 Hz .
Differences in acoustic song characteristic between the two populations were examined with Mann - Whitney U tests .
Two - tailed P values were Bonferroni-Holm adjusted [ 27 ] .
Construction of playback stimuli
All digital editing of the playback stimuli was done with Avisoft SASLAbPro software .
In total , we constructed 12 playback files each containing the song of a different male ( 10 males from the west coast , 2 males from the east coast ) .
Each playback file had a total duration of 120 seconds including 26 songs .
The songs of all mangrove finches consist of one syllable type that is repeated from one to four times with the majority of songs having three syllables ( Fessl , unpublished data ) .
To account for the varying numbers of syllables , we used three - and two - syllable songs in the playback , thus mimicking the natural singing style of the species .
From each source male we chose the three - syllable song rendition with the highest recording quality , which was then band - pass filtered to remove background noise ( f L = 1.2 kHz , f H = 4.6 kHz , Hamming window , 1024 coefficients ) , and normalized for amplitude .
Each source song was used with its original three syllables and also with the last syllable deleted to yield a 2 - syllable song .
The source song was copied in ten groups of two 3 - syllable songs ( separated by 1.1 s silence ) and two groups of two 3 - syllable songs and one 2 - syllble song ( separated by 1.1 s silence ) into a wav - file ( sampling rate : 44.1 kHz , accuracy : 16 bit ) .
The two song groups containing 2 - syllable songs were always the third and the ninth group in the sequence .
The resulting twelve song groups were evenly distributed over the entire duration of the sound file .
None of the birds was tested with its own songs or songs recorded closer than 200 m to its territory in order to minimize the chance that subjects were familiar with the stimuli .
Although the songs of the last two eastern males were tested several times , the playback of eastern songs was not pseudoreplicated because the two males comprise the entire known population of the eastern lineage .
Playback procedure
In total , we tested 20 males from the west coast population .
Each subject received two playbacks , one with local songs and one with songs from the east coast .
Half of the birds were tested with the local songs first , the other half with the foreign songs .
Playback experiments were carried out from 20 to 26 March 2009 between 0700 and 1500 hours .
Thirteen males were tested on the same day with 30 – 70 minutes between the two treatments .
For logistic reasons , the remaining seven males were tested with the second treatment one or two days after the first playback , but both experiments were always carried out at approx .
the same time of day ( ±2 hours ) .
The playback stimuli were broadcast by a Marantz PMD 660 connected to a Logitech mm 28 loudspeaker .
Upon spotting a singing male , we positioned the playback loudspeaker inside the bird 's territory in approx .
1.7 m height .
We aimed at placing the loudspeaker approx .
8 m from the test bird at the beginning of each playback , and most of the subjects received both treatments from this initial distance .
In the remaining birds , it was not possible to place the loudspeaker in 8 m for one or both treatments , and the distance between bird and loudspeaker ranged between 6 and 18 m .
In these cases , however , there was no systematic difference in the initial distance between subject and loudspeaker between the two treatments ( Wilcoxon signed - ranks test : T- = 8.5 , n = 7 , p = 0.469 ) .
Each subject was observed for 2 minutes before , during and after the playback .
During each of the three stages of the observation we continuously recorded the bird 's vocalizations with a Sony WM - D6C recorder and a Sennheiser Me66 directional microphone .
Because female songbirds are very unlikely to show strong responses to playbacks in the field [ 8 ] , we specifically targeted only males in our experiment .
However , any potential behaviours by females during the experiment were recorded in the same way as the for the male focus birds .
Analysis of playback responses
From the 20 birds tested , seven were excluded from the analysis because they could not be observed during the entire period of 6 minutes for each of the two playback trials or because neighbouring males and / or females approached the playback loudspeaker .
Variables measured during the playback period included the change in song rate compared to pre playback baseline levels ( # songs / min ) , latency to approach playback loudspeaker ( s ) , minimum approach distance ( m ) and time within 5 m of the loudspeaker ( s ) .
For the post playback period we assessed the subject 's time within 5 m of the loudspeaker ( s ) and the change in song rate compared to baseline levels ( # songs / min ) .
As these six response measures were highly correlated with each other , we conducted a principal component analysis ( PCA ) on the initial response variables .
A Kaiser - Meyer - Olkin test and a Bartlett test indicated that the data set was suited for a data reduction through a PCA ( KMO measure of sampling adequacy = 0.715 , Bartlett 's test of sphericity : χ 2 15 = 90.1 , p<0.001 ) .
The PCA yielded two principal components with an eigenvalue higher than 1 ( Table 1 ) .
The individual PC factors were used as a composite measure of the birds ' response to the playbacks ( playback response scores ) .
We compared individual PC1 and PC2 factors between the two playback treatments with Wilcoxon signed - ranks tests for matched - pairs based on exact P values .

Genetic analyses Blood from 33 mangrove finches of the western population was collected between 2006 and 2009 and from one eastern male in 2009 .
For the collection of genetic samples , the birds were caught with mist nets and a minimum amount of blood was taken with micropipettes following venipuncture of the alar vein .
Blood samples were genotyped at 16 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
Microsatellite analysis has been proved very useful in the study of phylogenetic relationships among Darwin 's finches [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] because variation in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences is insufficient for resolving relationships within more closely related species of this group [ 32 ] .
Standard laboratory protocols were used for DNA extraction and genotype determination .
Specific protocols and primer sequences are available elsewhere [ 28 ] .
Two independent rounds of DNA extraction and genotyping of the eastern bird produced 100 % agreement across all loci .
The analysis indicated that the small remnant eastern population contains unique genetic variation .
Hybridization with the congener Camarhynchus pallidus can be ruled out since only one of the seven unique east coast alleles appears in our sample from Isabela ( n = 18 ) .
It is also very distinct from other species sampled from Isabela [ 30 ] , including Camarhynchus parvulus ( n = 6 ) , Geospiza fuliginosa ( n = 13 ) and Certhidea olivacea ( n = 26 ) .
The east coast bird 's likelihood scores are well outside the range of values for birds within these species , and in each case lie 3 – 12 standard deviations below the mean .
Finally , contamination from other species can be ruled out since these loci are highly specific to Darwin 's finches [ 28 ] .
Body measurements
During status surveys which were conducted between 2006 and 2009 [ 23 ] , B.F. took body measures and pictures from 31 males of the western population and from one male from the east coast ( the same individual from which a genetic sample was collected ) .
The birds were captured with mist nets and then colour banded .
Upon capture , measures of bill size were recorded , as well as tarsus and wing length , and weight .
Results
The acoustic analysis yielded marked differences in song between the two mangrove finch populations ( Fig. 2 ) , and we found statistically significant differences in all measured song parameters ( Table 2 ) .

Moreover , we determined that the population differences in the songs were meaningful to the mangrove finches , as territorial males exhibited strong discrimination of the two local song variants .
Principal component analysis revealed that males responded significantly stronger in response to the playback of local songs than to the songs from the other population according to PC1 ( mean ± SD response : local songs = 0.411±0.895 ; eastern songs = − 0.411±0.957 ; T- = 12 , n = 13 , p = 0.017 ) , but not according to PC2 ( local songs = 0.134±0.839 ; eastern songs = − 0.134±1.158 ; T- = 35 , n = 13 , p = 0.497 ) .
PC1 explained the majority of the variation in the raw response parameters .
An examination of the single response variables ( Fig. 3 ) showed that the birds ' stronger response to local songs was mainly due to a higher increase in song rate during the playback ( T- = 0 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.001 , significance retained after Bonferroni- Holm correction ) , a closer approach to the loudspeaker ( T+ = 10 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.021 ) , and more time spent in the vicinity of the playback loudspeaker after the playback ( T- = 11 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.013 ) .
By contrast , no statistical differences were found in the latency to approach ( T+ = 33 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.404 ) , time spent within 5 m of the loudspeaker during the playback ( T+ = 26.5 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.349 ) and the song rate after the playback ( T- = 25 , n = 13 , uncorrected p = 0.161 ) .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011191.g003
Female responses to the playbacks were rare , and in the majority of cases no female was observed in a males ' territory at all .
However , of the five cases in which females approached the loudspeaker four occurred during the playback of local songs from the western population and only one occurred during the playback of foreign songs .
The notion of two separate mangrove finch lineages on the east and west coast of Isabela is supported by additional genetic and morphological differences : the captured east coast male 's breast had more pronounced dark streaks than was observed in any west coast male , and it also had a smaller beak gape than all 31 males that have been captured and measured on Isabela ( east coast = 8.25 mm , west coast = 8.70 – 10.35 mm ) .
When compared to 33 genotypes from the western population of C. heliobates , the eastern bird revealed seven unique alleles .
It was homozygous for two of these unique alleles at two different loci , while only two other singleton alleles were found in the western population .
The observed heterozygosity at the 14 autosomal loci for the eastern bird ( 43 % ) was slightly higher than the average for the western population ( 36 % ) .
Assignment tests [ 33 ] showed likelihood values of the eastern bird ( −22.2 ) are well below the range of values for C. heliobates ( mean ±SD : − 6.4±1.3 ) .
Discussion
We found marked acoustic differences in song between the two remnant populations of the mangrove finch .
The observed acoustic divergence was as big as or even bigger than differences in song between different species of Darwin 's finches ( c.f . [ 34 ] ) .
Territorial males at the west coast of Isabela responded more strongly to playback of local songs than to playback of songs from the eastern population , particularly in terms of song rate , nearest approach and time spent in the vicinity of the loudspeaker after the playback .
The validity of the playback results is confirmed by comparison with earlier playback studies with Darwin 's finches [ 22 ] , [ 35 ] – [ 37 ] .
Territorial males in these studies as well as in ours showed similar responses to playback in terms of song rate and nearest approach .
Thus , the results of our playback experiment suggest that species recognition in mangrove finches is impaired by the song divergence between the two remnant populations , which will affect sexual selection by male - male competition upon secondary contact .
Our study is the first evidence of highly divergent genetic differentiation within a single island population of Darwin 's finches and it is clearly associated with discontinuities in suitable habitat , as well as divergence in sexual signals .
In terms of reproductive isolation , the crucial question is whether females discriminate between the local song variants in a similar way as the males did .
Typically , females are much less responsive to song playback than males , and most field studies on species recognition have looked at responses of territorial males [ 8 ] .
Just as in a prior study on another species of Darwin 's finch , the sharp - beaked ground finch Geospiza difficilis [ 36 ] , female mangrove finches in this study were very rarely observed to respond to the playback .
However , of the five observed cases , four females came near the loudspeaker during the playback of local songs and only one female approached while a foreign song was broadcast .
Thus , assuming that female mangrove finches exercise similar discrimination of songs by locality as males , it might well be that the two mangrove finch populations are already reproductively isolated and could be regarded as two separate species .
If so , the eastern species will face imminent extinction because it has an estimated population size of only 5 – 10 individuals [ 23 ] .
It has been shown that local variants in bird song can be adapted to the environmental acoustics of different habitats [ 38 ] .
Both finch populations occur in mangrove forests , but the mangrove trees on the west coast were on average more than two times higher than on the east coast , and the canopy was also significantly less closed in the western forests [ 25 ] .
However , these habitat differences are rather small compared to those that have been found important in previous studies [ e.g. 39 ] –[ 41 ] , and it remains to be shown whether they can be accounted for the divergence observed in mangrove finch song .
Alternatively , and more likely , the song differences may be the outcome of random processes coupled with cultural transmission through individual learning of mating signals [ 9 ] .
The two mangrove finch populations are geographically separated by 70 km of barren lava desert and volcanic mountain , which is likely to have promoted the cultural evolution of different local song dialects .
Initially , the population differences in the mating signal may be due to a founding effect that was then maintained by vocal tradition .
Another possibility is that the divergent trajectories of evolution among the isolated populations may reflect a more gradual cultural drift of song characteristics over longer times .
In any case , our study suggests that crucial parts of the speciation process can occur in complete allopatry , without any sympatric phase at all .
Our findings not only provide strong support for the central role of sexual signals during speciation , but at the same time they also have implications for conservation .
Critically endangered species are often assumed to be relatively homogeneous .
Our results show , however , that even small numbers of individuals may harbour reproductive incompatibilities that have accumulated through isolation and divergence at small spatial scales .
If individuals from the two populations are not able to successfully reproduce with each other , then the scope of conservations actions such as captive breeding or translocation of birds will be limited .

SACRAMENTO , Calif . –
More than 2,000 disabled people of all ages , along with their families and supporters , marched here on May 26 , to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , and to lobby their legislators to maintain benefits like in - home supportive services ( IHHS ) , which are threatened with elimination in the proposed California state budget .
“ We ’re here , we ’re loud , disabled and proud ! ” they chanted , as they filled the West Steps area of the state Capitol building .
Mary Lou Breslin , co-founder of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund , a leading national disability rights law and policy center , recounted the history of the disabled rights movement that forced Congress to pass the ADA .
The movement used dramatic community actions such as sit-ins and “ crawl-ins , ” in which people with disabilities abandoned their wheelchairs to crawl up the steps of inaccessible public buildings .
Bags and bags of written testimony detailing discrimination against disabled people were sent to Congress , where Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and California Rep. Tony Coehlo were champions of the landmark legislation .
The ADA was passed in July 1990 and signed by the first President Bush , after the movement fought back a proposal to eliminate the rights of people with AIDS and HIV , an idea based on fear and myth .
“ We wo n’t back down !
We ’re not going to stop fighting for human rights ! ” Breslin concluded .
State Sen , Loni Hancock added to the history by recalling disability rights advocate Ed Roberts , founder of the first Center for Independent Living , who “ came to the Berkeley City Council and demanded curb cuts on every city corner . ”
Roberts changed the way people live all over the planet , said Hancock .
Hancock is the author of a bill , SB 1256 , which would establish every January 23 as “ Ed Roberts Day , ” to encourage schools and educational institutions to incorporate the history of the disability rights movement into their curricula .
SB 1256 was passed unanimously by the California State Senate and is now in the Assembly , Hancock said .
Other speakers warned that elimination of the in - home services ( IHSS ) program , and local programs such as clinics , senior day care centers , Meals on Wheels , and Paratransit , would force many seniors and people with disabilities into much more expensive nursing homes and hospitals .
Besides enjoying the warm weather , speakers , music , dancing and a free lunch , the demonstrators formed lobbying groups to visit their state legislators , urging opposition to the drastic budget cuts proposed by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .

The shock in England 's ranks runs so deep that Fabio Capello is refusing to rule out resigning if his team fail to beat Slovenia in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday , and crash out of a World Cup at the group stage for the first time since 1958 .
Capello 's position would be untenable anyway , but it is a measure of the England manager 's bafflement at the team 's feeble performances in draws against the USA and Algeria that he already declines to defend his position .
" We have time to answer this question , " he said .
" I think the fear of the World Cup is in the minds of the players .
It 's incredible .
The performance on one side is good [ in training ] but on the other they are not the same players . "
Fear of failure is not confined to England , according to Arsène Wenger .
The Arsenal manager said : " The biggest teams who have the highest level of expectation cannot express that talent yet .
One reason is caution , fear of failure , response to huge demands .
Basically , the big teams with high expectations play these first - round games just to get through .
I do n't think consciously but more for fear of failure .
" England came here with an expectation from everybody to win the World Cup .
It 's not easy to deal with that .
They want so much to do well that they think they cannot fail . "
Three weeks ago Capello exploited a power vacuum at the Football Association to remove a clause in his contract , which gave both sides a two - week window to sever their deal .
But he is now 90 minutes away from leaving the job more ignominiously than Sven - Goran Eriksson , whose teams reached two World Cup quarter - finals .
Tensions between the players and coaching staff are now in the open , with the manager 's clumsy handling of the goalkeeping issue the main cause .
Told that Capello had said his players are unable to cope with the " pressure of the World Cup " , David James paused and said caustically : " Did he ? "
Others are said to be unimpressed with Capello 's selections .
Joe Cole , for instance , has yet to make it on to the pitch .
Graham Taylor , the former England manager , said on BBC Radio 5 live : " I do now believe there 's a real danger of England going out .
There 's something not right behind the scenes .
I do n't know what it is .
I have an idea : I do n't believe the proper preparatory work is being done .
Look at the body language : something is wrong . "
England 's followers , who booed the team at the final whistle on Friday , will not want Capello to carry all the blame .
Wayne Rooney is among a core of underperforming senior players , though he compounded matters with his comments about the travelling support 's boos as he left the pitch .
The striker issued an apology tonight , saying : " I am as passionate about the England team as anyone .
Last night , on reflection I said things in the heat of the moment that came out of frustration at both our performance and the result .
" The most important thing now is to regroup , be positive and work towards winning the game on Wednesday .
To do this the players will need the support of the fans more than ever .
For my part I apologise for any offence caused by my actions at the end of the game . "
Asked what he can do to revive this campaign , Capello said : " This is a good question , because I speak a lot with the players , we train and everything is perfect , but when we play the players are not the same . "
Rooney , he insisted , is not carrying an injury : " Yes , yes , completely fit .
He trains , he 's training on the pitch for more time than the other players , he 's perfect .
The [ team 's ] problem is in the mind .
I want to see the spirit .
I did n't see the spirit of this side . "
Sir Trevor Brooking , the FA 's head of football development , warned before the game of a talent gap between the seniors and European Championship - winning Under - 17s .
" World Cup 2014 will be difficult for England .
I do n't think there are the obvious quality ones coming through who can replicate what we have currently unless we can fast - track one or two of the younger ones , " Brooking said .
" You wait five years for them [ the U - 17s ] to come through . "
England do not have five years .
They have 90 minutes against Slovenia .
When Ian Tomlinson 's widow watched video footage of his last moments alive for the first time on a laptop 16 months ago , she was speechless .
Julia Tomlinson had been told by police her husband had died of natural causes as he tried to get home through the G20 protest in London , and there was nothing suspicious about the death .
But as she watched footage shot by a New York fund manager and handed to the Guardian , which was conducting its own inquiry , a different story unfolded .
Tomlinson , hands in pockets , was walking away from police .
Julia Tomlinson winced as , repeatedly , she watched as an officer who was not displaying his badge number , and whose face was concealed behind a balaclava , lunged at her husband from behind and , without provocation , struck him on the leg and pushed him to the ground .
Eventually , through tears , Julia Tomlinson said she wanted justice .
Yesterday , she learned there would be none .
At a meeting with the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , she and her nine children were told of two seemingly incompatible conclusions : first , prosecutors believed there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the officer ; but second , owing to both the time limit for common assault charges and medical uncertainties – crucially , the contested findings of a forensic pathologist who is now the subject of an inquiry by the General Medical Council – prosecutors did not believe there was a prospect a jury would convict the officer on any charge .
The merits of the CPS arguments put forward for not prosecuting the officer – a van driver from the Metropolitan police 's territorial support group ( TSG ) – had by tonight already become the subject of intense controversy .
For the victims though , it was not a huge surprise .
A close - knit working - class family from the Isle of Dogs , east London , Tomlinson 's relatives long believed they would be deprived of justice by a system of police accountability they suspected was biased in favour of those who carry the batons .
The police disregard for Tomlinson was evidence on footage of the aftermath of the attack , which left him lying on the ground in front of a line of riot police shortly after 7.25 pm on 1 April .
None of the officers went to the aid of the 47 - year - old , who was clearly in distress .
Instead , it was left to a bystander , Alan Edwards , 34 , to lift him to his feet .
Edwards would later recall his conversation with Tomlinson .
" I said : ' You OK , mate ? '
He said : ' No , I live down there – that 's where I live .
I can't get there any other way .
I 'm trying to get home . ' "
Looking disoriented , Tomlinson then stumbled 100 yards down the road before collapsing and dying .
The initial police response was to accuse protesters of wrongdoing .
Within four hours , Scotland Yard had released a statement saying officers had gone to the victim's aid and called an ambulance , and were attempting to save his life with cardiopulmonary resuscitation when they were impeded by protesters who attacked them with " a number of missiles – believed to be bottles " .
In fact , it is no longer thought Tomlinson 's treatment was impeded when two , probably plastic , bottles landed nearby .
Protesters placed Tomlinson in a recovery position and called the ambulance before police arrived .
In the following days , City of London police , which was investigating the death , would receive information from witnesses that suggested Tomlinson might have been assaulted by an officer .
His family were not told about this , and were advised instead that he had died after being caught up in a fracas prompted by anarchist demonstrators attacking police .
Police told them witnesses had seen the newspaper seller simply " run out of batteries " .
Two days after the death , in what would become a crucial decision , the City of London coroner , Paul Matthews , requested that forensic pathologist Freddy Patel conduct a postmortem .
Patel had once been reprimanded by the General Medical Council over his conduct , and is not thought to have had a police contract at the time of the Tomlinson case .
The Met had written to the Home Office four years earlier raising concerns about Patel 's work in a number of cases .
Leading forensic pathologists say privately that they were astounded to learn such a controversial postmortem would be entrusted to an expert who was no longer thought to be actively dealing with suspicious cases .
Patel has since been barred from the Home Office register of accredited forensic pathologists and from carrying out postmortems in " suspicious death " cases .
Matthews has declined to say why he chose Patel .
One theory was that the coroner was recommended Patel 's services by City of London police .
The force has declined to comment .
It was Patel 's findings that enabled police to assure the family , who were prevented from viewing the body for six days , that there was nothing contentious about the death .
Telling the family Tomlinson had " died of a heart attack " , police made no mention of significant injuries found on his body , including blood in his stomach , bruising , and a dog bite on his leg .
Police also briefed journalists , erroneously , that there was nothing suspicious about the death and that the victim 's family were " not surprised " he had died because of prior medical conditions .
Tomlinson 's family deny ever having said this , and for their part claimed they were " badly misled " by police .
They believe they were the victims of a cover - up and that some police simply refused to countenance that an officer was involved in the incident .
When a senior City of London investigator watched footage of the attack , he said Tomlinson 's assailant could be a member of the public " dressed in police uniform " .
However , it is the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , the watchdog with the job of investigating police , that may ultimately be taken to task over failings in the case .
The first , crucial days of the inquiry were left to City of London police , in whose jurisdiction the death took place .
Three days after the death , after receiving word of Patel 's postmortem , the IPCC drafted a report into the death , concluding there was " no evidence " of police involvement in the death .
Despite evidence of contact with police , the IPCC resisted calls to launch an inquiry for six days .
It concluded that Tomlinson died of a heart attack after being caught up amid charging protesters .
The draft IPCC report was read over the phone to Tomlinson 's family , but was then shelved at the last minute .
The IPCC only agreed to investigate the case when the Guardian released footage of the incident and handed investigators evidence that contradicted the police version of events .
The footage instantly made headlines around the world , and would eventually transform perceptions of British policing , leading to two parliamentary inquiries into the Met 's handling of the protest and a national review of policing .
The officer caught striking Tomlinson came forward and was questioned under suspicion of manslaughter .
In August last year , the IPCC announced it had completed its inquiry and handed a file to the CPS .
The family were told in a private meeting with IPCC officials that , while they were not responsible for deciding on a prosecution , investigators believed there was sufficient evidence to charge the officer with manslaughter .
When two IPCC investigators flew to New York to collect the original video footage , the investment fund manager was surprised that they arrived without basic equipment such as a tape recorder .
Despite promises of a swift decision , concern over Patel 's evidence led to months of delays .
Almost 300 complaints were lodged about police behaviour during last year 's G20 protests , arguably the most controversial large - scale policing operation in the last decade .
Yet after dozens of inquiries , one trial and one of the largest inquiries in the history of the IPCC , not a single officer has yet faced serious disciplinary action .
Two officers have received written warnings .
The fund manager who shot the Tomlinson footage – a man who , like Tomlinson , had no affinity with the anti-capitalist ideology of many demonstrators that day – expressed disappointment tonight .
He said : " With this decision , the green light has been given .
Future aggressive police behaviour towards ordinary citizens will be tolerated , overlooked , and excused . "

In the last two decades in Mediterranean Europe , and especially in Spain , a new social group has emerged , called jovenes ( youngsters ) .
Members of this group exhibit several specific characteristics .
First , jovenes are usually male , aged 25 – 35 , although some members are in their 40s .
Second , they are in a perpetual state between graduation and their first job .
Third , they usually live with their parents to save money , allowing them to go out at least three times a week .
Fourth , they occasionally work a part - time job — if only due to the pressure imposed by their parents .
Last , and most important , they receive unemployment benefit credits and renew their membership on the " unemployment list " from time to time , so that the state subsidies do n't run out during their " temporary " hibernation .
It would be very unfair to put all the blame on them for their lack of initiative .
They play a vital part in what is called the " Atlas generation . "
They have the weight of the world on their shoulders , and they are going to be the ones in charge of paying for the economic sins of their parents .
It is important to analyze the reasons why this social group has appeared , what the situation is like today , and what the consequences will be of this phenomenon in the future .
For the last ten years , and especially since the recent financial crisis started , Spanish unemployment has risen astronomically , reaching a record of around 20 percent .
This , of course , does not count the thousands of illegal immigrants , who do n't appear in the official state statistics .
Aside from the vast number of unemployed , another significant group of people work in part - time jobs with " garbage contracts " or very low salaries .
Members of this group are called mileuristas ( those who earn only € 1,000 / month ) .
This group appears above the jovenes in the social pyramid .
Mileuristas normally live at home and dream of becoming economically sufficient eventually , or they live in cheap rented apartments funded by state money , which comes directly from taxpayers ' pockets .
Finally , we find a smaller group at the top of the pyramid .
This group is formed by either a lucky few , or in some cases , hardworking and generally outstanding young people .
This group has very decent jobs ( normally around € 2,000 / month starting salary ) and are the sons and daughters of wealthy families that normally receive a more - or - less high - quality private education .
They end up employed in the family business or in some firm where their parents or family members have contacts .
Outside of this pyramid we will also find a group of people that decide to study for an " oposición " ( state exam ) in order to work for the government .
Depending on the complexity of their education , and their success on the exam , they will end up working for the first time between the ages of 26 and 35 and will be decently , or even very well paid , for the rest of their lives .
It is also very important to give special attention to the number of years that people are called " students " in Spain .
The quality of a university graduate has been devalued in recent years to the point where an employer will no longer be impressed at all by an undergraduate degree in a job interview .
Consequently , at least a master 's degree or some kind of postcollege specialization accompanied by proficiency in at least three languages is demanded .
This , of course , means more years spent as a student and , for the most privileged ones , a year or two living and exploring foreign languages abroad .
" The quality of a university graduate has been devalued in recent years to the point where an employer will no longer be impressed at all by an undergraduate degree . "
Not so long ago in Spain , it was an honor to have a college degree and even more prestigious to hold a graduate degree , which only a few people could achieve due to the expense and hard work that it involved .
Now it is almost free to study in a Spanish public university .
This is viewed as a great accomplishment that gives opportunities to people from lower classes , who will sometimes end up forming part of the group of " hard working and outstanding young people . "
But , to be honest , this group is quite small .
The effort to make it easier to be a student is largely a way for the government to lower the unemployment rate .
In order to explain why it is so hard for recent graduates to obtain a decent job in Spain , it is important to know that labor costs are very high for employers — a consequence of strict laws that protect workers .
Four weeks ' vacation a year is the mandatory minimum .
An artificially high minimum wage places a floor under the supply of workers and the demand for jobs , creating a devastating imbalance .
This means there is a huge demand for jobs and little desire on the part of employers to fulfill it .
Additional reasons for the lack of job offers in Spain include the excessive finiquito , the final pay a worker is entitled to under Spanish law when fired : 45 days of salary for each year worked at the company .
Furthermore , taxes on employers are very high — at least a 50 percent of each worker 's annual salary , which means that if someone is paid € 20,000 a year , it costs their employer at least € 30,000 a year to hire them .
All this makes an employer very reluctant to hire an employee , which creates a high rate of unemployment and a huge number of " garbage contracts . "
These taxes also promote black - market activity , which either sidesteps the established rules or ignores them altogether .
The taxes on employee wages are very high as well , which brings us back to the mileurista social status .
These taxes create a substitution effect : firms have become desperate for new technologies to reduce labor inputs .
One recent example in Spain is McDonald 's move to start substituting workers with new machines that take the order for the customer , reducing the number of workers .
The goal is to leave only two sets of employees — the ones in the kitchen and ones that hand the food to you at the counter .
Spain 's misfortunes have been complicated since joining the eurozone .
The ability to obtain very low interest rates to borrow money — the same interest rates as in more powerful and savings - oriented economies like Germany — worked as an incentive for companies to borrow money for infrastructure and housing construction .
Around 800,000 houses have been built each year in Spain , more than France , Germany , and England combined .
This meant a surge in the supply of jobs in construction industries .
Unfortunately , this demand for labor was met mostly by immigrants who now find themselves unemployed with few possibilities .
Huge loans to finance this housing boom , especially from the Spanish " cajas " ( saving banks ) now cannot be paid back and have resulted in a huge government bailout .
As a result , the Spanish government has undertaken an increasingly large debt , financed by the continual issuance of new bonds .
This borrowing has strained Spain 's public finances , lowered its bond rating , and reduced the demand investors have to continue funding this deficit spending .
At the same time , the bust has caused a severe decline in tax receipts , especially in taxes like the IVA ( value - added tax ) .
Consequently the state has received less income and in response is now increasing consumption taxes to cover the shortfall ( effective next month ) .
These increased taxes will , in the end , translate to less spending and more constrained profits for all producers .
They will also make Spain a very unattractive place for companies worldwide to start or continue their business .
" The final pay a worker is entitled to under Spanish law when fired is a full 45 days of salary for each year worked at the company . "
All these effects will ultimately mean more unemployment , which takes us back to the young " Atlas generation . "
Ironically , many members of this generation have complete faith in the government to take care of all these issues for them .
They choose to stay at home until they are middle - aged and delay getting married and creating a family until their mid-to - late 30s .
They also have an increasingly huge debt issue , which they will eventually have to take care of .
If current trends continue , within a few short years in Spain each employee will have to pay for one pensioner on social security .
Only 40 years ago , ten employees took care of one pensioner through their social - security contributions .
The Atlas generation , by putting off marriage and children , has worsened this worker - pensioner imbalance .
The yearly rate of births per fertile woman in Spain is only 1.2 , one of the lowest in the world , and it will likely decline in coming years .
The only way to solve this problem would be to lower taxes , especially employment taxes , dramatically .
Doing so would encourage employers to offer more jobs and employees to have larger families .
Unfortunately , this option is n't of much interest for the politicians in Spain , who prefer to maintain the socialist status quo regardless of which political party is in power .

Federal prosecutors alleged 11 people were spies living secret lives in American communities , from Seattle to Washington D.C. , sent years ago to infiltrate U.S. society and glean its secrets .
In an extensive and bizarre affidavit whose details echoed Cold War spy thrillers , the Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed the alleged spies were sent here by the Russian overseas intelligence service known as the SVR — the successor to the Soviet KGB — as early as the mid-1990s , and were provided with training in language as well as ...

The principal of a Prescott , AZ elementary school has ordered that a mural — depicting current students at his school — have the skin tones lightened , after a series of racial slurs were hurled at the painters .
Cars would drive by and yell shit at the people painting the mural .
From the Arizona Republic :
" We consistently , for two months , had people shouting racial slander from their cars , " [ mural director R.E. ]
Wall said .
" We had children painting with us , and here come these yells of ( epithet for Blacks ) and ( epithet for Hispanics ) . "
There 's also a city councilman named Steve Blair who has a little AM radio talk show , on which he 's been railing for the mural to be painted over .
Not because there are brown people on it , really , but because the looming presence of a brown face — larger than the white faces ! — is causing unnecessary controversy :
" Personally , I think it 's pathetic , " he says .
" You have changed the ambience of that building to excite some kind of diversity power struggle that does n't exist in Prescott , Arizona .
And I 'm ashamed of that . "
Ah yes .
The inherent shit - starting of painting a mural of children who look different , because they are actual kids at the school , who look different .
Mr. Blair himself had nothing to do with stirring up needless controversy , obviously .
So after all the bickering and utter batshit insanity , the school 's principal , Jeff Lane , asked that the faces be lightened .
Not because of the race thing or the racist stuff !
Ha ha ha , not at all !
But because tonally — like artistic tonally , not color tonally — the painting was n't working :
We asked them to fix the shading on the children 's faces .
We were looking at it from an artistic view .
Nothing at all to do with race .
Oh , so he's , like , talking about the chiaroscuro and stuff .
OK , no problem .
Anyway .
That 's what 's happening in Arizona these days !
Somehow the country is getting more racist as time goes by , and now because there 's a Muslim basketball jazz - cat in office , everyone 's just lettin ' it allll hang out .
Happy belated birthday , dead soldiers .

INDIANAPOLIS --
The NCAA appears to be on the verge of expanding the men's basketball tournament to 96 teams .
Insisting that nothing has been decided , NCAA vice president Greg Shaheen nonetheless outlined a detailed plan Thursday that included the logistics and timing of a 96 - team tournament , how much time off the players would have and even revenue distribution .
Shaheen said the NCAA looked at keeping the current 65 - team field and expanding to 68 or 80 teams , but decided the bigger bracket was the best fit logistically and financially .
It would be played during the same time frame as the current three - week tournament and include first - round byes for 32 teams .
Although the plan still needs to be approved by the Division I Men 's Basketball Committee and passed on to the board of directors , most of the details already seem to be in place .
" We needed to make sure that we did everything possible to use the due diligence window to understand ourselves and understand what the future would hold , " Shaheen said .
" So that 's what we 're doing , that 's the process we 're undertaking .
We 've been handling it every day for the last several months and years , as we studied for the benefit of the organization . "
The men's tournament last expanded in 2001 , adding one team to the 64 - team field that was set in 1985 .
The 96 - team tournament would likely envelop the 32 - team NIT , though Shaheen said no decision has been made on what to do with the NCAA 's other , independently operated season - ending tournament .
The new format would start two days later than the current 65 - team field because it would eliminate the Tuesday play - in game and would conclude on the same day , a Monday .
It would be played at one fewer venue -- again , the play - in game -- and the NCAA says it would include no additional travel time for teams .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , along with one Republican and Democratic senator , introduced a bill late last week that would allow the President to effectively disconnect the internet by emergency decree .
The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act would allow the President to disconnect Internet networks and force private websites to comply with broad cybersecurity measures .

Future US presidents would have their Internet “ kill switch ” powers renewed indefinitely .
The bill was introduced by Lieberman , Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) and Sen. Tom Carper ( D - DE ) .
A parallel bill was drafted last year by Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) which would allow the federal government to unilaterally “ order the disconnection ” of certain websites .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ For all of its Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœuser - friendlyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ allure , the Internet can also be a dangerous place with electronic pipelines that run directly into everything from our personal bank accounts to key infrastructure to government and industrial secrets , ” Lieberman said in a release announcing his bill .
“ Our economic security , national security and public safety are now all at risk from new kinds of enemies — cyber- warriors , cyber-spies , cyber- terrorists and cyber-criminals .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The need for this legislation is obvious and urgent , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the Connecticut senator added .
“ We cannot afford to wait for a cyber 9/11 before our government realises the importance of protecting our cyber resources , ” Sen .
Collins said .

One news site notes :
The bill would give a newly - formed National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications the authority to monitor the “ security status ” of private websites , ISPs and other net - related business within the U.S. as well as critical internet components in other countries .
Companies would be required to take part in “ information sharing ” with the government and certify to the NCCC that they have implemented approved security measures .
Furthermore , any company that “ relies on ” the internet , telephone system or any other part of the U.S. “ information infrastructure ” would also be “ subject to command ” by the NCCC under the proposed new law .
Lieberman ’s bill would also create a cadre of cybersecurity agencies and order strategy planning with private firms .
The legislation is supported by anti-virus giant Symantec .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The Internet may have started out as a communications oddity some 40 years ago but it is now a necessity of modern life , and sadly one that is under constant attack , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Lieberman added in his release .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It must be secured …
The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010 is designed to bring together the disjointed efforts of multiple federal agencies and departments to prevent cyber theft , intrusions , and attacks across the federal government and the private sector .
The bill would establish a clear organizational structure to lead federal efforts in safeguarding cyber networks .
And it would build a public / private partnership to increase the preparedness and resiliency of those private critical infrastructure cyber networks upon which our way of life depends . ”
LOS ANGELES 
When Andrew van den Houten got a letter two weeks ago rejecting his request for Michigan public money to help finance his latest horror movie , “ The Woman , ” it came with an admonition about the state ’s good name .
“ This film is unlikely to promote tourism in Michigan or to present or reflect Michigan in a positive light , ” wrote Janet Lockwood , Michigan ’s film commissioner .
Ms. Lockwood particularly objected to “ this extreme horror film ’s subject matter , namely realistic cannibalism ; the gruesome and graphically violent depictions described in the screenplay ; and the explicit nature of the script . ”
The easy money is not quite so easy any more .
Among the states that began underwriting film and television production with heavy subsidies over the past half - decade  44 states had some sort of incentives by last year , 28 of them involving tax credits  at least a handful are giving new scrutiny to a question that was politely overlooked in the early excitement :
What kind of films are taxpayers paying for ?
Less than two years ago , Mr. van den Houten became one of the first to take advantage of Michigan ’s generous subsidy , which pays for up to 42 percent of a movie ’s cost , when he made “ Offspring , ” a cannibalism - themed horror picture that was later distributed by the Ghost House Underground direct - to - video line and has been showing on NBC Universal ’s Chiller TV network .
Twitter is branching out by enabling users to tweet from other websites including Amazon , Bing , Citysearch , Digg and eBay .

Chimp - on - chimp attacks in the wild are very common , especially among small packs of males on patrol .
Now research suggests the motive for these crimes is to gain territory .
To understand this violence , researchers studied a large group of chimpanzees living in Ngogo , Kibale National Park in Uganda .
After monitoring the group for over a decade , scientists counted 21 chimp - on - chimp murders .
Of those crimes , the researchers witnessed 18 directly , and deduced three from circumstantial evidence .
They think as many as 13 of the victims belonged to a single neighboring group .
" The take - home is clear and simple , " said researcher John Mitani of the University of Michigan .
" Chimpanzees kill each other .
They kill their neighbors .
Up until now , we have not known why .
Our observations indicate that they do so to expand their territories at the expense of their victims . "
After some of these neighboring competitors were dispatched with , the researchers observed the Ngogo chimpanzees beginning to use a large portion of new territory to the northeast of their previous range .
That piece of evidence allowed the researchers to link the murders with a motive – that of gaining new ground .
The scientists think the new land offers greater access to food , and potentially to females .
The attacks seem to be triggered when bands of chimpanzees go out patrolling into the territory of a neighboring chimpanzee group .
" Patrollers are quiet and move with stealth , " Mitani said .
" They pause frequently to scan the environment as they search for other chimpanzees .
Attacks are typically made only when patrolling chimpanzees have overwhelming numerical superiority over their adversaries . "
This tends to happen often for the Ngogo chimpanzees , who have a particularly large group of more than 150 individuals — about three times the number found in chimp communities studied elsewhere .
That advantage may explain the surprisingly high level of violence observed , the researchers said .
Mitani and colleagues described the research in the June 22 issue of the journal Current Biology .
If you want to know how reliant the middle class has become on credit cards all you need to know is that in circulation we have 631 million credit cards in the U.S.
For a nation with slightly above 300 million people this is roughly 2 credit cards for each man , woman , and child .
Credit cards and their subsequent “ plastic free ” variety of home equity lines of credit caused a massive boom that really put a veil over the underlying destruction of the middle class .
As Americans spent their way inching closer to the day of paying the Pied Piper , many thought they were getting wealthier when in reality , they were merely leasing a smoke and mirrors operation of transferring all their wealth to the banking sector of the economy .
It would be one thing if banks were lending their own money and putting their operations at risk .
When push came to shove , Americans get booted from their homes and have cars reposed while banks steal taxpayer bailout money to enrich themselves even further .
In addition , big operations funded by big money are now going out there buying properties at fire sale prices with government backed money .
The credit card as we have it in the U.S. is really a unique phenomenon :
Source : Creditcards.com
Only a handful of banks dominate the credit card industry .
The credit card is really built on the premise that the gravy train can go on forever .
At the apex of the credit bubble , and let us face it housing was n’t the only thing being financed with easy money , credit card companies were offering zero percent offers to lure customers into debt servitude .
Now that banks use the pretext that the “ world has changed ” , they can up those fees and interest rates and many Americans due to the weak economy are now no longer able to meet their obligations .
Credit card default rates are soaring :
Source : Calculated Risk
Those that ca n’t pay by definition will not pay and that is why we are seeing high levels of bankruptcy .
A credit card was never intended to be used as a secondary source of income but that is what it has become since wages have been stagnant for over a decade .
The vast majority do not pay their balance off each month .
This is same misguided premise on which option ARM loans were based on .
Given the option 90 + percent of the people went with the minimum payment causing an endgame that we are now dealing with .
Credit card loans outstanding have been contracting at a feverish pitch :
Yet was n’t the premise of the banking bailouts to increase credit in the market ?
Of course the banking system has largely captured the current lawmakers and the policy we are getting is friendly to their needs and desires while using the American taxpayer as their own form of credit card .
The lie that was perpetuated was that debt equals wealth and it absolutely does not .
So people in modest neighborhoods saw friends and family driving foreign cars and wondered how they were doing it with a $ 40,000 a year income .
They were doing it by extending themselves to the point of financial disaster .
So as the disaster hits , we operate in parallel universes .
The public that did over extend has to realize the marketplace reaction of cutting back , losing homes , or bankruptcy .
Banks on the other hand have actually come out ahead receiving trillions in dollars of taxpayer funded money .
Nothing easier than getting money in a hype of fear with politicians friendly to your cause .
Much of the easy lending environment was given the blessing by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury :
The above is really the story of the housing bubble , credit bubble , and easy money world we had for over a decade .
That is now completely changed and I often wonder if people realize that we wo n’t be going back to how things were .
We can ’t .
The underlying issue is the amount of debt being serviced now .
GDP includes this as a “ positive ” but we are now transferring this additional wealth to the banking sector on merely servicing preexisting debt .
This is like being happy that banks made billions of dollars in overdraft fees .
How is this good for the economy or most Americans ?
The math is so distorted that many Americans are wondering how in a country where 20 percent are underemployed we can have a 73 percent stock market rally .
The too big to fail banks are also at the center of the credit card word :
U.S. general purpose credit card market share in 2008 based on outstandings
( Note : 2007 ranking in parentheses )
1. JPMorgan Chase – 21.22 % ( 17.74 % )
2. Bank of America – 19.25 % ( 19.36 % )
3. Citi – 12.35 % ( 13.03 % )
4. American Express – 10.19 % ( 11.40 % )
5. Capital One – 6.95 % ( 6.95 % )
6. Discover – 5.75 % ( 5.65 % )
7. Wells Fargo – 4.21 % ( 3.07 % )
8. HSBC – 3.47 % ( 3.65 % )
9. U.S. Bank – 2.14 % ( 1.84 % )
10 . USAA Savings – 2.02 % ( 2.01 % )

It is no accident that they are now putting the vice on average Americans while sucking in trillions of dollars in bailouts .
And what is the big reform ?
They now provide a sheet that shows you a breakdown of how you are getting screwed in different formats !
This is the idea of reform right now from the corporatacracy .
Until we get solid reform credit cards will continue to operate in a loan shark environment ripping off the middle class until one day Americans will wake up and realize that there is no longer a middle class .

Enlarge " Cuddle Bear " and " Newsie " : Andi Parhamovich and Michael Hastings in New York in June 2006 .
WASHINGTON  Michael Hastings has packed quite a bit into his 28 years .
Drugs .
Alcohol .
Rehab .
War. Love . Death .
It 's the death part that Hastings , a correspondent for Newsweek , did n't count on quite so early .
His fiancée , Andi Parhamovich , a feisty , opinionated and idealistic 28 - year - old aid worker in Iraq , was killed Jan. 17 , 2007 , in a car bombing .
Hastings was there covering the war .
He tells their story in his new book , I Lost My Love in Baghdad : A Modern War Story ( Scribner , $ 24 ) .
Promoting such a tale was the last thing he expected to be doing this spring .
Hastings says he kept a journal but never intended to write a non-fiction book about Iraq .
" I did n't have anything to say about it , " says Hastings , who is now covering the presidential primaries for Newsweek .
That changed the day Parhamovich , an American from Ohio , was killed while attending a meeting at the Iraqi Islamic Party headquarters .
" When that happened , I had a lot to say , " Hastings says .
" I felt here 's my chance to write a final love letter to Andi . "
And so he did , taking a leave from work and spending two months in the winter of 2007 , right after her death , chain - smoking Parliament Lights while writing in his parents ' attic in Burlington , Vt .
He says he did it " to survive .
It never was a real choice . "
Hastings had no book deal , no agent , no plan of action .
But that soon changed when he started circulating his manuscript .
" I had such a positive response , " he says , a reaction that made him feel more comfortable about writing such an " intensely personal story about a relationship in such an extreme setting . "
Hastings and Parhamovich met in 2005 in New York while he was working at the magazine and she was a publicist for Air America Radio .
They had a whirlwind , roller - coaster romance that included romantic rendezvous in European capitals .
Then , after a year together , they found themselves in Baghdad when Parhamovich took a job with the National Democratic Institute , an organization that works to develop democratic practices around the world .
They met when they could , often at the Blue Star , a restaurant in the Green Zone .
Their romance blossomed .
She called him " Newsie , " making fun of the fact he always had a reporter 's notebook in his back pocket , as he did during a recent interview in a park in Washington , D.C.
He called her " Cuddle Bear " in their e-mails .
Mark Miller , Newsweek 's assistant managing editor and chief of correspondents , concedes that he was " a bit taken aback " when he first heard of the Hastings ' book proposal .
" But Mike has walked the line between the very personal and a powerful story , " Miller says .
" He has a keen eye for the telling details and a firm command of reporting the issues , " Miller says .
" It 's a brave but controversial book .
Some might feel uncomfortable with it . "
Hastings understands that some might feel he was taking advantage of his lover 's death .
" The risk of being criticized for doing so was nothing compared to not doing anything , " he says .
But when he held his book in his hands for the first time , he just stared at it .
" It was n't bittersweet .
It was mostly bitter , " he says .
" But do you curl up in a ball , or do you move forward ?
At the end of the day , I was lucky to have found someone to love me as much as she did .
' Lucky ' sounds funny , I guess , but that 's the way I feel . "
Hastings realizes his life is still filled with lots of " what ifs . "
What if he had n't been in Iraq ?
What if Andi had not gone there ?
" But if she had n't gone , she would n't have been Andi , " he says .
" Does it haunt me ?
Will it always ?
It 's like when anyone has a tragic death .
We all ask questions , the should - haves … "
He 's well aware he's on a journey , one that has taken him from drug abuse in college , then to rehab , back to college and finally to his high - profile job .
" As much as anyone possibly can , I get life , " says Hastings , who has not dated anyone since Andi 's death .
" My struggle now is not to be bitter .
How many times can you get knocked down and get up again ?
Andi would want me to keep going .
" But I 'm still pretty much messed up .
It 's one day at a time . "

Eishockey - WM Deutschland schafft Sensation in Rekordspiel
Zehntausendfacher Jubel in der Schalke - Arena : Zum Auftakt der Eishockey - WM hat Gastgeber Deutschland den hohen Favoriten aus den USA nach Verlängerung besiegt .

Niemals zuvor sahen so viele Zuschauer ein Eishockeyspiel live .
A federal judge who will decide the constitutionality of California ’s ban on same - sex marriage wants lawyers during closing arguments Wednesday to discuss the meaning of “ choice ” in sexual orientation and a possible finding that Proposition 8 attempted to “ enforce private morality . ”
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker , who has been presiding over the federal marriage trial in San Francisco , sent lawyers a list of 39 questions he wants addressed when the trial ends Wednesday after four hours of closing arguments .
Walker ’s questions reveal some of the issues still troubling him and suggest that his decision will rely heavily on evidence about the nature of sexual orientation , the effect of Proposition 8 , and the similarities and differences between heterosexual and same - sex couples .
He asked each side 12 questions and posed an additional 15 to both .
Testimony began in January and ended 2 1/2 weeks later .
Opponents of Proposition 8 called 16 witnesses and supporters two .
A protracted legal fight then ensued over the kinds of internal communications the campaigns had to disclose , a squabble that helped delay the trial ’s end .
Attorneys in the case suspect that Walker has by now produced a draft opinion that touches on issues he has raised in his questions .
Among the questions asked of attorneys for the Proposition 8 opponents is how much importance should be placed on the motivation of voters who approved the marriage ban .
Gay rights lawyers argue that Proposition 8 stemmed from animus against gays and lesbians .
Even if a ban on gay marriage has no rational purpose , Walker asked , is it legal if voters truly believed it would prevent harm ?
He cited a case that said a legislature could enact a law based on a “ common - sense ” notion that children fare best in homes with a mother and a father .
“ Do the voters ’ honest beliefs in the absence of supporting evidence have any bearing on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 ? ” Walker asked .
He also expressed interest in testimony that suggested women were more flexible in their sexual orientation than men .
A survey described during testimony reported that 88 % of gay men said they had no choice in their sexual orientation while 68 % of lesbians felt that way .
“ What are the constitutional consequences if the evidence shows that sexual orientation is immutable for men but not for women ? ”
Walker asked .
“ Must gay men and lesbians be treated identically under the Equal Protection Clause ? ”
Walker also observed that same - sex relationships received no legal protection in the United States until “ very recently . ”
“ How does this fact square with plaintiffs ’ claim that marriage between persons of the same sex enjoys the status of a fundamental right entitled to constitutional protection ? ”
Walker asked .
Another query revealed possible skepticism about the argument that legalizing gay marriage would reduce discrimination against gays and lesbians .
He asked the lawyers for two same - sex couples to cite evidence for that contention .
Turning to the supporters of Proposition 8 , Walker asked them how same - sex marriage would have negative social consequences and to describe how it would drastically change marriage as an institution .
“ Why is legislating based on moral disapproval of homosexuality not tantamount to discrimination ? ”
Walker asked both sides .
“ What evidence in the record shows that a belief based in morality cannot also be discriminatory ? ”
Walker , a Republican appointee with libertarian views , also explored the similarities between marriage and the state ’s domestic partnership law .
“ If , under California law , registered domestic partners are to be treated just like married spouses , what purpose is served by differentiating — in name only — between same - sex and opposite - sex unions ? ” he asked .
Walker has rejected a request by the media to broadcast closing arguments .
They will be heard in his courtroom and televised into an overflow room in the Civic Center courthouse .
His decision on cameras late last month followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January that stopped him from broadcasting the trial on the Internet .
A ruling in the lawsuit brought by two couples who want to marry is expected this summer .
The decision will probably be appealed to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Proposition 8 amended the California Constitution to reinstate a marriage ban that the state Supreme Court had lifted six months earlier .
The California Supreme Court later ruled that the measure did not violate the state Constitution .
The federal lawsuit argues that Proposition 8 violates federal constitutional rights to equal protection and due process .
A Los Angeles - based group funding the litigation hired conservative former U.S. Solicitor Gen .
Ted Olson and noted liberal litigator David Boies — the duo who squared off in Bush vs. Gore — to represent the challengers .
Supporters of Proposition 8 argue that children fare best in families with two opposite - sex parents and that Proposition 8 simply preserved the historical and traditional definition of marriage .

Thanks to the pledge we did long time ago and thanks to the community member , Silvio Grosso , who made major donation , I ’m working on Krita for next ~ 12 weeks full - time .
The Krita community and me prepared Action Plan II .
It ’s something like Google Summer Of Code proposal but with much more targets .
I have tasks per week , not one big target like Summer Of Code projects .
First two weeks of the plan are devoted to the support of the Photoshop brushes .
I worked on it already in Action Plan I , I added support of the brush masks ( bitmaps ) from the file format , but there are still presets saved in the ABR format and we want to support them .
The presets are for defining the brush rotation , roundness , it ’s dynamics like spreading in some area or some color stuff like HSV changes .
I ’m working on it right now .
First I thought that let ’s create new brush engine that mimics the Photoshop one and then load the presets into this one .
But that would be waste of time .
We already have brush engines that have features like the Photoshop one , but they are scattered in our brushes engines – especially in Pixel Brush and in Spray brush .
Cyrille pointed me to this fact .
And other problem is that we need to unify the brush engines .
Those I created are little divergent to the other brush engines , so I ’m unifying .
First thing I had to do was to add support of our standard brush dialog to the spray .
That way you can spray abr bitmaps because of preddefined brush dialog shows them and you can spray Auto Brush masks and even Text .
Great , is n’t it ?
I spent few days with that .
I fixed some bugs and now the standard dialog brushes are sprayed in the same way as the old limited shapes which were there before ( pixel , anti-aliased pixel , ellipse , rectangle , brush bitmap – texture ) .
This step is needed to support the abr presets .
Made with Krita now : More realistic clouds
We also started to work on backward compatibility with our presets so I just could not dropped old shapes and pixels because your presets would be broken .
Working on backward compatibility is not very funny – but it ’s important .
It builds character as Boudewijn said .
The backward compatibility works for spray presets , if you find bugs , contact me on IRC or fill a bug report .
Made with Krita before : Comic clouds before
The old shapes are useful so you can still spray old not - softness - aware circles , ellipses etc .
I wanted to merge those stuff into our standard brush dialog , but it turned out to be complicated .
We have KisBrush class that units all the brush masks under one class .
I was trying to turn my shapes into that one , but I would need more time to design it and implement it wisely .
The outcome of this is some interesting discussion in the Krita mailing list about my idea of random shapes based on QPainterPath .
At the end of the week I spent some hours on something different than ABR brush for a while to rest from ABR .
It ’s basically UI thing for airbrushing .
We had Airbrush brush engine in Krita , but it was basically only copy of Pixel Brush with hardcoded option for incremental deliver .
We dropped it due to spray brush which simulates the Airbrush much more better and then we want to have less brush engines with overlapping features , so it was wise decision to drop the Airbrush brush engine .
Turn your brush engine into airbrush mode
Every brush engine can act like “ airbrush ” , by delivering the brush mask when you do not move with your input device in the actual position .
It ’s done on the tool level – the free hand tool incrementally call paintAt at the same position in time interval specified by rate .
So I moved the rate option from the tool to the brush engines GUI and now it is part of the UI and you can turn on / off airbrush option in the UI for brush engines which want to support “ airbrush ” mode .
And even it can be part of the brush engine settings you can save , that was not possible before .
On the different topic , I spent nice weekend shortly before my final state exam in Brussels at the Libre Graphics Meeting .
Thanks to the KDE e.V. for the sponsorship !
You can watch my talk in some funny language slovakish - english about some brush engines I wrote for Krita .
It was great event .
I met some cool guys like GIMP developers for the first time .
I also teamed up with Martin maxy Reynolds , mypaint maintainer and core developer .
Great event , nice place to talk about Krita and meet people in real - life .
What I realized at LGM :
1. Krita does not have many users .
Most probably due to not releasing stable release for a long time .
Distributions ships the stable ugly Krita 1.6.x .
Let ’s hope in change with Krita 2.3 which should be the first user - ready , stable , awesome , great , unbelieveable release .
2 . I do n’t like the vegetarian food at all .
Brussels chips fries FTW !
In my real life I graduated two weeks ago !
I ’m Ing. Lukáš Tvrdý now .
I finished 5 years of university , it can be translated to Master Of Science .
Weeeee .
I ’m now going to job interviews and writing cover letters .
So far it ’s fun .
I ’m giving a talk at Akademy 2010 about Krita : what it was like to be GSoC student , community sponsored developer , talk about how we are doing in Krita community and I will show some results of my work in Krita .
Be there 😉
The Central Bank of Iran ( CBI ) intends on converting about € 45 million of its reserves into dollars and gold , Tehran 's media reported .
According to reports , the new monetary policy will be carried out in three phases , with the first phase – converting euro reserves into dollars – already underway .
CBI Chief Mohammad Bahmani hinted of the move in April , saying the Islamic Republic will turn to dollars in view of the euro 's poor performance .
Iran has been converting its currency reserve into euros since 2006 – a move meant to meet both Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's anti-US policies , and the American currency 's weakness .
The recent change stems from the financial crisis which hit the eurozone bloc following Greece 's financial struggles .
The euro - dollar rates have devalued by 20 % since the beginning of 2010 .
Iran 's foreign currency reserves , which are estimated at $ 100 billion – half of which are in euros – had to sustain the loss .
These major losses deteriorated the Iranian economy – which is struggling with international sanctions on top of domestic difficulties – further .

We know that there are more addicting things out there than Marijuana , we just had no idea that the iPad was on the list .
Now we ’re not saying that weed affects your mental state , but how else can you explain this unbelievably absurd Onion - esque news story from Gilbert , Arizona .
This past Thursday , Police arrested two men who posted a Craigslist ad ( pictured above ) in an effort to try and trade a 32 GB iPod Touch and a sizeable amount of Pot in exchange for an iPad .
And as if that was n’t dumb enough , these enterprising young fellows actually posted a picture of their weed on a scale , sitting right next to a third - generation iPod Touch .
Who knows , maybe the weed , which the Craigslist ad refers to as “ blue dream straight outta cali ” , had to be seen to be believed .
Then again , if it was really that good , maybe they would have asked for the 64GB iPad 3G model instead .
In any event , after receiving a tip about the obviously illegal posting , undercover police officers answered the ad and subsequently arrested 20 - year old Jacob Walker when they met up under the auspices of completing the advertised exchange .
Also arrested was Walker ’s partner in crime , 20 - year old Joseph Velarde who also hails from Gilbert , Arizona .
According to Gilbert Police Sergeant Mark Marino , the arrests were made once Walker proffered the Marijuana to the undercover agents .
Both now face charges for possession of an illegal substance and conspiracy to sell Marijuana .
And pictured below are the mugshots of these criminal masterminds , Walker on the left and Velarde on the right .
As far as we can tell , Walker looks high while Velarde looks pissed that the iPad does n’t support Flash .

Even though many Android users are still stuck with Android 1.5 or Android 1.6 , it looks like the Android 2.2 is successfully ported to the iPhone .
Android pot is not new to the iPhone , earlier we showed you the iPhoDroid which helps you port Android 2.1 to your iPhone and then we also showed you how to do it .
But , having the Froyo on your iPhone at such an early time can be amazing .
Although , the port is a success a few things are still not in place .
Most importantly , the WiFi is currently not working , there is no power management to speak of and the device gets extremely hot in a few minutes of use .
The biggest problem is that the Android 2.2 is not yet capable of recognizing the iPhone ’s GPU , so you wo n’t get a smooth experience after the port .
Well , I just want to say that try it on your own risk and if you are weak at heart then forget about it and wait for a safer port as more version of this hack are in queue and they will be released soon .

Unemployed need not apply
Job seekers meet with a recruiter at a recent jobs fair in Davie , Fla .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The last thing someone who is unemployed needs to be told is that they should n't even apply for the limited number of job openings that are available .
But some companies and recruiters are doing just that .
Employment experts say they believe companies are increasingly interested only in applicants who already have a job .

" I think it is more prevalent than it used to be , " said Rich Thompson , vice president of learning and performance for Adecco Group North America , the world 's largest staffing firm .
" I do n't have hard numbers , but three out of the last four conversations I 've had about openings , this requirement was brought up . "
Some job postings include restrictions such as " unemployed candidates will not be considered " or " must be currently employed . "
Those explicit limitations have occasionally been removed from listings when an employer or recruiter is questioned by the media though .
That 's what happened with numerous listings for grocery store managers throughout the Southeast posted by a South Carolina recruiter , Latro Consulting .
After CNNMoney called seeking comments on the listings last week , the restriction against unemployed candidates being considered came down .
Latro Consulting refused to comment when contacted .
Sony Ericsson , a global phone manufacturer that was hiring for a new Georgia facility , also removed a similar restriction after local reporters wrote about it .
According to reports , a Sony Ericsson spokesperson said that a mistake had been made .
But even if companies do n't spell out in a job listing that they wo n't consider someone who currently does n't have a job , experts said that unemployed applicants are typically ruled out right off the bat .
" Most executive recruiters wo n't look at a candidate unless they have a job , even if they do n't like to admit to it , " said Lisa Chenofsky Singer , a human resources consultant from Millburn , NJ , specializing in media and publishing jobs .
She said when she proposes candidates for openings , the first question she is often asked by a recruiter is if they currently have a job .
If the answer is no , she 's typically told the unemployed candidate wo n't be interviewed .
" They think you must have been laid off for performance issues , " she said , adding that this is a " myth " in a time of high unemployment .
It is not against the law for companies to exclude the unemployed when trying to fill positions , but Judy Conti , a lobbyist for the National Employment Law Project , said the practice is a bad one .
" Making that kind of automatic cut is senseless ; you could be missing out on the best person of all , " she said .
" There are millions of people who are unemployed through no fault of their own .
If an employer feels that the best qualified are the ones already working , they have no appreciation of the crisis we 're in right now . "
Conti added that firms that hire unemployed job seekers could also benefit from a recently - passed tax break that essentially exempts them from paying the 6.2 % of the new hire 's wages in Social Security taxes for the rest of this year .
Thompson said he also thinks ruling out the unemployed is a bad idea .
But he said that part of the problem is that recruiters and human resource departments are being overwhelmed with applications for any job opening that is posted .
So they 're looking for any short - cuts to get the list of applicants to consider down to a more manageable size .
" It 's a tough process to determine which unemployed applicants were laid off even though they brought value to their company and which ones had performance issues , " he said .
" I understand the notion .
But there 's the top x percent of unemployed candidates who are very viable and very valuable .
You just have to do the work to find them . "

Is enough being done to protect us from chemicals that could harm us ?
Watch " Toxic America , " a special two - night investigative report with Sanjay Gupta , M.D. , June 2 and 3 at 8 p.m. ET on CNN .
( CNN ) --
If you 're eating non-organic celery today , you may be ingesting 67 pesticides with it , according to a new report from the Environmental Working Group .
The group , a nonprofit focused on public health , scoured nearly 100,000 produce pesticide reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine what fruits and vegetables we eat have the highest , and lowest , amounts of chemical residue .
Most alarming are the fruits and vegetables dubbed the " Dirty Dozen , " which contain 47 to 67 pesticides per serving .
These foods are believed to be most susceptible because they have soft skin that tends to absorb more pesticides .
" It 's critical people know what they are consuming , " the Environmental Working Group 's Amy Rosenthal said .
" The list is based on pesticide tests conducted after the produce was washed with USDA high - power pressure water system .
The numbers reflect the closest thing to what consumers are buying at the store . "
Special report : Toxic America
The group suggests limiting consumption of pesticides by purchasing organic for the 12 fruits and vegetables .
" You can reduce your exposure to pesticides by up to 80 percent by buying the organic version of the Dirty Dozen , " Rosenthal said .
The Dirty Dozen
Celery
Peaches
Strawberries
Apples
Domestic blueberries
Nectarines
Sweet bell peppers
Spinach , kale and collard greens
Cherries
Potatoes
Imported grapes
Lettuce
Not all non-organic fruits and vegetables have a high pesticide level .
Some produce has a strong outer layer that provides a defense against pesticide contamination .
The group found a number of non-organic fruits and vegetables dubbed the " Clean 15 " that contained little to no pesticides .
The Clean 15
Onions
Avocados
Sweet corn
Pineapples
Mango
Sweet peas
Asparagus
Kiwi fruit
Cabbage

What is a pesticide ?
A pesticide is a mixture of chemical substances used on farms to destroy or prevent pests , diseases and weeds from affecting crops .
According to the USDA , 45 percent of the world 's crops are lost to damage or spoilage , so many farmers count on pesticides .
The Environmental Protection Agency , the FDA and the USDA work together to monitor and set limits as to how much pesticide can be used on farms and how much is safe to remain on the produce once it hits grocery store shelves .
" In setting the tolerance amount , the EPA must make a safety finding that the pesticide can be used with ' reasonable certainty of no harm . '
The EPA ensures that the tolerance selected will be safe , " according the EPA 's website .
Although the President 's Cancer Panel recently recommended that consumers eat produce without pesticides to reduce their risk of getting cancer and other diseases , the low levels of pesticides found on even the Dirty Dozen are government - approved amounts .
Can small amounts of pesticides hurt you ?
The government says that consuming pesticides in low amounts does n't harm you , but some studies show an association between pesticides and health problems such as cancer , attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder and nervous system disorders and say exposure could weaken immune systems .
The Environmental Working Group acknowledges that data from long - term studies are n't available but warns consumers of the potential dangers .
" Pesticides are designed to kill things .
Why wait for 20 years to discover they are bad for us ? "
Rosenthal said .
Some doctors warn that children 's growing brains are the most vulnerable to pesticides in food .
" A kid 's brain goes through extraordinary development , and if pesticides get into the brain , it can cause damage , " said Dr. Philip Landrigan , chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York .
Can pesticides be washed away ?
Not necessarily .
The pesticide tests mentioned above were conducted after the food had been power - washed by the USDA .
Also , although some pesticides are found on the surface of foods , other pesticides may be taken up through the roots and into the plant and cannot be removed .
" We 've found that washing does n't do much , " Rosenthal said .
" Peeling can help , although you have to take into account that the pesticides are in the water , so they can be inside the fruit because of the soil . "
All fresh produce , whether it 's grown with or without pesticides , should be washed with water to remove dirt and potentially harmful bacteria .
And health experts agree that when it comes to the Dirty Dozen list , choose organic if it 's available .
" To the extent you can afford to do so , [ parents ] should simply buy organic , because there have been some very good studies that shows people who eat mostly organic food reduce 95 percent of pesticides [ in their body ] in two weeks , " Landrigan said .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Obese women have four times as many unplanned pregnancies as healthy - weight women despite having less sex , and obese men are more likely to have sexual diseases despite fewer partners , scientists said on Wednesday .
In a study showing how obesity can harm sexual health , French and British researchers also found that obese women are less likely to ask for contraceptive advice or use the pill , and obese men are more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction .
With obesity epidemics overwhelming many wealthy nations and threatening increasing numbers of developing countries , experts said the public health impact of the findings was important .
In the United States , for example , two - thirds of adults are overweight or obese .
“ In public health terms , the study lends a new slant to a familiar message : that obesity can harm not only health and longevity , but your sex life , ” Sandy Goldbeck - Wood , a specialist in psychosexual medicine at Britain ’s Ipswich Hospital , wrote in an editorial on the study in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) .
The research , led by Professor Nathalie Bajos of France ’s National Institute for Health and Medical Research ( INSERM ) , is the first major study to investigate the impact of being overweight or obese on sexual activity and other factors such as sexual satisfaction , unintended pregnancy and abortion .
The authors surveyed the sexual behavior of 12,364 men and women aged between 18 and 69 years in France in 2006 .
Around half of them were normal weight , with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 18.5 to 25 , around 2,500 of them were overweight , with a BMI of 25 to 30 , and around 750 of them were obese , with a BMI over 30 .
Compared to normal weight men , obese men were 70 percent less likely to have had more than one sexual partner in the past year and two and half times more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction .
Obese men under 30 years old were far more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease .
Sexual dysfunction was not linked to BMI in women , but obese women under 30 years old were less likely than women of normal weight to seek contraceptive advice or use oral contraceptives and were also more likely to report an unplanned pregnancy .
The study also found that obese women were five times as likely to have met their partner on the internet , more likely to have an obese partner , and less likely to view sex as important for personal life balance .
Bajos said social pressure , low self - esteem and concerns about body image may help explain these findings .
Goldbeck - Wood said there was evidence that doctors find it difficult to discuss sex and weight issues with patients , but she said they must be more prepared to do so : “ We need to understand more about how obese people feel about their sex lives , and what drives the observed behaviors and attitudes . ”

Oregon 's 32,929 medical marijuana users can't be denied concealed handgun licenses , despite the efforts of at least two sheriffs who want to keep concealed weapons out of those hands .
The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled this week that Washington County Sheriff Rob Gordon and Jackson County Sheriff Mike Winters were mistaken in their interpretation of the federal Gun Control Act .
The act states that " an unlawful user ... of any controlled substance " can't own a gun , and the sheriffs contended the federal act trumps Oregon 's medical marijuana law .
Though federal law prohibits marijuana , Oregon 's 12 - year - old law legalizes pot possession for patients with qualifying ailments and a doctor 's approval .
Leland Berger , who represented four medical marijuana users who were denied concealed handgun licenses , was relieved by the Court of Appeals decision .
He sees the sheriffs ' denial of licenses as discrimination against patients who use cannabis to treat debilitating health problems -- including cancer , glaucoma , seizures , nausea and severe pain .
" They are opposed to the law generally , and this is how they express their opposition to the law , " Berger said , adding that fighting the cases was expensive for the counties .
" The downside is it 's a huge waste of taxpayer resources . "
Elmer Dickens , who argued the case for the Washington County sheriff , took offense at Berger 's characterization .
" We absolutely do n't think this has anything to do with discrimination , " Dickens said .
" And frankly , he 's impugning the integrity of every sheriff in the state . "
Dickens said Washington County was the first in the state to ask applicants seeking concealed gun licenses whether they use medical marijuana and to deny those who said yes .
He said sheriffs in many other counties -- including Coos and Douglas -- followed , seeing Washington County 's logic : that sheriffs are sworn to enforce the law and federal law forbids pot smokers from possessing guns .
Multnomah County asks applicants the same question , but a sheriff 's employee who handles applications said medical marijuana users are n't denied licenses .
Clackamas County does n't ask .
State law does n't direct counties to do so .
Washington County has n't decided whether to appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court .
Sheriff Gordon is on vacation and could n't be reached for comment .
Douglas County Sheriff Winters also could n't be reached for comment .
At the center of the case is Steve Schwerdt , who used marijuana and other medications for debilitating back and knee pain that is so bad he sometimes can't walk .
Washington County denied him a concealed handgun renewal , he fought it , and in 2005 Circuit Judge Marco Hernandez ruled in his favor -- a county attorney says because he could n't prove Schwerdt actually owned a gun .
Washington County later pulled Schwerdt 's license , Schwerdt went to court again , and Circuit Judge Steven Price ruled in favor of Schwerdt and two other cannabis cardholders .
The county turned to the Court of Appeals .
" I 'm getting tired of having to go through this over and over again , " Schwerdt said .
Schwerdt said he feels as if the sheriff has put him in the same category as heroin addicts .
" The first time around I sat there and felt like I was a junkie , " Schwerdt said .
" They treat you like you 're something that you 're not -- a criminal and the sort .
And I 'm not . "
Although medical marijuana users who practice the Second Amendment celebrated the appellate ruling , their legal standing remains unclear .
In April , the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that medical marijuana users can be fired for drug use .
Specifically , in overturning a Court of Appeals ruling , the high court said federal law requiring employers to accommodate disabled workers does n't cover medical marijuana users .
Adding to the murkiness , the Obama administration last year told federal authorities not to arrest or prosecute medical marijuana users .
A tally at the time showed 14 states , including Washington and California , allowed some medical marijuana use .
The Oregon Firearms Federation has no problem with medical marijuana cardholders carrying concealed weapons -- or for that matter , any law - abiding citizen , said federation director Kevin Starrett .

TRUTH , RATIONALITY , AND THE SITUATION
Mark A. Notturno
If my view of the social sciences and their methods is correct , then admittedly , no explanatory theory in the social sciences can be expected to be true .
Nevertheless , this need not trouble an anti-instrumentalist .
For he may be able to show that those methods may be very good methods , in the sense that they make it possible for us to discuss critically which of the competing theories , or models , is a better approximation to the truth .
-- Karl Popper
I
The Myth of the Framework
Poverty of Historicism
The Austrian Academy of Sciences ' Research Unit for Socioeconomics organized a workshop , which was held in Vienna in October of 1997 , to discuss the impact -- or lack of impact -- of Karl Popper 's ideas regarding situational analysis upon the social sciences .
The catalyst for the workshop was the publication of , a volume that includes Popper 's 1963 Harvard University lecture ' Models , Instruments and Truth ' , in which Popper explains the idea of situational analysis that he first introduced in his .
I am not , myself , an economist or a social scientist .
But I was invited to speak at the workshop as the editor of the volume in which Popper 's paper appeared .
I must confess that I was somewhat surprised both by the theme of the workshop and by some of its premises .
The working assumption for the workshop seemed to be that Popper had made a ' plea ' for situational analysis , that this plea had been ignored , and that situational analysis was not , as a consequence , widely used in the social sciences .
Egon Matzner , one of the organizers of the workshop , articulated the problem in his background paper as follows :
In spite of Popper 's forceful plea for ' situational analysis ' its impact , compared to the attraction of his ' falsification criterion ' , was very modest .
There are hardly more than a dozen articles in the specialist literature .
Matzner himself attributed this scarcity of articles to ' the fact that social analysis was equated by Popper himself with the application of the rationality principle ' :
The use neoclassical mainstream makes of the rationality principle focuses on the rather simple social situation in which an agent maximises his / her utility under ( monetary ) constraints .
This is , in itself , not yet objectionable .
The important point , however , is the fact that the logic of a social situation depends in almost all relevant problems on more than budget contraints and other conventional elements .
Such a simple social situation misses what Popper himself describes as a social situation .
But he went on to say that the problem of the workshop was to ' inform about the status and signification of Popper 's Situational Analysis in various social sciences ' , to explain why Popper 's ideas regarding situational analysis had ' so far had almost no impact on research programs ' , and to determine what ' potential contribution ' they ' can be expected to make ' .
I was not too surprised , with this as a background , to find that many of the social scientists at the workshop had only a vague familiarity with Popper 's ideas regarding situational analysis and the rationality principle .
Some of them , thinking that Popper equated rationality with rational choice theory , attributed too much to the rationality principle .
Others , thinking that he ignored the role played by institutions , attributed too little to the social situation .
In this way , some of them criticized him and others praised him for ' blindspots ' and ' insights ' that in my estimation originated largely in their own imaginations .
In my view , whether or not social scientists have written on situational analysis , or have even heard of it at all , has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not it is the method of the social sciences .
I have little doubt that Popper 's descriptions of situational logic , social situations , and the rationality principle are oversimplifications .
But oversimplification , in my view , is a large part of what Popper thought social science , and science in general , is all about .
I do not mean this as a criticism .
And I will , in the course of this paper , try to explain why I do not .
But I also want to address a more general problem that is raised by ' Models , Instruments , and Truth ' .
It is the problem of how to reconcile Popper 's talk about conjecture and refutation , error-elimination , and truth as the regulative ideal of science with his acknowledgement that scientists work with theories and models that they know to be false .
It is , as Popper addresses it in the context of ' Models , Instruments , and Truth ' , the problem of how to distinguish his critical rationalism from instrumentalism .
II
Karl Popper used to teach that science is trial and error , and that the aim of science is to get closer and closer to the truth .
This is what he meant by conjecture and refutation .
And it is also what he meant by his tetradic schema P1 -> TT -> EE -> P2 .
We put forth theories in an attempt to solve our problems , and we subject those theories to criticism in an attempt to eliminate their errors .
In this way , we make progress in solving our problems and , in so doing , get closer and closer to the truth .
Popper , in the late fifties , offered a mathematical definition of ' verisimilitude ' in an attempt to formalize his idea of getting closer and closer to the truth .
And Pavel Tichy , in the mid-seventies , showed that the problem of formalizing the idea of ' verisimilitude ' is not as easy to solve as Popper had initially thought .
Some people have concluded from this that the task of science is not to get closer and closer to the truth , but to get truth itself and to eliminate falsity per se .
David Miller , for example , writes , as a restatement and defence of critical rationalism , that ' The task of empirical science , like that of other investigative disciplines , is to separate as thoroughly and efficiently as it can the true statements about the world from those that are false , and to retain the truths ' .
1
I do not , however , think that this statement about the task of empirical science is true .
For suppose that there are no true universal statements about the world , but that we can determine whether any singular statement about the world is true or false .
It would then follow that all universal theories about the world are false and should be eliminated from empirical science .
But we might still find it preferable to work with false universal theories instead of true singular statements -- and especially if the counter - examples to such theories are well - known -- since there are simply too many true singular statements to remember .
Be this as it may , Miller 's account of the task of empirical science is certainly false -- if for no other reason than that there is an infinite number of true statements about the world that no empirical science has ever found interesting enough to record .
Consider the simple fact that I am here in Budapest writing this paper .
This fact can be represented by a true statement : ' Notturno is in Budapest writing a paper ' .
And this , no doubt , is a true statement about the world .
But no empirical science that I know has found this truth interesting enough to record , let alone to separate as thoroughly and efficiently as it can from the false statement that I 'm not .
There is nothing special about this particular statement .
There is , on the contrary , an infinite number of true statements about the world that no empirical science would ever , or should ever , take notice .
So what has gone wrong here ?
At this point , the naive response would be that ' Science does not deal with any old truth .
Science deals with scientific truth .
The task of empirical science is not to separate the true statements about the world from the false ones .
It is to separate the scientific truths from the scientific falsehoods , and to retain , once again , the scientific truths . '
This , however , would be too naive .
For the problem lies precisely in determining which of the true statements about the world are the scientific ones and which are not .
But even were we to solve this problem , the naive response would still be false as a restatement of Popper 's position .
Consider the rationality principle , which says that ' Each person acts adequately to the situation ' .
The rationality principle animates the so - called ' situational logic ' that Popper said we use to explain actions and events in social science .
It is , according to Popper , 'an integral part of every , or nearly every , testable social theory ' .2
But Popper thought that the rationality principle is false , 3 and he also thought that social scientists should retain it despite the fact that it is false .
4
If what Miller said were true , then one might expect Popper to separate the rationality principle as thoroughly and efficiently as he could from the true statement that people do not always act adequately to the situation -- and to retain that statement instead .
But this is not what he does .
On the contrary , Popper addresses ' the problem raised by the known falsity of social theories ' , 5 arguing that we should retain the rationality principle despite the fact that it is false .
I conclude from this that Miller 's statement , as a restatement of Popper 's epistemology , is false .
There is , however , a problem here .
The problem , once again , is how to reconcile Popper 's falsificationism with his seemingly contradictory acknowledgement that scientists work with theories and models that they know to be false .
It is , once again , the problem of how to distinguish critical rationalism from instrumentalism .
III
It is tempting to dismiss Popper 's account of the rationality principle and his talk about the known falsity of social theories as an inconsistency , and to try to explain it with two words : ' Social Science ' .
It is well - known that Popper had ambivalent feelings about social science and about its relationship to the natural sciences .
He used to joke that social science began with the idea that we need a special science to get rid of our social problems -- and that our greatest social problem now is how to get rid of the social scientists .
And he vacillated as to whether and how the methods of the social and natural sciences differ .
But there is no inconsistency here , and ' social science ' is no explanation .
Popper thought that the natural sciences also work with theories that are false and -- what is more important -- with theories that we know to be false , and how they are false ( at least as well as we know anything at all ) .
Natural scientists , for example , frequently work with models .
But according to Popper :
In every case in which we operate with a model , however far we may go , we are operating with a false picture of the facts .
It is a false picture of the facts because it oversimplifies the facts .
So no model is really true .
Our astronomical models may represent the planets as mass - points , or the sun as an ellipsoid .
But :
We actually know very well that the sun is n't really an ellipsoid , that it instead has craters and all sorts of bulges owing to the fact that it changes .
We know that all sorts of things are going on there , that the sun has bulges that are not really stable , protuberances , and all sorts of things .
And we know that the earth has mountains and seas , and that its possession of mountains and seas plays a certain role in connection with the theory of the tides .
6
But now suppose that we want to explain why Slovenia was not invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1997 .
We could , like many Slovenians , say that NATO is run by madmen , and leave it at that .
And if we did , then our statement may even be true .
But it would not be an .
It would , on the contrary , be tantamount to saying that we cannot give an explanation .
To say that someone did something because he is a madman is to confess that we cannot really explain it at all .
This is the fundamental insight , and the methodological point , behind the rationality principle .
The rationality principle is not the empirical hypothesis that each person acts adequately to the situation .
That hypothesis is clearly false .
It is , on the contrary , a methodological principle that places restrictions upon what will and will not count as a rational explanation .
It says that if we want to explain a social event rationally , then we must assume that the people in it acted adequately to the situation , or , at the very least , that they acted adequately to the situation as they saw it .
Some people will say that only a madman would elevate an empirical falsehood into a methodological principle .
But the rationality principle has analogues in empirical science , and even in philosophy .
This is because its fundamental insight and methodological point pertains not so much to social science as to explanation in general .
We do not explain the perihelion of Mercury by saying that there are no general laws of planetary motion .
And ironic as it may sound , we do not explain the Copernican Revolution by saying that it was a scientific revolution .
We might as well say that a miracle occurred .
Even if abstract universal laws did not exist , our attempts to explain natural phenomena would have to assume that they did -- just as our attempt to say something that is true must assume that one of two contradictory statements is false .
We can argue about what constitutes a law of nature , and about whether or not laws of nature actually exist .
But to assume that laws of nature do not exist , even if it were true , would be to assume that natural phenomena cannot be rationally explained .
The primary task of science is not to differentiate the true from the false .
It is to solve scientific problems .
It is , as Popper saw it , to explain the things that we want to understand , but are not yet able to understand or explain rationally .
This is what is primary .
The truth or falsity of the theories that we propose as solutions to our problems pertains to this task .
But the only real grip that we ever get upon the truth or falsity of our theories is through their success or failure in solving the problems for which they were created to solve .
And it is clear , since we are willing to work with theories that we know to be false , that the thorough and efficient differentiation of the true from the false remains secondary to the solution of scientific problems .
IV
Popper used to say that science begins and ends with problems .
He would say that we cannot really understand a theory unless we understand the problems that it is supposed to solve and the problem situation in which it was introduced .
He thought that science teaching could be improved by focusing upon problems and problem situations instead of upon theories .
And he proposed a new format for writing science articles that would highlight the problems that they discuss .
This is what Miller leaves out of his account of critical rationalism .
We are searching for truth , no doubt .
But for truth that is interesting and pertinent to what we are trying to explain .
And we may , everything else being equal , well prefer false theories that are interesting and pertinent over true theories that are not .
Truth and falsity are not themselves relative to our problems and problem situations .
But our decision to work with a false theory , as opposed to eliminating it , certainly is .
This is why P1 -> TT -> EE -> P2 is an oversimplification .
Whether we should work with a theory that we know to be false or eliminate our error will depend almost entirely upon our alternatives , and upon the problem that they are supposed to solve .
V
This is where models come in .
Popper distinguished problems of explaining or predicting singular events from problems of explaining or predicting a kind or type of event .
' The difference between these two kinds of problems ' , according to Popper , 'is that the first can be solved without constructing a model , while the second is most easily solved by means of constructing a model '.7
A model , according to Popper , consists of certain elements placed in a typical relationship to each other , plus certain universal ' animating ' laws .
8
Models differ from theories in that theories use abstract universal laws that allow them to make statements about singular events , whereas models try to capture the typical aspects of a situation so as to make statements about a kind or type of event .
Models may be called ' theories ' .
But real theories represent abstract universal laws , whereas models represent typical ( and not necessarily actual ) initial conditions .
This , according to Popper , makes models especially important in the social sciences , because the ' method of explaining and predicting singular events by universal laws and initial conditions is hardly ever applicable in the theoretical social sciences '.9
I am not sure that this is how we understand models today .
Today we do use models to explain and predict singular events .
And today , we are more likely to regard a model , be it in physics or in economics , as a description that attempts to capture the essential aspects of a system in a form that is simple enough for the mathematics to be solved .
One thing , however , is clear .
Models are oversimplifications , and as oversimplifications , they give false descriptions of the systems that they represent .
Does this pose a problem in and of itself ?
I do not think so .
We often work with oversimplified rules of thumb that would soon prove disasterous were we to follow them strictly in each and every case .
Paul Feyerabend thought that this refutes Popper 's epistemology .
But I think that it shows that Feyerabend did not really understand it .
Conjecture and refutation must always be supplemented with judgements regarding problems and problem situations and what will and will not work well within them .
Popper , insofar as this is concerned , used to describe his own formulations about method as oversimplifications that should not , strictly speaking , be taken as true descriptions of how science actually works , or even as prescriptions of how scientists ought to work in each and every case .
But lest this be misunderstood , he would quickly add that science is in general an oversimplification , and that the issue is not whether you oversimplify but whether or not you oversimplify well .
This explains at once how Popper 's critical rationalism differs from Miller 's restatement .
Both are oversimplifications .
But Popper 's oversimplification is better , since it explains what is happening , and why , when we decide to work with a theory that we know is false instead of eliminating it .
It also explains why formal logic cannot capture the idea of verisimilitude .
Formal logic is also an oversimplification .
But since it deals with form instead of meaning , its oversimplification is not sensitive enough to distinguish falsehoods that might be interesting and pertinent to a given problem situation from those that would not .
And it explains , in the end , how critical rationalism differs from instrumentalism .
Instrumentalists and critical rationalists agree that we use models to solve scientific problems .
But the problems that instrumentalists want to solve are primarily problems of prediction , and the problems that critical rationalists want to solve are problems of explanation .
We may well believe that our explanations are false .
But some explanations are closer to the truth than others .
So even though we may never be able to say that our theories are true , we need not say that they are merely instruments , or tools , for making predictions .
On the contrary , it is more likely that our predictions are tools for determining which of our theories is closest to the truth .
Still , supplementing conjecture and refutation with judgements about our problem situation poses problems of its own .
The main problem , if our decision to eliminate or work with a false theory depends upon our problem situation , is that our problems are not always clear while we are working on them , and may very well change as we work ourselves through them .
This is what P1 -> TT -> EE -> P2 is all about .
It means that we may have only a vague idea of our problem situation while we are in it .
And it means that we are likely to make mistakes when we have to decide whether to eliminate or retain a theory that we think is false .
I do not think that there is any way to avoid this problem .
But I think that we can , by working with models , and by constructing better and better models , continually improve our understanding of our problems and problem situations .
VI
A model can be likened to a map , and a map may be more or less accurate .
We may criticize and correct a map if it does not represent what we want to represent with the detail and accuracy that we need .
But whether or not we will actually do so will depend upon our needs and , in particular , upon what we want to do with the map .
A map of Vienna is inaccurate if it locates the Stephansdom on the outskirts of the city instead of in the center .
But such a map may be perfectly adequate if the only thing that we want to do with it is to show that the Stephansdom is in Vienna and not in Graz .
We should not expect -- and I do not think that anyone really does expect -- our maps to be perfectly accurate and detailed in every respect .
On the contrary , a map that was perfectly accurate and detailed in every respect would be entirely useless as a map , if indeed we could regard it as a map at all .
Imagine a map of Vienna in which everything in Vienna -- including the Stephansdom , the archbishop , and each of his altars -- is represented exactly the way it appears in Vienna itself .
This would be a dynamic map representing not only streets and buildings and airports and tram stations , but cars and people and insects and flowers moving exactly as they move in Vienna itself .
It would even represent me , as I drive my Toyota into the city and search for a place to park .
But even if we could arrange this map so that each of its objects lay exactly on top of the one that it represents , it could still not provide a perfectly accurate and detailed representation in every respect .
Since no two objects can occupy the same place at the same time , its spatio - temporal coordinates would necessarily be just off .
One of my postmodernist friends has suggested that we could correct this flaw by taking Vienna as a map of itself .
And this , no doubt , is a postmodern suggestion .
But I do n't think that we need to think about it too long in order to see that such a postmodern map could not possibly serve any of the functions that maps are supposed to serve .
Maps and models are and ought to be oversimplifications .
But whether or not they are good oversimplifications will depend upon what we want to do with them , and upon whether and to what extent they enable us to do what we want to do with them .
It will , in other words , depend almost entirely upon the problems that we want to solve , and upon the alternatives that we have available .
It will , in a word , depend upon our problem situations .
Newton 's problem was to explain the motions of the planets .
His laws of motion describe how bodies move in an ideal state .
Newton 's first law says that ' Every body continues in its state of rest , or of uniform motion in a right line , unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it . '
But no body has ever continued in its state of rest or in a right line over infinite space and time .
And , indeed , no body , if Newton 's theory were correct , ever could -- if only because all bodies , according to Newton 's theory , influence each other by the force of gravity .
Newton 's universal theory of motion was an abstract idealization .
But Newton also constructed a model of the solar system in order to explain how the planets move in a way that people could understand .
Newton 's model , like all models , is an oversimplification .
It represents the planets as mass - points , and it leaves out the asteroids and the cosmic dust .
It represents neither the pressure of the light of the sun nor the pressure of cosmic radiation .
It does not even represent the action of the distant masses upon the bodies of the solar system -- let alone the magnetic properties of the planets , or the electrical fields that result in their neighborhood from the movement of these magnets .
10
But it is difficult to see how anyone could possibly have understood it , let alone worked with it , had it not oversimplified things in this way .
The interactions between all these bodies , and the mathematics needed to describe them , would simply be too complex .
Indeed , even as things stand today , we need models and approximation techniques when dealing with Newton 's theory because it is too difficult to obtain exact solutions to problems involving interactions between more than two bodies .
Newton 's theory of motion was also an oversimplification .
And we have , despite some early hopes , known for a long time that it is an oversimplification .
It does not explain all of the observed phenomena .
But we used it , knowing that it does not explain all of the observed phenomena , partly because we had no better alternative , partly because we hoped to improve it , and partly because it explained how things are in the abstract in a way that allowed us to understand what we observed in the concrete in a way that was satisfactory enough for our purposes until our purposes and alternatives changed .
I emphasize that Newton 's theory was an oversimplification not in order to criticize it , but simply to underscore the fact that all scientific theories are oversimplifications .
No scientific theory can represent the world exactly the way it is .
But this is not so much a flaw in our scientific theories , as it is a prerequisite for them to be able to solve the problems that we want them to solve .
VII
But what about verisimilitude ?
And what , more importantly , about Slovenia ?
Popper , despite his frequent criticisms of definitions and ' What is ' questions , seems to have had a weakness for them .
11 He admired Tarski's definition of truth .
And he was proud of his own definition of ' verisimilitude ' .
Popper attempted to define ' verisimilitude ' in terms of truth and falsity contents , and to measure a false theory 's verisimilitude by counting and comparing the number of its true and false consequences .
Popper 's definition of ' verisimilitude ' does not work because every false theory has exactly the same number of true and false consequences as every other .
And Popper long ago acknowledged the fact .
Many critics seem to regard this as a great embarrassment .
But few of them , as far as I can see , thinks that ' verisimilitude ' is meaningless or that one theory cannot be closer to the truth than another .
In my view , trying to measure verisimilitude by counting a theory 's true or false consequences always missed the point .
Every false theory has the same number ( if we can really talk this way ) of true and false consequences as every other .
This is a consequence of the truth - functional nature of our logical connectives and the truth - functional definition of validity .
But some false statements are still closer to the truth than others .
All of our models of the solar system are false .
But some say that the earth moves in a circle around the sun , and others say that it does n't move at all .
Our best model to date -- the one that seems to explain more than any of the others -- says that the earth moves in an ellipse around the sun .
Let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that it does .
There is , given the problem situation of determining whether and how the earth moves , then a perfectly clear sense in which a model that shows the earth moving in a circle around the sun is closer to the truth than one that fails to show it moving at all .
VIII
Slovenia is more difficult , but not very different .
It seems false , if we want to explain why Slovenia was not admitted into NATO in 1997 , to say that it did not satisfy the critera for admission .
But it seems even more false to say that it was not admitted because NATO did not expand in 1997 at all .
Indeed , part of the problem situation is to explain why Slovenia was not admitted while Hungary , Poland , and the Czech Republic were .
I mention Slovenia not in order to give another argument for verisimilitude , but because I was surprised to read that situational analysis has had such little impact upon the methodology of the social sciences , and because I am wondering whether or not it really is true .
I am not an economist or a sociologist .
So what I have to say may reflect nothing more than my own ignorance .
But I did attend a conference in Budapest on ' NATO Enlargement , Reforms of the European Union and the Central European Region ' , and I was struck by the fact that each of the social scientists who spoke relied entirely upon situational analysis .
Their models of the social situation were different .
Some relied primarily upon political considerations , others upon economic considerations .
But each of the speakers analyzed the situation in an attempt to explain why NATO decided not to admit Slovenia .
And each did so in a way that , given the assumptions of his model , represented the decision as rational .
None of these speakers mentioned Popper , situational logic , or the rationality principle .
But the analyses that they gave were all examples of it .
So I would be tempted , as a first attempt at answering Dr. Matzner 's questions , to say that the reason why Popper 's views on situational analysis and the rationality principle have not had much impact on research programs and have not inspired a greater response in the literature is that there was never any real controversy about them in the first place -- as there was , for example , about his ideas that falsifiability is the criterion of a scientific theory and that scientists should actively try to falsify their theories .
There may , however , be more to it than this .
So let me briefly mention two points that may be somewhat interrelated .
First , the problem of situational analysis in the theoretical and historical social sciences , in Popper 's view , is not to construct models that predict or prophesize the future .
It is to construct models that help us to explain and understand the past .
When we try to explain why Richard made all those funny movements while crossing the street , we are trying to explain an event that has already happened .
We are not trying to predict how Richard will move the next time he crosses the street .
Similarly , the speakers at the NATO conference were trying to explain why something that had already happened had happened .
Many of them predicted that Slovenia would be admitted in 1999 .
But they typically added that the prediction might prove false .
And I only wish to add that if the prediction does prove false , then we will , come 1999 , be analyzing the situation once again , in an effort to give a rational explanation as to why it did .
This issue -- whether a model is supposed to be a tool for explanation and understanding , or a tool for prediction and prophecy -- is precisely what separates critical rationalism from instrumentalism .
And this brings me to the second point , which is that Popper appealed to his definition of verisimilitude in order to explain how his treatment of the known falsity of social theories differs from instrumentalism .
I do n't mean to be pedantic , but Popper did not characterize situational analysis as the fundamental problem of the social sciences -- as Dr. Matzner suggests in his background paper for this workshop -- but as the fundamental problem in the theoretical and historical social sciences .
The fundamental problem , in a nutshell , 'is to explain and understand events in terms of human actions and social situations ' .
12
' It is to trace the unintended social repercussions of intentional human actions . '13
This is important , because if we adopt the instrumentalist philosophy , then economics and sociology would not be theoretical or historical social sciences primarily interested in problems of explanation , but applied social sciences primarily interested in problems of prediction .
And I want to emphasize this , because some people might think that Popper 's failure to give a formal definition of verisimilitude means that there is no real difference between critical rationalism and instrumentalism after all .
But what do economists think ?
Is economics a theoretical or an applied science ?
Is it more interested in problems of explanation or in problems of rediction ?
In his Economics : Problems , Principles , Decisions , Edwin Mansfield writes that ' the best way to get an idea of what economics is all about is to look at some of the problems it can help illuminate ' .
Mansfield goes on to list the following questions as ' typical economic problems ' :
What determines the extent of unemployment in the American economy , and what can be done to reduce it ?
What determines the rate of inflation , and how can it be reduced ?
What determines the rate of increase of labor productivity ?
Why has this productivity slowdown occurred in the United States ?
What measures can and should be adopted to cope with it ?
Why is business competition desirable ?
Why does poverty exist in the world today , and what can be done to abolish it ?
These all sound like problems of explanation .
But Mansfield quickly turns to a discussion of models .
And when he does , we find that the purpose of models in economics is to make predictions .
Economics is based on the formulation of models .
A model is a theory .
It is composed of a number of assumptions from which conclusions -- or predictions -- are deduced .14
Mansfield then states the following three ' important points ' about models :
Two separate studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with a range of rheumatic diseases , with over half of all patients having below the ‘ normal ’ healthy levels of vitamin D ( 48 - 145 nmol / L ) in their bodies .
A further study assessing response to vitamin D supplementation found that taking the recommended daily dose did not normalise vitamin D levels in rheumatic disease patients .
The results of these three studies were presented at EULAR 2010 , the Annual Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome , Italy .
A UK study1 of 180 patients aimed to assess mean levels of vitamin D in patients with inflammatory joint diseases , osteoarthritis and myalgia ( muscle pain that , when experienced long term may be associated with nutritional deficiency ) .
Data on vitamin D levels were gathered and results showed that 58 % of individuals with a rheumatic condition had levels below that clinically considered to be ‘ sufficient ’ in healthy subjects ( 48 - 145 nmol / L ) .
An Italian study2 of 1,191 RA patients aimed to determine a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and several different clinical measures of disease activity .
Researchers found that , regardless of supplementation , levels of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , ( a standard clinical measure of vitamin D in the blood ) , were lower than healthy levels (
The UK study1 involved patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , osteoporosis , or unexplained muscle pain , ( total n=90 , 30 from each group ) .
These patients were matched with a control group of patients presenting with chronic back pain for a minimum of 6 months ( n=90 ) .
The RA patient group registered median levels of vitamin D of 36 nmol / L ( range 16- 85 nmol /L , p=0.045 ) and in osteoporosis patients , these levels were slightly lower with a median value of 31 nmol / L ( range 7- 82 nmol/ L , p=0.005 ) .
Patients with unexplained muscle pain had equally low median levels of vitamin D at 31 nmol/l ( range 11- 79 nmol / L , p= 0.008 ) .
In the first Italian study2 of 1,191 patients ( 85 % women ) from 22 rheumatology centres , researchers measured levels of 25 ( OH ) D , alongside paramaters of disease activity , calcium intake , sun exposure and bone mineral density .
The association found by researchers between disease activity scores and vitamin D levels remained statistically significant when adjusted for both sun exposure and body mass index ( BMI ) , both known risk factors for vitamin D deficiency .
Significantly lower 25 ( OH ) D levels were found in patients with active disease compared with those in disease remission ( mean level 21.8 nmol / L 25 ( OH ) D vs. 23.6 nmol / L respectively , p=0.057 ) , and in those who were not responding to treatment compared to patients with a good response to treatment ( 20.5 nmol / L vs. 23.4 nmol / L p=0.020 ) .
In the third Italian study3 , 100 patients ( 43 with IAD and 57 with NIAD ) received daily supplementation of 800 - 1000 IU of cholecalciferol ( a form of vitamin D often used to fortify foods ) over the course of six months .

Good price point
Includes a 250 GB hard drive .
It looks cool , and it is smaller than the original
It is much quieter and runs cooler

An odd way to remove the hard drive that could potentially cause problems

Introduction
It has been four and a half years since the original Xbox 360 was released on November 22 , 2005 .
New bundles have come out , hard drives for consoles have jumped in capacity exponentially , and there is even a black model of the 360 out there , but at its core the console has remained the same in terms of design .
When the Xbox 360 originally debuted against the Sony PlayStation 3 , it did so with somewhat similar hardware , but several less bells and whistles .
At the time , it seemed like a great move , as the PS3 ’s price put it out of reach of most gamers and where areas the additional add - ons for the Xbox 360 could be purchased anytime .
Price was definitely one of - if not THE - major factors in giving the 360 a commanding lead on the PS3 from the start .
But times change .
The more things are manufactured , the cheaper they become , and as the PS3 has dropped in price without sacrificing its features , its sales have quickly risen .
In answer , Microsoft has followed suit and released a new model , with new features that allow it to compete with the PS3 .
Many have been calling it the Xbox 360 Slim , but technically that is a misnomer , as it is a replacement for the 360 , not an alternative .
It is actually classified as the new Xbox 360 , so we will call it that .
Features and Design
The obvious change is in its look .
The matte colored exterior has been replaced with a glossy black casing , and a concave indention that comes to a point at the power button , which has also been redesigned .
Where the old model had a button that needed to physically be pressed , the new 360 buttons are touch sensitive and require no pressure .
There is even a sound to indicate that the command was accepted .
The same is true for the tray , as the button has been moved from the side , and placed above .
One minor drawback of the new casing is that the shine of the casing is also extremely prone to gathering fingerprints and smudges .
In terms of size , the new 360 is smaller than the original by roughly an inch and a half to two - inches .
It is not a huge difference , but it does feel more compact .
Part of that is due to the fact that the hard drive design has been totally remodeled .
Where on the previous version it was located on the side , the new version puts the hard drive inside the console .
It is still removable though , but that presents a problem in itself .
The hard drive is located behind a panel on the side , but to remove the drive itself , you pull on a fabric tab that in turn releases a button to unlatch the hard drive .
In theory this seems fine , but if you repeatedly pull out your hard drive and transport it between multiple Xboxes - which WILL eventually happen - then the cord will wear down .
If the cord rips , the hard drive is not going to come out easily .
This is a minor flaw , and Microsoft is likely banking on the fact that people will be using smaller hard drives to transfer the data via USBs rather than continually removing the internal hard drive , but it still seems like an unnecessarily risky design .
It is a minor gripe , but an obvious one .
The inclusion of a 250 GB hard drive standard is in itself nice , but the 250GB hard drive was standard on the last 360 bundle as well .
The change of hard drives does mean that the hard drives on older 360s are not physically compatible with the new models , but there is a cable you can buy that will allow you to transfer existing data from one drive to another with ease .
As for features , the new 360 finally catches up with the PS3 by including 802.11 b/g/n wifi connectivity .
This is probably the single biggest improvement over the former models , which required you to purchase an additional accessory that cost anywhere from $ 80 and up .
Even used WiFi adapters still run $ 50 and up on eBay .
The PS3 has had it since launch , and it is about time the 360 caught up .
The new 360 also features five USB ports ( two on the front and three on the back ) versus three in the old 360 , as well as an AUX port specifically for Microsoft ’s Kinect motion device .
On the back , the connections are the same ( HDMI , Ethernet out ) , with the exception of an upgraded digital audio port that accepts TOSLINK S / PIF optical input standard on all models .
Performance and Testing
Internally there is a new chip by Valhalla , a 45 - nanometer chip designed with integrated CPU and GPU .
The redesigned chip improves energy consumption by as much as half in some cases , makes it run quieter , and it decreases the size .
In terms of processing power , there is n’t much difference .
The chipset has been an issue with the 360 of course , but that was due to a specific chipset that has long since been replaced .
The red ring of death badly damaged the reputation of the 360 , but surprisingly it did not seem to drastically affect its sales .
Regardless , Microsoft has learned their lesson , and on top of the chipset , the console itself runs cooler than its predecessor .
Part of that is due to the new chip , but the double fans of the original model have been replaced by a single , more efficient unit .
With the chip putting off less heat , the single fan should be more than enough to keep the console cooler than the original .
You still need to maintain a healthy dose of common sense when running the device though ; in other words do not stick it in a closet under a bunch of towels and expect it to survive too long - but that is the same with any electronics .
Heat is bad , but the new 360 runs at lower temperatures than the original .
The new 360 is also much quieter .
When the 360 first came out , a game disk would spin so loudly that it sounded like the thing might fire out of the console .
The sound has become like a toothache that you have become so used to that you learn to ignore it .
It is only after a visit to the dentist that you realize that there was a better way to live .
It is the same with the new 360 .
You will immediately notice a difference , and wonder why you never noticed how loud your old system was .
The console will of course be backwards compatible with all existing Xbox 360 titles , but one thing missing is a slot for the memory cards that were specific to the original 360s .
However , recent software updates have allowed you to create a facsimile with any USB thumb drive .
One of the biggest selling features of the Xbox 360 has been the Xbox Live service that offers things like Netflix streaming , movies for rent , and now even ESPN content live and on - demand .
Since this is all software based , there did n’t seem to be any difference in terms of performance .
Accessories
The system ships with a black controller , a headset , the standard power cord , and a composite AV cable .
One gripe with the new 360 is that it does not ship with an HDMI or any form of HD cable .
With all gaming heading towards HD , you ’d think this would be a given .
They also ship the new 360 without an Ethernet cable .
Conclusion
The new design looks great .
The 360 was due for an overhaul , and the designers did a great job on it .
As with anything , some will love the design , some will hate it , but most should find it a pleasing change .
But looks alone are n’t likely to sell any consoles .
If there is one single feature worth touting , it is the inclusion of WiFi , which really does make a big difference .
The quieter sound is a nice touch , and the 250GB hard drive is a great selling point .
While this new unit is unlikely to make anyone go out and buy one if they already own a relatively new 360 , it might convince older users ( that managed to win the proverbial lottery by avoiding the red ring of death ) to upgrade .
Perhaps the biggest negative that people will focus on is the comparison between this model and the PS3 , which is the same price but features a built - in Blu-ray player .
$ 300 is reasonable for the new 360 , but the Blu-ray might be enough to sway new gamers that are still deciding between the systems towards the PS3 .
That is more of a “ pro ” for the PS3 than a “ con ” for the 360 though .
If you are looking for a new console and Blu-ray is n’t your thing , then you wo n’t be disappointed with the redesigned Xbox 360 .

Editors ' Recommendations
She went on : “ As a result of these threats , we 're going to pull Rachel Corrie into a port , add more high - profile people on board , and insist that journalists from around the world also come with us .
We ’re not “ there ” yet , are we ?
National health care - wise , that is .
The Affordable Care Act – signed into law this year after such a massive battle – was an important first step , especially after more than 100 years of trying .
But despite bringing much - needed help to millions of Americans , the bill fell short of the progressive goal of universal coverage , uniform benefits and effective cost controls through non-profit financing , fundamentals of all national health care systems around the world .
Just as Social Security and Medicare evolved and were improved , so will our new health care system .
It ’s a first step , but a first step to where ?
And when we finally get “ there , ” what is “ there ” going to look like ?
The first thing to remember is that none of the national health care systems around the world look exactly alike .
In fact , Canada does n’t even look like it ’s supposed to and they ’ve been “ there ” since 1964 .
Over here , Canada ’s single - payer health care system is sometimes portrayed as perfect .
It covers everybody , includes all services , does n’t cost Canadians a single penny in co-pays or deductibles , and there are no mean , nasty private insurance companies mucking things up .
A closer look , though , reveals that , technically speaking , Canada is not single - payer at all .
With 13 Canadian provinces and territories operating their own health authorities and sharing costs and rules - setting with the federal government , Canada is a 13 - payer system .
That ’s why some provinces require co-pays and others do n’t .
Some of them also do n’t cover certain prescriptions , dental and vision services , ambulance travel or private hospital rooms .
That ’s why there are still private insurance companies around selling supplemental coverage to two - thirds of all Canadians .
While Medicare is Canada ’s most popular social program and a source of national pride , Canadians freely admit that “ timely access to services , ” or wait times , is a problem .
Not what most of us imagined a single - payer system would look like , eh ?
All this is not intended to disparage a health care system that provides excellent care to all its citizens – and outsiders – for $ 3,000 per person less than the U.S. and is overwhelmingly supported by citizens regardless of political party .
It is intended , however , to warn against any and all forms of idealistic or dogmatic thinking within our own health care movement .
So let ’s agree .
Not every health care system looks exactly alike .
No national health care system is perfect .
And ours wo n’t be , either .
American journalist T.R. Reid , author of “ The Art of Healing , ” explains that national health care looks different around the world because each country has its own unique political , economic , social and cultural traditions .
Thus , the health care system is decentralized in Canada because it has a history of decentralized government .
The lesson for American activists is for us to really get to know our nation ’s own political , economic , social and cultural traditions so well that we can lead an evolution from the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) to a national health care system that Americans can identify with and proudly claim as their own .
We have much to learn from other countries and their health care systems , but we also have much to learn from American history and our own people .
We can begin that learning process by explaining what benefits ACA has to offer .
First , it gets us out there talking to people and engaging them in greater numbers than we did during the struggle leading up to passage of the ACA .
We also have to undo some of the damage Tea Partiers have done to any kind of health care reform .
Second , this “ implement and improve ” process can help us find out what Americans are thinking : what they like about reform , what they do n’t like about it and what they would like to see changed .
And we wo n’t learn anything from people if all we do is lecture at them .
The third thing we need to do in the process of getting “ there ” is to frame the health care issue in a way that was n’t done very well or consistently during the campaign : health care as a moral issue .
Reid writes ,
“ The design of any nation ’s health care system involves political , economic and medical decisions .
But the primary issue for any health care system is a moral one .
If we want to fix American health care , we first have to ask a basic question : Should we guarantee medical treatment to everyone who needs it ? ”
Or put more bluntly : “ Should a homeless person receive the same level of health care as a bank president ? ”
Once we , as a nation , can answer that question with a resounding “ yes , ” does it really matter whether our American health care system looks like Canada ’s , France ’s or something totally different ?
Whoa , wait a minute there .
What ’s France got to do with it ?
Ranked as having the number one health care system in the world by the World Health Organization , France is one of many nations that look like single - payer but , in fact , have multi- payer health care systems .
In France , Germany , Denmark , The Netherlands , Japan , Switzerland and Israel , private insurance companies collect premiums and pay all health care bills under strict government regulation for NO profit .
These health care systems come out of their nations ’ traditions , with sickness funds and employer - based private insurance having preceded the transition to national health care .
So how do we finally get “ there ? ”
To speculate , we might evolve toward a multi- payer system because we have a tradition of employer - based health care .
Many of the structures for that kind of national health care system have already been put in place by the ACA .
We could possibly evolve toward a single - payer system since we also have a single - payer tradition with our Medicare program .
We could build on state experiments with single - payer like Vermont ’s , or we could lower of the age for eligibility for Medicare to 55 , as was proposed in congressional debate this year .
We could also open up Medicare to all Americans by allowing them to buy into it at any age , as the conservative editor of a conservative local newspaper recently suggested .
And when we get “ there , ” we might turn out to be a 50 - payer system with each state operating its own health care authority .
Who knows ?
There are lots of good ways of getting “ there , ” so let ’s keep open all possibilities .
And , above all , let ’s listen to the directions Americans are giving us .
Our grandchildren wo n't believe our stories about the 1990s .
Yes , there really was a time before the World Wide Web and ubiquitous portable communication devices in sub-Saharan Africa .
Yes , you really could travel to some foreign countries without a passport , without a return ticket , without a credit card , and without entering multiple government databases .
Yes , the Pittsburgh Pirates really did once play winning baseball .
But as the Bush - Obama era of bailout economics and Keynesian rehabilitation settles into something like cruising speed , perhaps the most fantastic fact to swallow will be that once upon a time the United States had a president who restrained government spending , balanced the budget , argued forcefully for the benefits of free trade , and declared that " the era of big government is over . "
And he was a Democrat .
I come here not to mourn Bill Clinton , nor to give him sole credit for accomplishments that would not have happened without a hostile Republican Congress , but rather to lament the mostly unremarked passing of the political movement that made his economic successes possible .
Its disappearance has meant the biggest expansion of the federal government since World War II .
Starting with the Reagan landslide in 1984 and ending with John Kerry 's flaccid resistance to George W. Bush 's re-election in 2004 , liberals and Democrats went through a two - decade cycle of re-examining their previous philosophical and technocratic assumptions , embracing ( or at least grudgingly accepting ) some key elements of market economics and competition , then backtracking at least partway toward hoary old labor politics .
The party 's fortunes in capturing the White House ebbed at the beginning of the economic rethink , flowed at its height , then ebbed again during its final days .
This 20 - year process encompassed many different strains and went by several names — neoliberalism , the Third Way , the New Democrats — but underscoring most of it was a sound judgment that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher effectively destroyed traditional labor politics , a slow - building acknowledgment of the benefits of global trade and industrial privatization , and a nagging suspicion that lefties in the West too often looked like unmanly , unelectable sourpusses .
Better to cheerfully embrace the 21st century , á la Clinton and the early Tony Blair , than grumble in your cups about industrial malaise , declining union ranks , and unequal economic outcomes .
The seeds of the New Democrats ' demise were already flowering by Clinton 's second term , when an increasingly hostile progressive - left flank reacted with fury to gung - ho globalization , elective wars in Yugoslavia , and welfare reform ( see our Q&A with longtime neoliberal and welfare reform advocate Mickey Kaus ) .
Only the Republican - led persecution of Clinton 's sex-related crimes rallied progressives back to his side , and that support did not carry over to Vice President Al Gore , despite his last - minute lunge toward " I 'll fight for you ! " populism .
Ralph Nader 's 2.9 million votes in 2000 were both the deciding factor in the electoral contest and a stinging rebuke of Clintonomics .
This restive sentiment on the left was enough to push the stentorian bore John Kerry into concocting outrage at " Benedict Arnold CEOs " in 2004 , but the pose was undermined both by Kerry 's surface insincerity and the fact that his top economic advisers were rushing around reassuring business journalists that all free trade agreements were safe .
No Democrat outside of Kerry 's immediate family voted for the candidate with enthusiasm , and after his routing by a proven incompetent it was time to throw the old playbook out once and for all .
Neither Kerry nor the more solidly neoliberal New Democrats were only or even primarily differentiated by their economic philosophies , and therein lies a key reason for their demise .
The movement , like so many major - party fads , was primarily motivated not by ideas but by the desire to regain and retain power .
And a fundamental element of that mission was to identify and noisily reject past party tendencies that were seen to be unpopular among centrist voters .
So these New Democrats did n't merely refuse to be soft on crime like the touchy - feely ninnies in Dirty Harry movies ; they were tougher on crime than the most hardened Republican .
Clinton famously demonstrated his conviction that Democrats " should no longer feel guilty about protecting the innocent " by flying back to Arkansas in mid-1992 to oversee the execution of the brain - crippled cop killer Rickey Ray Rector , and once - rising New Democrat star Gray Davis was notorious as California governor for extolling the criminal justice policies of Singapore and rejecting his own parole board 's very rare recommendations of leniency .
New Democrats were some of the worst politicians in America when it came to expanding the War on Drugs , dreaming up new categories of people to execute , and degrading civil liberties for crass political gain .
Lacking Clinton 's serpentine political abilities , those who aped his base - repudiating stunts often ended up looking ridiculous .
John Kerry 's iconic moment at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 came not in any speech about economic policy but when the Vietnam vet strode out on stage , gave a theatrically grave military salute , and announced that he was " reporting for duty . "
No draft - dodging peacenik , he !
The gesture was received with the eye rolling it deserved .
Defining yourself by what you reject may yield short - term political gain and allow you to stumble into some good public policies now and then , but it 's no long - term substitute for articulating and defending concrete principles .
This is as true for citizens as it is for politicians .
That 's something to keep in mind as you read our cover forum , " Where Do Libertarians Belong ? "
In the Democrats ' case , the constant triangulation against the party 's true believers eroded enthusiasm at the core and produced a Republican - dominated Washington .
When voters belatedly soured on that bit of disastrously unified government in 2006 , it was an entirely different Democratic Party that rode the pendulum back to power .
The two - faced , unconfident approach of Kerry and Gore was out ; the full - throated combativeness of 2004 presidential contender turned party chair Howard Dean was in .
New members of the revitalized Democratic majority included many who were more conservative socially , but the party 's trade - bashing economic message bore little resemblance to the arguments Al Gore used to rout Ross Perot in their 1993 debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement .
By the time Barack Obama was ready for his coronation at the Democratic National Convention in 2008 , the party was unified in opposition to Bill Clinton 's trade and deregulatory policies , even while taking credit for his successful results .
But there 's a larger disconnect here .
Twenty years is a long time for ideas to percolate .
Younger voters and pundits supported Obama without understanding why Democrats were saddled with the " big government " label in the first place .
The only Democratic president in their memory was also the only one who did n't seriously goose the size of government .
And the Democrat who won in 2008 was a serious - sounding fellow from the University of Chicago who repeatedly promised " pay as you go " budgeting , no tax increase for 95 percent of Americans , and a " net spending cut . "
Did these liberals — some of whom frequently flashed their free trade credentials during the Bush administration — just forget what they used to believe ?
Or are they suppressing their principles until Obama announces that the economic crisis has finally been solved and we can resume regularly scheduled fiscal sobriety ?
Either way , their ongoing silence has to count as one of the great underreported political stories of the Obama presidency .
The New Democrats may be gone , but many of their worst policies — on criminal justice and foreign policy especially — are still locked into place .
We replaced politically insincere , base - distancing market enthusiasts with deadly serious , interest - group - embracing Keynesians .
Come back , 1990s .
All is forgiven .

Last week police in Belgium broke up a meeting of the country 's Catholic bishops - who were discussing how to deal with the pedophile priest crisis - to investigate claims of child abuse by Belgian clergy .
The raid provoked , predictably , the anger of the Vatican .
There also were death threats against witnesses and magistrates .
This morning ( July 6th , 2010 ) former head of the Belgian church , cardinal Godfried Danneels is interrogated by the police .
He will be asked to explain why hundreds of documents , relating to the murder of two young girls by Marc Dutroux , and pictures of their death bodies and of the autopsy were found at the episcopal palace .
Those documents belonged to the confidential files of the police .
He will also be asked to explain some letters found during the investigation which mentioned testimonials of victims of abuse by clericals that had been burned and in which the question was asked what to do about those still in existence that had n't as yet been transmitted to its own abuse panel .
Police spokespersons said it would be a long interrogation .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Authorities came upon a startling and mysterious scene when they showed up at a luxury apartment in Los Angeles in April while investigating a call about a gas odor .
The door was barricaded .
A cache of loaded weapons , including an AK - 47 , sat next to a mosaic depicting the CIA seal .
They found equipment for counterfeiting money .
High - powered binoculars were trained on the U.S. Federal Reserve building next door .
What followed was a six - week hunt for a suspect who had slipped out of the fire escape moments earlier and whose evasiveness drew comparisons to fictional agent Jason Bourne .
Police would eventually find their man , Brian Alexik , hiding out in his girlfriend 's apartment less than a mile from where he fled .
But three weeks on , detectives are still trying to figure out just who he is , what plot they may have thwarted and whether he was a lone wolf or part of a larger group .
Alexik clammed up soon after he was arrested and his trail has been harder to follow because he used at least two fake names .
The 34 - year - old is originally from Edison , N.J. , detectives said .
In 1996 , he was convicted in Middlesex County on a drug - dealing charge .
Five years later , he pleaded guilty to theft by deception and was sentenced to 180 days in jail , five years probation and had to pay $ 1,000 in restitution to a business .
Investigators are scouring his computer hard drives and studying the alarming contents of his penthouse as they attempt to unravel the mystery .
One bedroom had been converted into a makeshift machine shop , with tools scattered around .
It appeared Alexik had been manufacturing the parts of assault rifles that ammunition magazines are slotted into , said Detective Mark Severino from the Los Angeles Police Department 's major crimes unit .
Detectives found a loaded sawed - off shotgun and handgun , an AK - 47 , ammunition and other weapons parts including a gun barrel .
Ballistics tests are currently underway .
The CIA mosaic , depicting the white , starred shield with an eagle 's head on a blue background , measured about 5 feet across and investigators were impressed with the quality of the tile work .
They initially thought Alexik was obsessed with the spy agency .
" But there was no other evidence in there linking the CIA or his infatuation with the CIA , " Severino said .
" I do n't know why he would do that . "
A pair of binoculars was found by a tripod at the back window overlooking the Federal Reserve , but police do n't know what Alexik had been watching .
Answers might lie within the hard drives of four computers seized from the apartment and being analyzed by the Secret Service .
Police said Alexik appeared to move comfortably in social circles and most of his friends were in the cosmetics and clothing industries .
Investigators found designer clothes and European shoes in his apartment , along with a photo of Alexik mugging next to U2 frontman Bono .
" He could easily fool a lot of people , he could be very charming and carries himself very well , " Severino said .
" There was something about him that attracted these people to him . "
Alexik has pleaded not guilty to 10 felonies including weapons charges , narcotics offenses and forgery .
Federal weapons charges are also expected .
At a recent court hearing he appeared in a blue jail jumpsuit , his brown hair dyed to a coppery orange color and swept back across his head .
His public defender did not respond to requests for comment or for an interview in the jail .
If convicted of all counts he could face up to 15 years in prison .
Police believe Alexik was manufacturing fake IDs and passports , as well as counterfeiting thousands of dollars in cash .
A stash of what was believed to be illegal pills and methamphetamine was also in the home .
He allegedly had been bleaching low - denomination bills then using a printer to change the value to $ 100 or $ 50 .
In all , police recovered about $ 15,000 in bogus bills .
After Alexik slipped out the back window of his apartment on April 19 , detectives interviewed tenants at the downtown lofts .
Alexik had been paying about $ 4,000 cash for his rent but had recently stopped paying and was on the verge of getting evicted , Severino said .
He also seemed to have stopped paying his electric bill — Severino noticed coils of cables running from the hallway power outlets into the apartment .
The noxious odor that initially drew police reportedly came from a generator .
As investigators closed in , they arrested a friend , Gregory Koller , who was found with assault - style weapons magazines .
Police are looking into whether those may have been in the duffel bags Alexik was seen lugging as he fled down the fire escape .
" It is still unclear what his ultimate plan was going to be , however , what is clear is that his detection , capture , and arrest disrupted any future plans or growing capability to be even more dangerous to our community , " said Michael P. Downing , deputy chief commanding officer of the LAPD 's counterterrorism and criminal intelligence bureau .
Detectives scored a break June 3 when they went to talk to a woman believed to be his girlfriend .
She refused to open the door and it became apparent Alexik was hiding out there .
After a brief standoff with SWAT officers , Alexik surrendered .
Some investigators believe comparisons to Jason Bourne are unfair on the fictional spy .
" He got caught , " Detective Dan Logan said .
" When I interviewed him , he did n't knock me out , take my gun and take my recorder like in the movies .
He 's not as smart or resourceful as the Jason Bourne character . "

It was a late night in court for the Mail & Guardian as the Council of Muslim Theologians on Thursday evening tried to stop the newspaper from publishing a Zapiro cartoon featuring the Prophet Muhammad .
An interdict was not granted , but on Friday morning M&G editor - in - chief Nic Dawes and other staff were fielding a flood of angry callers , and even death threats hit the newspaper ’s office .
“ You ’ve got to watch your back ” and “ This will cost him his life ” were some of the remarks made .
The cartoon followed the furore surrounding the Facebook page , “ Everybody Draw Muhammad Day ” , which was sparked by threats by a radical Muslim group against the creators of US TV series South Park for depicting the prophet in a bear suit .
Zapiro ’s cartoon , published in Friday ’s M&G , depicted the prophet reclining on a psychiatrist ’s couch and bemoaning his followers ’ lack of humour .
When Dawes first saw the cartoon he said he thought it “ a gentle and irreverent poke ” at the hysteria that had greeted the Facebook page .
This week Pakistan ordered all internet service providers to block Facebook , as well as YouTube for carrying “ un-Islamic content ” .
Dawes recounted how he received a call from an attorney from the council at about 8.30 pm on Thursday night — after the distribution process of the Friday paper had begun .
“ He asked for an undertaking that we would stop distribution of the paper and remove the cartoon . ”
Dawes pointed out that this was impossible , and that in any event the M&G would not do so .
By 11.30 pm the newspaper ’s advocate had been pulled out of a dinner party and Dawes , along with the paper ’s investigation unit , found himself in the South Gauteng High Court ready to defend the M&G ‘s right to freedom of speech .
However , the council , or Jamiatul Ulama as it is also known , failed to provide the necessary papers for the M&G to answer .
It presented verbal evidence , but the judge ruled the interdict failed in terms of urgency , as the newspaper was already available in some outlets and the cartoon had already been published on the M&G Online .
It was a case of trying to close the stable doors long after the horse had bolted , the newspaper ’s counsel pointed out .
Furthermore , the judge found that the newspaper ’s rights had been compromised by not being provided with founding papers advising what the case against it was .
While the council pleaded with the judge not to throw the case out on technical grounds , she answered that “ as a judge and as a Muslim I am bound by our Constitution and the rules of our courts ” .
Earlier , the judge made a decision to not recuse herself , saying her own religious background would n’t influence her .
Violent backlash
The Council of Muslim Theologians is the same organisation that succeeded in preventing the Sunday Times in 2006 from republishing the controversial Danish cartoons of the prophet .
During Thursday ’s application the council repeatedly raised the spectre of a violent backlash , saying that the timing of the cartoon was bad because of a possible threat to the Soccer World Cup .
It added that while it would n’t advocate violence , it could n’t necessarily guarantee that there would n’t be any .
“ We very much saw that as a threat , and our counsel vigorously objected , ” said Dawes .
The judge upheld the objection .
While the council was unhappy with the court ’s decision , it agreed to meet Dawes to take the discussion forward .
“ The M&G is a platform for debate , ” Dawes emphasised , adding that everyone was welcome to engage in debate and discussion with the paper .
“ My view is no cartoon is as insulting to Islam as the assumption Muslims will react with violence . ”
However , he also noted that had the cartoon been in any way Islamophobic , or crossed the line in terms of hate speech and racism , he would not have published it .
But Zapiro ’s cartoons , he said , offend many people .
Many noted that the award - winning South African political cartoonist , whose pen has repeatedly and poignantly exposed corrupt politicians and various hypocrisies in the public sphere , could have been far harsher if he wished .
As Dawes said : “ If we had to pull every Zapiro cartoon that offended someone we would n’t have any Zapiro cartoons in the newspaper . ”
Pandigital , best known for making digital photo frames , announced today an Android - powered e-book reader called Novel , a slick device with a 7 - inch touchscreen LCD ( sorry , no multitouch ) .
Let 's first check out the specs : the Novel has a 7 - inch color 800 - by - 600 LCD .
It lacks 3G and a camera , but the Novel has an ARM 11 processor , Wi-Fi , and 1GB of internal memory ( a 2GB model will be available in June ) as well as slot for SD / MMC cards .
The battery life is purportedly good for around six hours , or about one flight across the US .
On top of an Android operating system ( this means lots of apps ! ) , you 'll be able to download over a million e-books from Barnes and Noble 's eBookstore , as well as watch video and show off photos .
Novel supports PDF , ePUB , as well as HTML .
Let 's talk about price : the Novel will set you back $ 199 , while Amazon 's Kindle costs $ 259 and Apple 's iPad starts at $ 499 .
Pandigital already has a huge network of retailers , so you 'll be able to pick one up at stores like Kohl's , Macy's , Costco or even Bed , Bath & Beyond .
What 's next for the Novel ?
Pandigital reports that a Novel with access to AT&T's Edge network will be available later this year .
Why AT&T Edge ?
That network " reaches 97 % of the geography in the US , " according to Kelly Odle at Pandigital , and their Photo Mail Digital Photo Frame already uses AT&T Edge to receive photos via email .
A 6 - inch e-ink Novel is also purportedly in the works .
With features that 'll appeal to a wide range of customers ( including a low price ) , perhaps the Novel will provide some competition for the " magical " iPad .

NEW YORK , June 22 ( UPI ) --
Four young men arrested during a New York water balloon fight are suing the city for $ 1 million each on claims of unlawful arrest .
Maurice Manners , 21 , Erick Martinez , 16 , Ryan Ginyard , 18 , and Jayvon McKinney , 12 , said they were part of the group of about 25 people having a water balloon fight on Walton Ave. in the Bronx during 90 degree weather May 26 when the police showed up , the New York Daily News reported Tuesday .

The four were arrested along with seven others not involved in the lawsuit .
Neil Wollerstein , a lawyer for the families , said disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly charges were dropped against the three older boys the day after their arrested and the 12 - year - old has a date in family court next week .
" It was a really hot day and everyone had clothes on like basketball shorts to get wet in , " Martinez said .
" Nobody went out to get arrested . "
Police stood by the arrests , saying the boys were throwing water balloons at passing cars .
WASHINGTON — The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration greatly expanded the fishing ban in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday in response to spreading oil from the BP well blowout .
The prohibited area now covers 19 percent of the gulf , nearly double what it was , according to the agency .
Officials are already seeing some impact on fish and wildlife in the region .
Rowan W. Gould , the acting director of the Fish and Wildlife Service , said 156 sea turtle fatalities had been recorded in the gulf since April 30 , about 100 more than usual at this time of year .
Mr. Gould also said that a small number of oily birds , 35 , had been recovered , including 23 dead birds directly linked to the spill .
“ It ’s important to note that the visibly oiled birds are a small part ” of the effects of the oil spill , Dr. Gould said in a teleconference on Tuesday .

May 31 : India 's economy grows 8.6 %
The Indian economy grew by 8.6 per cent in the quarter ending March this year compared with the same period last year , returning one of the world ’s fastest growing emerging markets close to where it was before the global financial crisis struck two years ago .
Ben McLannahan , the FT's Asia Lex columnist , reports .
The All Whites wanted a low - profile hitout in some African backwater against Chile , but instead ended up in a crazy carnival that was broadcast to 80 million South Americans .
Coach Ricki Herbert was fuming when he arrived at the Kanyamazane Stadium , finding a dozen Chilean cameras , thousands of fans and the team food on the floor , but left happy despite a 0 - 2 loss .
" We got pretty much what we wanted , '' said Herbert after all players came through the game unscathed , " and we 've got ( Tim ) Brownie on his way ' ' .
" We are in a stronger position than we 've ever been , '' said the coach , six days out from the World Cup opener against Slovakia .
The result was never a real issue in this game which featured three 30 - minute thirds , but the All Whites got an invaluable taste of playing football in Africa .
The town of Ka-Nayamazane had rolled out the welcome mat in style , with a group of Zulu dancers greeting visitors and the local schools closing for the students to fill the 15,000 - seater stadium to near capacity .
The chants of a few thousand Chilean fans melted in with the Zulu drums and thousands of the everpresent , deafening vuvuzela horns .
The cacophony of noise was only interrupted by the bizarre " Deutschland , Deutschland ' ' chants from a few dozen lost German exchange students at the local Mpumalanga University .
In this wall of sound and colour , one pale - faced lad in a beige brigade outfit too looked slightly lost .
Murray Tennent - Brown from Fielding was desperately searching for other Kiwis in the ground " but it seems I 'm the only one here ' ' .
Despite the home ground support for the Chileans and their superior ranking of 17 , the number 78 team in the world started the stronger of the two teams .
Ben Sigmund started on the right flank of the three - man defence , with Winston Reid in the centre , replacing Ryan Nelsen who did not travel because of an ear infection , and Tommy Smith again on the left .
Sigmund played the full 90 minutes and looked like a man possessed , fighting for his last chance to depose on of the two young defenders next to him and reclaim his place .
Herbert acknowledged that the fast , tricky South Americans were not Sigmund 's preferred opponents , but said his performance was good enough to remain in the equation for the starting 11 against Slovakia .
Ivan Vicelich , who has also found himself on the outer lately , teamed up in the centre of the midfield with Simon Elliott , while Jeremy Brockie started up front ahead of Shane Smeltz .
Brockie had two excellent chances to give New Zealand the lead in the first half an hour , but first headed a beautifully crossed ball from Leo Bertos over the goal and then only managed to hit the side - netting when the ball dropped invitingly after some aerial ping - pong in the box .
The winger played well but knows that a goal would not have hurt his selection chances .
" We had a few chance ourselves and I should have put one away .
Or at least got one on target . ''
Herbert said that he 10 of his starting team is just about confirmed , but hinted that he was not sure yet about the makeup of the front three .
" I want to see a bit more spark up front .
I think we 've created chances against arguably some of the best teams in the world .
We got three , four chances today and that could be your roll of the dice in the World Cup .
I want see things a bit sharper .
We 've got good personnel but we have to see how they are jelling . ''
Herbert made a few changes for the second third , bringing on Jeremy Christie , Shane Smeltz , Michael McGlinchey and Chris Wood , but Kiwis barely gave away any chances , nor did they create any .
The speedy , technical Chileans looked threatening on the break and at times exposed New Zealand 's lack of pace , but Mark Paston only had to make one save in the first hour .
The ball did find the net twice but both goals were disallowed for off - side and a handball respectively .
Goalkeeper James Bannatyne and David Mulligan came on for what is likely to be their only game time in the entire campaign , but the Chilean substitutes were the ones to make the impact in the final third .
Only minutes after Tony Lochhead had cleared a ball off the line , Gonzalo Fierro got in behind the left winger , and beat Bannatyne inside the near post ,
Four minutes later , the Chileans secured the win when Arturo Vidal 's cross from the left found Estaban Paredes who got in front Vicelich to score 2- 0 .
Shane Smeltz had a chance to put the All Whites on the scoreboard but his header was cleared off the line , before Smith smashed the inviting rebound across the goal .
Herbert said the Chile game had given them a taste of what is to come and completed a near perfect build - up , " so we 're ready .
I can't wait for the opening game . ''
Chile 2 ( Fierro 66 , Paredes 70 ) New Zealand 0 .

I was going to wait to write about this , but I 'm getting a lot of emails about it , so I 'll say something now , and followup when I get more information .
The story : BABloggee Alereon ( and many others ) sent me to an interesting site : Life After the Oil Crash Forum -- a forum that apparently has a lot of doomsday - type scuttlebutt posted to it .
An anonymous poster there says he has heard that the star Betelgeuse is about to go supernova , maybe as soon as a few weeks :
I was talking to my son last week ( he works on Mauna Kea ) , and he mentioned some new observations ( that will no doubt get published eventually ) of " Beetlejuice " ; it 's no longer round .
This is a huge star , and when it goes , it will be at least as bright as that 1054 supernova ... except that this one is 520 light years away , not 6,300 [...]
When it collapses , it will be at least as bright as the full moon , and maybe as bright as the sun .
For six weeks .
So the really lucky folks ( for whom Betelgeuse is only visible at night ) will get 24 hour days , everybody else will get at least some time with two suns in the sky .
The extra hour of light from daylight savings time wo n't burn the crops , but this might .
Probably , all we 'll get is visible light ( not gamma rays or X - rays ) , so it should n't be an ELE .
It 's sure gonna freak everyone out , though .....
Then it will form a black hole , but we 're too far away for that to matter .
The buzz is that this is weeks / months away , not the " any time in the next thousand years " that 's in all the books .
The basic takeaway : OK , folks , first : when news like this comes from an unnamed source on some random forum , and that source is not even a primary one , and that secondary source quoted is also unnamed , and that person heard it from a third party that is also unnamed ... well , oddly enough my skeptic alarm bell in my head rings loudly enough that my eardrums explode outward in every direction at the speed of light .
I hope I 'm being clear here .
The first important thing to note here is that if Betelgeuse explodes , we 're in no danger at all .
It 's too far away to hurt us .
Got that ?
It 's the most important thing to remember here , because I 'm quite sure this story will get wildly exaggerated as it gets repeated .
So , what 's the deal with Betelgeuse ?
What is it , will it explode , and if so , when ?
The details : Betelgeuse is one of the brightest stars in the sky .
That 's because it's an intrinsically luminous star , and one that 's relatively close by .
By luminous , I mean something like 100,000 times that of the Sun , and by close I mean roughly 600 light years away if not more .
That 's 6 quadrillion kilometers , or almost 4 quadrillion miles .
In other words , quite a hike .
Betelgeuse is a red supergiant .
It has a mass of something like 20 times the Sun's , and is near the end of its life .
When it dies , it will explode as a supernova , a titanic event that is among the most violent in the Universe .
For details on how this happens , read this essay I wrote about it .
It 's hard to know just when a star will explode when you 're on the outside .
Betelgeuse might go up tonight , or it might not be for 100,000 years .
We 're just not sure .
Betelgeuse is n't round , and it 's shrinking !
In the bulletin board post , he talks about the star not being round .
It 's unclear , but it sounds like he 's referring to observations which show that there is a big plume coming from the surface of Betelgeuse .
That was exciting news when it was released , but not hugely surprising ; stars are active , and massive stars even more so .
Also , note that those " new " observations are a year old !
That image above is from even earlier , and shows a Hubble observation of Betelgeuse taken in 2005 .
Note here that the star does n't look round , but that 's an illusion .
The image shows a hot spot in Betelgeuse 's swollen atmosphere , and that makes it look like a bump is hanging of the side .
In reality , that 's just because of the way the image is printed , and is n't an actual physical bump .
But the hot spot ( probably due to a big ol ' bubble of hot gas rising near the surface ) in itself shows that things on the star change all the time ; just recently two such spots were found .
The post also talks about Betelgeuse shrinking .
That claim is from observations made over the course of many years .
Those data indicate the star is shrinking , but it 's unclear what they mean .
While it may mean the star is in fact shrinking , starspots ( sunspots on another star ) may be fooling us , for example .
Also , red supergiants are n't like marbles , with a clean , sharp surface .
They are balls of gas , extended and bloated , so there is no real surface .
It 's therefore entirely possible the astronomers are n't even really measuring the surface of the star at all , and it's just the highly extended atmosphere that 's changing .
Surface tension , rotten to the core
The point I 'm making is that a lot of stuff can happen on the surface of the star that has nothing to do with the core .
Since it 's the core that generates the star 's energy and eventually causes it to explode , what 's happening on the surface is not an indication of any impending explosion .
Mind you , the surface and the core do " talk " to each other , though slowly .
As the core changes , that information does leak to the surface , but it takes centuries .
Until , that is , the core collapses .
When that happens , the shock wave takes hours or days to get to the surface , and the star explodes .
But that 's hardly a slow event taking decades !
So any changes we see happening now probably have little to do with what 's happening hundreds of millions of kilometers deep in the star .
Also , it 's been known for a long time that Betelgeuse is a variable star ; its light output changes .
This shrinking may just be a part of that natural cycle , and again no indication of an explosion .
Having said all that , I 'll note that someday , Betelgeuse will explode .
That 's for certain !
But it 's also way too far away to hurt us .
A supernova has to be no farther than about 25 light years away to be able to fry us with light or anything else , and Betelgeuse is 25 times that distance ( which means its power to hurt us is weakened by over 600x ) .
It 's the wrong kind of star to explode as a gamma-ray burst , so I 'm not worried about that either .
At that distance , it 'll get bright , about as bright as the full Moon .
That 's pretty bright !
It 'll hurt your eyes to look at it , but that 's about it .
The original post says it may get as bright as the Sun , but that 's totally wrong .
It wo n't even get 1/100,000th that bright .
Still bright , but it 's not going to cook us .
Even if it were going to explode soon .
Which it almost certainly is n't .
Conclusion :
So my personal opinion is that this is just another breathless rumor of astronomical doomsday that we get every couple of years .
Even if any of the science of it is right , it does n't mean Betelgeuse is about to explode any day now .
And since this is a rumor three times removed , I do n't put any stock in it .
I 'll wait until I hear from named scientists with published or publishable data before I start to wonder if the star is about to blow .
And if and when it does explode , it can't hurt us .
Someday it will -- maybe not for a hundred thousand years , but someday -- and every astronomer on the planet hopes it happens in their lifetime !
It will be a scientific bonanza unlike any ever seen .

Harry Potter is on a rampage and I 'm in control .
Armed with a wand , I dispatch a gathering of witches and wizards as I maneuver Potter deftly through an abandoned factory .
Swirling red lines spew from Potter 's wand as I watch over his shoulder , the dancing lights lance into an enemy wizard until he collapses in pain .

This may not be the Harry Potter you 're used to : A wide - eyed bespectacled youth of confused powers and wholesome values .
No , this Harry Potter uses spells to torture his enemies into unconsciousness , snipes witches with magic that turn them on allies and unleashes wall - crumbling blasts of magic from the safety of cover .

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is nothing like what you 'd expect from a video game based on a popular series of family - friendly books .
And that 's just what the developers hope .
Last month I had a chance to sit down with developers Bright Light Studios at EA 's LA offices and take the upcoming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 for a spin .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The game , built using a new graphics game engine , looks and plays a lot like a third - person shooter .
You control Potter from a perspective just behind and above the teen .
Potter is pretty fast on his feet and can even scramble into cover .
Most importantly , you use magic to dispatch enemies .

The Bright Lite folks likened each of the spells I used while testing the game to different sorts of weapons .
Confundus , which can be used to turn enemies upon each other from a distance , is like a sniper shot .
Stupefy , which knocks people and things over , is like a rocket launcher and Crucio , an unforgivable spell used to torture enemies in the universe of Harry Potter , is like a machine gun , the developers explained to me .
" This is a very , very different experience , " one of the developers say .
" There is no Hogwarts , no school rules , just life or death . "

And there also is n't much on the screen , besides the action .
There 's no life bar or targeting reticule .
No magic gauge or currently selected weapon icon .
Instead you pick up how you 're doing by what 's going on and how Potter is reacting to things .

The game played exactly how you would expect it to .
It was sort of like playing Medal of Honor with magic .
The cover system was snappy , controls tight and the battles surprisingly colorful .
Most importantly , the game did n't feel like a children 's title .
There was in the portrayal of the characters and the detail of the settings , a sense of gravity .
This was n't a bunch of cartoons shooting fireworks at one another , this was a life and death battle with magic that could torture a person to death .

My very short time spent with the game left me impressed with the title 's new direction and how aptly it handled as a shooter derivation .
What I could n't tell was whether the game would quickly get old , sending me from one magical firefight to the next until the game was over .
Hopefully in re-imagining the video game take on Harry Potter , due out this autumn for the DS , PC , PS3 , Wii and Xbox 360 , Bright Lite did n't forget to tap into the compelling fiction of the franchise .
Veteran circuit designer Hermann
Tilke will be responsible for the Austin F1 track , promoter Tavo Hellmund has confirmed to this writer .
Hellmund also says the project is also much further along than has been assumed , and the track has already been drawn .
“ This has been long in the works , ” he told this blog .
“ Everything is in place . ”
Although the former racer told local media yesterday that three possible venues were still under consideration , that suggestion was apparently a smokescreen .
While several alternatives were under consideration , one site was settled on some time ago , and the land – over 800 acres – has already been purchased .
Not only that but initial permissions for amenities such as water and waste , which are usually time consuming affairs , have already been granted .
Although Hellmund has yet to divulge details of what he calls a “ killer location ” , he confirmed that the site is to the east of the city , a few miles from the airport .
It is said to be in hilly countryside that has provided Tilke with a good starting point for a design .
The German has been asked to create a fast circuit with challenging corners that resemble those of classic established circuits such as Silverstone , Hockenheim and Spa .
It will be over 3 - miles in length .
Tilke first sent a representative of his company to Austin around two years ago , and has made personal many visits since .
He is currently looking for office space in the city in which to base the project .
Hellmund is adamant that Austin is an ideal location : “ Other than New York or LA , which already have 10 m people , where are you going to find a place that within 150 - mile radius you have three of the top 10 largest markets in the United States ?
That is the wonderful thing .
Our position between Canada and the United States , North , South and Central America , is unbelievable .
“ You take that into account , you take into account the draw that Austin is , it ’s the state capital , it ’s in the hill country , it ’s got a huge , huge vibe and tag of being the coolest place . ”
As reported previously , the race is set to benefit from the ‘ Texas Major Events Trust Fund , ’ which is intended to reimburse cities for costs they face when hosting big sporting events .
However , that relates only to specific events and does not have an impact on the cost of building the facility , which is apparently budgeted at $ 200 m .
The track build is being financed by private investors , and when completed the venue is likely to be named after either Texas or Austin .
One of the key elements that has helped to generate funding is that aside from F1 , the circuit will be used to help develop alternative fuels .
Tavo has known Bernie Ecclestone since he was a teenager .
His father was involved in promoting Indycar and TransAm races in Mexico City , and also helped to bring F1 back to the country in 1988 .
Hellmund Sr was also involved in the 1986 soccer World Cup and in organising music events .
While the Austin project was greeted with some scepticism , Hellmund ’s enthusiasm for it is infectious and he certainly makes a credible case for it .
It will be fascinating to see what happens next .
Earlier we noted that the Austrian mint was on its way to depleting its gold reserves following " panicked buying " from Europeans , who now openly fear the demise of their currency .
Now , courtesy of Slim Beleggen , we understand that the situation in the silver market is just as bad and has also spilled over to Germany : the contagion is no longer one of sovereign debt , but of precious metal physical inventory .
The primarily silver focused ( but holding gold as well ) Kronwitter precious metal online retailer is not only not accepting any orders , but has entirely taken down its website .
The only message left for visitors is ( translated from German ) as follows :
Dear customers , due to the enormous number of orders we can take at the moment no new orders via the Internet , email or fax contrary .
All previously purchased and paid for coins are shipped .
In order not to delay the extradition unnecessary to ask is to refrain from requesting payment or tracking number .
When shipped our you will automatically receive a shipping confirmation .
We hope to do everything within two days and then re-open the shop to buy .
Thank you for your understanding .

Soon coming to an LBMA vault near you - a run on physical and a total collapse of the 100x diluted Precious Metal market .

“ Europe is in a tough bind , ” said Kenneth S. Rogoff , a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a Harvard professor .
“ If you want to escape default , the Irish path is the only way to go .
But the Ireland experience points to the profound challenges that the current strategy implies . ”
Politicians here have raised taxes and cut salaries for nurses , professors and other public workers by up to 20 percent .
About 30 billion euros ( $ 37 billion ) is being poured into zombie banks like Anglo Irish , which was nationalized after lavishing loans on developers .
The budget went from surpluses in 2006 and 2007 to a staggering deficit of 14.3 percent of gross domestic product last year  worse than Greece .
It continues to deteriorate .
Drained of cash after an American - style housing boom went bust , Ireland has had to borrow billions ; its once ultralow debt could rise to 77 percent of G.D.P. this year .
“ Everybody ’s feeling quite sick at what happened because things were going so well for Ireland , ” said Patrick Honohan , the Irish central bank governor .
“ But we do n’t have the flexibility to do a spending stimulus now .
There ’s no one who is even arguing for it . ”
Mr. Honohan predicts growth could revive to a rate of about 3 percent by 2012 .
But that may be optimistic : Ireland , as one of the 16 nations in Europe that has adopted the euro as its common currency , is trying to shrink the deficit to 3 percent of G.D.P. by 2014 , a commitment that could weaken its hopes for recovery .
These troubles sting many Irish , given the head start Ireland has on most members of the euro club .
Its labor market is one of Europe ’s most open and dynamic .
After its last major recession in the 1980s , it lured knowledge - based multinationals like Intel and Microsoft  and now Facebook and Linked - In  with a 12.5 percent tax rate , giving Ireland one of the most export - dependent economies in the world .
Daniel was 6 years old when his mother sneaked him and his two sisters into the United States from Mexico .
He later graduated from the Arizona public school system and earned two degrees from Arizona State University – one in political science , the other in literature .
But the harsh reality of his status as an illegal immigrant broadsided his dream of becoming a lawyer .
As an illegal immigrant , Daniel is barred from getting waivers , grants or any other financial assistance to finish law school , so he dropped out after the first year and is now working as an intern at a law office .
What frustrates Daniel is that nothing is being done to address the issue of students like him who were brought here at a very young age .
“ Imagine waking up one day and your parents telling you that , ‘ Hey , you ’re actually from Iran and you ’re not here documented , and you ’re about to face a really harsh reality ’ , ” said Daniel , whose last name was withheld by the Arizona Capitol Times .
But if Sen. Russell Pearce gets his way , people like Daniel would be derailed from the education system much earlier , and in a way that could have much more significant effects on individuals and society as a whole .
Pearce said he plans to draft legislation next year to require students who are here illegally to pay tuition or be removed from public schools .
“ They should n’t be a burden . ” Pearce said .
“ You do n’t have a right to be a non-resident of this state and take advantage of the taxpayers of this state . ”
There are no precise figures to calculate the number of undocumented students in Arizona ’s schools .
But according to the Pew Hispanic Center , at least 10 percent of students in Arizona ’s K - 12 system have parents who are illegal immigrants .
It costs $ 9,698 to educate each student for one year in the Arizona public school system , according to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee .
That figure , from January 2009 , represents local , state and federal funding .
Carmen Cornejo of CADENA , a group that advocates for the passage of the federal DREAM Act , called the idea ridiculous and contrary to human rights .
She said children have a right to a free public education , and the state should be trying to get more children into school rather than keep them out .
Cornejo said Arizona already has one of the lowest rates of high school completion in the nation and Pearce ’s proposal would exacerbate the problem .
John Wright , president of the Arizona Education Association , opposes the idea of requiring students who are illegally here to pay tuition because it would potentially put school workers , such as teachers , in the middle of the immigration crossfire and take them away from the mission of educating children .
“ It suddenly requires school personnel to play a role as an immigration official to check status and to require documentation , ” he said .
It would n’t be the first attempt to pass legislation requiring public school tuition for illegal immigrant students .
Sen .
John Huppenthal , a Republican from Chandler , offered an amendment this year that would have required school boards to charge tuition to undocumented students or remove them from class .
The amendment failed to pass .
“ The basic idea though is to try to get a little bit of control over the tide of illegal immigration that is just overwhelming us , ” Huppenthal said .
Indeed , the legislation was meant to test the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in a case out of Texas in the early 1980s .
In Plyler v. Doe , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states must offer free public education to all school - age children , whether they are here illegally or not .
The court ruled that while public education is not a right , it is also not just some governmental benefit .
Education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society , the court said .
“ By denying these children a basic education , we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions , and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our nation , ” the justices noted .
Not only that , but the court noted it would be fundamentally unfair to act against the children of illegal immigrants .
“ Even if the state found it expedient to control the conduct of adults by acting against their children , legislation directing the onus of a parent ’s misconduct against his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice . ”
The court noted , though , that there was no evidence suggesting illegal immigrants impose any significant burden on the state ’s economy , and the record did not support the claim that excluding undocumented children was likely to improve the overall quality of education .
Michael Hethmon , a lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute , said his group is recommending a two - phase approach to overturning ~ Plyler ~ .
The first is to gather information to show an adverse impact as a result of educating children who are here illegally , then revisit the case ’s constitutional merits .
Hethmon said the situation is different now , and it would be hard to argue that illegal immigrants have no significant impact on the educational opportunities of U.S. citizens or legal residents .
Arizona , which shares the border with Mexico , was estimated to have about 500,000 undocumented residents in 2008 , according to the Pew Hispanic Center .
Students fresh out of college , six - figures deep in debt , face decades of debt slavery .
Both parents and students are wondering what went wrong .
Please consider Placing the Blame as Students Are Buried in Debt .
Like many middle - class families , Cortney Munna and her mother began the college selection process with a grim determination .
They would do whatever they could to get Cortney into the best possible college , and they maintained a blind faith that the investment would be worth it .
Today , however , Ms. Munna , a 26 - year - old graduate of New York University , has nearly $ 100,000 in student loan debt from her four years in college , and affording the full monthly payments would be a struggle .
For much of the time since her 2005 graduation , she 's been enrolled in night school , which allows her to defer loan payments .
This is not a long - term solution , because the interest on the loans continues to pile up .
So in an eerie echo of the mortgage crisis , tens of thousands of people like Ms. Munna are facing a reckoning .
They and their families made borrowing decisions based more on emotion than reason , much as subprime borrowers assumed the value of their houses would always go up .
The Project on Student Debt , a research and advocacy organization in Oakland , Calif. , used federal data to estimate that 206,000 people graduated from college ( including many from for - profit universities ) with more than $ 40,000 in student loan debt in that same period .
That 's a ninefold increase over the number of people in 1996 , using 2008 dollars .
No one forces borrowers to take out these loans , and Ms. Munna and her mother , Cathryn , have spent the years since her graduation trying to understand where they went wrong .
She started college at age 17 and borrowed as much money as she could under the federal loan program .
To make up the difference between her grants and work study money and the total cost of attending , her mother co-signed two private loans with Sallie Mae totaling about $ 20,000 .
When they applied for a third loan , however , Sallie Mae rejected the application , citing Cathryn 's credit history .
She had returned to college herself to finish her bachelor 's degree and was also borrowing money .
N.Y.U. suggested a federal Plus loan for parents , but that would have required immediate payments , something the mother could n't afford .
So before Cortney 's junior year , N.Y.U. recommended that she apply for a private student loan on her own with Citibank .
Over the course of the next two years , starting when she was still a teenager , she borrowed about $ 40,000 from Citibank without thinking much about how she would pay it back .
How could her mother have let her run up that debt , and why did n't she try to make her daughter transfer to , say , the best school in the much cheaper state university system in New York ?
The balance on Cortney Munna 's loans is about $ 97,000 , including all of her federal loans and her private debt from Sallie Mae and Citibank .
What are her options for digging out ?
Her mother can't help without selling her bed and breakfast , and then she'd have no home .
She could take her daughter in , but there are n't good ways for her to earn a living in Alexandria Bay , in upstate New York .
Cortney could move someplace cheaper than her current home city of San Francisco , but she worries about her job prospects , even with her N.Y.U. diploma .
She recently received a raise and now makes $ 22 an hour working for a photographer .
It 's the highest salary she 's earned since graduating with an interdisciplinary degree in religious and women 's studies .
After taxes , she takes home about $ 2,300 a month .
Rent runs $ 750 , and the full monthly payments on her student loans would be about $ 700 if they were n't being deferred , which would not leave a lot left over .
" I do n't want to spend the rest of my life slaving away to pay for an education I got for four years and would happily give back , " she said .
" It feels wrong to me . "

As long as the government continues to flood the for - profit education industry with loan dollars , and the risk for these loans is borne SOLELY BY students and the government …
THEN the industry has every incentive to :
Grow at all costs
Compensate employees based on enrollment
Influence key regulatory bodies - Manipulate reported statistics and other regulatory measures
All to Maintain Access to Government Money .
“ It 's about the numbers .
It will always be about the numbers . ” - Bill Brebaugh , head of University of Phoenix Corporate Enrollment
Boiler room tactics :
Ashford University ( BPI ) former enrollment counselor - “ Every 6 months we get a review that looks at how many students we enrolled and what percentage of them finished their first class .
As long as they finish their first class we get full credit and after that they are not our problem … ”
“ We are under so much pressure we are forced to do anything necessary to get people to fill out an application … ”
It ’s a boiler room –selling education to people who do n’t really want it . ”
APOL former enrollment counselor - “ The EC [ enrollment counselor ] review matrix is all smoke and mirrors so we could fly under the radar of the DOE … ”
Accreditation … the inmates running the asylum
In many instances , for - profit institution ’s representatives sit on the boards of their own Accrediting body , inevitably influencing the approval process and oversight of their own institutions !
Department of Education Losses
DOE will face nearly $ 275B in defaults over the next 10 years on a half - a- trillion dollars of lending to the For - Profit Industry
Projected Cumulative Stafford Loans ( in $ Billions ) and Cumulative Defaulted Dollars for For-Profit Education Students , 2007 - 2020 $
Kill the Pell Grant Program
Rather than throwing hard earned taxpayer dollars at programs that invite fraud and make debt zombies out of students , it 's time to kill the program entirely .
Instead , Obama wants to expand the fraud , even indexing the fraud to inflation .
Forget the dodgy bankers .
The people who have consistently received the most generous handouts from the public purse over the last 30 years are the big landowners .
Teachers , the police and the others are preparing for savage job cuts , tax rises and an age of economic austerity , but a very few people who do nothing more than own land are being handsomely rewarded .
Last month , the watchdog group Farmsubsidy.org collated the EU figures which identify where the € 55bn common agricultural policy ( CAP ) subsidies went in 2009 .
No big surprises there , with five giant European sugar companies netting € 500 m between them , a few dairy companies making tens of millions each and the top 1,200 landowners and companies on the continent receiving more than €5bn between them .
Last year , the number of farmers and food companies who received individual payments of more than € 1 m increased by more than 20 % .
In Britain we had 32 organisations and individuals each getting more than € 1m .
Perhaps because one in five Tory MPs is believed to receive farm subsidies , the government refused to divulge the British figures in advance of the election , and we wo n't have the exact names of the UK 's biggest subsidy - reapers for a few weeks .
But we now have the spreadsheet of the 65,000 people who received the farm subsidies , and it's not that different from other years .
The biggest handout will probably not go to a full - blooded capitalist , but to the Co-op group , which manages 16 large farming estates and is now Britain 's largest farmer .
Up near the top of the list , though , are the Dukes of Westminster and Marlborough , the former Lord Vestey 's family , the Queen , and very many hereditary landowners .
The vast majority of farmers get under € 5,000 and bust a gut to survive , but in a time of recession and belt - tightening these subsidies to the richest look grotesque .
That € 55bn represents more than 40 % of European Union 's entire annual budget , yet the top 10 % of big landowners are the people in least need .
We are each paying around € 100 a year for them to do little more than own land .
What 's more , the level of payments is cast in stone and cannot be revised for at least three more years , thanks to an agreement between France and Germany , who have more subsidy billionaires than any other country .
Even if Britain goes belly - up , their cash is safe .
And because British farmers are paid in euros , rather than pounds , they have all enjoyed windfall profits in the last four years as the pound has tumbled in value .
Few people on either side of the political spectrum have anything good to say about the CAP .
Critics point out that it was set up 50 years ago when food supplies were uncertain and nearly 20 % of the population worked on the land .
Today , just 5.4 % of EU 's population works on farms , and the sector is responsible for just 1.6 % of the economy .
Moreover , the subsidy system distorts markets , encourages farms to get bigger , does little for the environment and forces small farmers off the land .
The result is that the subsidies are grabbed by fewer and fewer richer and richer people .
Aid agencies say these subsidies make it impossible for poorer countries to compete , and health groups argue that they make industrial fats and sugars artificially cheap for junk food production .
Britain has long called for a cut in EU farm spending to free up funds for other areas such as efforts to boost economic competitiveness .
But however dire the economic times , there no chance of a radical overhaul before 2013 , when France and Germany are expected to veto change again .
It looks like we are stuck with a rotten system that we can do nothing about .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korean leader Kim Jong - il ’s son and handpicked heir has been elected to parliament but he will at best become a figurehead under a military - led collective leadership , news reports said on Tuesday quoting a source .
Anti-North Korea protesters hold placards with portraits of the North 's founder Kim Il - sung ( top ) , his son and current leader Kim Jong - il ( R ) and what they say is Kim Jong - il 's son Kim Jong - un at a protest in front of the Defence Ministry building in Seoul May 20 , 2010 .
North Korea said on Thursday it would take strong measures , including war , if the South imposes sanctions after blaming it for sinking a navy ship .
The South 's findings were a fabrication " orchestrated by the group of traitors in a deliberate and brigandish manner to achieve certain political and military aims , " the National Defence Commission said in a rare statement carried by the official KCNA news agency .
REUTERS / Truth Leem
Kim Jong-un was elected to the Supreme People ’s Assembly at the elections in March last year from district 216 , South Korean media quoted a Western source familiar with the North as saying .
The election may have been kept under wraps because the North has been wary of inciting discontent by publicly promoting Kim Jong - il ’s son as heir during economic difficulties , analysts said .
“ I have been able to confirm directly from a North Korean official that Kim Jong - un has been elected from the 216 electoral district , ” the unnamed Western source was quoted by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper as telling reporters .
The number 216 signifies the birthday of the current leader and is reserved for persons of special entitlement , making it likely “ Kim Jong ” who appears on the list of elected delegates is in fact the youngest son of Kim Jong - il , the source said .
The Supreme People ’s Assembly is the country ’s rubberstamp body that formally approves decisions by the leadership but key officials of the military and the ruling party are typically its elected members .
Kim Jong - il appears to have struck a deal with the military after he suffered a stroke in 2008 to get his son accepted as the next leader in return for agreeing to take a hardline policy externally as demanded by the army , the source was quoted as saying .
“ The military will probably come to the front after Kim Jong - il ’s death as a collective leadership with Kim Jong - un as figurehead , ” the source was quoted as saying .
There are indications that a new campaign to build a cult of personality for the junior Kim has begun , including the teaching of songs that try to give legitimacy to his place to succeed his ailing father , the source said .
The ruling communist party has called a rare meeting in September to elect a new leadership , a move analysts said could formally set in motion succession plans for Kim Jong - un to take over .
Points On A Package
You keep a low profile when you 're in oxygen debt .
Too much walking about just exacerbates the situation anyway .
So I was nervous when a stationeer appeared at my cubby and knocked on the door .
I slid out and stood in front of the polished , skeletal robot .
" Alex Mosette ? " it asked .
There was no sense in lying .
The stationeer had already scanned my face .
It was just looking for voice print verification .
" Yes , I 'm Alex , " I said .
" The harbormaster wants to see you . "
I swallowed .
" He could have sent me a message . "
" I am here to escort you . "
The robot held out a tinker - toy arm , digits pointed along the hallway .
Space in orbit came at a premium .
Bottom - rung types like me slept in cubbies stacked ten high along the hallway .
On my back in the cubby , watching entertainment shuffled in from the planets , they made living on a space station sound exotic and exciting .
It was if you were further up the rung .
I 'd been in those rooms : places with wasted space .
Furniture .
Room to stroll around in .
That was exotic .
Getting space in outer space was far down my list of needs .
First was air .
Then food .
Anything else was pure luxury .
The harbormaster stared out into space , and I silently waited at the door to Operations , hoping that if I remained quiet he would n't notice .
Ops hung from near the center of the megastructure of the station .
A blister stuck on the end of a long tunnel .
You could see the station behind us : the miles - long wheel of exotic metals rotating slowly .
No gravity in Ops , or anywhere in the center .
Spokes ran down from the wheel to the center , and the center was where ships docked and were serviced and so on .
So I hung silently in the air , long after the stationeer flitted off to do the harbormaster 's bidding , wondering what happened next .
" You 're overdrawn , " the harbormaster said after a needle - like ship with long feathery vanes slipped underneath us into the docking bays .
He turned to face me , even though his eyes had been hollowed out long ago .
Force of habit .
His real eyes were now every camera , or anything mechanical that could see .
The harbormaster moved closer .
The gantry around him was motorized , a long arm moving him anywhere he wanted in the room .
Hundreds of cables , plugged into his scalp like hair , bundled and ran back along the arm of the gantry .
Hoses moved effluvia out .
More hoses ran purified blood , and other fluids , back in .
" I 'm sorry , " I stammered .
" Traffic is light .
And requests have dropped off .
I 've taken classes .
Even language lessons ... "
I stopped when I saw the wizened hand raise , palm up .
" I know what you 've been doing . "
The harbormaster 's sightless sockets turned back to the depths of space outside .
The hardened skin of his face showed few emotions , his artificial voice was toneless .
" You would not have been allowed to overdraw if you had n't made good faith efforts . "
" For which , " I said , " I am enormously appreciative . "
" That ship that just arrived brings with it a choice for you , " the harbormaster continued without acknowledging what I 'd just said .
" I can not let you overdraw any more if you stay on station , so I will have to put you into hibernation .
To pay for hibernation and your air debt I would buy your contract .
You'd be woken for guaranteed work .
I 'd take a percentage .
You could buy your contract back out , once you had enough liquidity . "
That was exactly what I 'd been dreading .
But he 'd indicated an alternate .
" My other option ? "
He waved a hand , and a holographic image of the ship I 'd just seen coming in to dock hung in the air .
" They 're asking for a professional Friend . "
" For their ship ? " Surprise tinged my question .
I was n't crew material .
I 'd been shipped frozen to the station , just another corpsicle .
People like me did n't stay awake for travel .
Not enough room .
The harbormaster shrugged pallid shoulders .
" They will not tell me why .
I had to sign a nondisclosure agreement just to get them to tell me what they wanted . "
I looked at the long ship .
" I 'm not a fuckbot .
They know that , right ? "
" They know that .
They reiterated that they do not want sexual services . "
" I 'll be outside the station .
Outside your protection .
It could still be what they want . "
" That is a risk .
How much so , I cannot model for you . "
The harbormaster snapped his fingers , and the ship faded away .
" But the contractors have extremely high reputational scores on past business dealings .
They are freelance scientists : biology , botany , and one linguist . "
So they probably did n't want me as a pass - around toy .
Probably .
" Rape amendments to the contract ? " I asked .
I was going to be on a ship , unthawed , by myself , with crew I 'd never met .
I had to think about the worst .
" Prohibitive .
Although , accidental loss of life is not quite as high , which means I 'd advise lowering the former so that there is no temptation to murder you after a theoretical rape to evade the higher contract payout . "
" Fuck , " I sighed .
" Would you like to peruse their reputation notes ? " the harbormaster asked .
And for a moment , I thought maybe the harbormaster sounded concerned .
No .
He was just being fair .
He 'd spent two hundred years of bargaining with ships for goods , fuel , repair , services .
Fair was built - in , the half - computer half - human creature in front of me was all about fair .
Fair got you repeat business .
Fair got you a wide reputation .
" What 's the offer ? "
" Half a point on the package , " the harbormaster said .
" And we do n't know what the package is , or how long it will take ... or anything . "
I bit my lip .
" They assured me that half a point would pay off your debt and then some .
It should n't take more than a year . "
A year .
For half a percent .
Half a percent of what ?
It could be cargo they were delivering .
Or , seeing as it was a crew of scientists , it could be some project they were working on .
All of which just raised more questions .
Questions I would n't have answers to unless I signed up .
I sighed .
" That 's it , then ?
No loans ?
No extensions ? "
The harbormaster sighed .
" I answer to the Gheda shareholders who built and own this complex .
I have already stretched my authority to give you a month 's extension .
The debt has to be called .
I 'm sorry . "
I looked out at the darkness of space out beyond Ops .
" Shit choices either way . "
The harbormaster said nothing .
I folded my arms .
" Do it . "
Journey by Gheda
The docking arms had transferred the starship from the center structure 's incoming docks down a spoke to a dock on one of the wheels .
The entire ship , thanks to being spun along with the wheel of the station , had gravity .
The starship was a quarter of a mile long .
Outside : sleek and burnished smooth by impacts with the scattered dust of space at the stunning speeds it achieved .
Inside , I realized I 'd boarded a creaky , old , outdated vehicle .
Fiberwire spilled out from conduits , evidence of crude repair jobs .
Dirt and grime clung to nooks and crannies .
The air smelled of sweat and worst .
A purple - haired man with all - black eyes met me at the airlock .
" You are the Friend ? " he asked .
He carried a large walking stick with him .
" Yes . "
I let go of the rolling luggage behind me and bowed .
" I'm Alex . "
He bowed back .
More extravagantly than I did .
Maybe even slightly mockingly .
" I'm Oslo . "
Every time he shifted his walking stick , tiny grains of sand inside rattled and shifted about .
He brimmed with impatience , and some regret in the crinkled lines of his eyes .
" Is this everything ? "
I looked back at the single case behind me .
" That is everything . "
" Then welcome aboard , " Oslo said , as the door to the station clanged shut .
He raised the stick , and a flash of light blinded me .
" You should have taken a scan of me before you shut the door , " I said .
The stick was more than it seemed .
Those tiny rustling grains were generators , harnessing power for whatever tools were inside the device via kinetic motion .
He turned around and started to walk away .
I hurried to catch up .
Oslo smiled , and I noticed tiny little fangs under his lips .
" You are who you say you are , so everything ended up okay .
Oh , and for protocol , the others are n't much into it either , by the way .
Now , for my own edification , you are a hermaphrodite , correct ? "
I flushed .
" I am what we Friends prefer to call bi-gendered , yes . "
Where the hell was Oslo from ?
I was having trouble placing his cultural conditionings and how I might adapt to interface with them .
He was very direct , that was for sure .
This gig might be more complicated than I thought .
" Your Friend training : did it encompass Compact cross-cultural training ? "
I slowed down .
" In theory , " I said slowly , worried about losing the contract if they insisted on having someone with Compact experience .
Oslo 's regret dripped from his voice and movements .
Was it regret that I did n't have the experience ?
Would I lose the contract , minutes into getting it ?
Or just regret that he could n't get someone better ?
" But you 've never Friended an actual Compact drone ? "
I decided to tell the truth .
A gamble .
" No . "
" Too bad . "
The regret sloughed off , to be replaced with resignation .
" But we can't poke around asking for Friends with that specific experience , or one of our competitors might put two and two together .
I recommend you brush up on your training during the trip out . "
He stopped in front of a large , metal door .
" Where are we going ? " I asked .
" Here is your room for the next three days . "
Oslo opened the large door to a five - by - seven foot room with a foldout bunk bed .
My heart skipped a beat , and I put aside the fact that Oslo had avoided the question .
" That 's mine ? "
" Yes .
And the air 's billed with our shipping contract , so you can rip your sensors off .
There 'll be no accounting until we 're done . "
I got the sense Oslo knew what it was like to be in debt .
I stepped into the room and turned all the way around .
I raised my hands , placing them on each wall , and smiled .
Oslo turned to go .
" Wait , " I said .
" The harbormaster said you were freelance scientists .
What do you do ? "
" I'm the botanist , " Oslo said .
" Meals are in the common passenger 's galley .
The crew of this ship is Gheda , of course , do n't talk to or interact with them if you can help it .
You know why ? "
" Yes . "
The last thing you wanted to do was make a Gheda think you were wandering around , trying to figure out secrets about their ships , or technology .
I would stay in the approved corridors and not interact with them .
The door closed in my suite , and I sat down with my small travel case , no closer to understanding what was going on than I had been on the station .
I faced the small mirror by an even smaller basin and reached for the strip of black material stuck to my throat .
Inside it , circuitry monitored my metabolic rate , number of breaths taken , volume of air taken in , and carbon dioxide expelled .
All of it reported back to the station 's monitors , constantly calculating my mean daily cost .
It made a satisfying sound as I ripped it off .
" Gheda are Gheda , " I said later in the ship 's artificial , alien day over reheated turkey strips in the passenger 's galley .
We 'd undocked .
The old ship had shivered itself up to speed .
" But Gheda flying around in a beat - up old starship , willing to take freelance scientists out to some secret destination : these are dangerous Gheda . "
Oslo had a rueful smile as he leaned back and folded his arms .
" Cruzie says that our kind used to think our corporations were rapacious and evil before first contact .
No one expected aliens to demand royalty payments for technology usage that had been independently discovered by us because the Gheda had previously patented that technology . "
" I know .
They hit non-compliant areas with asteroids from orbit . "
Unable to pay royalties , entire nations had collapsed into debtorship .
" Who 's Cruzie ? "
Oslo grimaced .
" You 'll meet her in two days .
Our linguist .
Bit of a historian , too .
Loves old Earth shit . "
I frowned at his reaction .
Conflicted , but with somewhat warm pleasure when he thought about her .
A happy grimace .
" She 's an old friend of yours ? "
" Our parents were friends .
They loved history .
The magnificence of Earth .
The legend that was .
Before it got sold around .
Before the Diaspora . "
That grimace again .
But no warmth there .
" You do n't agree with their ideals ? " I guessed .
I guessed well .
Oslo sipped at a mug of tea , and eyed me .
" I 'm not your project , Friend .
Do n't dig too deep , because you just work for me .
Save your empathy and psychiatry for the real subject .
Understand ? "
Too far , I thought .
" I 'm sorry .
And just what is my project ?
We 're away from the station now ; do you think you can risk being open with me ? "
Oslo set his tea down .
" Clever .
Very clever , Friend .
Yes , I was worried about bugs .
We 've found a planet , with a unique ecosystem .
There may be patentable innovations . "
I sat , stunned .
Patents ?
I had points on the package .
If I got points on a patent on some aspect of an alien biological system , a Gheda - approved patent , I 'd be rich .
Not just rich , but like , nation - rich .
Oslo sipped at his tea .
" There 's only one problem , " he said .
" There may be intelligent life on the planet .
If it 's intelligent , it 's a contact situation , and we have to turn it over to the Gheda .
We get a fee , but no taste of the real game .
We fail to report a contact situation and the Gheda find out , it 's going to be a nasty scene .
They 'll kill our families , or even people you know , just to make the point that their interstellar law is inviolate .
We have to file a claim the moment of discovery . "
I 'd heard hesitation in his voice .
" You have n't filed yet , have you ? "
" I bet all the Gheda business creatures love having you watch humans they 're settling a contract with , making sure they 're telling the truth , you there to brief them on what their facial expressions are really showing . "
That stung .
" I 'd do the same for any human .
And it is n't just contracts .
Many hire me to pay attention to them , to figure them out , anticipate their needs . "
Oslo leered .
" I 'll bet . "
I was n't a fuckbot .
I deflected the leering .
" So tell me , Oslo , why I 'm risking my life , then ? "
" We have n't filed yet because we honestly can't fucking figure out if the aliens are just dumb creatures , or intelligences like us , " Oslo said .
The Drone
" Welcome to the Screaming Kettle , " said the woman who grabbed my bag without asking .
She had dark brown skin and eyes , and black hair .
Tattoos covered every inch of skin free of her clothing .
Words in scripts and languages that I did n't recognize .
" The Compact Drone is about to dock as well , we need you ready for it .
Let 's get your stuff stowed . "
We walked below skylights embedded in the top of the research station .
A planet hung there : green and yellow and patchy .
It looked like it was diseased with mold .
" Is that Ve ? " I asked .
" Oslo get you up to speed ? " the woman asked .
" Somewhat .
You 're Cruzie , right ? "
" Maricruz .
I 'm the linguist .
I guess ... you 're stuck here with us .
You can call me Cruzie too . "
We stopped in front of a room larger than the one on the ship .
With two beds .
I looked at the beds .
" I 'm comfortable with a cubby , if it means getting my own space , " I said .
There was far more space here , vastly so .
And yet , I was going to have to share it ?
It rankled .
Even at the station , I had n't had to share my space .
This shoved me up against my own cultural normative values .
Even in the most packed places in space , you needed a cubby of one 's own .
" You 're here to Friend the Compact Drone , " Cruzie said .
" It 'll need companionship at all times .
Their contract requires it for the Drone 's mental stability . "
" Oslo did n't tell me this . "
I pursed my lips .
A fairly universal display of annoyance .
And Cruzie read that well enough .
" I 'm sorry , " she said .
But it was a lie as well .
She was getting annoyed and impatient .
But screw it , as Oslo pointed out : I was n't there for their needs .
" Oslo wants us to succeed more than anything .
Unlike his parents , he 's not much into the glory that was humankind .
He knows the only way we 'll ever not be freelancers , scrabbling around for intellectual scraps found in the side alleys of technology for something we can use without paying the Gheda for the privilege , is to hit something big . "
" So he lied to me . "
My voice remained flat .
" He left out truths that would have made you less willing to come . "
" He lied . "
Cruzie shut the door to my room .
" He gave you points on the package , Friend .
We win big , you do your job , you 'll never have to check the balance on your air for the rest of your damned life .
I heard you were in air debt , right ? "
She 'd put me well in place .
We both knew it .
Cruzie smiled , a gracious winner 's smile .
" Incoming ! " Someone yelled from around the bend in the corridor .
" I 'm not going to fuck the Drone , " I told her levelly .
Cruzie shrugged .
" I do n't care what you do or do n't do , as long as the Drone stays mentally stable and does its job for us .
Points on the package , Alex. Points . "
Airlock alarms flashed and warbled , and the hiss of compressed air filled the antechamber
" The incoming pod 's not much larger than a cubby sleeper , " Oslo said , his purple hair waving about as another burst of compressed air filled the antechamber .
He smiled , fangs out beyond his lips .
" It 's smaller than the lander we have for exploring Ve ourselves , if we ever need to get down there .
Can you imagine the ride ?
The only non-Gheda way of traveling ! "
The last member of the team joined us .
She looked over at me and nodded .
Silvered electronic eyes glinted in the flash of the airlock warning lights .
She flexed the jet black fingers of her artificial right hand absentmindedly as she waited for the doors to open .
She ran the fingers of a real hand over her shaved head , then put them back in her utility jacket , covered with what seemed like hundreds of pockets and zippers .
" That 's Kepler , " Cruzie said .
The airlock doors opened .
A thin , naked man stumbled out , dripping goopy blue acceleration gel with each step .
For a moment his eyes flicked around , blinking .
Then he started screaming .
Oslo , Kepler , and Cruzie jumped back half a step from the naked man 's arms .
I stepped forward .
" It 's not fear , it 's relief . "
The man grabbed me in a desperate hug , clinging to me , his hands patting my face , shoulders , as if reassuring himself someone was really standing in front of him .
" It 's okay , " I whispered .
" You 've been in there by yourself for days , with no contact of any sort .
I understand . "
He was shivering in my grip , but I kept patting his back .
I urged him to feel the press of contact between us .
And reassurance .
Calm .
Eventually he calmed down , and then slowly let go of me .
" What 's your name ? " I asked .
" Beck . "
" Welcome aboard , Beck , " I said , looking over his shoulder at the scientists who looked visibly relieved .
First things first .
Beck got to the communications room .
Back and forth verification on an uplink , and he leaned back against the chair in relief .
" There 's an uplink to the Hive , " he said .
" An hour of lag time to get as far back as the home system , but I 'm patched in . "
He tapped metal inserts on the back of his neck .
His mind plugged in to the communications network , talking all the way back to the asteroid belt in the mother system , where the Compact 's Hive thrived .
Back there , Beck would always be in contact with it without a delay .
In instant symbiosis with a universe of information that the Compact offered .
A hive - mind of people , your core self subjugated to the greater whole .
I shivered .
Beck never moved more than half a foot away from me .
Always close enough to touch .
He kept reaching out to make sure I was there , even though he could see me .
After walking around the research station for half an hour , we returned to our shared room .
He sat on his bed , suddenly apprehensive .
" You 're the Friend , correct ? "
" Yes . "
" I 'm lonely over here .
Can you sleep by me ? "
I walked over and sat next to him .
" I wo n't have sex with you .
That 's not why I 'm here . "
" I 'm chemically neutered , " Beck said as we curled up on the bed .
" I 'm a drone . "
As we lay there , I imagined thousands of Becks sleeping in rows in Hive dorms , body heat keeping the rooms warm .
Half an hour later he suddenly sighed , like a drug addict getting a hit .
" They hear me , " he whispered .
" I 'm not alone . "
The Compact had replied to him .
He relaxed .
The room filled with a pleasant lavender scent .
Was it something he 'd splashed on earlier ?
Or something a Compact drone released to indicate comfort ?
What 's Human ?
" That , " Kepler said , leaning back in a couch before a series of displays , " is one of our remote - operated vehicles .
We call them urchins . "
In the upper right hand screen before her , a small sphere with hundreds of wriggling legs rotated around .
Then it scrabbled off down what looked like a dirt path .
Cruzie swung into a similar couch .
" We sterilize them in orbit , then drop them down encased in a heatshield .
It burns away , then they drop down out of the sky with a little burst of a rocket to slow down enough . "
I frowned at one of the screens .
Everything was shades of green and gray and black .
" Is that night vision ? "
Oslo laughed .
" It 's Ve . The atmosphere is chlorinated .
Green mists .
Grey shadows .
And black plants . "
The trees had giant , black leaves hanging low to the ground .
Tubular trunks sprouted globes that spouted mist randomly as the urchin brushed past .
" Ve 's a small planet , " Kepler said .
" Low gravity , but with air similar to what you would have seen on the mother world . "
" Earth , " Oslo corrected .
" But unlike the mother world , " Kepler continued , " Ve has high levels of chlorine .
Somewhere in its history , a battle launched among the plants .
Instead of specializing in oxygen to kill off the competition , and adapting to it over time , plant life here turned to chlorine as a weapon .
It created plastics out of the organic compounds available to it , which is doable in a chlorine - heavy base atmosphere , though remarkable .
And the organic plastics also handle photosynthesis .
A handy trick .
If we can patent it . "
On the screen the urchin rolled to a slow stop .
Cruzie leaned forward .
" Now if we can just figure out if those bastards are really building a civilization , or just random dirt mounds ... "
Paused at the top of a ridge , the urchin looked at a clearing in the black - leafed forest .
Five pyramids thrust above the foliage around the clearing .
" Can you get closer ? "
Beck asked , and I jumped slightly .
He 'd been so silent , watching all this by my side .
" Not from here , " Kepler said .
" There 's a big dip in altitude between here and the clearing . "
" And ? " Beck stared at the pyramids on the screen .
" Our first couple weeks here we kept driving the urchins into low lying areas , valleys , that sort of thing .
They kept dying on us .
We figure the chlorine and acids sink low into the valleys .
Our equipment can't handle it . "
Beck sat down on the nearest couch to Kepler , and looked over the interface .
" Take the long way around then , I 'll look at your archives while you do so .
Wait ! "
I saw it too .
A movement through the black , spiky bushes .
I saw my first alien creature scuttle around , antennae twisting as it moved along what looked like a path .
" They look like ants , " I blurted out .
" We call them Vesians .
But yes , ants the size of a small dog , " Oslo said .
" And not really ants at all .
Just exoskeletons , black plastic , in a similar structure .
The handiwork of parallel evolution . "
More Vesians appeared carrying leaves and sticks on their backs .
And gourds .
" Now that 's interesting , " Beck said .
" It does n't mean they 're intelligent , " Beck said later , lying in the bunk with me next to him .
We both stared up at the ceiling .
He rolled over and looked at me .
" The gourds grow on trees .
They use them to store liquids .
Inside those pyramids . "
We were face to face , breathing each other 's air .
Beck had no personal space , and I had to fight my impulse to pull back away from him .
My job was now to facilitate .
Make Beck feel at home .
Insect hives had drones that could exist away from the hive .
A hive needed foragers , and defenders .
But the human Compact only existed in the asteroid belt of the mother system .
Beck was a long way from home .
With the lag , he would be feeling cut off and distant .
And for a mind that had always been in the embrace of the hive , this had to be hard for him .
But Beck offered the freelance scientists a link into the massive computational capacity of the entire Compact .
They 'd contracted it to handle the issue they could n't figure out quickly : were the aliens intelligent or not ?
Beck was pumping information back all the way back to the mother system , so that the Compact could devote some fraction of a fraction of its massed computing ability to the issue .
The minds of all its connected citizenry .
Its supercomputers .
Maybe even , it was rumored , artificial intelligences .
" But if they are intelligent ? " I asked .
" How do you prove it ? "
Beck cocked his head .
" The Compact is working on it .
Has been ever since the individuals here signed the contract . "
" Then why are you out here ? "
" Yes ... "
He was suddenly curious in me now , remembering I was a distinct individual , lying next to him .
I was n't of the Compact .
I was n't another drone .
" I 'm sorry , " I said .
" I should n't have asked . "
" It was good you asked . "
He flopped over to stare at the ceiling again .
" You 're right , I 'm not entirely needed .
But the Compact felt it was necessary . "
I wanted to know why .
But I could feel Beck hesitate .
I held my breath .
" You are a Friend .
You 've never broken contract .
The Compact ranks you very highly . "
Beck turned back to face me .
" We understand that what I tell you will never leave this room , and since I debugged it , it 's a safe room .
What do you think it takes to become a freelance scientist in this hostile universe ? "
I 'd been around enough negotiating tables .
A good Friend , with the neural modifications and adaptive circuitry laced into me from birth , I could read body posture , micro-expressions , skin flush , heart rate , in a blink of the eye .
I made a hell of a negotiating tool .
Which was usually exactly what Gheda wanted : a read on their human counterparts .
And I had learned the ins and outs of my clients businesses quick as well .
I knew what the wider universe was like while doing my job .
" Oslo has pent - up rage , " I whispered .
" His family is obsessed with the Earth as it used to be .
Before the Gheda land purchases .
He wants wealth , but that 's not all , I think .
Cruzie holds herself like she has military bearing , though she hides it .
Kepler , I do n't know .
I 'm guessing you will tell me they have all worked as weapons manufacturers or researchers of some sort ? "
Beck nodded .
" Oslo and his sister London are linked to a weaponized virus that was released on a Gheda station .
Cruzie fought with separatists in Columbia .
Kepler is a false identity .
We have n't cracked her yet . "
I looked at the drone .
There was no deceit in him .
He stated these things as facts .
He was a drone .
He did n't need to question the information given to him .
" Why are you telling me all this ? "
He gestured at the bunk .
" You 're a professional Friend .
You 're safe .
You 're here .
And I 'm just a drone .
We 're just a piece of all this . "
And then he moved to spoon against the inside of my stomach .
Two meaningless , tiny lives inside a cold station , far away from where they belonged .
" And because , " he added in a soft voice , " I think that these scientists are desperate enough to fix a problem if it occurs . "
" Fix a problem ? " I asked , wrapping my arms around him .
" I think the Vesians are intelligent , and I think Kepler and Oslo plan to do something to them if , or when , it 's confirmed , so that they can keep patent rights . "
I could suddenly hear every creak , whisper , and whistle in the station as I tensed up .
" I will protect you if I can .
Right now we 're just delaying as long as we can .
Mainly I 'm trying to stop Cruzie from figuring out the obvious , because if she confirms they 're really intelligent , then Oslo and Kepler will make their move and do something to the Vesians .
We 're not sure what . "
" You said delaying .
Delaying until what ? "
I asked , a slight quaver in my voice that I found I could n't control .
" Until the Gheda get here , " Beck said with a last yawn .
" That 's when it all gets really complicated . "
His voice trailed off as he said that , and he fell asleep .
I lay there , awake and wide - eyed .
I finally reached up to my neck and scratched at the band of skin where the air monitor patch had once been stuck .
Points on nothing was still just ... nothing .
But could I rat out my contract ?
My role as a Friend ?
Could I help Oslo and Kepler kill an alien race ?
Things had gotten very muddy in just a few minutes .
I felt trapped between the hell of an old life and the hell of a horrible new one .
" What 's a human being ? " I asked Beck over lunch .
" Definitions vary , " he replied .
" You 're a drone : bred to act , react , and move within a shared neural environment .
You serve the Compact .
There 's no queen , like a classic anthill or with bees .
Your shared mental overmind makes the calls .
So you have a say .
A tiny say .
You are human ... - ish .
Our ancestors would have questioned whether you were human . "
Beck cocked his head and smiled .
" And you ? "
" Modified from birth to read human faces .
Under contract for most of my life to Gheda , working to tell the aliens or other humans what humans are really thinking ... they would n't have thought highly of me either . "
" The Compact knows you reread your contract last night , after I fell asleep , and you used some rather complicated algorithms to game some scenarios . "
I frowned .
" So you 're spying on us now . "
" Of course .
You 're struggling with a gray moral situation . "
" Which is ? "
" The nature of your contract says you need to work with me and support my needs .
But you 're hired by the freelancers that I 'm now in opposition to .
As a Friend , a role and purpose burned into you just like being a drone is burned into me , do you warn them ?
Or do you stick by me ?
The contract allows for interpretations either way .
And if you stick with me , it 's doing so while knowing that I 'm just a drone .
A pawn that the Compact will use as it sees fit , for its own game . "
" You left something out , " I said .
" Neither you , nor I , are bred to care about Vesians , " Beck said .
I got up and walked over to the large porthole .
" I wonder if it would n't be better for them ? "
" What would ? "
" Whatever Kepler and Oslo want to do to them .
Better to die now than to meet the Gheda .
I can't imagine they 'd ever want to become us . "
Beck stood up .
There was caution in his stance , as if he'd thought I had been figured out , but now was n't sure .
" I 've got work to do .
Stay here and finish your meal , Friend . "
I looked down at the green world beneath , and jumped when a hand grabbed my shoulder .
I could see gray words tattooed in the skin .
" Cruzie ? "
Her large brown eyes were filled with anger .
" That son of a bitch has been lying to us , " she said , pointing in the direction Beck had gone .
" Come with me . "
" The gourds , " Cruzie said , pointing at a screen , and then looking at Beck .
" Tell us about the gourds . "
And Oslo grabbed my shoulder .
" Watch the drone , sharp now .
I want you to tell us what you see when he replies to us . "
My contract would be clear there .
I could n't lie .
The scientists owned the contract , and now that they 'd asked directly for my services , I could n't evade .
Points on the package , I thought in the far back of my mind .
I was n't really human , was I ?
Not if I found the lure of eternal riches to be so great as to consider helping the freelancers .
" The Vesians have farms , " Cruzie said .
" But so do ants : they grow fungus .
The Vesians have roads , but so do animals in a forest .
They just keep walking over the same spots .
Old Earth roads used to follow old animal paths .
The Vesians have buildings , but birds build nests , ants build colonies , bees build hives .
But language , that 's so much rarer in the animal kingdom , is n't it , Beck ? "
" Not really , " the drone said calmly .
" Primitive communication exists in animals .
Including bees , which dance information .
Dolphins squeak and whales sing . "
" But none of them write it down , " Cruzie grinned .
Oslo 's squeezed my shoulder , hard .
" The drone is mildly annoyed , " I said .
" And more than a little surprised . "
Cruzie tapped on a screen .
The inside of one of the pyramids appeared .
It was a storehouse of some sort , filled with hundreds , maybe thousands , of the gourds I 'd seen earlier that the Vesian had been transporting .
" Nonverbal creatures use scent .
Just like ants on the mother planet .
The Vesians use scents to mark territories their queens manage .
And one of the things I started to wonder about , were these storage areas .
What were they for ?
So I broke in , and I started breaking the gourds . "
Beck stiffened .
" He 's not happy with this line of thought , " I murmured .
" Thought so , " Oslo said back , and nodded at Cruzie , who kept going .
" And whenever I broke a gourd , I found them empty .
Not full of liquid , as Beck told us was likely .
We originally thought they were for storage .
An adaptive behavior .
Or a sign of intelligence .
Hard to say .
Until I broke them all . "
" They could have been empty , waiting to be sealed , " Beck said tonelessly .
I sighed .
" I 'm sorry , Beck .
I have to do this .
He 's telling the truth , Oslo .
But misdirecting . "
" I know he is , " Cruzie said .
" Because the Vesians swarmed the location with fresh gourds .
There were chemical scents , traces laid down in the gourds before they were sealed .
The Vesians examined the broken gourds , then filled the new ones with scents .
I started examining the chemical traces , and found that each gourd replaced had the same chemical sequences sprayed on and stored as the ones I broke . "
Beck 's muscles tensed .
Any human could see the stress now .
I did n't need to say anything .
" They were like monks , copying manuscripts .
Right , Beck ? " Cruzie asked .
" Yes , " Beck said .
" And the chemical markers , it 's a language , right ? " Kepler asked .
I could feel the tension in her voice .
It was n't just disappointment building , but rage .
" It is . "
Beck stood up slowly .
" It took me days to realize it , " Cruzie said .
" And that , after the weeks I 've been out here .
The Compact spotted it right away , did n't it ? "
Beck looked over at me , then back at Cruzie .
" Yes .
The Compact knows . "
" Then what the hell is it planning to do ? "
Kepler moved in front of Beck , lips drawn back in a snarl .
" I 'm just a drone , " Beck said .
" I do n't know .
But I can give you an answer in an hour . "
For a second , everyone stood frozen .
Oslo , brimming with hurt rage , staring at Beck .
Kepler , moving from anger toward some sort of decision .
Cruzie looked ... triumphant .
Oblivious to the real breaking developments in the air .
And I observed .
Like any good Friend .
Then a loud ' whooop whooop ' startled us all out of our poses .
" What 's that ? "
Cruzie asked , looking around .
" The Gheda are here , " Oslo , Kepler , and Beck said at the same time .
The Path Less Traveled
" Call the vote , " Oslo snapped .
Cruzie swallowed .
I saw micro beads of sweat on the side of her neck .
" Right now ? "
" Gheda are inbound , " Kepler said , her artificial eyes dark .
I imagined she had them patched into the computers , looking at information from the station 's sensors .
" They 'll be decelerating and matching orbit in hours .
There 's no time for debate , Cruzie . "
" What we 're about to do is something that requires debate .
They 're intelligent .
We 're proposing ripping that away over the next day with Kepler 's tailored virus .
They 'll end up with a viral lobotomy , just smart enough we can claim their artifacts come from natural hive mind behavior .
But we 'll have stolen their culture .
Their minds .
Their history . "
Cruzie shook her head .
" I know we said they 're going to lose most of that when the Gheda arrive .
But if we do this , we 're worse than Gheda . "
" Fucking hell , Cruzie ! " Oslo snapped .
" You 're changing your mind now ? "
" Oslo ! " Cruzie held up her hands as if trying to ward off the angry words .
" You saw our mother planet , " Oslo said .
" The slums .
The starvation .
Gheda combat patrols .
They owned everyone .
If you did n't provide value , you were nothing .
You fought the Sahara campaign , you attacked Abbuj station .
How the fuck can you turn your back to all that ? "
" I did n't turn my back , I wanted a different path , " Cruzie said .
" That 's why we 're here .
With the money on the patents , we could change things ... but what are we changing here if we 're not all that better than the Gheda ? "
" It 's us or the fucking ants , " Kepler said , voice suddenly level .
" It 's really that simple .
Where are your allegiances ? "
I bit my lip when I heard that .
" Cruzie ... "
I started to say .
She held a hand up and walked over to the console , her thumb held out .
" It takes a unanimous vote to unleash the virus .
This was why I insisted . "
" You 're right , " Kepler said .
I flinched .
I could hear the hatred in her voice .
She nodded at Oslo .
He raised his walking stick .
The tiny grains inside rattled around , and then a jagged finger of energy leapt out and struck Cruzie in the small of her back .
Cruzie jerked around , arms flopping as she danced , then dropped to the ground .
Oslo pressed the stick to her head and fired it again .
Blood gushed from Cruzie 's eye sockets as something inside her skull went ' pop . '
A wisp of smoke curled from her open mouth .
Oslo and Kepler put thumbs to the screens .
" We have a unanimous vote now . "
But a red warning sign flashed back at them .
Beck relaxed slightly , a tiny curl of a smile briefly appearing .
Oslo raised his walking stick and pointed it at Beck .
" Our communications are blocked . "
" Yes , " Beck said .
" The Compact is voting against preemptive genocide . "
For a split second , I saw the decision to kill Beck flit across Kepler 's face .
" If you kill him , " I spoke up , " the Compact will spend resources hunting you two down .
You ca n't enjoy your riches if you 're dead . "
Kepler nodded .
" You 're right . "
But she looked at me , a question on her face .
I shrugged .
" If you 're all dead , I do n't have points on the package . "
" Trigger them manually , " Oslo said .
" We 'll bring the drone .
We wo n't leave him up here to cause more trouble .
Bring him , or her , or whatever the Friend calls itself as well .
Your contract , Alex , is now to watch Beck . "
We burned our way through the green atmosphere of Ve , the lander bucking and groaning , skin cracking as it weathered the heat of our reentry fireball .
From the tiny cramped cockpit I watched us part the clouds and spiral slowly down out of the sky as the wings unfurled from slots in the tear - drop sized vehicle 's side .
They started beating a complicated figure - eight motion .
Oslo aimed his walking stick at us when the lander touched down .
" Put on your helmet , get out .
Both of you . "
We did so .
Heavy chlorine - rich mists swirled around , disturbed by our landing .
Large puffball flowers spurted acid whenever touched by a piece of stray stirred - up debris , and the black , plastic leaves all around us bobbed gently in a low breeze .
Oslo and Kepler pulled a large pack out of the lander 's cargo area .
Long pieces of tubing .
They set to building a freestanding antenna , piece by piece .
I watched Beck .
I could n't see his face , but I could see his posture .
He was about to run .
Which made no sense .
Run where ?
On this world ?
Within a few minutes Oslo and Kepler had snapped together a thirty - foot tall tower .
I swallowed , and remained silent .
It was a choice , a deliberate path .
I broke my contract .
Oslo snapped a clip to the top of the tower , then unrolled a length of cable .
He and Kepler used it to pull the super light structure up .
That was the moment Beck ran , as it hung halfway up to standing .
" Shit , " Oslo cursed over the tiny speakers in our helmets , but he did n't drop the structure .
" You 've only got a couple hours of air you moron ! "
The only response was Beck 's heavy breathing .
When the antenna stood upright , Oslo approached me , the walking stick out .
" You did n't warn us . "
" He was wearing a spacesuit , " I said calmly .
But I could see Oslo did n't believe me .
His eyes creased and his fingers tightened .
A bright explosion of pain ripped into me .
My vision cleared .
I was on my hands and feet , shaking with pain from the electrical discharge .
A whirlwind of debris whipped around me .
I looked up to see the lander lifting into the sky .
So that was it .
I 'd made my choice : to try and not be a monster .
And it had been in vain .
The Vesians would be lobotomized by Kepler 's virus .
Beck would die .
I would die .
I watched the lander beginning a wide spiral upward away from me .
In a few seconds it would fire its rockets and climb for orbit .
In a couple hours , I would run out of air .
Four large gourds arced high over the black forest and slapped into the side of the lander .
I frowned .
At first , it looked like they had no effect .
The lander kept spiraling up .
But then , it faltered .
The lander shook , and smoke spilled out of a crack in the side somewhere .
It exploded , the fireball hanging in the sky .
" Get away from the antenna , " Beck suddenly said .
" It 's next . "
I ran without a second thought , and even as I got free of the clearing , gourds of acid hit the structure .
The metal sizzled , foamed , and then began to melt .
A few seconds later , I broke out onto a dirt path where the catapults firing the gourds of acid had been towed into place .
Beck waited for me , surrounded by a crowd of Vesians .
He wore only his helmet , he 'd ripped his suit off .
His skin bubbled from bad chemical burn blisters .
" The Vesians destroyed all the remote - operating vehicles with the virus in it , " he said .
" The queens have quarantined any Vesians near any area that had an ROV .
The species will survive . "
" You 've been talking to them , " I said .
And then I thought back to the comforting smell in my room the first night Beck spent with me .
" You 're communicating with them .
You warned them . "
Beck held up his suit .
" Yes .
The Compact altered me to be an ambassador to them . "
" Beck , how long can you survive in this environment ? "
I stared at his blistered skin .
" A year .
Maybe .
There will be another ready by then .
Maybe a structure to live in .
The Gheda will be here soon to bring air .
The Compact has reached an agreement with them .
The Vesian queens are agreeing to join the Compact .
The Compact gets to extend out of the mother system , but only to Ve .
In exchange , the Gheda get rights to all patentable discoveries made in the new ecosystem .
They 're particularly interested in plastic - based organic photosynthesis . "
I collapsed to the ground , realizing that I would live .
Beck sat next to me .
A small Vesian , approached , a gourd in its mandibles .
It set the organic , plastic bottle at my legs .
" What 's that ? "
" A jar of goodwill , " Beck said .
" The Vesian queen of this area is thanking you . "
I was still just staring at it two hours later as my air faded out , my vision blurred , and the Gheda lander finally reached us .
The harbormaster cocked his head .
" You 're back . "
" I 'm back , " I said .
Someone was unpacking my two bags .
one of them carefully holding the Vesian ' gift . '
" I did n't think I 'd ever see you again , " the harbormaster said .
" Not with a contract like that . "
" It did n't work out . "
I looked out into the vacuum of space beyond us .
" Certainly not for the people who hired me .
Or me . "
" You have a peripheral contract with the Compact .
An all - you - can - breath line of credit on the station .
You 're not a citizen , but on perpetual retainer as the Compact 's primary professional Friend for all dealings in this system .
You did well enough . "
I grinned .
" Points on a package like what they offered me was a fairy tale .
A fairy tale you 'd have to be soulless to want to have come true . "
" I 'm surprised that you did not choose to join the Compact , " the harbormaster said , looking closely at me .
" It is a safe place for humans in this universe .
Even as a peripheral for them , you could still be in danger during patent negotiations with Gheda . "
" I know .
But this is home .
My home .
I 'm not a drone , I do n't want to be one . "
The harbormaster sighed .
" You understand the station is my only love .
I do n't have a social circle .
There is only the ebb and flow of this structure 's health for me . "
I smiled .
" That 's why I like you , harbormaster .
You have few emotions .
You are a fair dealer .
You 're the closest thing I have to family .
You may even be the closest thing I have to a friend , friend with a lowercase 'f . ' "
" You follow your contracts to the letter .
I like that about you , " the harbormaster said .
" I 'm glad you will continue on here . "
Together we watched the needle - like ship that had brought me back home silently fall away from the station .
" The Compact purchased me a ten - by - ten room with a porthole , " I said .
" I do n't have to come up here to sneak a look at the stars anymore . "
The harbormaster sighed happily .
" They 're beautiful , are n't they ?
I think , we 've always loved them , have n't we ?
Even before we were forced to leave the mother world . "
" That 's what the history books say , " I said quietly over the sound of ducts and creaking station .
" We dreamed of getting out here , to live among them .
Dreamed of the wonders we 'd see . "
" The Gheda do n't see the stars , " the harbormaster said .
" They have few portholes .
Before I let the Gheda turn me into a harbormaster , I demanded the contract include this room . "
" They do n't see them the way we do , " I agreed .
" They 're not human , " the harbormaster said .
" No , they 're not . " I looked out at the distant stars .
" But then , few things are anymore . "
The Gheda ship disappeared in a blinding flash of light , whipping through space toward its next destination
The Republican Congressman who suggested that President Obama “ has a default mechanism in him that breaks down [ on ] the side of race ” has already been widely criticized for his remark .
But adding insult to injury , even a Republican candidate has now canceled a fundraiser where Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) was scheduled to speak on his behalf .
In an appearance Monday on G. Gordon Liddy ’s radio talk show , King reacted to a comment made several months ago by Attorney General Eric Holder that when it comes to race Americans are “ in too many ways , essentially a nation of cowards . ”

“ When you look at this administration , I ’m offended by Eric Holder and the President also , their posture , ” King remarked .
“ It looks like Eric Holder said that white people in America are cowards when it comes to race .
And I do n’t know what the basis of that is but I ’m not a coward when it comes to that and I ’m happy to talk about these things and I think we should .
But the President has demonstrated he ’s got a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race — on the side that favors the black person , in the case of Professor Gates and Officer Crowley . ”
King had previously been scheduled to speak at a $ 100 a plate fundraiser next Saturday on behalf of Colorado State Representative Cory Gardner , who is running for Congress against a Democratic incumbent , but according to the Coloradoan , that has now been canceled .
Gardner ’s campaign manager , Chris Hansen , “ informed the Coloradoan of the cancellation after the paper inquired about King ’s remarks ” but offered no explanation .
As of Tuesday , the Colorodoan had been unable to reach King ’s office for a comment and could not confirm whether King was still scheduled to speak at a Tea Party rally on Saturday with Gardner and another Republican candidate .
The Des Moines Register reports that King ’s office has objected that the liberal website PoliticalCorrection.com unfairly made King ’s remarks appear racist by omitting his use of Professor Gates as an example .
King has made similar statements in the past , however , as when he complained last month that President Obama had “ politicized ” the Arizona anti-illegal immigrant law by alleging “ that it ’s race - based and racially motivated when the law itself specifically prohibits that from happening . ”
After the cancellation of the fundraiser was announced , Andy Stone , a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , commented , “ The event may have been canceled , but Congressman King ’s comments today are just the latest in a long line of inflammatory and offensive remarks , and Cory Gardner owes it to Colorado voters to explain whether he agrees with his guest or not . ”

Of all the forms of woe that take root in the human genome , the cancer called Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most merciless .
It can infiltrate the brain ’s white matter for months before causing any symptoms .
By the time memory loss and seizures reveal the presence of an invader , there ’s often little to do but minimize the patient ’s suffering .
Most who are diagnosed with the disease — people like the late senator Edward Kennedy — are dead within two years .
In fall 2005 , the National Cancer Institute announced that it was going after glioblastoma and several other fatal forms of cancer in a totally new way .
Francis Collins , then director of the National Human Genome Research Institute , told an audience of reporters , federal health officials , and cancer survivors that the same technologies his team had employed to map the complete human genome — high - throughput DNA sequencing , lab automation , and computational biology — would now be enlisted in the fight against some of the most feared diseases in medicine .

The NCI ’s new initiative would be called the Cancer Genome Atlas .
By cataloging the genetic glitches that turn healthy cells into malignant marauders , the institute hoped to come up with innovative methods of detecting and treating cancer in its earliest stages as well as develop smarter strategies for prevention .
The pilot phase of the project would focus on three of the most common and treatment - resistant forms of the disease : glioblastoma , serous cancer of the ovaries , and squamous - cell carcinoma of the lungs , the classic killer of smokers .
Hopes for the atlas were extraordinarily high .
NCI deputy director Anna Barker predicted that everyone in the room would remember the day as a milestone in medical history .
Director Andrew von Eschenbach declared that genomic analysis would ensure that the future of cancer testing and treatment looked “ no more like the past than a butterfly resembles a caterpillar . ”
Even the normally low - key Collins — now head of the National Institutes of Health — gushed that the “ planets have aligned to tackle cancer . ”
Just a few months later , however , NCI researchers might have wondered whether the planets had instead conspired against them .
Rather than making progress by analyzing DNA from hundreds of samples of cancer tissue , the project had practically slammed to a halt .
The problem was not in the data or the technology .
The problem was in the flesh and blood — the tumor specimens provided by thousands of cryogenic storage facilities known as biobanks .
Located in hospitals , universities , nonprofit organizations , and pharmaceutical companies , biobanks play a quiet but crucial role in health care .
Like libraries of the human organism , they archive a wide range of biospecimens — including blood , hair , sperm , saliva , plasma , whole organs , and purified DNA — to use in research and experimentation .
From drug development to assisted reproduction , progress in dozens of fields would be impossible without biobanks .
They are the biological back end of data - driven medicine .
When the NCI drew up its plans for the atlas , dozens of bio-repositories in the US assured the institute that at least 500 samples of each type of tumor could be provided easily .
Once the project was under way , however , the researchers got a series of bruising reality checks .
Many biobank managers did n’t seem to know exactly what was in their own freezers .
Some specimens had never been checked before they were put in storage and turned out to be unfit for analysis .
Others had been obtained from patients without adequate consent , so a single sample might require months of legal wrangling before it could be used .
And often , when a frozen chunk of tumor finally arrived at the lab , it was a bloody mess , riddled with dead and decaying cells or simply too small to yield enough DNA .
One bank at a major university claimed to have more than 12,000 samples of glioblastoma in its collection .
Only 18 of those were good enough to use .
The rate of unacceptable shipments from other institutions ran as high as 99 percent .
“ We originally aimed for 1,500 samples , which we were told we could get from four to six biobanks in the US alone , ” says Carolyn Compton , director of the NCI ’s Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research , which led the collection effort .
“ We never made it to 500 samples of glioblastoma , even after asking biobanks all over the world .
We barely got to 500 in ovarian cancer .
And we never even started working on lung cancer , due solely to our inability to find the requisite samples .
Meanwhile , everyone at the biobanks thought they were doing a superb job . ”
In a subsequent investigation , Compton ’s office discovered that an inability to obtain high - quality biosamples is a growing problem in labs , eating away at progress in medicine like an undetected malignancy .
Many scientists reported that rather than pursuing the most promising leads in their research , they ’re forced to design experiments around whatever tissue scraps they can get .
One in five confessed that the inferior quality of the samples might be compromising their data .
Every year , billions of dollars ’ worth of research into the genetic underpinnings of autism , schizophrenia , diabetes , Alzheimer ’s disease , and other devastating disorders hinges on scientists ’ ability to tap industrial quantities of cells and tissue .
But Compton found that while our technology for decoding the inner workings of life is advancing dramatically , the protocols for collecting and storing specimens of human flesh have barely evolved in decades .
At the same time , innovation in the field of biobanking has stalled for lack of funding and interest .
The science of bio-preservation is still considered an arcane , musty specialty , more akin to taxidermy than medicine .
“ You might have thought that doing the science would be the biggest challenge of a massive undertaking like the Cancer Genome Atlas , ” Compton told me last fall .
“ But acquiring the biospecimens turned out to be the hardest part , bar none .
It ’s the Wild West out there . ”
The first floor of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in Camden , New Jersey , looks less like the Wild West than a bustling spaceport crammed with flying saucers .
Rows of stainless steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen house the most diverse collection of human cells in the world .
The contents of these freezers , kept in sealed Pyrex vials at - 196 degrees Celsius , played key roles in a wide array of 20th - century medical breakthroughs .
The institute was founded in 1953 by Lewis Coriell , a charismatic pediatrician who pioneered methods of growing viruses and human cells in vitro .
By turning test tubes and centrifuges into factories of life , he gave the young Jonas Salk a way to mass - produce polio viruses in the quantities needed to create a vaccine .
Coriell also invented the first sterile air - filtration system for labs and turned a crate of foreskins donated by pediatrician and future surgeon general C. Everett Koop into a medium for growing chicken pox .
The town of Camden has changed a lot since then .
Poet Walt Whitman ’s old cottage , a few blocks away , is a grassy oasis in a flatland of bail - bond agencies and strip malls .
But the shining tanks that Coriell left behind when he died in 2001 have kept a Noah ’s ark of genomic data safe for decades .
The keeper of the ark is Christine Beiswanger , a cell - culturing expert with the patient manner of a middle - school science teacher .
She swells with pride as she says that even if Camden were off the grid for six weeks , her beloved samples would stay frosty because of the institute ’s 11,000 - gallon gravity - fed backup tank of liquid nitrogen .
Portions of Coriell ’s collection have also been seeded in multiple locations , including a site in Wisconsin that bills itself as the world leader in bovine genetics .
“ Bull semen , ” she says .
“ We went out there once .
We heard more than we ever wanted to know about artificial insemination in cows .
But at least we learned that our collection is safe . ”
In addition to human cell lines , Coriell ’s repository also houses tissue , plasma , serum , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Pausing at one of the freezers , Beiswanger pulls on a blue cold - resistant glove and raises the lid .
Fishing with a long hook , she catches a rack of vials and lifts it out .
The nitrogen pool is eerily invisible , having the same refractive index as air .
Clouds of sublimating vapor pour out and vanish halfway to the floor .
Each vial represents the trace of a human life launched into the future in hopes of a cure that will benefit others .
The dozens of tanks lining this room contain cells of diabetic Native Americans , autistic Chinese , bipolar Amish , and a Latino infant who suffered from Moebius syndrome , a rare neurological disorder that causes an inability to smile , frown , or form any other facial expression .
The Coriell Institute is only one of tens of thousands of biobanks in the US .
An exact number is hard to calculate , because they range in size from fridges stocked with tumors for a surgeon ’s personal research to a mammoth collection of tissue samples stored by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at a warehouse in Maryland .

Biobanking is an expensive proposition : Just one cryogenic freezer can suck down $ 2,000 worth of electricity a year .
In the interests of science , it ’s best to archive samples and the data related to them for decades after enthusiasm for the research has faded .
As a result , many bio-repositories are chronically underfunded .
Those in academic labs are typically paid for with money siphoned from grants and departmental expenses .
Larger nonprofit institutions , including Coriell , are kept afloat by year - to - year contracts with federal agencies under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health .
A growing number of firms now market their human commodities directly to scientists online .
Browsing through one of these biobazaars can be surreal for the uninitiated .
Recently , the “ most popular ” cells available from a company called Asterand were fibroblasts removed from the milk ducts of a 45 - year - old African - American woman who died of invasive breast cancer .
The price of a vial containing approximately 1 million of her cells : $ 875 plus shipping .
Though prolific sperm donors can earn a modest living by making regular biobank deposits , tissue donors are not paid , thanks to a 1984 US law designed to prevent organ trafficking .
It ’s technically illegal to sell human tissue at a profit under this statute , but high - volume vendors like Asterand and BioServe finesse this by charging hefty processing and shipping fees .
In the age of molecular medicine , the tissue trade is booming .
Asterand ’s annual revenue soared by 82 percent in 2008 to more than $ 22 million .
Lewis Coriell would not have been surprised that his cell collection in Camden gave birth to a thriving global industry .
After all , he tried to persuade the US government to build a vast storehouse of human cells to support research from coast to coast .
But he might have been taken aback to learn that the crude 19th - century chemistry he and his peers repurposed for bio-preservation is still the state of the art in the 21st century .
Note 1 .
The original version of this story gave the incorrect name for the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology .
Learning how to freeze and thaw human tissue without turning it into mush took scientists a very long time .
One of the first cryo-pioneers was a Catholic priest named Basile Luyet , author of a 1940 book called Life and Death at Low Temperatures .
For decades , he chronicled dozens of gruesome attempts to resurrect monkeys , dogs , cats , and rabbits that had been frozen in their cages or immersed in slushy water until their hearts stopped .
Few of these unfortunate creatures survived the ordeal intact ; their organs were turned to a rank stew by a buildup of salt and ice crystals .
Shortly before his death , the priest reluctantly concluded that “ it would be easier to bring back a dead body than a frozen one . ”
The long - awaited breakthrough was a lucky accident .
In 1947 , a British scientist named Christopher Polge was searching for ways to freeze , store , and revive chicken sperm , a potential boon to farmers who would no longer have to wait until their prize leghorns were in the mood .
Polge tried immersing the fowl gametes in a fructose solution , which did n’t work very well — until one day , mysteriously , it did .
Analysis of the curiously effective solution revealed that its label had somehow been switched .
The bottle actually contained glycerol , not fructose .
Glycerol seemed to be such an effective cryoprotectant that it ’s still employed in biobanks for preserving blood cells and fluids like saliva and urine .
Another decades - old discovery is also still in use — dimethyl sulfoxide , a colorless , odorless solvent derived from wood pulp .
( DMSO is weird stuff : Dip a finger in it and you will pick up a faintly oysterish flavor under your tongue a few minutes later . )
Tissue requires a different preservation method , which relies on two mainstays of Victorian - era labs : formaldehyde and paraffin .
In a typical cancer operation , the surgeon excises a lump of flesh that is suspected to be malignant .
The nurse carries it to the pathology suite , where a sample is mounted on slides so a pathologist can make a diagnosis .
If the patient has signed a consent form , whatever tissue is left over will be shipped to a biobank .
But first , it ’s dipped in a diluted formaldehyde solution called formalin that acts as a fixative , arresting all metabolic processes in the cells .
Then it ’s embedded in paraffin , which prevents oxidation .
Such tried - and - true preservation protocols have endured because , for a long time , they were all that researchers required .
“ Study sizes were small , investigators sourced their samples locally , and they got what they wanted , ” NCI clinical investigator Stephen Hewitt says .
“ There was no need for evolution . ”
If you wanted to freeze and thaw red blood cells , a dash of glycerol would do the trick .
Sperm ?
Use a 5 percent DMSO solution .
Hair follicles , lymphocytes ?
Ditto .
By 1999 , Rand estimated that there were more than 300 million tissue samples stacked up in US biobanks , with 20 million additional specimens coming in every year .
As new items were added to the menu , the classic recipes were repurposed over and over again with minor variations .
Plasma , whole organs , stem cells ?
Check , check , and check .
The industry seemed ready to accommodate any advance in medicine .
When Coriell began stocking his human ark in the early ’ 50s , the role of DNA in heredity was just becoming clear .
By the mid-’90s , doctors were scheming to hijack genes with viruses to cure congenital diseases .
Keeping pace with the state of science for half a century , institutions like Coriell grew into bio-smorgasbords , serving products ranging from kidneys to dental pulp .
But with the sequencing of the complete human genome in 2003 , everything changed .
Our ability to probe the inner workings of cells jumped by many orders of magnitude .
What the gene chip and microarray revealed — which even the trained eye of a pathologist could n’t see — is that the traditional methods of bio-preservation play havoc with genetic material .
Just as the advent of high - throughput DNA sequencing demanded factory - size shipments of tissue , it made many of our ways of harvesting and storing human specimens obsolete .
The trouble starts in the operating room .
The first step in taking out a tumor is clamping off its blood supply .
But cancer does n’t give up so easily .
In 2001 , researchers in Florida discovered that just minutes after a tumor goes offline , its genes start switching on and off as the cells try to adapt to a world without oxygen .
While everyone ’s attention is focused on the patient , those genes are rapidly altering their expression patterns .
As the surgeon prepares to close the incision , the lump of deadly DNA on the back table is still hard at work .
Often the tissue destined for a biobank languishes for a couple of hours at room temperature before it ’s finally dunked in formalin .
In a hectic clinical environment — like Massachusetts General in Boston , where the NCI ’s Compton was director of gastrointestinal pathology — a slice of diseased colon can sit around in a cooler all weekend before being fixed on Monday morning .
NCI investigators have now identified more than 460 genes in colon cancer that switch on or off in just the first hour after the arteries are clamped .
In other words , the tumor that is deposited into a biobank is not really the same one that was removed from the patient .
With an increasing number of crucial treatment decisions based on analysis of that tissue — including which drugs might be lifesaving or life - threatening for a particular patient — unreliable data has the potential to translate into bad medicine .
Another set of problems kicks in during the freezing and thawing process .
In the late ’90s , researcher John G. Baust figured out why some samples that look perfectly preserved after thawing turn black and liquefy on the lab bench a day or two later .
He discovered that the cryoprotective effects of glycerol and DMSO were overrated .
Yes , they minimize structural damage to cells , which was all that was needed when the most powerful tool in the lab was a microscope .
But they do n’t shield the genome from the trauma of a round trip to the subarctic regions of a freezer .
Some cells get so stressed that hours after they thaw , they take themselves out of the gene pool permanently in a cascade of events known as “ programmed cell death . ”
In the past , a certain amount of dying off was considered just a brutal fact of life in the cryozone .
But the work of Baust and others revealed that even cells that do n’t outright perish experience changes in genetic expression during the freeze - thaw cycle .
In fact , by keeping visible cell structures intact , cryoprotectants can lead to overestimating the quality of biospecimens , making them even more likely to corrupt genomic data .
What ’s more , it turns out that formalin causes significant alterations to cellular RNA , the key to decoding the genetic mechanisms of cancer .
And DMSO can have the perverse effect of amplifying a tumor ’s metastatic potential , turning cancer into super cancer at the molecular level .
While news of these discoveries was trickling out in bio-preservation journals , therapeutic medicine was progressing by leaps and bounds .
Many new treatments — such as using stem cells to repair bone marrow stripped out by high - dose chemotherapy and radiation — require banked cells to be thawed and injected into patients immediately .
Because these protocells are so fragile , they ’re often not rinsed before treatment for fear that too many will be lost .
As a result , preservatives end up coursing through the patient ’s bloodstream .
But DMSO can cause nasty side effects , particularly in children , including chills , nausea , kidney failure , and even cardiac arrest .
So patients simply have to bear up under the onslaught of DMSO while trying to survive cancer , chemo , and radiation .
The industry ’s response to these revelations was a series of cautious upgrades .
Adding a dose of enzymatic inhibitors to the preservative mix can reduce unexpected bouts of cell death but does nothing to eliminate DMSO toxicity .
Chilling tissue at a carefully controlled rate immediately after harvesting ( using a technique appropriated from Eskimos in the early 1900s by Clarence Birdseye , father of the frozen - food industry ) reduces the need for toxic antifreeze but requires disruptive changes in the routine of overworked hospital staff .
These incremental solutions are hardly enough to make up for a long period of complacency .
“ We got stuck for about 20 years , ” says Allison Hubel , a cryopreservation expert at the University of Minnesota .
“ People assumed that things like DMSO were one - size - fits - all solutions .
If you have the perception that all the big problems in a field have been solved , there ’s no motivation for funding . ”
Tackling unsolved problems is even harder because biobanks have been lackadaisical about establishing standard operating procedures .
This is largely due to the fact that they have n’t been forced to ; biobanks used for research operate outside the purview of regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration .
Instead , the industry supervises itself , following voluntary advisories issued by groups like the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories .
But only a tiny fraction of US biobanks are members of that organization , which did n’t get around to publishing its first set of guidelines until 2005 .
The CEO of Coriell , geneticist Michael Christman , acknowledges an immediate need for new standards across the industry as it tries to cope with a massive tech upgrade on the research side .
“ Tissue banking in particular has n’t been studied in a systematic way , and acquisition of specimens in the hospital is n’t consistent , ” he says .
“ One surgeon might make sure that a sample is frozen right away , while another calls up the lab and says , ‘ OK , send somebody over now . ’
You might have specimens side by side in a bio-repository that were acquired very differently . ”
Meanwhile , the ascendancy of data - driven science is putting ever greater IT demands on biobanks .
In addition to the massive quantities of information generated by molecular analysis , a properly annotated sample library now requires megabytes of anonymized data about patients ’ medical histories , along with a Web - enabled infrastructure capable of supporting collaborative research projects .
Not surprisingly , many biobanks — with decades of legacy records still sitting in flat files in the basement — are struggling to keep up .
Finally , there are hurdles to providing labs with adequate supplies of cells and tissue that have little to do with biobanks themselves .
Researchers are notoriously loath to share choice specimens , because unlike data , once they ’re used , they ’re gone .
And though early diagnosis has been a lifesaving boon for cancer patients , it has also reduced the size and quantity of tumors available for research .
Only at a gathering of biobankers can you hear someone say wistfully , “ The days of huge tumors are over . ”
Carolyn Compton looks a little harried and jet - lagged this morning , which is understandable .
The NCI ’s bio-repository chief has come straight off a plane from Beijing to a biobanking conference in Philadelphia and is due back in DC after lunch .
But as the trim 62 - year - old steps up to the podium to offer a tart assessment of the state of the industry , her wit and energy return .
“ We now have the technical ability to get the wrong answers with unprecedented speed , ” she says .
“ If we put the wrong stuff into the front end of our analytical pipeline , we will not only lose the war on cancer , we ’ll pollute the scientific literature with incorrect data that will take us a long time to sort out .
This is a crisis that requires disruptive innovation . ”
The biobankers in the room hang on every word because she is one of their own .
Before joining the NCI in 2005 , she was a pathologist and biobank manager .
Now , with millions of dollars in federal incentives at her disposal , Compton is ideally situated to bring order to the Wild West .
For decades , she was content simply to practice medicine and take care of patients .
She taught at Harvard and McGill universities while running bio-repositories for major hospitals like Shriners and Mass General .
A former go - go dancer for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles , she also earned a following in local gyms , teaching aerobics to housewives who had no idea that the diminutive blonde funking out at the front of the room spent the rest of her day scrutinizing tumors .
After a 2002 conference where she heard some of the top US researchers and government officials admit that the war on cancer had stalled out , she quit academia .
“ The consensus in the room was that a shortage of high - quality biosamples was the number one roadblock to a cure , ” she says .
“ This hit me like a revelation .
I realized that seeing patients and doing my own research could n’t possibly be as important as removing this roadblock . ”
During the conference , she met with NCI deputy director Barker , who later created the Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research specifically to induce Compton to come to Bethesda .
One of her first major achievements was to put the cancer atlas back on track .
Compton ’s team scoured hospitals , community and academic cancer centers , patient advocacy groups , surgical societies , and tissue archives worldwide for samples worthy of molecular analysis .
This three - year effort finally paid off last winter , when the institute made the genetic source code of more than 300 specimens of brain and ovarian cancer available to researchers .
At least 20 more tumor types will be sequenced in the next two years , with the results available free online .
Recently , the NCI announced that it has identified four new subtypes of glioblastoma .
In a stroke of luck , drugs currently in clinical trials for other forms of cancer target the mutations in these tumors as well .
If the trials go well , the first treatments for a disease long considered a death sentence could already be halfway to market .
Down the road from NCI headquarters , the centerpiece of Compton ’s plan to reboot the industry is taking shape .
Here , by the end of the year , she will launch caHUB , the command center of a network designed to supply cancer labs with genomics - grade tumors and other biospecimens in industrial quantities .
Jump - started by a $ 60 million stimulus grant , the hub will bring together pathologists , oncologists , sample providers , preservation specialists , patient advocates , ethicists , and computing experts with the common goal of dragging biobanks into the 21st century .
There will be no shiny domes in caHUB ’s headquarters .
Storage will be outsourced to vendors that follow the NCI ’s best - practice guidelines , formulated after years of probing for weak links in the so - called cold chain .
Some of Compton ’s ideas seem basic .
Most biobanks now evaluate the quality of a sample for the first time when it ’s about to be shipped to a researcher .
Gauging the quality of samples when they ’re logged into the archive instead will reduce unpleasant surprises later .
Compton has made clear to biobank managers that if you want the institute ’s funding in the new era , you will have to play by its rules .
The reforms that will be tougher to execute require changes in the mindset of surgeons , pathologists , and hospital staff .
“ Fixing this will require a new level of awareness that the tissue in the bucket is now one of the most important parts of the patient , ” Compton says , “ because analysis of that tissue will determine all treatment decisions downstream . ”
One vendor that Compton is likely to tap for caHUB is a German startup called Indivumed , which has built a business based on that way of thinking .
The brainchild of a ruddy Hamburg oncologist named Hartmut Juhl , the company offers biobanking and genomics analysis at 10 hospitals in the US and Europe .
To guarantee the integrity of its molecular data , Indivumed assigns each patient a nurse who ensures that no more than 12 minutes elapse before a sample is fixed or frozen .
The nurse also keeps meticulous records of every aspect of the process ( “ all very German , ” Juhl says ) , because even the patient ’s time under anesthesia affects the results of the analysis .
Boutique biobanking like this does n’t come cheap , but it ’s paid for by companies like Pfizer and Sanofi - Aventis in exchange for tissue and data that help them develop new products .
Obviously , not every sample in caHUB can come equipped with its own German nurse .
But the NCI ’s guidelines are serving as a new gold standard for the biobanking industry as a whole .
Compton ’s campaign is also lending momentum to grassroots reform efforts far from the centers of power in Washington .
Some of these are aimed at addressing problems that NCI guidelines can’t solve , such as the need to move past glycerol and invent a new breed of cryopreservative agents optimized for genomics and cell - based medicine .
This year , Hubel and her colleagues at the University of Minnesota launched a think tank called the Biopreservation Core Resource , dedicated to developing new ways of storing cells and tissue .
Hubel has patented a DMSO - free method of preserving fragile cells intended for treatments that require direct infusion into patients .
“ Sometimes even best practices are n’t good enough , ” Hubel says .
“ We ’re here to push the envelope . ”
The stakes are high , as personalized medicine is finally starting to make good on its hype .
In March , researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced that they ’re developing blood tests for cancer based on mutations in an individual ’s mitochondrial DNA .
Drug companies are embracing genetic testing as a way to revive potential blockbuster medications that were taken off the market because they triggered side effects in volunteers with rare genetic vulnerabilities .
Overall , the US market for personalized tests and treatments is expected to double by 2015 .
Cancer is only one continent in the atlas of human misery .
Everyday killers like diabetes and hypertension may someday yield to the diagnostic power of microRNA and other molecules we do n’t yet know how to look for .
But getting to that future will require thawing out an industry still frozen in the past .

NSW Labor MP David Campbell has resigned as the state 's Minister for Transport and Roads .
Mr Campbell has been accused of using a taxpayer funded government car to visit a gay sex club in the state Premier 's eastern suburbs electorate .
According to Seven , Mr Campbell visited the gay club , Ken's at Kensington on Anzac Parade , Tuesday night in Premier Kristina Keneally 's electorate of Heffron for two hours .
The station then showed footage of a man who appeared to be Mr Campbell , wearing a white business shirt and dark trousers but no jacket .
The man emerged from a doorway into a street and a set of ascending stairs could be seen clearly behind him .
The man walks along the ill - lit street , passes a corrugated iron fence before emerging from the darkness to get into a white Holden sedan .
Comment is being sought from Ms Keneally .
Mr Campbell resigned as the state 's Minister for Transport and Roads , citing personal reasons .
" I have resigned as minister for Transport and Roads for personal reasons , not for any reasons relating to my ministerial duties , '' he said in a statement today .
" I apologise to my wife , family , colleagues , staff and the community for letting them down .
" This will be a very difficult time for my family and friends and I ask for their privacy to be respected . "
Mr Campbell said he would remain in Parliament as the member for Keira , on the state 's south coast .
" I am incredibly proud of my achievements while serving as minister for Transport , Roads , Police , Small Business , the Illawarra , Regional Development and Water Utilities , " Mr Campbell said in the brief statement .
A spokesman for Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell said the Opposition would not be commenting on Mr Campbell 's resignation .
Bottomless Amateur Brookes Summer Bush

Last photos we did before I shaved for summer .
Gotta sample of what my " summer bush " is this year !
Origen was an ex post facto heretic , anathematised by the second council of Constantinople in 553 , some three centuries after his death .
Alexandria , Origen 's birthplace , was the intellectual center of the Hellenistic world and a hotbed of speculative Platonic philosophy .
In the first century Philo of Alexandria had , through his biblical exegesis , attempted to fuse Platonism and Judaism .
Origen , with greater success , sought to merge Christianity with Greek philosophy .
It was however Origen 's Platonism that did him in .
Following Plato , he subscribed to the doctrine of pre-existent souls , which was not acceptable according to the orthodox industry standard that was later established .
On Origen 's account , God 's first creation , before time , was a collectivity of souls .
Of these , all but one , the human soul of Christ , fell away .
In the end , however , all humans and every spirit , even the devil , would be saved , returning to a state of " pure mind " .
Reading this one asks : where is it all coming from – the hierarchy of incorporeal , conscious beings , the precosmic fall , the apotheosis of all souls at the end of time ?
There is no argument for this grand cosmological story .
The only argument is in the elaboration of metaphysical machinery through which it is articulated .
But one could say the same for other Hellenistic philosophers , including Origen 's contemporary Plotinus – a fellow student of the ur - Neoplatonist Ammonias Saccus .
Origen was on the cutting edge of Hellenistic philosophy , characterised by speculative metaphysics , mysticism and plain flakiness .
Origen was also on the cutting edge of biblical scholarship as the first Christian theologian to learn Hebrew in order to read the Hebrew Bible .
Like Philo , Origen read scripture allegorically .
The Bible was divinely inspired , he held , but since so many of the stories in the Bible were clearly false and even ridiculous , God 's intention must have been that they not be taken literally .
" What intelligent person " , Origen asked , " can imagine that there was a first " day " , then a second and a third " day " – evening and morning – without the sun , the moon , and the stars …
Who is foolish enough to believe that , like a human gardener , God planted a garden in Eden … I cannot imagine that anyone will doubt that these details point symbolically to spiritual meanings , by using an historical narrative which did not literally happen . "
Origen 's theology was always controversial , but it has always been controversial whether Origen should be regarded as a heretic .
Impeccably orthodox theologians admired him .
Saints Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus collected his works as the Philocalia of Origen and promulgated them ;
St Jerome translated over 80 of his sermons for the edification of western readers deficient in Greek .
During his lifetime , Origen 's orthodoxy was never questioned and even later the chief bone of contention was his doctrine of the pre-existence of souls – including the human soul of Christ .
His fanciful interpretations of the Bible were no worry , biblical literalism being a modern invention .
Even his doctrine of universal salvation was not clearly unacceptable .
The emperor Justinian , an avid amateur theologian keen on eternal damnation , pressed the second council of Constantinople to condemn this doctrine , but the bishops did not ratify his proposal : St Clement of Alexandria and St Gregory of Nyssa , both known universalists , survived with their sanctity intact .
It 's hard to imagine what Origen , or his orthodox contemporaries , would make of contemporary Christianity .
I suspect they would find the conservative evangelical variety unintelligible and would even be puzzled by " mainline " Christianity .
Why , they 'd wonder , were these third millennium Christians so utterly indifferent to vital metaphysical questions ?
Why did they care about the historical accuracy of biblical narratives ?
Why were they so interested in stories about the human Jesus and so little concerned about the metaphysics of the logos , which became incarnate ?
Why was their Christianity so simplistic , prosaic , anti-intellectual and deadly dull ?
I got religion as an undergraduate , reading church history and the Greek fathers of the church .
I was taken by the romance of late antiquity in the east , fantasising a world where metaphysics and mysticism were popular pastimes , where , as Gregory of Nyssa reports , shopkeepers and laborers argued fine points of theology in the streets .
If I had been brought up with the puerile , prosaic religion of Sunday school Jesus - stories , church rummage sales , happy - clappy services and self - help programs , dull sentimentalities and dull moralism – I would never have given Christianity a shake .
At about 10:40 a.m. that day , a 36 - year - old man was riding a bicycle on Limestone Road ( Route 7 ) near Ocheltree Lane when he felt a sudden pain and saw a four - inch blow dart buried several inches into his right thigh , police said .
The injury was treated by a physician .

The suit could hit as early as tomorrow , according to The Hollywood Reporter , as Voltage teams up with the US Copyright Group to target those who downloaded the Oscar - winning film without paying .
And they 've got the ISPs ( mostly ) on their side :
After filing the lawsuits , the plaintiffs must subpoena ISP records in an effort to match IP addresses with illicit behavior on BitTorrent .
According to lawyers at Dunlap 's firm , 75 percent of ISPs have cooperated fully .
Those that have resisted are mostly doing so , they say , because of the amount of work involved in handing over thousands of names .

This obviously is n't the first lawsuit of its kind — just the biggest .
But here 's how it 'll play out : once the ISPs hand over your info , you 'll be sent a settlement offer .
Do n't want to settle ?
You 'll be sent another offer .
Still pass ?
That 's when you get full - on sued .
And attempts to quash similar subpoenas have so far been unsuccessful :
Of the some 50,000 individuals who have been sued thus far , only three have tried to quash the subpoena .
In one instance , a Georgia man tried to invoke the state 's shield law protecting journalists from having to disclose their sources .
The judge denied the motion .
In another instance , a woman successfully got a court to throw out the subpoena because her IP address was n't listed in the original complaint .
Unfortunately for her , the complaint was then amended .

Of course , chasing down BitTorrent users is n't going to end piracy .

The 2010 NHL Entry Draft is quickly approaching , and , thus far , the Flames ' first pick will be in the third round , 64th overall .
I 've decided to profile a few players whom the Flames could potentially select come June 25th - 26th .
Today 's player is Kelowna Rockets winger Brett Bulmer .
Ranked 65th by Central Scouting in their final rankings , he moved up 99 (! ) spots from his mid-term ranking of 164th overall .
Junior Team : Kelowna Rockets
Position : LW
Height : 6'3 "
Weight : 175lbs .
At 18 years old , this past season was just Bulmer 's first with the WHL's Kelowna Rockets .
In 65 games , he scored thirteen goals ( 7ES , 6PP ) and added twenty - seven assists for forty points , 95 PIMS , and a minus - 7 rating on a Rockets squad that finished in sixth place in the WHL's Western Conference with a record of 35 - 31 - 6 and 76 points .
In twelve playoff games , Bulmer scored 3 - 2 - 5 and was +1 with 6 PIMS .
Described as a strong winger who plays an up - tempo , physical style of game , Bulmer is particularly strong in the corners and along the boards , and is excellent at protecting the puck .
His improved speed and skating combined with his willingness to compete in the " dirty areas " of the ice point to a potential future as a power forward likened to the Avs ' Chris Stewart , and perhaps explains why his draft stock has risen so dramatically in the past few months .
In terms of weaknesses , Bulmer still lacks strength comparable to his size .
His defensive game is lax at times , and while his hands are considered " quick , " his general hockey sense -- especially when it comes to stick - handling and receiving passes -- still needs some work , but that should some with age and experience .
The fact that Bulmer has played only one season of Major Junior is both a weakness and a strength .
It classifies as a weakness because his game is still quite raw , so any team that drafts him has to acknowledge the risk of him turning out to be a " bust , " and a strength because he has the potential to develop according to the needs of the team that drafts him .
As such , it 's questionable whether or not he'd really be the right fit for the Flames .
While Bulmer definitely has a fair bit of offensive upside , the organization already has a number of " work in progress " prospects in their system .
They could potentially do better , but could almost certainly do worse as well .
Supreme Court Holds 2nd Amendment Applies To The States
The Supreme Court resolved a 100 + year old Constitutional ambiguity today , but the legal issues surrounding gun control remain as murky as ever .
Doug Mataconis · · 13 comments
In a 5 - 4 ruling , the Supreme Court cleared up a 124 year - old ambiguity and ruled that the 2nd Amendment does in fact apply to state and local laws regulating gun ownership and possession :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The Supreme Court held Monday that the Constitution ’s Second Amendment restrains government ’s ability to significantly limit “ the right to keep and bear arms , ” advancing a recent trend by the John Roberts - led bench to embrace gun rights .
By a narrow , 5 - 4 vote , the justices signaled , however , that less severe restrictions could survive legal challenges .
Writing for the court in a case involving restrictive laws in Chicago and one of its suburbs , Justice Samuel Alito said that the Second Amendment right “ applies equally to the federal government and the states . ”
The court was split along familiar ideological lines , with five conservative - moderate justices in favor of gun rights and four liberals opposed .
Chief Justice Roberts voted with the majority .
(…)
Monday ’s decision did not explicitly strike down the Chicago area laws , ordering a federal appeals court to reconsider its ruling .
But it left little doubt that they would eventually fall .
Still , Alito noted that the declaration that the Second Amendment is fully binding on states and cities “ limits ( but by no means eliminates ) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values . ”
This decision essentially overturns an 1886 decision in Presser v. Illinois where the Court held that the 2nd Amendment applied only to the Federal Government .
However , since this case was decided before the Court began applying other provisions of the Bill of Rights against the states through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment , it was unclear how a decision that held that the 2nd Amendment was alone in not being incorporated could possibly be good law .
Today , the Court affirmed that it was not and that the individual right to keep and bear arms defined in District of Columbia v. Heller applies to the states .
Beyond that , though , there ’s plenty of ambiguity .
The Court did not rule today that Chicago ’s gun ban was unconstitutional .
Instead , it remanded the case back to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals for a determination on that issue .
Presumably , though , the Court of Appeals will now be bound to apply the Heller standards to the Chicago law , meaning that it ’s highly unlikely that the law can withstand Constitutional scrutiny .
The one thing Heller made clear , though , is that there is very little agreement on the Court about what constitutes a violation of the 2nd Amendment beyond the outright bans reflected in the D.C. and Chicago laws .
It will be left to other cases and others courts to decide what Heller and McDonald mean for less restrictive gun control laws , or registration schemes that exist mostly to make it difficult to own firearms .
As I noted more than two years ago while wrapping up the oral argument in Heller , this is just the beginning of a whole new round of Constitutional jurisprudence .

McDonald v. City Of Chicago
By David BrownIt was n't the voltage but the amps this young Philllies fan felt on Monday night in Philadelphia .
In the eighth inning of a Phillies - Cardinals game , a 17 - year - old male hopped a fence at Citizens Bank Park .
He fled security for a few seconds until a Philadelphia police officer fired a Taser gun at the boy from about 15 - feet away , dropping him on the spot in left - center field .
The Philadelphia Inquirer spoke to this young man 's dad on Tuesday morning and reports that the kid actually called his father to ask for permission before running on the field .
The dad told him it was n't the best of ideas — you think ? — but the future Penn State student went ahead and did it anyway .
He 's being charged as a juvenile for resisting arrest , disorderly conduct and defiant trespass .
" He was n't drinking .
He was not on drugs , " the father said .
The Philadelphia police commissioner , meanwhile , is publicly supporting the officer 's actions .
But the Phillies say they want to talk about whether or not such force is necessary for future trespassers .
At 12.20 am and 20 seconds in Utah today Ronnie Lee Gardner became the first American in 14 years to be put to death by firing squad , his heart ripped to pieces by bullets blasted from the rifles of five expert marksmen hidden behind a brick wall .
The state attorney , Mark Shurtleff , tweeted the news .
" I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner 's execution , " he wrote , adding : " May God grant him the mercy he denied his victims . "
Then , with relatives of the condemned man 's victims looking on behind bullet - proof glass , he became only the third person to die by firing squad in the US since 1977 .
All three took place in this western state , which has long prided itself on its passionate embrace of the gun .
Utah is the only state in the US other than Oklahoma that lists the firing squad as a possible means of execution , offering condemned men the choice between that and the lethal injection .
In April , Gardner chose to die by the gun , telling a judge : " I would like the firing squad , please . "
The manner of the execution shocked many across America , with critics claiming it was a throwback to the brutal blood - begets - blood mentality of the frontier era .
Demonstrations were held on the steps of the Utah State Capitol building in central Salt Lake City and a prayer vigil was held at the Catholic cathedral .
Gardner ate his last meal of steak , lobster tail , apple pie , vanilla ice cream and 7UP soda on Tuesday , choosing to fast until his death .
The prisoner 's extended family of about 20 brothers , sisters , daughters and grandchildren were assembled outside the prison , having strung up dozens of coloured balloons , which they released as soon as news came through of Gardner 's death , as a symbol of his soul going up to heaven .
His daughter Brandie told the Guardian that Gardner explained to her why he opted for the firing squad .
" He told me : ' I lived by the gun , I murdered with a gun , so I will die by the gun ' . "
Brandie , 33 , said she was strongly opposed to the death penalty , even though Gardner approved of it .
" I oppose it not because of my dad but because there are 10 commandments and one says thou shalt not kill . "
The family of one of the victims – Nick Kirk , who was shot in the stomach as Gardner tried to escape from a courthouse and died 10 years later – were also outside the prison , demonstrating their support for his execution .
" You do n't want to wish somebody dead , " said Kirk 's daughter Barb Webb .
" But our family wants this finished – we need to heal . "
Kirk 's wife , BelDean , and granddaughter Jamie were among 25 people who watched the execution from two witness rooms protected from the risk of ricochet by the bullet - proof glass .
The shooting was carried out in a specially designed execution chamber inside Utah state prison , a simple room measuring 6 metres by 7 metres ( 20 ft by 24ft ) .
Gardner was taken into the chamber shortly after midnight ( 7 am BST ) , having spent his final hours sleeping , watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films and reading the thriller Divine Justice .
He was strapped to a black chair with a metal tray placed beneath it to collect his blood , had a hood placed over his head , and a white circular target pinned to his chest to mark his heart – the precise location of which had been identified earlier by a prison doctor .
Then five local police officers , chosen for their skills as marksmen and kept anonymous by law to minimise the risk of reprisals , were ushered into the chamber and lined up behind a brick wall at the other end of the room about 7.5 metres away .
They were handed .30 - calibre rifles , the muzzles of which they inserted through a gap in the wall to point at the condemned man .
Four of the rifles were loaded with a single live bullet .
The fifth contained an " ineffective " round – which unlike a blank gives the same recoil as a live round ; that way none of the five executioners know whether they delivered the fatal shot , thus lessening their psychological burden .
Gardner never disputed his guilt or sought to minimise the terrible acts he had committed .
In 1980 he was convicted of robbery and sent to Utah state prison , where his life would end 30 years later .
In 1984 he escaped , and on 9 October , high on cocaine , he shot and killed a barman , Melvyn Otterstrom , at Salt Lake City 's Cheers Tavern .
On trial for that murder , he made another escape attempt on 2 April 1985 , arranging for a gun to be slipped to him by a female accomplice as he was being brought to Salt Lake City 's central courthouse .
In the melee , he shot a lawyer called Michael Burdell in the right eye .
Burdell died in hospital 45 minutes later .
Burdell 's family has consistently opposed the execution of Gardner .
His niece , Donna Taylor , speaking to the Guardian outside the prison , said her uncle had always been against the death penalty .
" He just did n't like the idea of killing anybody .
He would n't have wanted this . "
From Tyler Durden over at Zero Hedge , this absolutely riveting post :
Who needs a wartime nuclear exchange when you have peaceful countries nuking the gamma rays out of their own sovereign territories - now that the environmental theme is rather popular , the following video by Isao Hashimoto shows all the nuclear " tests " conducted by the world in the period between 1945 and 1998 .
Based on public data , the world 's peaceful countries have already nuked themselves at least 2,054 times , with the US nuking the state of Nevada and its immediate neighbors about one thousand times .
And keep in mind - the fallout does not just miraculously " disappear . "
Feel free to consider that next time you look at bargain properties on the strip .
Anyway , as Idealist asks , " How would your life be different if you were taught in school a small nuclear war already took place ? "
One thing is certain - Congress would be stunned and appalled , and the disgraced CEO of Nukes R Us , Inc. , who previously gave trillions in campaign contributions to every Congressional critter , would be facing a very unpleasant and theatrically televised day .

( CNN ) --
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has already claimed many victims -- from pelicans to oyster beds and precious marshland .
But there may be one more : a species only just recently discovered .
Scientifically known as halieutichthys aculeatus , it is not a thing of beauty .
But it lives an anonymous sort of existence on the seabed of the Gulf , some 1,500 feet below the waves and -- like all marine life in the gulf -- plays its role in the food chain .
Its more digestible name is the Louisiana pancake batfish .
And if oil stays deep under water , the gulf could lose it before it 's even officially recognized as a species .
While scientists are uncertain what the long - range effects of the massive spill will be on the gulf 's delicate balance of life and death and its complex food chain , the little - known Louisiana pancake batfish is a case in point of one species whose very existence is in that balance .
Dr. Prosanta Chakrabarty , an ichthyologist -- otherwise known as a fish biologist -- and assistant professor at Louisiana State University , found himself face - to - face with the little fish during a deep - sea trawl in the gulf with the university last fall .
" We were lucky to get four or five specimen , " Chakrabarty said .
" The variation we found was enough for me to be convinced that there was something new . "
With a flat , round body resembling a pancake , as its name suggests , this species of batfish does n't really look like a fish .
" If you make an oval between your thumb and forefinger , they 're about that big .
Their mouths and bulbous eyes are right in the front of their heads .
You can't even see their faces if you look from above , " Chakrabarty said .
Not only does it look odd ; it also moves in mysterious ways .
The Louisiana pancake batfish uses its foot - like fins , complete with an elbow , to push off the sea floor .
Flapping its tail , it swiftly hops across the sand .
" They 're not like a flounder ; they are much more mobile , more like a pancake with feet .
They 're bizarre for what they look like and how they behave , " Chakrabarty said .
Pancake batfish spend most of their days resting on the sandy bottom of the gulf .
Chakrabarty says it 's impossible to tell how many of them are in existence .
" During my trawl with LSU , we caught probably 100,000 fish and three of them were pancake batfish .
It 's a hard thing to guess from that what their population is , but since they 're rare in museums , they 're probably rare in the wild , " Chakrabarty said .
And although it 's not known exactly where they link into the food chain , he said tuna and marlin from the gulf have been found with Louisiana pancake batfish in their stomachs .
Even a possibility that one small species could disappear because of waters fouled by oil has scientists pondering what such an event would mean long - term for the gulf , and even beyond the gulf 's waters .
" All of life on earth is a big book .
All the extinct things are pages that are torn out of that book that muddle our history , " Chakrabarty said .
He said what is most upsetting to him is that after 200 years of scientific study in the gulf , he estimates 98 percent of its marine life remains unknown .
And with the United States ' worst - ever environmental disaster still ongoing , could become unknown forever .
" We know about commercial fish and shrimp .
But there are 1,500 meters of question mark between the well head and the surface about the animal life and we really know very , very little .
" We 're making a trade - off between two habitats and putting the more fragile one at risk .
If we lose the [ pancake batfish ] , we 're losing a big part of evolutionary history , " Chakrabarty said .
Because it lives in the deep , the pancake batfish is not threatened by tar balls or the surface sheen of oil -- but by undersea oil plumes identified by researchers from the University of South Florida .
On June 8 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that tests done by the University 's researchers proved the existence of subsurface oil clusters .
BP continues to dispute the extent of the plumes .
But Chakrabarty says this subspecies of batfish could be wiped out even if it does n't directly encounter oil .
It lives on small invertebrates that are the foundation for the entire marine food chain in the gulf .
And now it may be at risk of either losing its only source of food or ingesting an oil - coated dinner .
Chakrabarty says that one ray of hope for the newly discovered species are the oil - consuming bacteria that thrive on crude oil .
They use enzymes to metabolize the oil into two products ; new microorganisms and carbon dioxide .
Essentially , it is as if they are sucking the oil out of the water .
Dr. Samantha Joye , a professor at the University of Georgia , recently returned from an expedition in the gulf to research the undersea plumes .
While she acknowledged that the bacteria are certainly a good option for extracting oil from the water , she said they might not get the chance to do so .
" At present , oxygen concentrations exceed 2 mg / L ( two milligrams per liter ) but if concentrations drop below that , it would spell problems for any oxygen - requiring organisms , " Joye wrote in a blog .
And the oil - munching bacteria require oxygen to metabolize the oil .
The bacteria also exist in much higher quantities at the surface of the gulf where there is sunlight and warmth .
Where this pancake batfish lives , at the very bottom , there are neither .
" Less than one percent of the microbial community in the gulf lives in the deep sea , " Chakrabarty says .
" It is so cold down there , one to two degrees Celsius , that they will move much more slowly to break down those micro-droplets of oil . "
He is currently working on the original description of the Louisiana pancake batfish for the Journal of Fish Biology and says it should be published by August .
By the time it reaches an audience , though , the entry may not describe a species that is , but a species that was .
Update : Obama promises criminal probe into Deepwater Horizon disaster
Calling for a “ full and vigorous accounting ” of the facts , President Obama demanded Tuesday that the ongoing probe into the Deepwater Horizon disaster keep open to the possibility of criminal charges .
“ They have my full support to follow the facts wherever they may lead , without fear or favor , ” he told press gathered in the White House Rose Garden , according to published reports .

“ We have an obligation to determine what went wrong , ” he said , according to The New York Times .
Pledging to strengthen laws and reform regulatory measures to prevent another similar disaster from occurring , Obama vowed : “ If our laws were broken , leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region . ”
“ Only then can we be assured that deep - water drilling can take place safely , ” the president added , according to The Washington Post .
“ Only then can we accept further development of these resources as we transition to a clean energy economy .
Only then can we be confident that we ’ve done what ’s necessary to prevent history from repeating itself . ”
Attorney General Eric
Holder confirmed earlier in the day that criminal and civil investigations had been progressing , but did not state the parties under closest scrutiny .

The Associated Press reports :
Attorney General Eric
Holder says federal authorities have opened criminal and civil investigations into the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill .
Holder would not specify Tuesday which companies or individuals might be the targets of the probe .
He says federal clean air and pollution laws give him the power to open the investigations .
The United States has launched both a civil and criminal investigation into the massive oil spill gushing out of a BP - leased rig , US Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday .

“ We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who has violated the law , ” Holder told reporters .
“ We will not rest until justice is done . ”
Holder said the criminal probe began “ some weeks ago ” but declined to elaborate on what kind of charges could be laid .

The Hollywood couple were not present for the hearing in London 's High Court
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have accepted an undisclosed sum in settlement of their privacy claim against the News of the World .
The stars sued the newspaper in January over a story saying they would separate and had agreed custody arrangements .
Appearing in London 's High Court , the couple 's lawyer said that News Group Newspapers now accepted the allegations were " false and intrusive " .
The couple were not present for Thursday 's hearing .
The actors ' action , for misuse of private information and breach of the 1998 Data Protection Act , was concerned with a front page story dated 24 January , which had the headline " Pitts all over " .
The article alleged that Jolie and / or Pitt had visited a divorce lawyer in December 2009 , and that the couple had reached an agreement regarding the division of their assets .
But a statement from Schillings Lawyers noted that Sorrell Trope , identified by some publications as the divorce lawyer in question , had never met the couple .
" I have never met ... your clients or had any involvement with either of them .
The foregoing is true with respect to all other members of this firm , " said Trope in a letter quoted in the statement .
In court on Thursday morning , lawyer Keith Schilling said the News of the World , which argued that it had acted in good faith , had now agreed to publish an apology .
It will also pay Pitt and Jolie 's costs and damages , which they intend to donate to their charity , the Jolie - Pitt Foundation .
The newspaper confirmed that a settlement had been reached , but declined to comment further .
June 28 , 2010
DOZENS OF Detroit paramedics protested June 25 because they want to be able to come to people 's assistance quickly in case of an emergency -- and proposed budget cuts would make that impossible .
Raising signs that read " Save us so we can save you , " the paramedics withstood the 90 - degree heat in order to raise awareness of budget cuts about to take place that will affect the safety of Detroit residents , as well as anyone who happens to pass through .
Alarmingly , 75 percent of the demonstrators had worked all night , their shifts having only ended at 7 a.m.-- and they would be returning to another full night on the job at 7 p.m .
" That 's how big of an issue this is , " said Tim Goodman , a paramedic of 15 years .
Paramedics are represented by the Detroit Emergency Medical Services Association , a union that formed last year to replace a union local affiliated with the Boilermakers ' union .
The new union faces a major challenge .
Detroit Fire Commissioner James
Mack plans to cut 75 emergency medical technician ( EMT ) and paramedic positions from the Detroit Fire Department 's Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) Division as well as cut 33 active members .
That cutback would leave only 12 ambulances on duty to cover the entire city of Detroit .
As it stands , the city has only 24 ambulances available at any time -- a number that paramedics say is completely inadequate .
EMS workers on the picket line in Detroit in a struggle for jobs ( Sarah Levy | SW )
" Some people are actually dying , " said Kent Hammer , one of the protesting paramedics .
" This ca n't go on . "
Hammer explained that the national standard for response time is four minutes -- the time it takes for an untreated brain injury to leave permanent damage .
" Our response time is already over 10 minutes , " he said .
" And that 's [ before the cuts ] with 24 ambulances . "
Detroit is larger geographically than the city of Chicago , although it is less populated .
Chicago runs 62 paramedics at any given time -- almost six times more than Detroit will be left with if the fire commissioner gets his way .
One of the paramedics said that he has had to drive more than 20 miles to get to a call , and that those in need are often forced to wait for over an hour .
There have already been many cuts that have hindered the ability of workers to respond to emergencies .
Recently , five advanced life support units were reduced to basic units , making them less effective .
The basic units include stretchers to transport people , but they are n't equipped with materials to actually treat them .
Goodman added that Detroit also lacks a first - response system that , in most cities , allows the fire department to come to the scene of an emergency before the ambulance can get there .
" Sometimes calls are backed up for four hours , and we 're left showing up hours after calls , " said Hammer .
" We 've even had to take other forms of transportation . "
THE PROPOSED ambulance cuts have shocked a city that has become numb to the harsh budget cuts driven by the economic crisis .
Even police driving by the demonstration enthusiastically honked and shouted in support of the protesters -- not a typical cops ' reaction to street protests .
" The cops are in support of us because every time they call for us , we 're not there , " said Jim Atkinson , a paramedic of 14 years .
" Even when we had 24 ambulances , there was one case -- that was n't out of the ordinary -- where there was a man in critical condition with a spinal cord injury only four blocks away from Medic 17's quarters , " he continued .
" Even four blocks away , we did n't have anyone available , so the police had to put the man in their car [ without any proper medical treatment or handling ] .
" Because the man was n't handled properly , his spinal cord was permanently damaged .
Now he 'll never be able to walk again .
If we had been able to reach him , we could have handled him correctly , and he could have been saved . "
While a particularly ugly example , the proposed EMS cuts in Detroit reflect a budget crisis that is hitting states and cities across the nation , affecting everything from education to affordable housing .
At the same time , corporations and bankers who benefited from government bailouts continue to rake in obscene profits and bonuses .
These upside - down priorities were clearly a source of anger among the protesters .
" Lots of administration could be cut , as well as other things that are n't necessary , " said Hammer .
" But instead , they 're cutting the things that are essential . "
According to Goodman , the mayor put out a memo proposing cuts in administration as a way to balance the city 's budget .
Goodman said that there are 19 various administrative chiefs on duty at any time , who are paid lavishly but do n't actually do anything tangible for the citizens of Detroit .
Cutting spending on those positions could keep vital services like the EMS operating .
Instead , Detroit Fire Commissioner James
Mack -- who is in the position to make the final decision on the issue -- has disregarded the mayor 's proposal and is moving to cut the most necessary positions almost by half starting July 1 .
Although both the City Council and Mayor Dave Bing say they are opposed to the EMS cuts , neither has done anything to stand up to Mack .
" We think there 's a deliberate misinformation campaign regarding where they want the cuts to come from , " said paramedic Jesse Rangel .
" The council proposed the cuts to areas that were not essential [ but that 's not what the fire commissioner is trying to do ] . "
Rangel said he thinks the Detroit City Council is placing too much trust in the fire administration , and that in return , it is deliberately misleading the city administration .
Hence , the paramedics took it upon themselves to profile the issue to the community and media .
Rangel said the paramedic union has given presentations to various religious groups in the city as well as other community groups .
" People do n't have any clue of how bad things are , " he said .
It 's hard to imagine how things could get much worse .
Besides resulting in unnecessary deaths and forcing paramedics to work insanely long hours , the cuts make it so that any time off from work is emotionally burdened with the knowledge that people are dying because not enough EMTs are on call to save them .
" The moral of the story is , when you 're in town , be careful , " said Rangel .
There is another moral to be gotten out of the story of the EMS cuts in Detroit :
As long as profit is the driving force of society and carries the most weight in deciding what is necessary for a community , the lives of regular people will be disregarded .
It 's one of the weirdest political ads we 've seen this year : " Hot Air : The Movie . "
It shows an animated Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , at a committee hearing in Congress .
Her head starts expanding and expanding until it floats off into air , pulling Boxer from her chair and bursting through the Capitol dome .
Then Boxer turns into a large blimp with loudspeakers on top and TV screens around the bottom , floating over the California landscape , broadcasting inanities .
( No , we 're not making this up .
See the ad for yourself . )
A creepily cheerful narrator says : " Soon her elitist self - image grew so that it overwhelmed the capital and drifted west ... westward , to tell us all how to live our lives ... "
At seven and half minutes , the video runs too long to be a TV ad and is clearly aimed at an online audience .
At about the halfway mark ( after the senator - blimp has floated over what appears to be the L.A. skyline ) , the ad introduces Republican Carly Fiorina as a better alternative and a " successful leader . "
We decided to check one of the ad's more concrete criticisms of Boxer :
That she 's " passed only three bills in 18 years " into law .
" One named a local courthouse .
One named part of a river -- in Virginia .
And the third brought California some money to retrofit bridges .
Three bills , " the narrator said .
Following our standard practice , we contacted the Fiorina campaign for back - up .
They told us they were counting only bills passed into law where Boxer was listed as the primary sponsor .
But they also told us since the ad was made , they ran across two other bills , so the actual number they found was five .
They contrasted this unfavorably with Sen. Dianne Feinstein , who they said was the primary sponsor on 14 bills that became law .
Of Boxer 's legislation , the ad mentions a 1994 law that funded bridge retrofits ; a 2007 law to name a U.S. courthouse in Fresno , Calif. , the " Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse ; and a 2008 law to designate a portion of the Rappahannock River in Virginia as the " John W. Warner Rapids . "
The other two laws are a 2004 measure to provide for " the development of a national plan for the control and management of Sudden Oak Death , a tree disease caused by the fungus - like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum , " and a 2009 law to re-name a San Diego post office as the " Cesar E. Chavez Post Office . "
( We verified that both passed . )
But Fiorina 's narrow accounting is misleading because it ignores the collaborative way that bills become law .
Any single bill that lists a single senator as author is often the collective work of many senators .
In some cases , entire bills become amendments to other bills that pass .
We found that Boxer co-sponsored at least 72 bills since 1995 .
A good number of these were for less significant resolutions or post office namings .
But some were more prominent pieces of legislation , such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act , which removed barriers so women can sue for gender - based pay discrimination , and the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights
Act of 2008 , which aimed to reduce counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property .
" It 's the nature of the process that everybody participates , " said Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie .
" No one writes a bill all on their own with no other input . "
In the case of particular bills , it 's often possible to piece together which senators contributed to a piece of legislation through research and reporting .
But there 's no standardized way to count meaningful contributions on a broad scale .
" There is no good , strong , objective , consistent way to measure productivity as a legislator , " said Norman Ornstein , a Congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
The statement in the Fiorina ad is " meaningless , " he said .
" It does n't matter whether it 's narrowly , factually accurate .
It has nothing to do with Boxer 's record as a legislator , " he said .
Ornstein also pointed out that Boxer is chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , so she 's steered important legislation on energy and offshore drilling .
Committee chairs do n't always author the original legislation themselves , but they play a critical role by greenlighting bills they support and stopping bills they oppose .
Boxer has used that power to advance her legislative agenda , Ornstein said .
The Boxer campaign said she has contributed to several pieces of legislation that she did n't directly sponsor .
She co-authored a successful amendment that permitted companies to claim a one - time tax reduction on profits made overseas if money is invested into the domestic American economy .
They said she also contributed to laws that protected California wilderness areas , funded after - school programs , and set rules for 401 ( k ) plans limiting how much employers could force employees to hold in company stock .
We looked into a few different accounts of Boxer 's legislative accomplishments .
CQ's Politics in America 2008 edition noted that she had " pushed through " the tax change on overseas profits .
It also said that she had " led efforts in 2001 to help communities deal with abandoned industrial sites . "
However , the 2010 edition said that " Getting major legislation passed has not been the trademark of Boxer 's career , " and noted the bridge retrofits bill .
But it also said that she is very active in promoting environmental issues and has been a longtime proponent of " cap and trade " legislation to address carbon emissions and climate change .
Such legislation is still pending in Congress and has yet to become law .
In ruling on the statement in the " Hot Air " ad , we find a lot lacking .
The Fiorina ad said that Boxer " passed only three bills in 18 years " into law .
But now even the Fiorina campaign admits that number is wrong -- there are five .
And more importantly , experts on Congress say the Fiorina campaign 's methodology is a misleading way of assessing a senator 's legislative accomplishments .
The Fiorina campaign could still make a case that Boxer is not an effective legislator , but the campaign has failed to do it here .
Using the count of bills authored is simplistic and does n't reflect the reality of the legislative process .
We rate the statement False .

To understand what that means , though , it helps to know how they ’re doing it .
As of the end of March , the average U.S. household ’s total mortgage , credit - card and other debt stood at 122 % of annual disposable income , meaning it would take a bit more than 14 months to pay it all off if everyone stopped spending money on anything else .
That sounds like a lot , but it ’s better than it was before :
At its peak in the first quarter of 2008 , the debt - to - income ratio stood at 131 % .
Economists tend to see 100 % as a reasonable level , so we ’re almost a third of the way there .
The falling debt burden conjures up images of a nation seeking to repent after a decade of profligacy , conscientiously paying down mortgages and credit - card balances .
That may be true in some cases , but it ’s not the norm .
In fact , people are making much more progress in shedding their debts by defaulting on mortgages and reneging on credit cards .
Since household debt hit its peak in early 2008 , banks have charged off a total of about $ 210 billion in mortgage and consumer loans , including credit cards .
If one assumes that investors suffered at least that much in losses on similar loans that banks packaged and sold as securities ( a very conservative assumption ) , then the total — that is , the amount of debt consumers shed through defaults — comes to much more than $ 400 billion .
Problem is , that ’s more than the concurrent decrease in household debts , which amounts to only $ 372 billion , according to the Federal Reserve .
That means consumers , on average , are n’t paying down their debts at all .
Rather , the defaulters account for the whole decline , while the rest have actually been building up more debt straight through the worst financial crisis and recession in decades .
In a sense , people who default on onerous debts — including the “ strategic defaulters ” who still have jobs and could pay — are doing the economy a favor .
They ’re freeing up cash to spend on other things , which can boost demand and give companies the confidence they need to start hiring again .
If everybody just hunkered down and tried to pay their insurmountable debts , we might never have gotten out of the recession .
Defaults are bad for the banks , but taxpayers already covered the cost of the losses through federal bailouts .
The bigger question , though , is what we as a society will learn from the experience .
The lesson seems to be that the way to get ahead in the world is to take huge risks — buy a house you ca n’t afford with no money down , or invest huge amounts of borrowed money in risky loans — but let somebody else pick up the bill if things go wrong .
As the growing U.S. federal debt demonstrates , that ’s not a sustainable way to run an economy .
Government plans to defy the UN in this case should worry us all .
In Franz Kafka 's novel The Trial , an ordinary man finds himself trapped inside the byzantine processes of a shadow justice system .
When he asks what he has done wrong , the bureaucrats reply , '' It 's not our job to tell you that . ''
When he goes to court , he and his lawyers are not allowed to see any of the evidence against him .
His faceless accusers always remain unknown to him .
Inevitably , in a system such as this , he is found guilty .
All around him , life continues as normal , as if the fair trial of one man is of no concern to the world .
Kafka 's story is a terrifying glimpse into a world that , on the surface , claims to be ruled by law , but in reality is one where the modern bureaucratic state exercises total control over the individual .
The individual 's right to be treated decently is extinguished for an unknown greater good .
Kafka was writing about rising authoritarianism in early 20th century Europe , but he could well have been describing Australia 's current migration and security laws .

Oh , oh .
Part Deux .
The Rachel Corrie Gaza aid ship is now steaming toward the Gaza coast , and its communications may have been already jammed .
It is flagged as an Irish vessel , and the far right Israeli government of Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman have vowed that it will not be allowed to reach Gaza .
It likely will be boarded and diverted without incident .
It is increasingly clear that the violence on the Mavi Marmara came about in part because it was a large five - deck ship and could not easily be boarded from the sea .
The Rachel Corrie is a smaller vessels and presents no such tactical challenge .
The new ship carries 19 activists including a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize .
It is named for an American peace activist Rachel Corrie , who was deliberately run down by an earth mover at the order of the Israeli military while attempting to stand in the way of a punitive house demolition .
A play about Corrie was prevented from being put on in New York by the Israel lobbies .
The censorship was later initially repeated in Toronto , though ultimately the play was put on there .
Paul McGeough , one of our great war reporters and investigative journalists , has constructed one of the first rounded accounts of the boarding of the Mavi Marmara by Israeli commandos and the way it turned into a game of shooting fish in a barrel .
McGeough was on one of the other ships and could see some of the events by moonlight .
He then conducted interviews with the aid workers while they were imprisoned in Israel and on the plane to Istanbul .
He reveals that an initial attempt to board the Mavi Marmara from an Israeli vessel failed .
Then an initial attempt to land commandos on the deck also failed , when the commandos were captured , and some beaten until the captain and others intervened to stop it .
Their weapons were confiscated and thrown overboard .
At that point live fire was deployed , apparently both by helicopter gunship onto the top deck and by rappelling commandos .
Unarmed people were shot between the eyes , shot in the top of the head , shot in the back of the head , shot in the chest , shot in the back , and shot in the legs .
Other accounts say the wounded were piled up in a room by the commandos without any first aid and many left to bleed out .
Then all the passengers were kidnapped and sequestered and silenced , and the Israelis confiscated and cherry - picked all the video and photos to show one moment of resistance to the first landing and erase all the subsequent murders by Israelis of unarmed passengers .
Fully six of the aid workers killed on the deck were shot by a single out - of - control commando , who is in line for a medal for bravery from Israel .
Although he claims that Israeli commandos had already been shot by passengers , the aid workers deny this and since he’d be up on murder charges if he fired on unarmed people , he has a reason to paint the situation as already dire when he began his shooting rampage .
Glenn Greenwald details how the Israeli army managed the US mass media and shaped their narrative .
My favorite such moment was when CNN ’s Tony Harris interviewed a flotilla survivor who had been released and asked her a lot of aggressive questions coming out of Israeli propaganda .
She complained that he was working off the Israeli narrative .
He threw a fit and pointed out that he was being nice enough to put her on the air and denied that he was working off the Israeli narrative .
His next question ?
So it is charged that the flotilla had links to al - Qaeda .
How do you respond to that accusation ?
I fell off my chair laughing and weeping all at once .
A Sydney court has been told a man accused of raping a Sydney woman last weekend is a member of the Nepalese royal family .
Police say 21 - year - old Amit Hamal walked into the bedroom at a Rose Bay home on Friday night when he went to drop off food .
He is a delivery driver for the Bayleaf Restaurant .
It is alleged he found the 44 - year - old woman sleeping and raped her before running away .
Prosecutors told the court they will lay more charges , saying the offence happened while the victim 's husband and children were in the house .
But the defence lawyer says the sex was consensual .
Hamal was arrested at Sydney airport last night , but his lawyer said he had a good reason for buying a one - way ticket overseas as he was heading home to see his sick father .
Hamal 's wife was in court for the hearing .
The magistrate has refused bail .
The unfurling of a Japanese solar sail , the first demonstration of a new space propulsion technology , went exactly according to plan .
According toJAXA 's blog posts and photos from the event , the IKAROS spacecraft 's sail appears to be in place .
It 's a big step in its attempt to travel driven only by sunlight .
" This is the first sail ever deployed in space , and if they succeed in using it for solar - sail flight – it'll still be a few weeks before we know that – it'll be a milestone , " said Louis Friedman , executive director of the Planetary Society , an organization dedicated to promoting space exploration , which is readying its own solar - sailing mission .
A solar sail uses the pressure from photons striking its surface to push the spacecraft through space .
Materially , the 650 square - foot sail is made of incredibly thin , aluminized plastic that 's only 0.0003 inches thick , a little thicker than spider silk , or about the diameter of a red blood cell .
When a photon strikes its surface , it bounces off , imparting its momentum to the sail .
Each photon might not deliver much thrust , but over time , all that light adds up .
" The actual force might be just a few millionths of a g , but because it acts continuously , it allows you to build up large velocity changes over time , " Friedman said .
" That 's where a sail really does its work is long missions . "
The Japanese sail also has thin - film solar cells built into it .
They could be used to generate electricity to drive an engine that would work alongside the sail .
The key difficulty with such a thin and large object is that it 's hard to deploy .
" The things we 're watching for are all their dynamical behaviors that you ultimately can't model and that might cause undue stress on the material , " Friedman said .
In the IKAROS design , the sail was unfurled by using centrifugal force generated by spinning the craft .
Space - travel proponents are particularly interested in the technology because it does n't require fuel , which makes it the leading ( and basically ) only candidate for very long - distance travel .
" It 's the only way we know – that anybody knows – to ultimately do practical interstellar flight because you do n't have to carry your propellant along with you , " Friedman said .
" Anything else you do , whether it 's nuclear or advanced engines , you 're always carrying propellant and the mass becomes too great . "

Music producer Phil Spector was legendary for his work with Tina Turner , the Ronettes , the Beatles .
But certainly his greatest feat would seem to be having a new CD appear this summer proclaiming him as producer while he sits in Corcoran State Prison , where he is serving a sentence of 19 years to life for the second - degree murder of struggling actress Lana Clarkson .
The new CD is the work of his wife , fledgling singer Rachelle Spector -- and it was produced before her husband went to prison last year .
Rachelle , who is 29 ( 30 next month ) met her husband , who is 70 , at Dan Tana ’s , the old - style Italian restaurant and bar hangout .
They met just months after Clarkson died of a gunshot wound in the producer ’s Alhambra mansion .
Rachelle said she had no clue about his fame -- or his infamy -- that night .
" Pretty much from the time we met until the time he was taken away from me , " she said referring to the April 2009 conviction that sent him to prison , " we were inseparable . "
Never doubting his innocence , she says , she married him in September 2006 .
The two worked on her CD , she said , between that year and 2009 , a period that Spector spent mostly free on bail .
His first trial ended in a hung jury in 2007 before he was convicted after his second trial .
" It took a lot longer than anticipated because the trial took precedence over everything , " Rachelle said .
" It was fun , " she said of the recording sessions .
" It was his outlet .
It was his escape back to his roots . "

By By Stephanie Dearing May 30 , 2010 in Environment Canberra - Peter Garrett , Australia 's Environment Minister , announced Saturday that Australia had failed to make diplomatic inroads with Japan over the annual whale hunts in the Southern Antarctic Ocean . " ... the response of the whaling countries has not been positive .
Recent statements by whaling countries in the Commission have provided Australia with little cause for hope that our serious commitment to conservation of the world 's whales will be reflected in any potential IWC compromise agreement .
The Government has always been firm in our resolve that if we could not find a diplomatic resolution to our differences over this issue , we would pursue legal action .
The Government 's action fulfils that commitment . "
The decision to take legal action against Japan was jointly announced by three Australian Ministers : Stephen Smith MP , Minister for Foreign Affairs , Peter Garrett MP , Minister for Environment Protection , Heritage and the Arts , Robert McClelland MP , Attorney - General .
The press release stressed the good relationship between Australia and Japan , saying " Australia and Japan share a comprehensive strategic , security and economic partnership .
We share a substantial commercial relationship built over many decades , growing strategic and security linkages , and work together closely in key international forums such as the G20 , the United Nations , the World Trade Organisation and APEC .
The Government 's action today reflects a disagreement in one element of a relationship that is deep , broad and multi-dimensional .
Both Australia and Japan have agreed that , whatever our differences on whaling , this issue should not be allowed to jeopardise the strength and the growth of our bilateral relationship .
" New Zealand has said it will not support Australia 's decision to take Japan to court .

It also demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to end whaling globally .
The Australian Government has not taken this decision lightly .

We have engaged in intensive discussions in the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) and bilaterally with Japan . "

We trust the court to understand just what the word ‘ sanctuary ’ means . ”
Watson went on to say “ This action by Australia lends further credibility to our in the field intervention activities in the Southern Ocean . ”

The XMRV study conducted by the NIH and the FDA has been delayed for publication by its authors .
The CDC XMRV study publication has also been put on hold for publication by its authors at the 11th hour .
The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) picked up on this information and wrote an article about it here : http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703374104575337160225739290.html?mod=googlenews_wsj#articleTabs%3Darticle
It has been reported that the CDC failed to find XMRV in the blood of CFS patients .
This contrasts the FDA / NIH confirming the original Lombardi - Mikovits study in finding XMRV in the blood of a significant number of CFS patients .
After devoting many months to a scientific paper , scientists tend to be confident of their results and the icing on the cake for them comes when their study is published in a scientific journal .
It is therefore rather suspicious that both study groups ’ authors , the FDA / NIH and the CDC asked for their papers to be put on hold for publication .
The WSJ article reports that “ senior public - health officials ” were the reason that both papers were thwarted from an imminent publication .
Possible Reasons for the Delay
I will explore the possible different reasons for the delay of publication of these two studies .
I am assuming that the WSJ is correct in that “ senior public - health officials ” were the reason that the papers were put on hold .
1 . The government may now know that XMRV causes disease and between 3 % and 7 % of the population are infected with XMRV .
If both studies were released , the government may have felt unprepared for the consequences of a Lombardi - Mikovits confirmation study .
In order to “ regain control ” of the situation , the government may have delayed both studies to give itself extra time to be fully prepared for the XMRV threat .
Very little is known about XMRV and the government may have wanted a 100 % reliable XMRV test to be available to the public before revealing the XMRV threat .
The government may have also wanted to gain more knowledge regarding the ease of transmissibility of XMRV to avoid further public fear .
It may also have wanted a definitive list of illnesses XMRV can be responsible for .
2 . Another possible reason for the delay concerns the different conclusions on XMRV by different government departments .
For the government to release two conflicting studies ( 1 of which has to be flawed ) may be seen as failing to be an appropriate medical authority .
The government may also feel a level of embarrassment at presenting contradictory findings .
This situation would be problematic for the government regarding its recommendations on XMRV and an official XMRV stance .
Why They Should Release the Studies
1. Scientific progress is a collaborative , world - wide effort .
Scientists around the entire world contribute to scientific knowledge .
The US government not releasing the XMRV studies results in the consequence of all scientists outside of the US government not being able to build upon , replicate , improve and critique the US government scientists work .
One of the attractive aspects of a scientific journal is that the readership is generally an expert in the specific field .
The government preventing these experts from analysing the studies , thwarts or at least delays scientific progress .
2. Science is known for is objectivity and separation from political agendas .
The act of the US government not releasing the XMRV studies is a slap in the face to science .
Science is played out in the public yet professional arena ( as opposed to the private arena . )
To solve scientific issues behind closed doors leads to the possibility of government agendas dictating the scientific results to suit themselves .
This is as opposed to the way science should work in scientific results dictating government agendas .
3 . By not releasing the studies into the public arena , the government is directly delaying the scientific process .
If only a few scientists ( as opposed to scientists around the world ) are to decide if the FDA / NIH or CDC study is correct then a longer time will lapse before a conclusion by the wider scientific community on XMRV is settled upon .
4 . The delay mentioned in ( 3 ) means a delay of treatment for CFS patients and those patients infected with XMRV .
The delay also means that more people will become infected with XMRV while the government decides on this issue within their own time frame .
5 . If the government released the FDA / NIH study , a numerable amount of scientists and institutions would put a large amount of money towards XMRV research .
At the moment the Lombardi- Mikovits study remains officially unconfirmed .
If the FDA / NIH study was released , the Lombardi - Mikovits study would become officially confirmed resulting in a wave of immediate worldwide research towards XMRV .
6 . The question now arises on the timeframe until the government reaches an internal consensus on XMRV .
There is little external pressure on the government to hurry along with its XMRV research and consensus .
If the Lombardi - Mikovits confirmation study was released by the government , they would have to work swiftly on XMRV as the public would demand this .
If the general population is not aware of an XMRV threat ( as the situation is like at the moment ) then the government can do things at a leisurely pace .
The delay may be good for the superficial government image but is bad for the people the government agencies are meant to be helping - the CFS patients and potentially the XMRV positive patients .
The misperception of the misnomer that is CFS means the wider public probably would n’t be too worried about catching CFS , although they should be .
What May Have Been Wrong With the CDC Study
I am assuming the CDC study is flawed in its conclusions and will examine where they may have went wrong .
This is all speculation as I have n’t read the CDC XMRV paper .
I am hypothesising on where the CDC may have gone wrong in not finding XMRV in CFS patients .
Cohorts
The CDC are notorious for using flawed CFS definitions as well as controversial methods of finding patients for their CFS studies .
Let ’s assume the CDC used their normal cohorts for this XMRV study .
They find their cohorts by phoning up a cross section of the population and asking them questions such as whether they are fatigued .
( From http://www.cdc.gov/cfs/cfsgastudy.htm)
They then give the positive respondents medical examinations that are intended to determine if their apparent “ fatigue ” is from an obvious organic source , to exclude a CFS diagnosis .
The medical examination DOESN’T involve doing any specific testing for things considered to be potential CFS biomarkers such as NK cell function or SPECT scan tests .
After their medical examination , if the subjects fit into the CDC criteria for CFS , they are included in a study .
The CDC criteria for CFS is highly controversial and a world apart from the Canadian Criteria that has almost ubiquitously been recognised by CFS specialists as sufficient to diagnose CFS .
The former head of the CFS department of the CDC said 84 % of the people they found through random phone interviews and the CDC diagnosed as having CFS did n’t know themselves they had CFS .
( From http://www.cfidsreport.com/News/06-CDC_CFS_Reeves.htm)
Also the CDC researchers determined that the average workload of its CFS cohort was 48 hours per week .
( http://www.cfidsreport.com/News/06-CDC-CFS-Controversy.htm)
If the CDC did use their traditional cohorts and techniques of diagnosing CFS patients , then their failure to find XMRV in their cohort is n’t surprising .
If their XMRV retrovirus finding techniques were correct they would have by their own study shown their cohort to NOT represent CFS patients .
Did the CDC Find it in Anyone ?
The CDC study according to the WSJ failed to find XMRV in their CFS patients .
They may have failed to find it in their healthy controls .
If this was the case , they would have used very dubious techniques similar to the European failed XMRV attempts that did n’t find XMRV in anyone .
If the CDC did n’t find XMRV in anyone , it contradicts the findings of many groups such as : The Whittemore Peterson Institute , The National Cancer Institute , The Cleveland Clinic , the Japanese Study , The University Medical Centre - Hamburg , The Drug and Food Administration and The National Institute of Health .
All of these groups found XMRV in a similar , comparable percentage of the healthy population .
Hindsight
When the CDC started their XMRV study , ( not long after the 9th of October 2009 ) it was n’t widely known how difficult it was to detect XMRV .
Since the WPI study , the failure of many groups to detect XMRV in prostate cancer and CFS has highlighted the need for specific techniques .
The CDC did n’t have this hindsight and may have overconfidently completed their study .
The CDC study was completed before the start of February - a much shorter timeframe than the Lombardi - Mikovits study .
Techniques Used
Without having read the CDC XMRV study , I can only guess what mistake they made in managing not to find XMRV in CFS patients .
The other studies that failed to find XMRV may have had comparably flawed methods to the CDC .
The CDC may have messed up like these studies in areas such as :
Using the wrong cohort ( i.e. not true CFS patients )
Failing to amplify , culture or activate their samples
Using old blood
Looking in non-replicating cells for XMRV
Using a PCR technique designed at detecting a lenti-retrovirus such as HIV as opposed to a gamma - retrovirus such as XMRV .
Using a PCR test not capable of detecting the low tire levels of XMRV
Looking for the primer pairs for ENV as opposed to a different primer pair
Looking for the primer pairs for ENV which may not have been sufficient to find XMRV due to diversity of that area
It becomes evident that finding XMRV requires a very specific technique and changing one variable even slightly from the original Lombardi - Mikovits paper may be sufficient to not find XMRV .
Dr Suzanne Vernon highlighted this point when she talked about the differences between the Imperial College London XMRV study and the Lombardi - Mikovits XMRV study .
She writes :
“
The blood was collected from CFS patients in different types of blood collection tubes .
The genomic DNA was extracted and purified using different techniques .
The amount of genomic DNA included in the amplification assay was different .
Different primer sequences were used that amplified different regions of the XMRV proviral DNA .
The conditions of the PCR amplification assay were different – from the numbers of cycles , to the type of polymerase used . ”
Dr Vernon ’s full article can be found here : http://www.cfids.org/cfidslink/2010/010603.asp
Lead Author
According the WSJ , the lead author of the CDC XMRV paper was the microbiologist , William Switzer .
He was also involved in the study titled , “ Prevalence of Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus in Prostate Cancer . ”
The abstract of the paper can be found here : http://www.retroconference.org/2010/Abstracts/37160.htm
In his prostate cancer study , Switzer found 1.2 % of prostate cancer patients to be positive by ENV and POL PCR , which means they probably had XMRV .
This number is distinctly different from other prostate cancer - XMRV studies which have found XMRV in as high as 40 % of those suffering from prostate cancer .
Conclusion
Given the CDC ’s history of treating and viewing CFS , their negative XMRV - CFS study is a further sign of their failure to understand the complexities of CFS .
If the government had a scientific viewpoint they would let the scientific process take its natural course ( releasing both papers ) which would involve embarrassing the CDC .
Instead the CFS patients must wait on bureaucracy rather than a global scientific effort .
UPDATE : Since writing this article , some new information has emerged .
This new information is definitely worth reading and can be found on the CFS Central website http://www.cfscentral.com/2010/06/embargoed-studies-redux.html
This new information ( although only a rumour at the moment ) reveals the details of the FDA / NIH study and CDC study , including XMRV positive percentages .

Now is a good time to mention “ word wars ” .
Word wars are useful tools during the frantic month of November , when 1600 + words a day are required and time , family demands , and everything else collide .
Set a timer for 5 , 15 , or 30 minutes , challenge someone else , and see how many words you can get written .
Leave everything behind – grammar , punctuation , spelling , perhaps coherent sentence structure – but get that wordcount .
The section below is from one of many word wars .
Because of that , even though I ’ve done some basic editing , it is a little confusing .

As tension was rising within the group , they nearly encountered [ BC1 ] another Deeper traveling school .
They scrambled to change direction , but the Deeper community seemed almost to follow them .
They swam rapidly , trying to stay ahead of the quick - moving Deepers and the accompanying Shallower school above .
As they moved off towards one side , they found another , larger shallower school , with no real place to squeeze between .
Frustrated the four swam forward as quickly as they could , gaining a little ground ahead of the shallower farm .
But as they raced ahead , looking for a way to get off to the side before the ridge which was rapidly approaching , a ship and group of enforcers appeared on the horizon .
Alex frantically looked for options as they stopped .
Behind them the shallower school continued approaching , to the north [ BC2 ] a larger school .
Underneath both , a farily [ BC3 ] large Deeper community .
In front of them to the south , the Ridge , which would force the Deepers up and leave them very little room for even possible hiding [ BC4 ] .
And passing directly in front and headed towards them from the east , the group of enforcers .
There was little time ofr [ BC5 ] arguing , though each of them suggested a different tack .
We ’ll split up [ BC6 ]
Alex decided .
“ Gooshan and Xero , to the south , try as hard as you can to get past the school .
If you have to go over the ridge , try to make it through or find a group to blend in with if possible .
Good luck , we ’ll meet you on the shelf .
Muuld , come with me , we ’re going to try and go under the enforcers but stay out from under eth [ BC7 ] ship if possible .
We ’ll be pusing [ BC8 ] our depth but hsould [ BC9 ] be able to make it .
Everyone stay calm as you can , if you get found sing the slave song as we ’ve discussed before and mimic the controlled fear of those belonging to a Deeper group already – afraid only of your owner deepers and not those approaching .
I pray for the best and hope to see you in a few days . ”
No one noticed Daire was gone , nor had thoughts for him now [ BC10 ] .
He was n’t going to save them , not that they trusted him enough for that anyway .
Xero and Gooshan did as Alex suggested , and took off on a south - east tangent , swimming as fast as the possibly could , trying to escape detection and make it around – or under – the shallower school while escaping Deeper notice [ BC11 ] .
They kept being forced to change course east to avoid getting too close .
Just as they seemed to make it south enough of the school , the ground underneath rose forming the ridge , and the Deepers began coming to ttheir [ BC12 ] depth .
There was no room to get further out of the way – they were trapped .
As tension was rising within the group , they nearly collided with another Deeper traveling school .
They scrambled to change direction , but the Deeper community seemed almost to follow them .
They swam rapidly , trying to stay ahead of the quick - moving Deepers and the accompanying Shallower school above .
As they moved off towards one side , they found another , larger shallower school , with no real place to squeeze between .
Frustrated the four swam forward as quickly as they could , gaining a little ground ahead of the shallower farm .
But as they raced ahead , looking for a way to get off to the side before the ridge which was rapidly approaching , a ship and group of enforcers appeared on the horizon .
Alex frantically looked for options as they stopped .
Behind them the shallower school continued approaching , to the south a larger school .
Underneath both , a fairly large Deeper community .
In front of them to the south , the Ridge , which would force the Deepers up and leave them very little room for hiding .
And passing directly in front and headed towards them from the east , the group of enforcers .
There was little time for arguing , though each of them suggested a different tack .
“ We ’ll split up ” Alex decided .
“ Gooshan and Xero , to the south , try as hard as you can to get past the school .
If you have to go over the ridge , try to make it through or find a group to blend in with if possible .
Good luck , we ’ll meet you on the shelf .
Muuld , come with me , we ’re going to try and go under the enforcers but stay out from under the ship if possible .
We ’ll be pushing our depth but should be able to make it .
Everyone stay calm as you can , if you get found sing the slave song as we ’ve discussed before and mimic the controlled fear of those belonging to a Deeper group already – afraid only of your owner deepers and not those approaching .
I pray for the best and hope to see you in a few days . ”
No one noticed Daire was gone , nor even thought about him right now .
He was n’t going to save them , not that they would have trusted him enough for that anyway .

Ah , and here it gets very intense .
The rest of this chapter , and on into the following chapter , is packed to the gills ( haha ) with ….
Well , I wo n’t spoil it for you .
It has been fun to write , though sad in parts .
I will say shortly after this word war I realized that I ’m going to completely change how the groups split up , and in fact mid-way through the chapter I just changed who was where , magically , with no explanation .
My poor proofreaders !
Anyway , this section has a lot of room for improvement on the re-write .
I hope you ’ve enjoyed .
If you would like more excerpts , please let me know .
I ’m drawing near the end of the first draft now , and anxious to be done .
