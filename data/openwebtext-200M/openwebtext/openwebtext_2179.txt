There could be a more down - to - earth explanation behind the strange lights that appeared over Phoenix on Monday night , according to one Phoenix man .
Lino Mailo , 44 , said he saw his neighbor launch several helium balloons with flares attached to them from the back porch of his north Phoenix home .
Mailo said the balloons took off about 8 p.m. , right before the mysterious lights were spotted .
� It 's pretty tricky , because the higher the balloons get , the harder it is to tell what they are , � Mailo said .
A helicopter pilot with the Phoenix police department who was flying last night also saw the objects and said they appeared to simply be some flares hanging from helium balloons .
Mailo said he has no idea why his neighbor released the balloons , but he regrets not filming the act .
� I feel bad for the people freaking out about this , � Mailo said .
� I could 've put this whole thing to rest . �
Civilian and military aviation organizations said Tuesday they had idea what caused the lights .
An official with the North American Aerospace Defense Command , which monitors the skies for security threats , said Tuesday the organization did not know where the lights came from .
Ian Gregor , a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said that though air traffic controllers at Sky Harbor Airport witnessed the lights , they do not know the cause .
Nothing appeared on radar and Gregor said the FAA will not be investigating .
� There 's nothing to look into , � Gregor said .
Several Valley residents reported seeing the lights in the sky on Monday night and Gregor said the FAA received numerous calls .
Witnesses said they saw four lights in a square shape that eventually became a triangular shape .
The lights were moving to the east and they disappeared one by one .
Phoenix resident Kent Titze and his wife watched the lights from their house near Loop 101 and Cave Creek Road .
� It was something I 've never seen before , � Titze said .
� Right away I thought � UFO '.�
Titze 's wife Fran rushed to take pictures of the lights .
� To me it looked like clusters of red lights - like three or five of them in each bundle , � Kent Titze said .

The Bong Show Pot Legalization Goes Prime Time
ACLU funds pro-pot infomercial .
In the last decade , when pot -law reform advocates have faced off with the status quo on equal footing , pot reform has won .
Initiative backers in a dozen states , for instance , have spent big bucks passing medical - marijuana measures despite fierce opposition from federal officials .
Nevertheless , the adult recreational use of pot ( as opposed to medical use ) does n't have majority support to pass in any state .
Before voters will ever approve that sort of proposal , pot advocates must first change attitudes toward the drug by going toe to toe with the White House 's multimillion - dollar antidrug media campaign .
The national ACLU has decided to fund a pilot effort .
Beginning on Valentine 's Day , television viewers in the Seattle media market will begin seeing a slick , 30 - minute pot-reform infomercial .
Hosted by television travel guru Rick Steves , Marijuana :
It 's Time for a Conversation will initially be available on Comcast On Demand cable , says Alison Holcomb , director of the ACLU of Washington 's Marijuana Education Project , which produced the show .
Holcomb says the ACLU plans to spend at least $ 20,000 per week airing the program around the state .
Three local network affiliates ( KOMO , KING , and KIRO ) have already received and approved copies of the script , she says .
However , none of the station 's advertising managers could be reached for comment .
" We 're working with the stations to figure out what times are available , " Holcomb says .
By the end of 2008 , she expects the program to begin airing in more conservative regions , including Pierce County , Clark County , and greater Spokane .
" It 's good to be in a corner of the country where we can test - market for this , " said Steves at an advanced screening .
The national ACLU , which opposes punitive marijuana laws they believe chip away at civil liberties , chose Washington because polls suggest reforming marijuana laws is most feasible here .
( Disclosure : I used to work for the ACLU of Washington . )
The program makes its case against pot prohibition by chronicling the racial hysteria behind the drug 's criminalization in the 1930s and examining the impact of modern - day pot laws , under which about 800,000 people are arrested in the U.S. each year .
The format — an infomercial with the requisite gregarious host and an audience that robotically claps on cue — is clearly geared to strike a chord with its target demographic : moms , a group traditionally wary of marijuana but proven to buy products sold on TV .
But , to fit within cable and station programming guidelines , the show cannot advocate for any specific legal reforms .
It must settle for encouraging viewers to start a discussion on the issue and prompting them to visit Marijuana Conversation.org for more information .
The absence of overt advocacy actually makes the program compelling — it encourages the viewer to hang on and find out what he or she is supposed to do .
Although , the potential for backlash does exist .
When the program wraps up without defining its goals , moms may wonder what exactly the ACLU wants .
Does the civil - liberties organization want to allow adults to smoke pot in the privacy of their bedrooms , or is this part of a nebulous liberalization agenda that would make drugs more available ?
Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen , the state 's leading critic of drug - reform efforts , worries that the infomercial turns pot smokers into politically sympathetic characters .
" When you start running ads and say , ' Golly , gee whiz , look at all the things happening to people who get [ unfairly ] arrested , ' you start putting out a story saying there is no problem with marijuana , " says Owen .
These messages lower the perception of pot 's harm , he adds , thus increasing the rate of marijuana use , especially by kids .
" The show does n't encourage anyone to use marijuana , " Holcomb responds .
" This show acknowledges risks associated with heavy marijuana use , and no one is saying that marijuana use is a good thing . "
" The question we are positing is this :
Is criminalizing marijuana use actually increasing public safety and decreasing health risks , " Holcomb says , " or is it hurting us on both counts ? "
In Where Are All The Open Source Billionaires ?
I used this chart as an illustration :
Because open source code is freely distributable , anyone can take that code and create their own unique mutant mashup version of it any time they feel like it .
Whether anyone else in the world will care about their crazy new version of the code is not at all clear , but that 's not the point .
If someone wants it bad enough , they can create it -- or pay someone else to create it for them .
This is known as " forking " .
It 's the very embodiment of freedom zero , and it's an essential part of every open source license .
But there are forks , and there are forks :
What is different about a fork is intent .
In a fork , the person (s ) creating the fork intend for the fork to replace or compete with the original project they are forking .
That 's exactly what happened to the Pidgin project recently .
In their 2.4 release they changed the GUI action of the text field where the user types their IM from a manually re-sizable window , to a fixed size window that auto - re - sizes based on the amount of text typed .
On the surface , this sounds like a minor change , but it triggered a massive user revolt !
Why ?
This is what they 're up in arms about :
The developers , for whatever reason , dug in their heels on this one and refused to budge .
You can read through some of the commentary on the bug ticket to get an idea , but the general tenor was combatative bordering on hostile .
The bug was eventually closed as " wo n't fix " .
The community 's response was swift :
Oh yeah ?
Fork you !
Funpidgin is a fork of the popular open source client Pidgin which allows instant messaging with over twenty different protocols .
What makes us different from the official client is that we work for you .
Unlike the Pidgin developers , we believe the user should have the final say in what goes into the program .
So far five new features have been added to Funpidgin upon requests from users , and all of them are optional .
It is these options that make the use of Funpidgin enjoyable to a diverse range of people .
Funpidgin is a fork in the truest sense ; the developers intend to replace Pidgin .
But will it ?
Who knows .
There are four possible outcomes from any fork :
The fork dies
Funpidgin languishes due to lack of attention from developers and users .
Funpidgin eventually dies .
The fork merges
Funpidgin and Pidgin reach a consensus .
The Funpidgin changes are folded back into Pidgin .
The original dies
Funpidgin becomes so popular that it draws developers and users away from Pidgin .
Pidgin eventually dies .
Both original and fork survive
Funpidgin and Pidgin both succeed on their own terms , perhaps by attracting different audiences or meeting different user needs .
You can find examples of all four outcomes peppered throughout the history of open source software .
You might think that the adoption of open source software licenses would lead to dozens if not hundreds of incompatible , slightly - different versions of the same stuff -- bewildering users and developers alike .
I 'm not so sure .
There 's a tremendous amount of inertia around the open source projects that survive long enough to become popular .
Consider the challenges the newly forked Funpidgin project now faces :
A divided community of users and developers .
Siphoning enough energy and attention away from an established project to remain viable .
Differentiating themselves enough from Pidgin so that they are n't viewed as useless or irrelevant .
The original Pidgin project is free to take whatever parts of the Funpidgin open source code they deem appropriate and fold that into Pidgin , thus undermining the fork .
Forking is incredibly difficult to pull off .
It is a painful , but necessary part of the evolution of open source software .
Just as in real evolution , I suspect that most forks die in vast , nameless numbers , before they become strong enough to engender any forked progeny of their own .
Forking is the absolute bedrock of open source software -- but it is also not a path to be chosen lightly .
Does the FBI track cellphone users ' physical movements without a warrant ?
Does the Bureau store recordings of innocent Americans caught up in wiretaps in a searchable database ?
Does the FBI 's wiretap equipment store information like voicemail passwords and bank account numbers without legal authorization to do so ?
That 's what the nation 's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wanted to know , in a series of secret inquiries in 2005 and 2006 into the bureau 's counterterrorism electronic surveillance efforts , revealed for the first time in newly declassified documents .
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly
The inquires are the first publicly known questioning of the
FBI 's post -9/11 surveillance activities by the secret court , which has
historically approved nearly every wiretap application submitted to it .
The court handles surveillance requests in counterterrorism and foreign espionage investigations .
The inquiries add to questions surrounding how the FBI has used the broad powers handed to it by Congress in the 2001 USA Patriot Act , including the FBI 's admitted abuse of so - called National Security Letters to get stored telephone and financial records .
Among other things , the declassified documents reveal that lawyers in the FBI 's Office of General Counsel and the Justice Department 's
Office of Intelligence Policy Review queried FBI technology officials in late
July 2006 about cellphone tracking .
The attorneys asked whether the FBI was obtaining and storing real - time cellphone - location data from carriers under a " pen register " court order that 's normally limited to records of who a person called or was called by .
The internal inquiry seems to have preceded , and was likely prompted by , a secret court hearing on the matter days later .
Kevin Bankston , a lawyer with Electronic Frontier Foundation , says the documents suggest that the nation 's spy court shares the reluctance of federal criminal courts to turn everyday cellphones into tracking devices , in the absence of evidence that the target has done something wrong .
" I hope that this signals that the FISC , like many magistrate judges that handle law enforcement surveillance requests , is growing skeptical of the government 's authority to conduct real - time cellphone tracking without probable cause , " says Bankston .
In criminal cases , the government 's attempts to get cellphone - tracking data without probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime were denied several times in 2005 by federal judges in New York and
Texas .
According to the documents , which the EFF obtained in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit , an FBI general counsel lawyer asked on July 21 , 2006 : " Can we at the collection end tell the equipment NOT to receive the cell site location information ? "
The lawyer added a note of concern that phone companies might be sending along cell - site data even when they are n't asked for it .
" Do we get it all or can we , when required , tell the equipment to not collect the cell - site location data ? , " the lawyer asked .
Separately , the secret court questioned if the
FBI was using pen register orders to collect digits dialed after a call is made , potentially including voicemail passwords and account numbers entered into bank - by - phone applications .
Using a pen register order , the FBI can force a phone company to turn over records of who a person calls , or is called by , simply by asserting the information would be relevant to an investigation .
But existing case law holds that those so - called " post - cut - through dialed digits " count as the content of a communication , and thus to collect that information , the FBI would need to get a full - blown wiretapping warrant based on probable cause .
The FBI 's encrypted wiretapping backbone network , DCSNet , connects 37 FBI field offices , according to some documents .
Other documents suggest the network now extends to 52 field offices , including locations in Alaska and Puerto Rico .
This enhanced image is based on black - and - white FBI documents .
Colored photo- illustration : Frank RodriguezOn August 7 2006 , Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge Colleen
Kollar - Kotelly took the extraordinary step of ordering the FBI to report ( .pdf ) on how its sophisticated phone wiretapping system , known as Digital Collection System , handled those extra digits and whether it stored them in a centralized data - mining depository known as Telephone
Application .
The documents ( .pdf ) show that the majority of FBI offices surveyed internally were collecting that information without full - blown wiretap orders , especially in classified investigations .
The documents also indicate that the information was being uploaded to the FBI 's central repository for wiretap recordings and phone records , where analysts can data - mine the records for decades .
EFF 's Bankston says it 's clear that FBI offices had configured their digit - recording software , DCS 3000 , to collect more than the law allows .
" The FBI 's configuration of DCS 3000 to collect post - cut - through dialed digits when conducting pen-register surveillance is flatly illegal under statute and raises serious Fourth Amendment questions , based on the unanimous decisions of two district court judges and three federal magistrate judges holding that such interceptions require a wiretap order based on probable cause , " Bankston said .
The documents also reveal that the inquiry on dialed - digits collection was n't the first time the secret court had queried the FBI regarding its use and storage of information from wiretaps .
In October 2005 , the court also asked the
FBI to explain how it stored " raw " foreign - intelligence wiretap content and information about Americans collected during those wiretaps .
The government is supposed to " minimize " – that is anonymize or destroy – information gathered on Americans who are n't the targets of a wiretap , unless that information is crucial to an investigation .
The court wanted the FBI to explain what databases stored raw wiretaps ( .pdf ) , how those recordings could be accessed , and by whom , as well as how minimization standards were implemented .
The documents do n't reveal the answer to that question .
The FBI did not respond to a request for comment by press time .

The people on this list , however , collect things that are far , far stranger .
Behold , Neatorama 's guide to the 25 Strangest Collections on the Web :
1. Graham Barker 's Navel Fluff Collection
Graham Barker 's Navel Fluff Collection
Some people see navel fluff or bellybutton lint as life 's little annoyances .
Not Graham Barker : he began collecting them since 1984 , and now has the world 's largest collection of navel fluff according to Guiness Book of World Records :
It was on the 17th of January 1984 that I found myself under - occupied in a youth hostel in Brisbane .
The night was steamy and stormy - too wet outside and too hot inside to do very much , and my attention drifted to my belly button .
There it was ... fluff !
I must have seen it before that night , but this occasion was the first time I ever picked it out and wondered about it .
I became curious about how much navel fluff one person could generate ( enough to stuff a cushion , maybe ? ) , and the only way to find for sure was to collect it and see .
My first piece of navel fluff was stored in an empty film canister , and the collection had begun .

2. Air Sickness Bag Virtual Museum
Like its name implies , the Air Sickness Bag Virtual Museum is all about vomit bags .
Indeed , it catalogs more than 2,000 photos of air sickness bags from all over the world .
In addition to airplane air sickness bags , the website also has a collection of bus sickness , sea sickness , and even space sickness bags !
Though most are underwhelming in terms of design , some are actually quite artistic .
Virgin Atlantic airlines even held a " Design for Chunks " project in 2004 , where artists submit their designs to be put as a limited edition barf bags !
Before you check out the website , I 'll leave you with a few of the more unusual bags from the Visitor 's Favorite section :

Indeed , Joseph has the largest collection of handcuffs ( with focus on vintage ones ) , leg irons , nippers , and thumbcuffs on the Web : Link
What 's a nipper and a thumbcuff ?
Well , a nipper is a handcuff that locks only one hand , but has a handle for keeping the cuffed person under control ( Photo to the left is a 1888 nipper made by Thomas & Smith ) .
A thumbcuff , like its name implies , cuffs both of the person 's thumbs .

The Asphalt Museum is actually a real museum in a real building in Sacramento , California , but it 's weird enough that we 'll just have to include it on this list .
It has a large collection of ( you guessed it ) everything asphalt .
The museum was founded by Scott Gordon and Marie Vans in 1991 , while both attended Colorado State University .

12 . Nancy Alford 's Mangles
What is a mangle ?
You 'll be forgiven if you do n't know what it is : a mangle is a cast iron contraption with two wooden rollers , a spring , and a side wheel with handle .
Its function is to wring clothes dry after you wash them , so obviously it 's now obsolete with the invention dryers and all ...
A few years ago , Nancy Alford was in a local department store when she saw , and fell in love with , a mangle .
For her sixteenth wedding anniversary , Nancy wanted ( and got ) - you guessed it , a mangle .
Her husband thought she was mad .
Since then , she has collected so many of them that they had to build a new house ( which she aptly named Mangleten ) to fit all her mangles .

14 . Lydia's AOL CDs
Younger Neatorama readers may not be familiar with AOL CDs , but the rest of us surely remember getting spammed with tons of these discs from America Online .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , AOL produced over a billion CDs ( with over 1,000 distinct designs ) for its direct mail campaign .
The strategy was a huge success : AOL became the largest dial - up Internet Service Provider in the world ( for a while anyway ) .
After its fateful merger with Time Warner and the decline of dial - up as a mean of accessing the web , the company stopped producing the discs in 2006 .
But fear not .
Lydia of Lydia 's AOL Disks shares with us her collection of over 2,500 unique AOL diskettes and CDs .

15 . Museum of Burnt Food
The Museum of Burnt Food is dedicated to accidentally burnt food , er ... carbonized culinary masterpieces ( no intentionally burned artwork there ! ) .
The museum was founded by harpist Deborah Henson Conant , who recounted this tale :
The museum was founded in the late 1980's one night when Deborah put on a small pot of Hot Apple Cider to heat , then received an unexpected . . . fascinating . . . and very long phone call .
By the time Deborah returned to the kitchen , the Cider had become a " Cinder " and thus the first , and perhaps still the most impressive , exhibit : " Free Standing Hot Apple Cider " was born .
SINCE THEN , countless other works have entered the museum , such as " Thrice Baked Potato , " " Why Sure , You Can Bake Quiche in the Microwave , " the indestructible " Mmmm … … Soy Pups , " and the lovely matching set of Pizza Toast .
Deborah has a tip on kitchen decorating , which I think everyone should heed : " Never scrimp on fire extinguishers and smoke alarms . "

18 . Becky Martz's Banana Labels
In 1991 , Becky Martz first noticed banana labels when she put two bunches of bananas in the fruit bowl together .
She noticed that the " Dole " labels actually were n't quite the same : one said Guatemala and the other said Honduras .
Later that year , she noticed a particularly festive Chiquita label and decided that she wanted to collect banana labels .
Today , Becky has more than 7,000 different banana labels and even branched out to collect asparagus and broccoli bands .
If you think that this is a strange hobby , well , ... it is .

21 . Dr. Val Kolpakov's Toothpaste Collection
Dr. Val Kolpakov is a practicing dentist in Saginaw , Michigan , so it 's only natural that he has an unnatural affinity to toothpaste .
Starting in 2002 , Dr. Val began collecting toothpaste from around the world .
His website , Toothpaste World , categorizes toothpastes according to location , brand name , and year of production .
Right now , he has over 1,400 items : Link
I 'd be remiss if I did n't share with you a toothpaste trivia from Dr. Val 's website .
Here 's the world 's oldest known formula for toothpaste :
The world 's oldest - known formula for toothpaste , used more than 1,500 years before Colgate began marketing the first commercial brand in 1873 , has been discovered on a piece of dusty papyrus in the basement of a Viennese museum .
In faded black ink made of soot and gum arabic mixed with water , an ancient Egyptian scribe has carefully described what he calls a " powder for white and perfect teeth " .
When mixed with saliva in the mouth , it forms a " clean tooth paste " .
According to the document , written in the fourth century AD , the ingredients needed for the perfect smile are one drachma of rock salt - a measure equal to one hundredth of an ounce - two drachmas of mint , one drachma of dried iris flower and 20 grains of pepper , all of them crushed and mixed together .
The result is a pungent paste which one Austrian dentist who tried it said made his gums bleed but was a " big improvement " on some toothpaste formulae used as recently as a century ago .

23 . British Lawnmower Museum
British Anzani Lawnrider ( c. 1960 )
The tireless curators of the British Lawnmower Museum , Brian and Sue Radam , dedicate their lives to preserving the best example of British engineering prowess : the lawnmower !
The lawnmower was invented in 1827 by English engineer Edwin Beard Budding , who wanted a superior alternative to the scythe .
He took a machine designed to cut the knap off cloth and used it to cut grass instead .
At the time , people thought that he was mad , so he tested his invention in the middle of the night so no one could see him !
The British Lawnmower Museum 's now has over 200 vintage lawnmowers and part of 400 others : Link
24 . Helena Vnouckova's Napkins

25 . Museum of Hoaxes
I 'm going to end this long list with Neatorama pal Alex Boese 's excellent website : Museum of Hoaxes .
Alex Boese probably has the strangest collection of them all : he collects stories about and examples of scams and hoaxes !
In 1997 , Alex created the Museum of Hoaxes as research notes for his doctoral dissertation , and the website quickly became popular .
So much so that Alex the " hoaxpert " wrote three books which we have featured on Neatorama before : The Museum of Hoaxes , Hippo Eats Dwarf , and Elephants on Acid And Other Bizarre Experiments .
If you have n't seen it before ( perhaps you 've been living under a rock ) , then definitely check out the Museum of Hoaxes : Link - you wo n't be disappointed !

American Judaism has a boy problem .
After several thousand years in which women were relegated to the sidelines of worship and community leadership , scholars and denominational leaders now say that women are significantly outnumbering men in numerous key segments of non-Orthodox Jewish community life .
At the Reform movement 's seminary , 60 percent of the rabbinical students and 84 percent of those studying to become cantors are female .
Girls are outnumbering boys by as much as 2 to 1 among adolescents in youth group programs and summer camps , while women outnumber men at worship and in a variety of congregational leadership roles , according to the Union for Reform Judaism .
The evidence is everywhere .
At Temple Sinai in Sharon , nine of the 11 members of this year 's confirmation class were girls .
At Temple Beth David in Canton , last Saturday 's Bible study drew 11 women and no men .
At Temple Isaiah in Lexington , the executive board for the last year had eight women and one man .
And at the Prozdor , an intensive supplementary high school program at Hebrew College in Newton , 59 percent of the students are female .
" After bar mitzvah , the boys just drop out , " said Sylvia Barack Fishman , a professor of contemporary Jewish life at Brandeis University and the coauthor of a study on " Gender Imbalance in American Jewish Life , " which was publicly released last week .
" American Jewish boys and men have fewer connections to Jews and Judaism in almost every venue and in every age , from school - age children through the adult years , " the study declares .
" Contemporary liberal American Judaism , although supposedly egalitarian , is visibly and substantially feminized . "
As with so much about gender , everything about this subject is highly controversial .
Some Jewish leaders dispute the statistics , citing contradictory evidence , or pointing to the continuing presence of men at the helm of the biggest community organizations and synagogues .
Others question whether a preponderance of women is a problem , or just progress .
No one is clear whether the trend , which has only emerged in the last few years , is a temporary phenomenon or a sea change .
But scholars and rabbis say they are concerned that diminished participation by men in Judaism threatens the health of the Jewish community .
The Brandeis study argues that " men 's decreased interest in Jews and Judaism walks hand in hand with apathy toward creating Jewish households and raising Jewish children . "
" Men need to be encouraged to come back into the synagogue , " said Stuart M. Matlins , editor in chief of Jewish Lights Publishing .
The Vermont - based publisher has a long list of women 's studies books , but this fall is publishing a guide for Jewish men , and next spring is publishing a modern men 's Torah commentary .
" The welcoming of women into leadership positions is something I have worked very hard on , but we do n't want to lose the men . "
The phenomenon is most pronounced in the Reform movement , which is the largest branch of Judaism in the United States , but is also being observed , to a lesser extent , in conservative Judaism .
In Orthodox Judaism , where traditional gender roles are maintained , a more familiar struggle is underway , as orthodox feminists agitate for greater roles in worship and possible ordination as rabbis .
There is no consensus about why women are now disproportionately represented in non-Orthodox settings , although scholars and Jewish leaders note that the pattern , although a departure from traditional Judaism , mirrors the pattern seen in mainline Protestantism .
" It 's an American phenomenon , " said Rabbi Daniel Freelander , vice president of the Union for Reform Judaism .
" It 's not clear that there 's anything uniquely Jewish about it . "
The umbrella group of Reform synagogue brotherhoods - organizations that have lost thousands of members over the last several decades - has renamed itself Men of Reform Judaism and published a men's Passover Haggadah intended for use at all - male Seders .
The Reform movement is trying to add more adventure to its Israel trips , saying that boys seem to be drawn to risk .
It is also improving athletics programs at its camps and is encouraging synagogues and camps to explore programming for men , including father - son events .
Ethan Bair , a 27 - year - old seminarian from Jamaica Plain , said that in his rabbinical class at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles , there are nine women and three men .
Male seminarians gather monthly to study together , he said .
" We talk about this a lot , but there are no clear solutions yet , " Bair said .
" I 'm sort of hoping it will correct itself . "
Some Jewish leaders argue that the preponderance of women in segments of Jewish community life reflects pent - up demand for involvement by a gender excluded from leadership for much of religious history .
Some suggest that in the Western world , spirituality , especially in more liberal denominations , has become associated with femininity .
Others believe that men are reluctant to join organizations unless they can play leadership roles , and with the entry of large numbers of women into synagogue life , there are fewer such opportunities for men .
" Perhaps one factor is that men are devaluing something that is done by women , while another factor may be that men have less free time then they did a generation ago , and they 're choosing to use that free time for child - rearing and family activities , " said Rabbi Joseph Meszler , of Temple Sinai of Sharon .
Meszler , the author of the Jewish Lights book on men's responsibilities coming out this fall , is an advocate of giving men a time to talk apart from women .
He has relaunched his synagogue 's defunct brotherhood , held a men's barbecue , and started men 's study groups .
" We need to reintroduce men to the synagogue , but on their own terms , " Meszler said .
A group of volunteer engineers are finishing the design for a home - brewed wind turbine that will bring electricity to off - the - grid Guatemalan villages by this summer .
After the U.S. engineers finish the design , local workers in the town of Quetzaltenango will manufacture the small - scale turbine .
It will produce 10 - 15 watts of electricity , enough to charge a 12 - volt battery that can power simple devices like LED lights .
" They 're replacing kerosene lamps , if anything at all , " said Matt McLean , a mechanical engineer by day and leader of the wind - turbine project by night .
" The biggest driver is just keeping the cost way down .
We 're shooting for under $ 100 , which is a challenge , but we 're in that range . "
The effort comes amidst recent efforts to bring new light and power to small towns in the developing world .
An estimated 1.6 billion people worldwide are without electricity , and many of them are forced to light their homes with kerosene .
Using one of these lamps is like smoking two packs of cigarettes a day , says the World Bank , and the lamps present a significant fire risk .
That 's why many startup companies , such as d.
Light , are trying to bring cheaper LED lights to homes , but they still need a solution for producing power locally .
That 's where organizations like Engineers Without Borders come in .
Founded in 2002 by Bernard Amadie , a professor at the University of Colorado - Boulder , it has grown to more than 10,000 members in over 250 chapters .
According to Cathy Leslie , the executive director of the U.S. organization , 340 projects are underway .
The turbine was created by the Appropriate Technology Design Team of EWB 's San Francisco chapter .
Team members like Malcolm Knapp and Heather Fleming spend their nights and weekends inside D2 M 's design shop trying to perfect low - tech gadgets for people 2,500 miles away .
D2 M , which is Knapp and Fleming 's employer , donates the lab space for after - hours use by the EWB team .
Unlike the large - scale assemblies found in wind farms , the roughly two - foot - wide and three - foot - tall turbine has a vertical axis .
McLean said that orientation worked better in the choppy conditions likely to meet the turbine out in the field , where it 'll be bolted on to buildings , towers or even trees .
The turbine , which Fleming refers to as a " she , " is undergoing its final tweaks .
Next Sunday , the prototype will undergo its next - to - last build before Fleming and another volunteer head down to the Guatemalan manufacturing facility , XelaTeco , with the building plans in hand .
The engineering team had to make their design simple enough that it could be assembled from cheap and widely available components .
As a result , their plans call for building the turbine out of hard plastic ( or canvas ) bolted on to a steel - tube structure .
The rotor , which creates mechanical energy from the movement of the blades , runs into an alternator ( actually a cheap DC motor running in reverse ) , which converts the mechanical energy into electricity .
" We 've had to simplify the way we were thinking and get rid of the idea that everything had to be as efficient as possible , " McLean said .
For instance , one key obstacle was creating a good bearing system to reduce friction within the turbine .
Steel bearings proved unavailable to the Guatemalan manufacturer .
Instead , the designers were forced to dig deep into their bag of tricks , eventually pulling out Teflon tape .
" It 's normally used for sealing pipes , " said McLean .
" But it 's a very low cost way of reducing friction . "
XelaTeco , for its part , received seed funding from the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group , a nonprofit dedicated to incubating for - profit businesses in developing countries .
AIDG 's goal is not just to bring cheap wind - powered generators to Guatemalan villages , but also to build self - sustaining businesses that are well integrated with the local economy .
" For us , this is hopefully the start of a lot more projects like this in other areas as we start more businesses , " said Peter Haas , executive director of the AIDG .

Sex crime has a telltale signature , even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States .
How extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetrators , Condoleezza Rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
I had a sense of deja vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison .
Even as the Bush Administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of " a few bad apples " low in the military hierarchy , I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top .
It 's not that I am a genius .
It 's simply that , having worked at a rape crisis centre and been trained in the basics of sex crime , I have learned that all sex predators go about things in recognisable ways .
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by the former secretary of defence , Donald Rumsfeld ; the Vice - President , Dick Cheney ; and Rice - who chaired the torture meetings .
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorised sexualised abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by females .
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld , in his own words , " checking in " on the sexualised humiliation of prisoners .
The Libertarian party does not support heavy military involvement with other countries at this time .
Libertarians oppose military aggression and believe that war is only justified in defense .
Notable Libertarian figures include Gary Johnson , William Weld , Steve Vaillancourt , Bob Barr , and Wayne Allyn Root .

Making a ' Killing ' on the ' War on Terror ' Editor ’s Note : One of George W. Bush ’s long - lasting legacies may be what President Dwight Eisenhower might have called the “ terror - industrial complex , ” a vast web of interlocking corporations , government agencies and consultancies that have turned the shock of 9/11 into a blank check against the U.S. Treasury .
In this guest essay , the Independent Institute ’s Ian S. Lustick looks at the ever - expanding size of this leviathan that is devouring tax dollars and American liberties : Nearly seven years after Sept. 11 , 2001 , what accounts for the vast discrepancy between the terrorist threat facing America and the scale of our response ?

Why , absent any evidence of a serious domestic terror threat , is the War on Terror so enormous , so all - encompassing , and still expanding ?
The fundamental answer is that al - Qaeda ’s most important accomplishment was not to hijack our planes , but to hijack our political system .
For a multitude of politicians , interest groups , professional associations , corporations , media organizations , universities , local and state governments and federal agency officials , the War on Terror is now a major profit center , a funding bonanza , and a set of slogans and sound bites to be inserted into budget , project , grant and contract proposals .
For the country as a whole , however , it has become a maelstrom of waste and worry that distracts us from more serious problems .
Consider the congressional response .
In mid-2003 , the Department of Homeland Security compiled a list of 160 potential terrorist targets , triggering intense efforts by representatives , senators and their constituents to find potential targets in their districts that might require protection and therefore be eligible for federal funding .
The result ?
Widened definitions and blurrier categories of potential targets and mushrooming increases in the infrastructure and assets deemed worthy of protection .
By late 2003 , the list had increased more than tenfold to 1,849 ; by 2004 it had grown to 28,364 ; by 2005 it mushroomed to 77,069 ; and by 2006 it was approximately 300,000 .
Across the country , hundreds of interest groups recast their traditional objectives and funding proposals to reflect the new imperatives of the new war .
The National Rifle Association declared that the War on Terror means more Americans should own firearms to defend against terrorists .
The gun control lobby argued that fighting the War on Terror means passing stricter gun control laws to keep assault weapons out of the hands of terrorists .
Schools of veterinary medicine called for quadrupling funding to train veterinarians to defend the country against terrorists using foot - and - mouth disease to decimate cattle herds .
Pharmacists advocated the creation of pharmaceutical SWAT teams to respond quickly with appropriate drugs to the victims of terrorist attacks .
According to a 2005 report by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) inspector general , 85 percent of the businesses granted low - interest SBA counterterrorism loans failed to establish their eligibility .
The SBA authorized 7,000 loans worth more than $ 3 billion , including $ 22 million in loans to Dunkin ’ Donuts franchises in nine states .
With a half - billion dollars in homeland security funds available for bulking up the counterterrorist and intelligence capabilities of state and local police and sheriff ’s departments , jurisdictions throughout the country scrambled to expand lists of potential threats .
By 2006 , thanks to this flood of federal funding , more than 100 police departments had established some type of intelligence unit .
Other cities found more imaginative ways to combat terrorism .
In May 2007 , Augusta , Ga. , officials authorized spending $ 3 million to protect fire hydrants against terrorist tampering .
This spending decision was recommended by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police , which cited a 2004 government report labeling hydrants “ a top vulnerability . ”
Not surprisingly , the American Waterworks Association warmly endorsed the idea of spending nearly $ 60 billion to protect fire hydrants nationwide .
Universities also have benefited from the ready availability of new grant and contract funds , creating graduate programs in homeland security , institutes on terrorism and counterterrorism , and proposals for academic conferences .
It is difficult to blame scientists and researchers for responding to government appeals to devote their talents to the War on Terror .
In 2004 , I attended a lecture given by the official in charge of encouraging scientists to shift their research activities in this direction .
We were told that no matter what topics we worked on , and whether we were natural scientists or behavioral scientists , our work likely could help in the fight against terrorism .
The official strongly encouraged us to submit grant proposals for projects based on “ outside the box ” thinking because , he said , there was plenty of money available .
Officially , the terrorist threat level is always and everywhere no less than elevated .
The threat is constantly dangled before us : ports , border crossings , the milk supply , cattle herds , liquid natural gas tankers , nuclear power plants , drinking water , tunnels , bridges , subways .
The result : continued support for ever - increasing funding .
Within little more than half a decade America adjusted psychologically , politically and militarily to the Soviet enemy and its capacity to incinerate our cities on a moment ’s notice .
We came to know the Soviet enemy very well and were able to adopt prudent , realistic and successful policies in the face of genuine threats of national destruction posed by Moscow ’s nuclear arsenal .
Rather than let our fears and anxieties of Muslim fanatics drive policy , we need the same sober approach to the real but lesser threat posed by terrorists .

Fake Nose Hair and Automatic Beds Zany Inventors Show off Ideas in Geneva
Over 700 inventors are showing off 1,000 wacky new products at this year 's International Exhibition of Inventions , which runs through Sunday in Geneva .
Pump prices eased slightly in most of the country , including California , but analysts warned that the small respite may be short - lived , especially after oil traded higher Monday in spite of a pledge by Saudi Arabia to increase production .
After a weekend summit where producers and oil - consuming nations discussed head - spinning crude prices , Saudi Arabian officials said that they would raise output by 200,000 barrels a day to 9.7 million .
But the market considered it a drop in the oil bucket given rising demand worldwide and supply concerns prompted by last week ’s attacks by militants on a Nigerian offshore oil rig and a Chevron Corp. pipeline .
“ The result of the meeting was a very small increase in production , some questionable commitments for capacity increases and no reasons for the speculators to move out of the commodity , ” said Bruce Bullock , director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .

Light , sweet crude for August delivery climbed $ 1.38 , or 1 % , to close Monday at $ 136.74 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil prices have doubled in the last year .
Over the last week , the average price of a gallon of self - serve regular gasoline slipped to $ 4.079 nationally and $ 4.585 in California , both posting a 0.3 - of - a- cent decline , according to the Energy Department ’s survey of filling stations , released Monday .
That marked the first price drop for the U.S. and California averages since March 24 , when the national average was $ 3.259 a gallon and the state average was $ 3.602 .
Gasoline prices fell everywhere except the Rocky Mountain region and parts of the West Coast .
On an even happier note for drivers , the Internal Revenue Service said Monday that it was raising the automobile mileage deduction for the last six months of 2008 .
For business vehicles , the rate is increasing to 58.5 cents a mile from 50.5 cents .
For individuals deducting medical and moving expenses , the rate is rising to 27 cents a mile from 19 cents .

Analysts offered few assurances that gasoline prices had finally peaked .
“ We may drift a little lower or a little higher in the next few weeks , so enjoy the next 30 to 40 days , ” said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst for Wall , N.J. - based Oil Price Information Service .
Prices could easily jump again because of hurricanes or other factors , he said .
That prospect was more than some motorists could stomach .
“ I ca n’t afford $ 100 fill - ups , ” said visual effects supervisor Greg Kimble , 50 , who lives on the Miracle Mile and has had to drive his 1969 Chevy Impala because his roommate moved to Texas , taking his Honda Civic with him .
Kimble is riding the bus more often to work and wishing members of Congress had to do the same .

“ The people in position to make the laws do not have to deal with life on a real - time basis the way that we do , ” he said .
Jo Carol Hunter of Newport Beach said she recently forked over $ 70 to fill up her 1998 Toyota Camry , expecting to get back some change .
It took the whole $ 70 and her tank still was n’t full .
Hunter ’s job requires her to visit doctors ’ offices to get referrals for a recovery center for plastic surgery patients .
Now she uses the telephone and e-mail more , cutting her driving to 50 miles a week from 100 .
“ How do we get it to stop or slow down or reverse itself ? ” asked Hunter , 62 .
“ We want to know who to blame , where to point fingers and who can get it fixed . ”

At a congressional hearing Monday , some lawmakers said they were planning legislation to rein in the behavior of oil commodity speculators , who are among the many suspects in the rise of oil prices .
Large investors held 71 % of futures contracts in April , more than double the level in 2000 , according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
“ Since August 2007 , oil has become the hedging instrument against the weakening dollar and rising inflation , ” Roger Diwan , a partner at consulting firm PFC Energy , told the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations .
Outside the U.S. , American motorists were getting little sympathy , particularly in Europe , where taxes help boost prices well above U.S. levels .
“ Stop complaining until you reach at least $ 10 per gallon , ” Asbjoern Grande , a personnel manager in Hoeyanger , Norway , said in an e-mail .
There , gas was selling for $ 9.79 a gallon , he said .

Danny Allen , one of my colleagues across the hall at PC World , is working on a story about computer products that never quite made it into the hands of customers .
As you might expect , Apple has its share of those products , and so Danny and I spent some time talking about legendary ( and not - so - legendary ) vaporware products from Apple , and I volunteered to dig up some information about a few of them .
The most talked - about and hyped Apple product to never exist is probably Copland , the first Mac OS 8 .
Those of you who were n’t following the Mac in the mid-’90s might be shocked to discover that the Mac OS 8 we remember today was not supposed to exist .
Mac OS 8 as we know it came together only after one of Apple ’s first attempts to replace the classic Mac OS crashed and burned .
That project was code - named Copland , and Apple spent more than a year promoting it as the future of the Mac .
( Somewhere in my archive I ’ve got an “ OS 8 : Hands - On Experience ” T - Shirt from Apple ’s Worldwide Developer Conference .
Attendees of that conference ended up being just about the only ones who ever got hands - on time with Copland . )
In any event , just outside my office lurks a metal filing cabinet full of CD - ROMs containing digital data for every issue of Macworld for more than a decade .
And so in order to help Danny out , I dug out files from the July 1996 issue of Macworld , featuring an up close look at the Mac OS 8 that would never come to be .
This is n’t to say that elements of Copland did n’t end up in the final Mac OS 8 .
The new grayscale interface look migrated to the eventual OS 8 , as did some features .
( Most of the major technical underpinnings promised by Copland would n’t arrive on the Mac until half a decade later , with the arrival of Mac OS X .
But as I waded through the old files , what struck me was one of the promised features of Copland I had completely forgotten : an automated backup system that now resonates as a first hint of the Time Machine to come .
The Macintosh Guide window lets you choose Assistants to automate various tasks , including ' backup my files . '
Also note the option to automatically check your eWorld mail !
Kids , if you do n't know what eWorld was , ask your parents .
Among the things the Computer Custodian can do is automate your backup .
It can also rebuild your desktop !
Talk about things I do n't miss doing in Mac OS X .
Picking a disk for Copland to use for backup is not that different from what you do to pick a disk for Time Machine .
Of course , it 's a hard - drive picker .
How complicated could it be ?
From this window , you 'd choose what you want Copland to back up .
This is more reminiscent of the .
Mac Backup utility 's options for backing up subsets of your files than it is of Time Machine 's whole - disk backup option .
Finally , you can let Copland tell you when your backup is complete via a pop-up message that appears like a floating sticky note when the job is done .
Amid the many Copland screen shots I dug out of that filing cabinet , there was also the first suggestion of something like Spotlight , a system - wide search function that went beyond simple file - name searching .
Now would these features have been as advanced as what we 've got in Leopard ?
Of course not .
It was the mid-'90s .
But it is interesting to notice that even back then , there were forces within Apple that were trying to make backing up your hard drive a more convenient process .
But it was not to be .
And now we only remember Copland when someone 's working on articles about famous products that never , ever reached the hands of the general public .
Update :
The news story below was originally posted on Friday , June 13 .
It is a brief summary of a longer news article written by Cade Metz of The Register .
After our article posted we were contacted by Technology Consultant George Ou , who was briefly referenced in our news story .
Ou felt that Metz 's coverage -- and therefore our coverage as well -- did not accurately represent his statements or some of the arguments for network prioritization .
For the sake of balanced news coverage , we are adding a link to Ou's blog here , where he provides another perspective on this story .
Google has been very vocal on its stance for net neutrality .
Now , Richard Whitt -- Senior Policy Director for Google -- announces that Google will take an even more active role in the debate by arming consumers with the tools to determine first - hand if their broadband connections are being monkeyed with by their ISPs :
" We 're trying to develop tools , software tools ... that allow people to detect what 's happening with their broadband connections , so they can let [ ISPs ] know that they 're not happy with what they 're getting -- that they think certain services are being tampered with , " Google senior policy director Richard Whitt said this morning during a panel discussion at Santa Clara University , an hour south of San Francisco .
In an article written by Cade Metz , a reporter for The Register , Metz explains that when the net neutrally debate first popped up at Google , Google actually considered playing along with the network - throttling ISPs :
" We were pretty well known on the internet .
We were pretty popular .
We had some funds available .
We could essentially buy prioritization that would ensure we would be the search engine used by everybody .
We would come out fine – a non-neutral world would be a good world for us . "
But more idealist minds prevailed at Google , and the company has advocated network neutrality ever since --" or as Whitt likes to call it ' broadband neutrality ' . "
Whitt did n't mention when the network analysis tools would become available .

On the night before she died , she came into their room , kissed her father
Raymond on the cheek and cheerfully told him : " I love you , Dad . "
The following day Hannah 's mother Heather went to check on her daughter and found her hanging by a tie from the top rail of her bunk bed .

From Fresh - faced to suicidal : Hannah
Bond pre emo , left , and weeks before her death
She screamed for her husband to come , but try as he might it was too late : there was simply nothing that he could do to save Hannah 's life .
In the unending bleakness of the weeks that have followed , the couple have fought to make sense of what happened .
Why on earth did their daughter — a popular , intelligent and attractive girl — do such a thing ?
They could find only one clue : Hannah was what is known as an " emo " .
Some describe it as a cult or a sect , but in reality the term — derived from
the word " emotional " — encapsulates a trend that is becoming hugely popular
among Britain 's schoolchildren .
A trans-Atlantic import , its followers dress in black , favouring tight jeans ,
T - shirts , studded belts and sneakers or skater shoes .
Hair is all - important : often dyed black and straightened , it is worn in a long fringe brushed to one side of the face .
Music also plays a critical role .
Emos like guitar - based rock with emotional lyrics .
American bands such as My Chemical Romance , Good Charlotte and Blink 182 are particular favourites .
No doubt many adults would ask : " So what ? "
On the surface , it all sounds typically teenage — angst - ridden ,
over - dramatic and tribal .
Scroll down for more ...
Heartbroken : Ray and Heather Bond said Hannah told them emo was ' just a fashion '
No different , in fact , to the Goth subculture
that first emerged in Britain
during the early 1980s .
There is , though , growing concern
that there is a deeply unhealthy
undertone to the emo movement .
Some time before her death ,
Hannah 's parents , who live in Kent ,
noticed scarring on the inside of her
wrists .
When they questioned her
about it , honest and open as ever , she
told them she 'd inflicted the wounds
herself and that it was part of an emo
" initiation ceremony " .
Only after her death would they discover
how she had secretly chatted
online to emo followers all over the
world , talking about death and of the
" black parade " — a place where emos
believe they go after they die .
A check of Hannah 's home page on
social networking site Bebo revealed
her pseudonym , Living Disaster , and
that she 'd decorated it with a picture
of an emo girl with bloody wrists .
Another picture showed a child's
exercise book scrawled with the
words : " Dear Diary , today I give up . "
While Hannah 's wrist injuries may
have been slight , the issue of selfharm
among adolescents is causing
growing concern in British schools .
Scroll down for more
My Chemical Romance made it to No.1 in the UK chart with Welcome To The Black Parade in October 2006 - the ' black parade ' is a place where all emos believe they will go when they die
New figures show that the number of
children admitted to hospital due to
injuries inflicted on themselves has
risen by a third in five years .
In 2002/03 there were 11,891 such
admissions ; in 2006 /07 this had risen
to 15,955 .
In both periods , there were
more than three times as many
admissions of girls as of boys .
Crucially , those who self - harm are
more likely to go on to attempt suicide .
While there is a multitude of reasons
for this epidemic ( exam - related stress
and bullying to name but two ) , it is
hardly surprising that the emergence
of a sub-culture that appears to
glamorise self - harm and even suicide
is being regarded with alarm .
Inevitably , criticisms of emo culture
are laughed off by those who consider
themselves to be at the heart of it .
It 's just a music thing , they say , and anyone
who takes it further has something
inherently wrong with them .
" If you listen to the lyrics , you will
see there is nothing that promotes
suicide ; and even if there was , no
right - minded person would listen to it
and think : ' Now I 'm going to kill
myself , ' ' a self - confessed emo wrote
last week on a music website following
the inquest into Hannah 's death .
" I do n't think anyone can say that
there is a link between emo and
suicide — it 's just a myth .
" Emo has
become an easy target for ridicule like
this ; but the bottom line is emotional
does not mean suicide . "
That is true , of course .
But as
any parent will tell you ,
adolescent children can be
highly irrational .
They are also
easily influenced and may be illequipped
to deal with powerful
emotions that can be magnified by a
sense of " membership " to a sub-group
that revels in self - pity .
It is something that Lorraine
Harrison is all too aware of .
She has
three daughters , the youngest of
whom is 11 - year - old Levi , a girl who
classes herself as emo .
Recently , Levi asked her mother :
" Just why do people kill themselves ? "
" When she asked me that , it made me
shudder , " says Lorraine , 46 , from
Alston in Cumbria .
" I managed to keep
calm and explained to her that people 's
minds are very disturbed , and
often they do n't really want to die .
But
inside I felt sick with worry that Levi is
thinking about such things . "
From being the sort of girl who
dressed in pink and played with
Barbie dolls , now Levi will wear only
black .
Her favourite T - shirt is patterned with skulls , and she
spends hours in her room listening
to music by My Chemical Romance .
" Their lyrics seem to be associated
with depression and self - harm , and
I feel shock when I listen to them , "
says her mother .
" Levi seems to
have gone from being a lively girl
who enjoyed having friends around ,
to someone who has become quite
introverted . "
When the topic of suicide was
raised , Lorraine became so concerned
that she telephoned Levi's
father , David , from whom she
is separated .
" He reminded me that I used to be
a rebel , too , " she says .
" I was a punk
rocker for a while , and he reassured
me it was probably just a phase
that Levi would grow out of .
" But I do n't feel it is like the punk rock
movement .
That was about a zest
for living and seeing life from a
different angle .
We did n't harp on
miserably about dying . "
Efforts to snap Levi out of her
emo torpor have so far met with
little success .
Before Christmas , Lorraine bought her daughter a
wardrobe of brightly - coloured
designer clothes and jeans , but they
have barely been worn .
She has banned Levi from dying
her hair black , but is worried about
clamping down further in case it
causes further rebellion .
Levi insists that her mother is
worrying unnecessarily .
" I think many of the concerns
around emos are n't true , " she says .
" To me , emos skateboard a lot ,
dress in darker colours and listen to
alternative rock music .
" It 's also true
they probably think about feelings
more than other people .
" I do get
teased for being an emo because
some people at school think it 's just
about suicide and self - harm .
" But I think you would have to be
depressed already to self - harm —
and I 'm not depressed .
" I like going out dressed in emo
clothes because it causes a stir .
There are n't many emos where I
live , so people look at you .
" It makes
you feel individual . "
That sense of rebellion and
non-conformity is something that
21 - year - old Jennina Taylor - Wells
can relate to .
Now a student at
Oxford Brookes University , she
became an emo at 16 .
For her , it was
also about making a statement .
" I was going through an unhappy
period at school , " she recalls .
" I grew
up in the wealthy area of Cheshunt
in Hertfordshire , and I was surrounded
by spoilt rich kids .
I felt
that being an emo gave me a
defined individuality . "
Looking back , she acknowledges
that the " cult " , as she calls it , was
heavily linked to self - harm and
depression .
Many of her friends
were actually taking prescription
antidepressants .
" In hindsight , I can see that being
involved with such a cult can be
dangerous if you are a vulnerable
personality .
" There is a very dark
side to being an emo , which
is about dressing in black and
listening to music with very deep
lyrics .
That could tip a vulnerable
person over the edge . "
In recent years , the growing reach
of the internet and social networking
sites such as MySpace , Facebook
and Bebo has meant that the
influences to which teenagers are
exposed are not controlled by mere geography .
While this can have
positive effects , Professor Stephen
Briggs , a clinician in the adolescent
department of the Tavistock Clinic ,
says it can also adversely affect the
way teenagers develop .
" With mobile phones , the internet
and Facebook you can create a
virtual world that means you need
never be alone , " he says .
" It means
that you do n't ever have to be out
of sight — and that does n't allow an
adolescent to experience that sense
of being a bit separate , of finding
one 's self .
" It means you do n't have a chance
to mature on your own ; to know
who you are . "
Just what directed Hannah
Bond 's behaviour on that tragic
September night last year will
never be known .
At the inquest in Maidstone ,
Kent , Vanessa Everett , head
teacher of Mascalls Secondary
School where Hannah was a pupil ,
admitted there had been problems
with emos harming themselves .
Everett added she thought
it " probable " that Hannah might
have been influenced by another
emo girl at the same school who
had attempted suicide a year
earlier .
According to a fellow
student , she was a close friend
of Hannah 's and one of a large
number of emo pupils .
" The amount of boys and girls who
seem to be into it is incredible , " the
teenager told the Mail .
" I reckon
there must be 15 to 20 per cent of
pupils who are emos .
A boy in my
class has recently got into it and
he 's changed completely .
" He used to be normal but now he
harms himself , he 's dyed his hair
black and he wears dark clothes and
a really long black coat .
" He 's got loads of plasters up his arms and
cuts and marks .
I tried to ask him
about them but he ignored me . "
It also emerged that in the
months leading up to her death ,
Hannah had begun to use the
internet more , secretively surfing
the web on the family 's laptop .
Her mother told the
inquest : " About a month
before [ Hannah 's death ]
I noticed that she was
addicted to it [ the internet ] .
" There was a definite change in
her desire to be online . "
On the night of her death , Hannah
had spent the evening at a friend's
house — also an emo and one who
had also cut himself , telling his
mother : " We 're emos , we all do it . "
Hannah had wanted to sleep over
and was upset at having to leave .
When they got home , Mrs Bond
told Hannah to go to bed , adding
that they would discuss the matter
in the morning .
The teenager
turned to her and said : " I feel like
killing myself . "
Breaking down in tears , Mrs Bond
told the inquest : " I think I said :
' Do n't be so silly — we 'll talk about
it in the morning . ' "
An hour later , Mrs Bond went into
her daughter 's bedroom at the family
home in East Peckham , near
Maidstone , and found Hannah's
lifeless body hanging from the
metal railing of the top bunk .
Returning a verdict of suicide ,
Coroner Roger Sykes said : " She
had become an aficionado of the
emo fad and she was a user of the
internet , which enabled her to
contact other emos all over the
world , in particular America .
" But she was a very well - liked girl
who had many friends and was
doing well in school .
In her
mother 's words , she had 'everything
to live for ' .
" The emo overtones concerning
death and associating it with
glamour I find very disturbing .
It is
not glamorous ; just simply a tragic
loss of such a young life . "
The 200 friends and family who
attended Hannah 's funeral will no
doubt echo that .
But not everyone
seems to have learned the lesson .
In a tribute book set up at
Hannah 's school , one pupil left the
following message : " I hope you
enjoy the black parade . "
Naive , misguided or just plain
stupid .
But then , that 's always been
the trouble with some teenagers .
And the danger of emo .
Worldwide protests to rally against China 's ' flagrant ' human rights violations
Demonstrations , petition drives , and prayer vigils will mark the " International Protest Against China 's Violent Treatment of North Korea Refugees " on Friday and Saturday at Chinese consulates and embassies around the world , including Canada , France , Germany , Japan , Spain , South Korea , the UK and the US .
" The demonstrations are a way of pressuring the Chinese Government to comply with their obligations under the UN Convention on Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol , " said Lindsay Vessey , advocacy coordinator for Open Doors USA , which is a member of the North Korea Freedom Coalition .
" Under this convention , the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHRC ) should have access to the North Koreans refugees hiding in China - estimated at 100,000 to 300,000 - and be able to protect and help them find asylum in other countries like the US and South Korea .
" Yet , China is deporting refugees back to North Korea where they face terrible punishment . "
At least 500,000 North Koreans are believed to have crossed the border over to China in the past 10 years .
Although the UN Special Rapporteur on North Korea considers the North Koreans who flee to China " refugees " deserving of protection , China has signed an agreement with its communist ally to return refugees back to North Korea where they face imprisonment , torture , and sometimes execution for leaving the country - a state crime .
China , in defense of its actions , has claimed North Koreans entering its country are " economic migrants " and not refugees and thus it has the right to return them .
" For several years both the Chinese and North Korean authorities have implemented measures to close the border , " notes Suzanne Scholte , chairman of the North Korean Freedom Coalition .
" Currently the Chinese authorities are working more aggressively with North Korean agents to hunt down and repatriate the North Korean refugees .
" We have heard several reports that North Korean agents are posing as refugees to draw out both humanitarian workers and true refugees as part of this escalating crackdown .
Even refugees in jail are being used as ' bait ' to draw out potential rescuers , so that Chinese authorities can arrest them , " she said .
North Korea is currently one of the most repressive regimes in the world and is ranked by the ministry Open Doors as the world 's worst persecutor of Christians .
Citizens of the communist state are forced to adhere to a personality cult that revolves around worshipping current dictator Kim Jong Il and his deceased father , Kim Il Sung .
Human rights activists have urged people not to travel to Beijing to attend the 2008 Olympics unless China grants the United Nation 's refugee agency , UNHCR ( United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ) , access to North Koreans hiding in its territory .
" The Chinese government needs to know that Christians around the world are aware and care about the government 's flagrant human rights violations and that we are committed to praying and assisting these refugees , " adds Scholte .
She is urging people from around the world to join those who are protesting against the injustice and praying for the refugees , many of whom are Christians .
" We need everyone to join and support these events as the situation in China is worse than ever for North Korean refugees , " she says .
" Some cities will deliver petitions ; some will stage protests and demonstrations .
Wherever you are in the world , please take part in this effort .
" Please remember the suffering of the North Korean refugees and take a stand for them so that together we can help end the most avoidable human rights tragedy occurring in the world today . "
Demonstrations will also take place in Belgium , Holland and Norway .
Mike Larson examines what real interest rates are and what they mean for the economy .
Mr. Larson takes a closer look at real and nominal interest rates and how they can affect the economy .
The Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates .
The benchmark federal funds rate was 5.25 % last summer .
It 's all the way down to 2.25 % now and , chances are , the Fed will cut that rate again when it concludes its next policy meeting on April 30 .
The only question is whether they will issue a quarter - point or half - point cut at that time .
Consider this : 2.25 % sounds low , and it is .
But what if interest rates , by at least one measure , are really - 4.65 % ?
Or that by another measure , they 've hit a stunning - 12.55 % ?
These numbers are accurate :
Looking at the current , nominal level of rates along with what inflation is doing to get an idea of whether monetary policy is easy or tight is the concept of " real " interest rates versus " nominal " ones .
When real rates are negative , it 's a sign that policy is easy .
That can drive inflation pressures and inflation expectations higher .
When real rates are positive , it means that monetary policy is restrictive .
That , in turn , tends to keep inflation controlled
Today the nominal federal funds rate may be 2.25 % .
But key inflation data released over the past several days shows :
Import prices skyrocketed 14.8 % from a year ago in the month of March .
That was up from 13.4 % a month earlier and the highest rate of import inflation since the government started tracking it in 1982 .
Producer prices jumped 6.9 % from March 2007 .
That year - over - year gain in the Producer Price Index is just shy of the 7.4 % rate in January , which , in turn , was the biggest rise since 1981 .
The Consumer Price Index rose 4 % since last March .
Computing the real funds rate using import prices results in a - 12.55 % rate ( 2.25 % nominal funds rate minus 14.8 % import inflation rate ) .
Using the PPI , results in a - 4.65 % rate ( 2.25 % minus 6.9 % ) .
Even using the CPI , real interest rates are still negative -- - 1.75 % ( 2.25 % minus 4 % ) .
Crude oil hit a fresh , all - time high of $ 115 a barrel this week and the price of many different commodities have gone through the roof while the dollar has continued to fall .
This is not just strong demand .
It 's not just strong overseas economic growth .
It 's the fact that nominal rates are much lower in the U.S. than elsewhere and that real rates are hugely negative .
Larson believes , " Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has abandoned any semblance of caring about inflation and decided that the real concern is fighting deflation by any means necessary , including slashing interest rates to as little as - 12.55 % .
Investors are piling into commodities and fleeing dollar investments because they are desperately trying to maintain their purchasing power in the face of a Fed that appears dead - set on destroying it . "
" You should put your money in investments that can protect you .
That includes hard assets like gold and other commodities , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ( TIPS ) , and foreign bonds , which rise in dollar terms when the greenback loses value , " Mr. Larson states .

Iraq is insisting on the right to veto any US military operations throughout its territory under a " status of forces " agreement currently being negotiated between Baghdad and Washington , according to a senior member of the Iraqi government .
The agreement will last for a maximum of two years and can be terminated by either side with six months ' notice , Hussain al - Shahristani , Iraq 's oil minister , told the Guardian yesterday .
His remarks come amid intensive closed - door negotiations between the Iraqi and US governments which have led to complaints in the US Congress as well as Iraq that the Bush administration is tying the next US president 's hands by seeking to maintain long - term bases in Iraq for possible attacks on Iran and other neighbouring states .
But Shahristani insisted yesterday : " Neither the constitution nor our people will allow any violation of our sovereignty .
Obviously foreign troops on Iraqi soil carrying out operations without the prior consent and approval of the elected government is a violation .
" Any arrests , any operations internally or externally against our neighbours without prior agreement of the Iraqi government will be considered a violation ...
Land and sea movements and air space is all part of Iraq 's sovereignty . "
The status of forces agreement , known as Sofa , will flesh out a more general " strategic framework " pact on all aspects of the US - Iraqi relationship that is also being worked out secretly .
The two agreements are seen as " legacy issues " allowing Bush to claim success and a legitimation of the US occupation when the UN mandate runs out at the end of this year .
Before the talks started this spring , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , sought to remove nationalist suspicions in Iraq by saying the US had " no interest in permanent bases " .
Shahristani 's disclosure that Iraq wants the Sofa to be " only short , for one or two years " is designed to put a time limit on the US presence and remove ambiguity about what constitutes a temporary or a permanent base .
US commanders have warned repeatedly that the relative peace which has prevailed in Baghdad is fragile because extremists , including al - Qaida in Iraq and Shia militant groups , remain capable of high - profile attacks , the latest of which took place yesterday afternoon on a busy street in a Shia area in west Baghdad when a car bomb exploded , killing at least 51 people .
The blast shattered the relative calm experienced in Baghdad since a ceasefire on May 11 ended fighting between US and Iraqi forces and Shia militants .
The Sofa has aroused fierce controversy in Iraq .
No drafts have been published and only a handful of MPs have seen it .
The Iraqi government has been forced to give parliament a vote on the final text , although Washington says it need not go to the US Senate as it is not a treaty .
A letter denouncing various leaked provisions , signed by more than 100 of the 275 Iraqi MPs was handed to US senators recently .
Since the talks began in March , Washington has reduced its demands .
" The first US draft was n't even remotely acceptable , " said Shahristani , who is a member of the United Iraqi Alliance , the Shia movement that is the largest bloc in parliament .
The prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , was given full control over negotiations by Iraq 's political council for national security last weekend .
Recent US concessions will allow Iraqi courts to have jurisdiction over thousands of private contractors in Iraq , currently immune from prosecution .
They will also transfer the 21,000 detainees in US jails to Iraqi custody .
But with Iraqi prisons already overcrowded , this may involve a paper transaction .
Iraq is still insisting US troops be chargeable in Iraqi courts .
The US is unlikely to concede this .
The Bush administration is putting the Iraqi government under intense pressure to agree to the security pacts by July 31 .
But Shahristani said : " There is no way for the Sofa to be presented to parliament before its summer recess . "
The oil minister also disclosed that the Iraqi government expects to sign its first contracts with western oil companies within the next two weeks .
These will be for technical support and repair .
Bidding for developing new fields is under way but " it will be open to competitive tendering " .
Shahristani denied this was backdoor privatisation , since the Iraqi National Oil Corporation would retain control of 80 % of Iraq 's discovered reserves .
He criticised the Kurdistan regional government for signing agreements with small oil firms for developing fields in northern Iraq without Baghdad 's consent .
Backstory
The US wants to cover its military presence in Iraq with a bilateral pact with Baghdad once the annually renewed UN resolution runs out on December 31 .
This requires the Iraqi parliament 's approval , and has aroused suspicion and opposition .
Moqtada al - Sadr 's nationalist movement is holding weekly protests calling for an end to the occupation .
Other parties are uncertain whether to accept a deal .
Major issues are whether the roughly 50 US bases would be permanent , and under whose control .
Disputes also centre on whether the US could use them freely , and for what operations - inside Iraq , or against other countries .
The Iraqi government wants US crimes to be tried in Iraqi courts .
The US says yes for US contractors , no for US troops .
Bush wants a deal by July 31 before the US party conventions .
The Iraqi parliament is unlikely to review the text until the autumn .

Huge investment in closed - circuit TV technology has failed to cut UK crime , a senior police officer has warned .
Det Ch Insp Mick Neville said the system was an " utter fiasco " - with only 3 % of London 's street robberies being solved using security cameras .
Although Britain had more cameras than any other European country , he said " no thought " had gone into how to use them .
Det Ch Insp
Neville heads a unit which is piloting a new database to track offenders using CCTV .
Speaking at the Security Document World Conference in London , Det Ch Insp Neville , the head of the Met 's Visual Images , Identifications and Detections Office ( Viido ) , said one of the problems was that criminals were not afraid of cameras .
There 's no fear of CCTV .
Why do n't people fear it ?
[ They think ] the cameras are not working
Det Ch Insp Mick Neville
Metropolitan Police
He also said more training was needed for officers who often avoided trawling through CCTV images " because it 's hard work " .
" CCTV was originally seen as a preventative measure , " the Guardian quotes him as saying .
" Billions of pounds has been spent on kit , but no thought has gone into how the police are going to use the images and how they will be used in court .
It 's been an utter fiasco : only 3 % of crimes were solved by CCTV .
" There 's no fear of CCTV .
Why do n't people fear it ?
[ They think ] the cameras are not working . "
New database CCTV operators also needed more feedback to ensure they felt " valued " , he said .
Det Ch Insp
Neville 's unit is now piloting a new database of CCTV images which police hope will help track and identify offenders .
The unit is also looking at ways of using software which can follow distinctive brand logos on the clothing of unidentified suspects .
The contribution of CCTV to the detection of crime is likely to equal that of DNA and fingerprints
Graeme Gerrard , Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire Police
In addition , from next month , his team will be putting images of suspects in muggings , rape and robbery cases on the internet .
" If criminals see that CCTV works they are less likely to commit crimes , " Det Ch Insp Neville added .
Graeme Gerrard is the Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire Police , and ACPO lead on CCTV .
He believes the contribution of CCTV to the detection of crime is " likely to equal that of DNA and fingerprints " .
But he admitted that it is not without flaws :
" The CCTV network in the UK has been built up in a piecemeal way , driven by local authorities and the private sector more than by the police .
" Better training and more intelligent use of the technology are important to the future development of how we use CCTV , " he added .
4.2 million cameras According to the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) , CCTV has not failed .
They say it has helped reduce crime in the capital .
" The comments made by DCI Mike Neville reflect the need for police to make the best possible use of available footage and exploit its benefits both in crime prevention and detection . " an MPS spokesperson said .
If criminals see that CCTV works they are less likely to commit crimes
Det Ch Insp Mick Neville
Metropolitan Police Ken Pease , from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science , at University College London , said looking through hours of footage could be " tedious " for officers .
" If you look at the data , and I have done some of the research myself , they do have an effect .
" The thing is the effect wears off , and it wears off for the reasons that are pretty clear - which is the non-use of the very tedious job of sifting through footage for less than very serious crimes . "
One study suggests there may be more than 4.2 million CCTV cameras in the UK - the majority on private property - but until Viido was set up in September 2006 there had been no dedicated police unit to deal with the collection and dissemination of CCTV evidence .
If Viido , based at Southwark Police Station , is judged to be a success it could lead to the development of specialist CCTV units across the country .

Chinese hackers may have been responsible for the recent power outage in Florida , and the widespread blackout that struck the northeastern U.S. in 2003 , according to a new report in the National Journal that shows the intelligence community taking cyberwar hysteria to new and dizzying heights .
The story , citing computer security professionals , who in turn cite unnamed U.S. intelligence officials , says that China 's People 's Liberation Army may have cracked the computers controlling the U.S. power grid to trigger the cascading 2003 blackout that cut off electricity to 50 million people in eight states and a Canadian province .
Careful examination of this photo reveals the " trees " are actually Chinese hackers .
Courtesy NERC" Investigators blamed ' overgrown trees ' that came into contact with strained high - voltage lines near facilities in Ohio owned by FirstEnergy Corp. , " the story reads .
" There has never been an official U.S. government assertion of Chinese involvement in the outage , but intelligence and other government officials contacted for this story did not explicitly rule out a Chinese role .
One security analyst in the private sector with close ties to the intelligence community said that some senior intelligence officials believe that China played a role in the 2003 blackout that is still not fully understood . "
It 's official : Cyberterror is the new yellowcake uranium .
Ever since intelligence chief Michael McConnell decided on cyberterrorism as the latest raison d'etre for warrantless NSA surveillance , we 've seen increasingly brazen falsehoods and unverifiable cyberattack stories coming from him and his subordinates , from McConnell 's bogus claim that cyberattacks cost the U.S. economy $ 100 billion a year , to one intelligence official 's vague assertion that hackers have caused electrical blackouts in unnamed countries overseas .
This time , though , they 've attached their tale to the most thoroughly investigated power incident in U.S. history .
The official investigation into the February outage in Florida is ongoing , so I 'll be watching with eager eyes for signs of Chinese hackers when the final report comes out .
But there 's no need to wait to evaluate the claim that hackers caused the northeastern blackout of 2003 .
The North American Electric Reliability Council spent six months investigating the outage .
The detailed 228 - page final NERC report found a complex confluence of events responsible , but not a single hacker .
It traced the root cause of the outage to the utility company FirstEnergy 's failure to trim back trees encroaching on high - voltage power lines in Ohio .
When the power lines were ensnared by the trees , they tripped .
In fairness , there was a cyber component to the blackout .
In 2004 , I was the first journalist to report on a bug in a GE energy management system that resulted in an alarm system failure at FirstEnergy 's control room , which kept the company from responding to the outage before it could spread to other utilities .
But the bug – a subtle race condition – was a poor candidate for a Chinese logic bomb .
For one thing , it was n't just at FirstEnergy .
It was in a GE product called the XA / 21 in use at more than 100 utilities across the globe .
And it did n't cause the blackout , it just hampered the response .
So China would have to have planted the race condition in a product used around the world , then , using the most devious malware ever devised , arranged for trees to grow up into exactly the right power lines at precisely the right time to trigger the cascade .
Or maybe I 'm being naive .
Maybe there were no trees .
Implicit in this new cyberterror tale is the suggestion that everybody who investigated the 2003 blackout , including FirstEnergy , the Department of Energy , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , and the civilian North American Electric Reliability Council , were part of a massive conspiracy to conceal a ( pointless ) Chinese hack attack from the American people .
Now that we 're seeing " overgrown trees " between the same scare quotes conspiracy theorists bracket around " lone gunman " and " moon landing , " the cybarmageddon hawks have squarely set foot in the realm of 9/11 truthers .
I 'm waiting for them to blame Chinese hackers for " Hurricane " Katrina .

Meet the dog that thinks there 's nothing sweetah than a cheetah
Sahara and Alexa are the best of mates , but they have a very unconventional friendship .
That is because Sahara is cheetah and Alexa is a giant Anatolian Shepherd guard dog .
Destroying the notion that cats and dogs can only be the best of enemies , these two residents of Cincinnati Zoo in the US have been old muckers since they were both barely two months old .
Both seven years old now , Alexa and Sahara were raised together as part of a conservation programme at the zoo designed to help ensure Sahara 's African cousins survival in the wild .
play - time : Alexa an Anatolian Shepherd Dog , and Sahara a Cheetah who have grown up together at Cincinnati Zoo and are best friends
Linda Castaneda , 31 , who is part of the Cat Ambassador scheme , which works in conjunction with the Cheetah Conservation Fund of Africa , explained : ' The point of the Cat Ambassador Programme is to protect cheetahs from over - zealous farmers in Namibia and South Africa .
' We want to show the farmers that the cheetahs at least have respect for the dog and that more importantly the dog has no fear of the cat .
' Hopefully , if the farmers all take on the Anatolian guard dog then we can eradicate the need to shoot them because they wo n't be getting near to the livestock . '
As Linda goes on to say : ' The dog is a fantastic non-lethal predatory solution . '
' It has been bred in Turkey for thousands of years as a sturdy herd dog and would never leave livestock that it was trained to guard . '
Sahara and Alexa travel to schools around America showing off their unconventional friendship to fascinated school children .
Weighing in at 100 lbs Alexa would have no problems defending herself if Sahara the cheetah who is a decidedly skinny 85 lbs ever decided to get a bit frisky .
Younger days : Alexa and Sahara when they her babies at Cincinnati Zoo
Linda added : ' When they play together it is all in good fun until one or the other takes it a step too far .
' They both have an eyeball to eyeball moment and then both understand that play time is over . '
Unlike their younger days , Alexa and Sahara need their own time and space and each have their own enclosures within the zoo .
Meeting up for their educational tours , when they are reunited it is like they have never been apart .
However , truly the oddest part of their relationship is Alexa the dogs attitude towards her canine brothers and sisters .
Because Alexa is actually a zoo animal and spends the majority of her time with cats she can not be let near other domesticated dogs in case she tries to eat them !
So that begs the question , does Alexa think she is a cat or does Sahara think she is a dog ?
School time :
The odd couple meet a group of amazed schoolchildren
Sadly this looks like my home state of Florida .
It 's legal to shoot people in the back here .
We can thank Jeb Bush for that legal innovation .
My Nana would probably knit this herself , God rest her zombie bones .
Before you begin , I grew up with rifles and guns .
I actually had a shotgun rack in my bedroom from 7th grade on .
I 've shot a lot of types of guns .
Revolvers , semi-automatic handguns , various caliber rifles .
Everything short of an assault weapon .
Discourse : I contemplated buying a handgun , but then realized that I 'd just find myself in bad situations .
A bad guy who feels under control is more predictable .
A bad guy who sees someone fumbling for a gun gets spooked and then really bad things happen .
I was taught that if you decided to pull your weapon you have already decided to kill .
The rest is just the motions to implement your will .
I 've decided that I can't kill , ergo no gun .
I agree with harlyquin .
Gun shops will preview movies and look for the weapons used .
Because sure as sh*t there will be a surge in purchases in that particular weapon .
The individuals who buy them tend to be in their young 20s , or parents buying that special " reward " for their child .
Should we really personalize a weapon that is designed to kill ?
I would be irritated if an Eagle Driver painted a Disney Theme all over his / her plane and visited day schools .
An F - 15 is a machine designed to kill , as is a gun .
We should not forget these things .
As an individual who has friends who died from gunshots , and have had guns pulled on myself , I can say that they really does n't make a difference owning one .
You just tend to get yourself in more trouble ( overconfidence . )
I 've had friends march around sketchy parts of town thinking they are invincible because they have a gun on them .
They found out that they were very wrong .
Normal folks tend to negotiate with their target when they draw ( leave me alone or I 'll shoot ! )
Opposition does not typically think that way .
So you end up getting shot anyways .
My friend , who was a marine scout sniper ( 63 kills ) , has one handgun , but it 's locked in a case .
The way he looks at it is that there is no way in hell he can get a gun trained on a target , fire and get his three pops in ( 2 body mass center , 1 head shot ) if opponent barged into his house while he is watching TV with his kids , or at the drive thru .
He keeps it as a reminder of a former life , and perhaps for bizarre emergencies ( social breakdown after a disaster i.e. hurricanes . )
He knows that the kids are more likely to kill themselves with the gun .
And I can promise you a large dog will be a much more credible deterrent , and will not hesitate if the time ever comes .
People love them ( dogs ) , and you keep them in public ( chicks dig them . )
Doing that with a gun does n't get the attention you want .
Even though it ’s April 16th and there ’s 16 inches of snow on the ground here in Ithaca , NY , I ’d like to think that I might have a use for these innovative products sometime soon .
That is , if I can even get my hands on them .
First up is a “ Professional Solar Garden Shower System ” called the Solar Fizz .
This portable showering unit uses reflector tubes to capture solar energy and heat water to 70 + degrees Celsius .
Each tube can hold 15 liters — with a complete system capable of providing hot water for an entire family .
Each of the units displayed on the website is claimed to be portable ; but even the 15 liter version might be a little unwieldy if you plan on roughing it somewhere .
The only problem is that the technology is limited to a few countries in Europe and Asia .
They ’re looking for distributors in North America ; no any of you eco-entrepreneurs out there — have a look !
Outdoor showers are the bomb - diggity — especially pollution - free , hot showers .
Next , from the people that brought you the Solar Fizz comes the SunFence .
While not quite as catchy a name , the SunFence is an innovative take on pool heating .
We all know pools require fences , so why not take advantage of that standing real estate and turn those barriers into water heaters ?
Using a small pump that pulls water from your pool , the SunFence uses solar energy to heat the water as it pases through various levels .
While this technology can’t beat a solar cover in terms of zero energy use ; it ’s probably more efficient at heating a pool quickly and without much hassle .
Both of these technologies appear circa 2004 , so I have no idea if the concepts are even still around or for sale .
Still , the websites make for interesting reading and I would n’t be surprised if we see more of these innovations make their way into U.S. markets soon .
Anyone else ever heard of the fizz ?
Based on an earlier post , you might also try making one of these by yourself !
Scientists are one step closer to attaining the ultimate goal : producing temperatures high enough to sustain fusion , the reaction that powers our Sun and the possible future for global energy production .
Researchers at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire , UK , have attained temperatures higher than the surface of the Sun , 10 million Kelvin ( or Celsius ) , by using a powerful one petawatt laser called Vulcan .
This experiment goes beyond the quest for fusion power ; generating these high temperatures recreates the conditions of cosmological events such as supernova explosions , and astronomical bodies like white dwarfs and neutron star atmospheres …
This is some awesome research .
An international collaboration of researchers from the UK , Europe , Japan and the US have succeeded in harnessing an equivalent of 100 times the world energy production into a tiny spot , measuring a fraction of the width of a human hair .
That ’s a whopping one petawatt of energy ( one thousand million million watts , or enough to power ten trillion 100W light bulbs ) focused on a volume measuring about 0.000009 metres ( 9 Â µm ) across ( I took the value of the diameter of a human hair to be 90 Âµm , as measured by Piezo Technology , in case you were interested ) .
This is a vast improvement on previous tests , where the volume heated measured 20 times smaller than this new experiment .
This feat was achieved through the use of Rutherford Appleton ’s Vulcan laser .
The petawatt laser was able to attain this vast power by delivering a very short - period pulse onto the target .
After all , the planet did n’t experience a black out as the laser was switched on , the laser is able to amplify the amount of power available by focusing on a microscopic volume for a short period of time .
Vulcan blasted its target with the one petawatt laser beam for a mere 1 picosecond ( one millionth of a millionth of a second ) .
This may seem miniscule , but this microscopic period of time allowed the target material to be heated to the 10 million Kelvin .
These tests not only allow scientists to study what happens when matter is heated to such extremes , it also paves the way to more powerful lasers fusing the nuclei of hydrogen , deuterium and tritium .
Self - sustaining nuclear fusion may then be possible , unlocking a gateway into a huge source of energy .
It is conceivable that a future fusion reactor will use a powerful , focused laser to start fusion events , allowing the energy produced by each reaction to power the next .
This is the basis of self - sustaining nuclear fusion .
“ This is an exciting development – we now have a new tool with which to study really hot , dense matter ” – Prof.
Peter Norreys , STFC funded researcher and Vulcan scientist .
The Vulcan has some stiff competition though .
In the US , the Texas Petawatt laser broke the record for most powerful laser a few days ago , reaching energies in excess of one petawatt .
But plans for a bigger UK laser , the Hiper ( High Power laser Energy Research ) , will be even more powerful and is intended to investigate fusion power .

The soap that grows on trees
Soap nuts can replace all brand - name detergents
But do the soap nuts really work ?
How soap nuts clean your laundry
More than just laundry soap
The bottom line : Nature 's replacement for manufactured soap products
Where to get your soap nuts : U.S. , Canada , U.K. and more
I 've discovered an amazing new product that replaces commercial laundry detergents with a natural soap that literally grows on trees !
This is a very big deal because the laundry room is one of the most toxic rooms in the home of a typical consumer .
Commercial laundry detergents , fabric softeners and dryer sheets contain alarmingly high levels of toxic chemicals well known to cause cancer , liver disorders , neurological disturbances and hormone disruption .
I still have n't figured out why so many people actually wash their clothes in these dangerous chemicals and then wear them around all day , allowing the chemicals in the clothes to penetrate their skin and enter their bloodstream where they cause serious harm .
Even worse , all those toxic chemicals get flushed downstream where they contribute to the mass killing of fish and ocean ecosystems , including all the various life forms that depend on the fish ( such as birds ) .
We 're offering a rediscovered natural product -- " Soap Nuts ! " -- right now at www.BetterLifeGoods.com and could replace commercial detergents for good ?
It sounds too good to be true , but in fact , it 's real .
For the past two months , I 've been washing all my own clothes with this simple , natural laundry soap that 's been used in India for centuries , and I 've never felt happier ( or more environmentally conscious ) about my laundry .
Here 's the story about the natural laundry detergent that literally grows on trees .
I 'll reveal what it is , how it works , and how you can get some right now at www.BetterLifeGoods.com
Across the jungles of India and Indonesia , a surprisingly practical tree called sapindus mukorrosi grows a small fruit surrounded by a firm outer shell , much like a lychee or rambutan .
This tree , also called the Chinese Soapberry Tree , is unique in the fact that it synthesizes its own natural soap - like saponins that coat the shell of the fruit .
When the fruits ripen and fall from the tree , local families harvest the windfall , then remove the inner fruit from the outer shell .
The shell is then dried in the sun , using absolutely no chemical processing or manufacturing processes .
In fact , the whole process uses no fossil fuels either , except in the transportation of the product to the western world ( which is efficiently accomplished by ship ) .
It is this outer shell -- rich in natural saponins which act as water surfactants -- that the native families in India have used for centuries to wash their own clothes .
They toss 2 - 3 shells into a small burlap bag and work it in with their laundry ( which is usually washed by hand , by the way ) .
The soap nuts , as they 're now called ( even though they have no relation to actual nuts ) , absorb water and release their saponins which circulate as a natural surfactant in the wash water , reducing the surface tension of the water and freeing dirt , grime and oils from the clothing .
When the clothes are rinsed , the soap nut saponins are washed downstream where they remain harmless to the environment .
No synthetic chemicals , no fragrance chemicals , no foaming agents or other toxins .
Just nut shells grown by nature .
( See the resources section at the end of this article to learn where you can buy these nuts in the US , Canada , UK , Ireland and elsewhere ... )
Even though these soap nuts have been used for hundreds of years in India and Indonesia , where brand - name chemical detergents are heavily marketed to consumers through advertising , coupons and in - store displays .
Packed in eye - catching boxes and scented with artificial fragrance chemicals , these synthetic detergents are literally scooped up by tens of millions of consumers who have no idea they 're bathing their clothes in cancer - causing chemicals while destroying the environment by flushing dangerous chemicals downstream .
Until now , there have been few options for eco-conscious consumers .
While an increasing number of eco-friendly manufactured laundry products now exist in the marketplace ( such as Seventh Generation and Biokleen brands ) , .
And many of the so - called " natural " laundry products are still made with fragrance chemicals , anyway .
When I first saw these soap nuts , I got really excited about the possibility of publicizing an eco-friendly solution that could .
So I decided to financially support the Bodhi Soap Nuts company by buying a large number of her soap nut products and stocking them in our Phoenix fulfillment center .
They 're now available for you to purchase ( at a very reasonable price , by the way ) at www.BetterLifeGoods.com
When you purchase these soap nuts and put them to use , you 're not only protecting your health and the environment , you 're also supporting the families in India and Indonesia that sustainably harvest these nuts as a way of life .
Remember how I 'm always urging us all to " vote with our dollars ? "
This is the perfect opportunity to do so .
Vote against the chemical laundry companies and vote FOR natural , tree - grown laundry products by switching to soap nuts
This is the " miracle " laundry product made by Mother Nature that I 've been looking for .
It 's made by a tree , with absolutely nothing added or taken away ( except the fruit , of course ) .
It 's natural through and through .
No other laundry product even comes close . , by the way .
They leave your clothes clean , unscented and feeling cozy soft .
It 's the first laundry product I 've ever found that I was truly happy with .
This is what I 'm now washing all my clothes with .
Of course , any skeptical consumer would be asking one question right now : " Do these soap nuts really work ?
" I was skeptical , too , that a soap nut grown by a tree in India could really replace my high - tech eco-friendly laundry soap made in America .
So I bought a box of Bodhi Soap Nuts and tried them myself .
I took 3 soap nuts and dropped them into the small cotton bag that comes in each box of Bodhi Soap Nuts , then I tossed them into my laundry and avoided using any other detergents or laundry products .
I set the temperature on warm and gave it a normal wash cycle , then I hit the start button and walked away .
An hour later , I returned and examined the finished load .
They sure smelled clean .
But the real test would come from wearing them during a workout , so I took them outside to dry them in the sun ( since we have such great sunlight here in Arizona , I often use it for drying clothes ) .
After a few hours of blazing desert sunlight , the clothes were completely dry .
I suited up with a pair of workout pants and an A shirt , then headed to the gym for an intense workout designed to produce lots of sweat .
The short version of this story is thatand they smelled just fine , even after an hour of sweat - inducing cardiovascular activity .
( It also helps that I do n't drink dairy products , which makes people stink , but that 's another story ... )
My workout clothes seemed just as clean to me as any other load of laundry I washed in various eco-friendly laundry products !
Over the next few days , I continued washing more loads with the soap nuts .
Every load came out clean , yet unscented ( just the way I like it ) .
I washed grimy socks , workout pants , hiking shorts and sweaty underwear , and everything was cleaned to my satisfaction .
In other words , I remain convinced that these tree - grown soap nuts are just as good as any other soap products on the market .
One thing I did learn in all this , however , was that you probably should n't wash bedsheets with these soap nuts .
What happened ?
In my wash , the small cotton bag holding the soap nuts got wrapped up in the sheet , and the soap nuts soaked the sheet with a slight soap nut color ( sort of rust colored ) .
This color came out in the next wash , because it's not a permanent stain or anything , but it taught me that for the soap nuts to be really effective , they needed to be able to circulate freely in the laundry and not get caught in a large bedsheet .
Aside from the bedsheet incident , everything else came out of the wash sqeaky clean !
The process by which soap nuts clean your clothes is naturally quite simple .
The soap nut shell contains a natural saponin that works as a surfactant , making your water " wetter " and allowing it to penetrate the fibers of your clothing , working away the dirt and grime that makes clothes dirty .
The surfactant then holds on to the dirt , keeping it in suspension in the water until it 's drained away , taking the dirt with it .
What 's left is a load of clean clothes and nothing else !
That 's the way laundry should be .
Much like clean water , clean laundry should NOT contain toxic chemical residues .
In fact , it 's more important to consider what laundry products do NOT contain than to look at what they do contain .
What Bodhi Soap Nuts do NOT contain include :•
Foaming chemicals that fool consumers into thinking their clothes are cleaner because there are " suds " in the wash .
TRUTH : Suds have nothing to do with cleaning .
They are chemical additives used to create the illusion of cleaning action .
( Silly consumers actually expect suds , so the manufacturers add them in . ) •
Fragrance chemicals that make laundry " smell " clean .
Most commercial laundry products use toxic , synthetic fragrance chemicals that are , in fact , well known to promote cancer and liver disorders .
Laundry products are not really regulated by any single government agency , and there is currently no law banning the use of known cancer - causing chemicals in laundry products ( much like with cosmetics ) . •
Filler ingredients .
Nearly all commercial laundry products are made with at least 50 % filler ingredients to " bulk them up " and make them appear to deliver more value for the price .
Consumers are mostly just buying the illusion of detergent , made mostly with filler .
You wo n't find filler or toxic chemicals in Bodhi Soap Nuts .
Just pure , natural saponins grown by a tree and engineered by nature .
In my opinion , that 's where more of our products should ultimately come from .
Would n't it be great if shampoo also grew on trees ?
Actually , it does .
The natural saponins found in Bodhi Soap Nuts are universal cleaning agents .
Sure , they work great in the laundry , but did you know they are also traditionally used to clean skin and hair ?
In fact , the soap nut saponins work on everything from pets and children to washing fruits and vegetables .
In ancient India , jewelers even used the soap to shine their precious metals and stones , giving them a beautiful natural luster .
By the way , to avoid exposing infants and children to the toxic chemicals found in commercial laundry products .
And while you 're at it , why not save yourself from that exposure , too , by washing your own clothes with nature 's laundry soap ?
Using Bodhi Soap Nuts , you can make your own ultra - pure multipurpose cleaner .
Here 's the recipe : Simmer 1 cup of soap nuts in 4 cups of water on your stove , then allow the liquid to cool .
Mash the soap nuts by hand ( squish them around to get out all the saponins ) , then drain the resulting liquid through a cheese cloth or nut milk bag .
Voila !
You 've gotUse it around the kitchen , in the shower , washing the dog ... it 's all good .
You can even use it to wash your dishes .
Remember :
This natural soap is n't going to foam up like phoney cleaning products made by chemical companies , and it sure does n't smell like fragrance chemicals .
So do n't expect it to look or smell like the products you might have been using .
However , .
The soap works so well that it 's actually being studied right now as a way to decontaminate soils from exposure to toxic chemicals .
How 's that for a natural solution ?
Nature 's soap can save the planet from man 's soap .
Overall , I 'm incredibly delighted to have discovered Bodhi Soap Nuts .
They 're nature 's gift to the world , and we would all be smart toand switch to natural laundry soaps that grow on trees .
It 's good for your health , your family and your environment .
Plus , it ends the cycle of monetary support for manipulative consumer product companies that poison the world with their harmful chemicals products .
All those brightly - colored laundry detergent boxes lining the shelves of your local grocery store are , indeed , quite poisonous to both you and the planet .
How much do soap nuts cost ?
The price of using these soap nuts in your laundry is well under fifty cents a load ( U.S. ) , making it quite comparable to other eco-friendly laundry products .
It 's not as cheap as dumping foaming chemicals into your laundry , but then again , if you 're the kind of person reading this website , you 're probably far more concerned about saving your health than saving a quarter on a load of toxic laundry .
Is n't it good to know that Washing your clothes does n't have to be bad for the environment .

An Australian who took a new car on a 3,200 km ( 1,988 mile ) six - day test drive from the city to the outback has been arrested , police said on Thursday .
The 30 - year - old convinced a car dealer in the southeastern city of Melbourne to lend him a A$ 40,000 ( $ 37,000 ) Honda Accord sedan last Friday and drove the equivalent of London to Istanbul before he was arrested near the town of Tennant Creek , deep in the outback of the Northern Territory .
" He drove from Melbourne to Adelaide to Alice Springs , " Tennant Creek police Constable James Gray - Spence told Reuters .
He said the man was arrested without incident at a road block on his way north to Darwin after he failed to pay for fuel at a hamlet .
The test drive was the longest known to Australian police and topped a 500 km theft on New Zealand 's South Island in 2006 .
" I think we 've topped that with the 3,000 km mark , " Gray - Spence said .
Melbourne car yard owner Ian McKenzie said the man would have had to have been in the car all day , every day to reach Tennant Creek .
" He seemed a legitimate gentleman .
He stood at the desk right in front of a camera .
He was n't afraid of being photographed or videoed , " McKenzie told the Herald Sun newspaper .
The man was charged with aggravated unlawful use of a motor vehicle and unlawful possession of property and will appear in court on Thursday .

The Associated Press explains why , even in tough economic times , cash - strapped states are refusing federal abstinence - only dollars .
Is Congress listening ?
The Associated Press is just out with a major story about how in tough economic times , cash - strapped states are refusing federal tax dollars for abstinence - only programs .
The story is one more in a long line of damning pieces of evidence about the failures of abstinence - only programs , the waste of tax dollars they represent , and should be a wake up call to Congress .
AP reporter Kevin Freking writes :
Skeptical states are shoving aside millions of federal dollars for
abstinence education , walking away from the program the Bush
administration touts for slowing teen sexual activity .
Barely half the states are still in , and two more say they are leaving .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

$ 50 million has been budgeted for this year , and financially strapped
states might be expected to want their share .
But many have doubts that
the program does much , if any good , and they ’re frustrated by chronic
uncertainty that it will even be kept in existence .
They also have to
chip in state money in order to receive the federal grants .
Iowa
Gov. Chet Culver , a Democrat , made his decision to leave based on the
congressionally mandated curriculum , which teaches " the social ,
psychological and health gains of abstaining from sexual activity . "
Instructors must teach that sexual activity outside of marriage is
likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects .
" It
was just too strict , " said Emily Hajek , policy adviser to Culver .
" We
believe local providers have the knowledge to teach what ’s going to be
best in those situations , what kind of information will help those
young people be safe .
You can not be that prescriptive about how it has
to be taught . "
A federal tally shows that participation in the
program is down 40 percent over two years , with 28 states still in .
Arizona and Iowa have announced their intention to forgo their share of
the federal grant at the start of the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 .
Readers of Rewire certainly understand the waste , fraud and abuse that abstinence - only programs represent , and the inherent danger they are to teens who are not getting accurate information about their sexual health .
This AP story , likely appearing in thousands of newspapers across the country tomorrow morning , and to be featured in radio and television newscasts , will help Americans better understand what they intuitively already do — abstinence - only is a complete failure and waste of their tax dollars .
" The funding stream became inconsistent .
We did n’t know from one
quarter to the next whether we’d be getting the rest of the money , "
said Elke Shaw - Tulloch of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare .
" We got to the point where we did n’t have any infrastructure to put the
money to use .
At the same time , there was mounting evidence the
abstinence programs were n’t proving to be effective . "
Throw in a
rising pregnancy rate among 15 - 19 year - olds in Idaho — 2,543
pregnancies in 2006 compared with 2,396 in 2004 — and state officials
decided last summer it was time to get out .
Study after study has demonstrated abstinence - only ’s ineffectiveness , and as the AP points out , the Mathematica report in particular is being cited by some of the states as a reason to stop the programs .
In April 2007 , a federally funded study of four abstinence - only
programs by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. , found that participants
had just as many sexual partners as nonparticipants and had sex at the
same median age as nonparticipants .
The four programs had taught
students about human anatomy and sexually transmitted diseases , helped
them improve their communication skills , manage peer pressure , set
personal goals and build self - esteem .
For Colorado , the study
results sealed the decision to get out of the program .
Dr. Ned Calonge ,
the state ’s chief medical officer , said Mathematica ’s methods were the
gold standard for scientific studies .
" To show no benefit
compared to nothing .
That was striking , " Calonge said .
" These are tax
dollars that are going for no useful purpose , and it would not be
responsible for us to take those dollars . "

Welcome to a world where criticism of militant Islam could land you in court or worse .
In Vancouver , Canada 's venerable Maclean 's magazine awaits a hate - speech verdict from a human - rights tribunal for publishing a chapter from syndicated columnist Mark Steyn 's best - selling book " America Alone . "
The accusers charge the author and publisher with " Islamophobia . "
Last week , Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , secretary general of the 57 - member Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , warned a gathering in Kuala Lumpur that " mere condemnation or distancing from the acts of the perpetrators of Islamophobia " would not suffice .
He recommended that Western countries restrict freedom of expression and demanded that the media stop publishing " hate material " like the Danish cartoons .
" It is now high time for concrete actions to stem the rot before it aggravates any further , " he said .
Islamic countries already scored a victory on this front back in March .
They pushed through a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Council urging a global ban on the public defamation of religion -- read Islam .

These are examples of a growing campaign to use judicial power to silence critics of militant Islam .
In the U.N. Durban Review Conference , scheduled for April 20 - 24 , 2009 in Geneva , it appears that the OIC and its cohorts have identified the perfect platform to further their agenda .
Recall the first Durban meeting , the 2001 U.N. World Conference Against Racism , which took place only days before 9/11 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An organic molecule has been spotted for the first time in the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system , a key step toward possibly finding signs of life on a distant world , scientists said .
This artist 's impression shows the Jupiter - like extrasolar planet known as HD 189733b , orbiting close to its star about 63 light years from Earth .
Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to detect methane in this planet 's atmosphere -- the first organic molecule found on a planet outside our solar system .
Hubble also confirmed the presence of water vapor in the planet 's atmosphere .
The findings are published in the journal Nature .
REUTERS / ESA , NASA and G. Tinetti ( University College London , UK & ESA ) / Handout
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope found methane in the atmosphere of a planet called HD 189733 b , which is about the size of Jupiter and is 63 light - years from Earth , they said in research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature .
Organic molecules contain carbon - hydrogen bonds and can be found in living things .
Methane , for instance , is found in natural gas and cattle belches .
But the scientists were quick to point out that this distant planet -- with atmospheric temperatures around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1,000 degrees Celsius ) -- is not thought to be a candidate for hosting any form of life .
“ For this specific planet we observed , methane cannot be produced biologically , ” Giovanna Tinetti of the University College London , one of the researchers , said by e-mail .
“ It ’s highly unlikely that cows could survive here , ” Tinetti joked .
“ The idea is to repeat the same kind of observations in the future for planets which are less hostile to the development and evolution of life , ” she added .
HD 189733b is one of more than 270 planets to be discovered orbiting stars other than our sun -- called extrasolar planets .
It is a “ hot Jupiter ” type , similar to the gas giant Jupiter in our solar system but reaching scorching temperatures because they orbit so closely to their stars .
This one whizzes around its star roughly every two Earth days .
Methane , composed of carbon and hydrogen , has been detected on many of the planets in our solar system .
“ Under the right conditions , methane can contribute to the formation of amino acids , ” an important building block of life , said another member of the research group , Mark Swain of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
The scientists were able to confirm the previously reported discovery of water molecules in the planet ’s atmosphere .
They made their observations as the planet passed in front of its parent star in what is called a transit .
The scientists used a method called transit spectroscopy -- breaking light up into its various colors .
“ You can think of the prism making a rainbow spectrum when you shine light through it .
And we do this when the planet passes in front of its parent star .
So what we see is the starlight filtered through the planet ’s atmosphere .
The molecules in the atmosphere of the planet leave a fingerprint in the spectrum , ” Swain said in a telephone interview .
Separately , other astronomers used NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope and the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii to find water molecules in disks of dust and gas around two young stars .
The water is at the center of spinning disks of particles that may eventually coalesce to form planets around the stars DR Tau , 457 light - years from Earth and AS 205A , 391 light - years from Earth , they reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The video game console war goes beyond just usability and specifications … it includes beauty as well .
The Playstation 3 has always looked the best in my eyes .
Its shine , color and shape look amazing and seem extremely powerful and worthwhile .
The major problem I have thought of is because of its size and stature , it is hardly a video game console that may be taken to go .
Unlike the newest PS2 models which are extremely thin , compact and easily packed , the PS3 is bulky and not easily carried … until a Playstation 3 concept laptop was built by the one and only Ben Heck .
This PS3 Laptop may still have a hefty weight ( 16 pounds ) , but it combines a Playstation 3 hardware with a running laptop .
This modification also includes a 17 inch HD screen , so the console capability and graphics can still be inspiring and shocking .
In addition , it also consists of a 60 GB hard drive , built in keyboard , and stereo speakers , so you can have an entire Playstation 3 mobile package .
This PS3 concept mod will be up for auction , for the long and amazing work put into it .
I for one may not be able to afford it , but can still praise its ingenuity .

HARRISON TOWNSHIP , Mich . 
So many people have so many things they can no longer afford .
This is an excellent time to be a repo man .
When a boat owner defaults on his loan , the bank hires Jeff Henderson to seize its property .
The former Army detective tracks the boat down in a backyard or a marina or a garage and hauls it to his storage area and later auctions it off .
After nearly 20 years in the repossession business , Mr. Henderson has never been busier .
“ I used to take the weak ones , ” he said .
“ Now I ’m taking the whole herd . ”
Boating was traditionally the pastime of the well - off , but the long housing boom and its gusher of easy credit changed that .
People refinanced their homes and used the cash for down payments on a cruiser , miniyacht or sailboat .
From 2000 to 2006 , retail sales for the recreational boating industry rose by more than 40 percent , to $ 39.5 billion , while the average loan amount more than tripled to $ 141,000 .
Last year , as real estate faltered , the gears went into reverse .
The number of boats sold fell 8 percent .
Many boats are fuel hogs , and rising gasoline and diesel prices meant a weekend jaunt could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars .
Owners found they could not sell a boat for what they owed and could not refinance either .

BAGHDAD – What the US has been calling the success of a " surge , " many Iraqis see as evidence of catastrophe .
Where US forces point to peace and calm , local Iraqis find an eerie silence .
And when US forces speak of a reduction in violence , many Iraqis simply do not know what they are talking about .
Hundreds died in a series of explosions in Baghdad last month .
This was despite the strongest ever security measures taken by the US military , riding the " surge " in security forces and their activities .
The death toll is high , according to the website icasualties.org , which provides reliable numbers of Iraqi civilian and security deaths .
In January this year 485 civilians were killed , according to the website .
It says the number is based on news reports , and that " actual totals for Iraqi deaths are higher than the numbers recorded on this site . "
The average month in 2005 , before the " surge " was launched , saw 568 civilian deaths .
In January 2006 , the month before the " surge " began , 590 civilians died .
Many of the killings have taken place in the most well guarded areas of Baghdad .
And they have continued this month .
" Two car bombs exploded in Jadriya , killing so many people , the day the American Secretary of Defense ( Robert Gates ) was visiting Baghdad last week , " a captain from the Karrada district police in Baghdad , speaking on condition of anonymity , told IPS .
" Another car bomb killed eight people and injured 20 Thursday ( last week ) in the Muraidy market of Sadr City , east of Baghdad , although the Mehdi army ( the militia of Muqtada al - Sadr ) provides strict protection to the city , " the officer said .
" There is no security in this country any more . "
Unidentified bodies of Iraqis killed by militias continue to appear in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities .
The Iraqi government has issued instructions to all security and health offices not to give out the body count to the media .
Dozens of bodies are found every day across Baghdad , residents say .
Morgue officials confirm this .
" We are not authorized to issue any numbers , but I can tell you that we are still receiving human bodies every day ; the men have no identity on them , " a doctor at the Baghdad morgue told IPS .
" The bodies that have signs of torture are the Sunnis killed by Shi’ite militias ; those with a bullet in the head are usually policemen , translators or contractors who worked for the Americans . "
The " surge " of 30,000 additional troops came to Iraq , mostly Baghdad , in February of last year .
The total current number of US troops in Iraq is approximately 157,000 .
They were sent to end violence , and with a declared aim of helping political reconciliation .
But where peace of sorts has descended in Baghdad , Iraq ’s capital city of six million ( in a population of 25 million ) , it comes from a partitioning of people along sectarian lines .
The Iraqi Red Crescent reports that one in four residents has been driven out of their homes by death squads , or by the " surge . "
According to an Iraqi Red Crescent report titled " The Internally Displaced People in Iraq " released Jan. 27 , 1,364,978 residents of Baghdad have been displaced .
The Environment News Service reported Jan. 7 that " many of the capital ’s once mixed areas have become either purely Sunni or Shi’ite after militias forced families out for belonging to the other religious branch of Islam . "
Some of the eerie calm in areas of Baghdad comes because togetherness has ended .
Sunnis and Shi’ites who lived together for generations are now partitioned .
This is not the peace many Iraqis were looking for , surge or no surge .
On Jan. 8 , UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond announced that there were at least 2.2 million Iraqis internally displaced within the country , and that at least another two million had fled the country altogether .
This , no doubt , would make many areas quieter .
The US military has erected three to four meter high concrete walls around several neighborhoods , forcing residents to choose either Sunni or Shi’ite areas in which to live .
Such separation has brought large - scale displacement , and protests .
Sunni Muslims seem to have the worst of it .
Many Iraqis are outraged by the number of Sunni detainees the " surge " has taken .
Residents of Amiriya district of western Baghdad demonstrated Feb. 11 against mistreatment by US and Iraqi forces involved in the " surge . "
The " surge " aims to eradicate al - Qaeda from Iraq , but this has meant that most military operations have been carried out in Sunni areas like Amiriya .
" We are here to protest against the unfair arrests and raids conducted against the innocent people of Amiriya , " Salih al - Mutlag , chief of the Arab Dialogue Council in the Iraqi government told IPS at the demonstration .
" This has gone too far under the flag of fighting terror . "
Al - Mutlag said they were also demonstrating against arrests in the western parts of Baghdad , despite an apparently peaceful situation there as a result of residents ’ cooperation with Iraqi army units .
Large numbers of residents came out in the Dora region of southwest Baghdad to protest against the US military for arresting 18 people , including an 80 - year - old man .
" We are the ones who improved the situation in western parts of Baghdad without any interference from the Americans and their puppet Iraqi government , " former Iraqi Army Major Abu Wussam told IPS in Amiriya .
" We negotiated with our brothers in the Iraqi national resistance who agreed to conduct their activities in a different way from the traditional way they used to work .
" It seems Americans did not like it , and so they are punishing us for it , instead of releasing our detainees as they promised . "
Some of the apparent peace on the street is a consequence of rising detentions .
In November last year Karl Matley , head of the Iraqi branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross , declared that more than 60,000 prisoners and detainees are held in prisons and other detention centers .
A large number of these were taken during the " surge . "
By August 2007 , half a year into the " surge , " the number of detainees held by the US - led military forces in Iraq had swelled by 50 percent , with the inmate population growing to 24,500 , from 16,000 in February , according to US military officers in Iraq .
The officers reported that nearly 85 percent of the detainees in custody were Sunni Arabs .
Given that the majority of the detained are Sunnis , the " surge , " rather than bridging political differences and aiding reconciliation between Sunni and Shi’ite groups , appears to have had the opposite effect .
And yet , there could be more dangerous reasons to doubt such success of the " surge " that is claimed .
Among the recent arrests in Baghdad , the US military counted six members of the Sahwa ( Awakening ) forces .
This is a force of resistance fighters now ostensibly working with the US military .
The US pays each member 300 dollars monthly .
More than 80 percent of about 70,000 Sahwa members are Sunni .
The arrest of some Sahwa members is indication of US military doubts about the loyalties of some of these Sahwa fighters .
Shi’ite political parties and militias already accuse them of being resistance fighters in disguise .
Many believe that large numbers of Sahwa forces are resistance fighters simply riding the " surge . "
" How come Sunni parts of Baghdad became so quiet all of a sudden , " says Jawad Salman , a former resident of Amiriya who fled his house in 2006 after Iraqi resistance members accused him of being a government spy .
" It is a game well played by terrorists to divert the fight against Shi’ite groups .
I lived there and I know that all residents fully support what the US calls the terrorists . "
The Sahwa strategy has brought down the number of US casualties – for now .
But the US strategy seems to have done less for Iraq than for its own forces .

We won Survivor Starbucks by enduring the grub eating immunity challenge and now our urban camping trip is over .
Power has been restored to the cyberhutch so no more venting over ventis .
Last week ’s Bar Jules five dollar toast got a rise out of Eater SF and SF Weekly .
Of course we all understand that when you are dealing with top quality ingredients , you should pay for them , but we knead to know the bread to bread ratio before the cost pops up on the bill and makes us feel crumby .
Today ’s toast episode at Canteen was a slice of heaven .
Our lightly carbonized , processed mill products came with our entrees ( at no extra charge ) accompanied by some tasty preserves and butter :
My gravlax omelette ( $ 8.95 ) : ... was an eggy tube lined with chives , shaved fennel and bits of cured salmon .
The potatoes had the perfect balance of crispy bits to starchy bits .
Each spud chunk had a brown crunchy expanse to justify its existence on the plate .
Chubby got the chicken hash ( $ 11.95 ) :
The server explained that they poach their eggs a little firmer for this mountain of potatoes , chicken with self - saucing eggs .
Every bite was flavorpacked and craveable .
The service was friendly , efficient and improves with each of our visits ( which are spaced further apart than the food warrants . )
We love the music , books and overall vibe of this cozy diner : ... off the lobby of a dormitory for Academy of Art University which has been slowly buying up all the San Francisco real estate in a Monopoly game that is funded by book larnin ’ - averse young people with rich parents .
They should consider putting Starbucks inside of Academy of Art Universities inside of Starbucks like Russian nesting dolls , it would be so much more practical .

And speaking of Starbucks , from today ’s Bunrab email , Steve A. writes about yesterday ’s food puck :
Gutenberg ,
In fact , the eggs for all the Starbucks breakfast sandwiches served in the United States are cooked at just two locations , stuffed into sandwiches , and kept frozen for up to two days before being reheated in the speed oven ...
As the Starbucks sandwiches cooled , the texture changed noticeably ( as is often the case with microwaved sandwiches ) , leaving tough bread and bacon , rubbery cheese and spongy egg .
In your post about Starbux breakfast sandwiches you mention that they are equivalent to McDonalds Egg McMuffins .
Even though Starbux should be better because their beverages are better and they market their chain as upscale with upscale prices , their breakfast sandwiches are actually inferior to McDonalds because they are frozen and merely heated up in a toaster in - store .
McDonalds eggs are cooked and their sandwiches are made in - store .
Until Starbux stores get a real kitchen instead of warming ovens , it will be this way .
Steve
Gutenberg replies :
Dear Steve ,
Thanks for the info .
I think that presenting the egg muffin in a bag with a sticker that reads : “ Great Coffee deserves Great Food ” is actually a cautionary reminder before you reach the point of desperation necessary to break the seal and access the launch codes to detonate this belly bomb .

Some people think that the reason the public misunderstands so many issues is that these issues are too " complex " for most voters .
But is that really so ?
With all the commotion in the media and in politics about the high price of gasoline , is there really some terribly complex explanation ?
Is there anything complex about the fact that with two countries -- India and China -- having rapid economic growth , and with combined populations 8 times that of the United States , they are creating an increased demand for the world 's oil supply ?
The problem is not that supply and demand is such a complex explanation .
The problem is that supply and demand is not an emotionally satisfying explanation .
For that , you need melodrama , heroes and villains .
It is clear that many people prefer to blame President Bush .
Others prefer to blame the oil companies , who have long been the favorite villains of the left .
Politicians understand that .
Numerous times they have summoned the heads of oil companies before Congressional committees to be denounced on nationwide television for " greed , " with the politicians calling for a federal investigation to " get to the bottom of this ! "
Now that is emotionally satisfying , which is the whole point .
By the time yet another federal investigation is completed -- and turns up nothing to substantiate the villainy that is supposed to be the reason for high gasoline prices -- most people 's attention will have turned to something else .
Newspapers that carried the original inflammatory charges with banner headlines on page 1 will carry the story of the completed investigation that turned up nothing as a small item deep inside the paper .
This has happened at least a dozen times over the past few decades and it will probably happen again .
What about those " obscene " oil company profits we hear so much about ?
An economist might ask , " Obscene compared to what ? "
Compared to the investments made ?
Compared to the new investments required to find , extract and process additional oil supplies ?
Asking questions like these are among the many reasons why economists have never been very popular .
They frustrate people 's desires for emotionally satisfying explanations .
If corporate " greed " is the explanation for high gasoline prices , why are the government 's taxes not an even bigger sign of " greed " on the part of politicians -- since taxes add more to the price of gasoline than oil company profits do ?
Whatever the merits or demerits of Senator John McCain 's proposal to temporarily suspend the federal taxes on gasoline , it would certainly lower the price more than confiscating all the oil companies ' profits .
But it would not be as emotionally satisfying .
Senator Barack Obama clearly understands people 's emotional needs and how to meet them .
He wants to raise taxes on oil companies .
How that will get us more oil or lower the price of gasoline is a problem that can be left for economists to puzzle over .
A politician 's problem is how to get more votes -- and one of the most effective ways of doing that is to be a hero who will save us from the villains .
You have heard of the cavalry to the rescue .
But have you ever heard of economists to the rescue ?
While economists are talking supply and demand , politicians are talking compassion , " change " and being on the side of the angels -- and against drilling for our own oil .
Has any economist ever attracted the kinds of cheering crowds that Barack Obama has -- or even the crowds attracted by Hillary Clinton or John McCain ?
If you want cheering crowds , do n't bother to study economics .
It will only hold you back .
Tell people what they want to hear -- and they do n't want to hear about supply and demand .
No , supply and demand is not too " complex . "
It is just not very emotionally satisfying .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is suspected of having taken envelopes full of cash from a U.S. businessman , the chief prosecutor said on Monday in his most graphic public account of a corruption case against Olmert .

Olmert has denied any wrongdoing in the case , which threatens to force him from office and disrupt his U.S. - brokered peace negotiations with the Palestinians .
State Prosecutor Moshe Lador , speaking at a Supreme Court hearing , said investigators suspected New York businessman Morris Talansky had given Olmert “ dollars , in cash and in envelopes , during brief meetings from time to time ” .
Olmert ’s attorneys were petitioning the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court ’s decision to hear preliminary testimony from Talansky , currently visiting Israel , before he returns to the United States .
The Supreme Court did not immediately rule on the argument that such testimony , at an early stage of the investigation , would impinge on Olmert ’s right to a fair trial by effectively indicting him before any formal charges were brought .
Olmert acknowledged this month that Talansky had raised funds for his two successful campaigns for mayor of Jerusalem in 1993 and 1998 , a failed bid to lead the right - wing Likud party in 1999 and a further internal Likud election in 2002 .
The prime minister said his former law partner had handled the details , and voiced confidence that the attorney had made sure proper procedures were followed .
Israeli law broadly prohibits political donations of more than a few hundred dollars .
Police have said Olmert is suspected of taking “ significant sums of money from a foreigner or a number of foreign individuals over an extended period of time ” .
A judicial source said the sums involved totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars .
On Sunday , Attorney - General Menachem Mazuz said the investigation , one of several focusing on corruption suspicions against Olmert , would not be finished any time soon .
Police say they intend to question Olmert for a second time within the next few days .

Creating the Perfect Ecommerce Site
While there are a lot of important lessons to take away from the list of ecommerce websites mentioned above , it ’s important to remember that all sites are different .
While you should definitely strive to make your online environment as user - friendly and appealing as possible , you ’ll also need to think carefully about a number of other things .
For instance , all websites should have ease of use baked into their core , as well as strong product descriptions , unique checkout pages , and simple solutions to help your customers spend their money with ease .
However , it ’s the little details that you add to your online business that really helps it to stand out .
For instance , think about :
The audience that you ’re trying to attract : Different kinds of customers expect different things from a website .
Some younger audiences will expect more animations and graphics , while B2B customers expect a lot of reliable information .

BigCommerce makes it super easy to list your products , set up a category page , or multiple , and deal with things like shipping details .

However , BigCommerce is n’t always ideal for beginners .
The system is pretty advanced compared to some of the other shop builders out there .
That ’s great for developers who know their way around code , but it might not be the right tool for people just getting started .
BigCommerce does have a great community around it , however .
This could mean that you can simplify the process of building your store just by reaching out to someone who has a little extra coding knowledge .
Compared to Shopify and BigCommerce , Squarespace is n’t quite as much of a big deal – at least not yet .
However , it still stands out as one of the leading site - building tools on the market .

If you ’re new to the world of website building , Squarespace makes it easy to start loading your inventory up online .

Store is likely to be the best choice for companies that want to develop an online solution to showcase their store to the digital world .
If you already have a retail location or restaurant , and you want to take it to the next level , Square can definitely help with that .
You might need to learn a little coding if you want to get really advanced with your customization , however .
Finally , if you ’re on the hunt for an easy - to - use website building tool , and the options above do n’t appeal to you , then Wix could be the ultimate choice .
As one of the most popular software options in the world , Wix gives business owners access to everything they need to launch their own amazing online presence .

Once considered to be an over - the - top irritation , pre-movie DVD piracy messages have been proved to be the key factor in defeating organized crime and terrorism .
Interviews with drug gang lords and international terrorists have revealed that they are resigned to giving up , now that people have been informed that buying illegally copied DVDs was the one thing that kept them going .
‘ Those heavy ads might just seem like some pain - in - the - arse message you can’t skip , however many times you press the fast forward or menu button ; but yeah the message is right .
Selling fake DVD ’s really is the key to our global crime operation . ’
One gang leader admitted that heroin trafficking was just a loss - leader that was only set up to deflect police attention away from the serious business of selling low - quality copies of Basic Instinct 2 down the market .
Al - Qaeda leaders also admitted that the warning about pirated DVDs funding terrorism was also completely true .
‘ Yeah the whole jihad against the decadent west was a smokescreen .
What we are really about is earning millions from that bloke in the pub who asks you if you want any cheap Adam Sandler movies . ’
A spokesman for Interpol said he was delighted with the response to the messages at the beginning of DVDs – and that 100 % of consumers had immediately stopped buying pirated DVDs on learning of their underworld origins .
‘ We did fear that people might cynically think that this was just the huge movie companies trying to protect their profits but of course nothing could be further from the truth . ’

Senate superdelegates meet on endorsing Obama
The 15 uncommitted Senate superdelegates are meeting this afternoon to discuss how to proceed on making their endorsements and are likely to back Sen.
Barack Obama in the next couple of days , sources tell Politico .
The senators are not meeting with representatives from either campaign during the gathering , the sources say .
Stay tuned for updates this afternoon .

Obama 's embrace of political pragmatism came into sharp focus Thursday with the landmark Supreme Court ruling that overturned Washington , D.C. 's handgun ban and declared for the first time an individual right to possess a gun .
Obama : Change agent goes conventional
Barack Obama has crafted an image as an unconventional candidate , a change agent and a post - partisan politician who represents a dramatic break from the status quo .
But since securing the Democratic presidential nomination , when confronted with a series of thorny issues the Illinois senator has pursued a conspicuously conventional path , one that falls far short of his soaring rhetoric .
Faced with tough choices on fronts ranging from public financing and town hall meetings to warrantless surveillance and the Second Amendment , Obama passed up opportunities to take bold stands and make striking departures from customary politics .
Instead , he has followed a familiar tack , straddling controversial issues and choosing politically advantageous routes that will ensure his campaign a cash edge and minimize damaging blowback on several highly sensitive issues .

Obama 's embrace of political pragmatism came into sharp focus Thursday with the landmark Supreme Court ruling that overturned Washington , D.C. 's handgun ban and declared for the first time an individual right to possess a gun .
As an Illinois state legislator , Obama generally supported tighter restrictions on firearms and served on the board of a foundation that funded legal scholarship advancing the theory that the Second Amendment does not protect individual gun owners ' rights , as well as 14 separate groups that ultimately signed an amicus brief supporting the D.C. ban .
Though he had tried to avoid taking a firm stand on either the ban or the case , an unnamed staffer last year told the Chicago Tribune that " Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional . "
On Thursday , though , the Obama campaign distanced itself from that record , which would have considerable downside risk for a presidential candidate running on a 50 - state landscape .
Obama 's top spokesman , Bill Burton , said that the statement to the Chicago Tribune " was not worded as well as it could have been " and that Obama believes that generally the Constitution " does n't prevent local and state governments from enacting their own gun laws . "
After the high court ruling , Obama said in a statement he has " always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms , but I also identify with the need for crime - ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common - sense , effective safety measures . "
The Court " has now endorsed that view , " Obama asserted , citing a passage in Justice Antonin Scalia 's majority opinion which begins : " Like most rights , the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited . "
Shortly before the court decision , Obama sought to sidestep another political land mine over controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation .
His support for a government surveillance bill that offers retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies — a bill that he vowed last year to filibuster — angered liberal Internet activists who felt betrayed by what they saw as a politically expedient move designed to inoculate himself against GOP charges that he 's weak on national security .
But Obama explained it to reporters Wednesday by pointing out that the bill has changed from when he made his filibuster pledge , saying the latest version allayed several concerns , including providing closer oversight of the government surveillance program .
Yet it still effectively offers retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that aided the administration 's warrantless wiretapping efforts , a key point Obama said he would oppose .
He said Wednesday that he was satisfied with the requirement for an inspector general 's review .
He is expected to vote for an amendment stripping out the immunity provision , but even if the effort fails , Obama likely would back the underlying bill .
" It is not all that I would want , " Obama said in a statement last week .
" But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence - collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay , " he said .
The calculations that mark Obama 's delicate approach toward the FISA bill and the Supreme Court gun ruling come on the heels of his decision last week to reverse a pledge he made last year to participate in the public financing system in the general election if his Republican opponent agreed to do the same — a move that made him the first modern presidential candidate to decline public financing in a general election .
McCain has agreed to participate in the system , which provides candidates $ 84 million in taxpayer cash but limits their campaign spending to that amount .
Obama , whose historic fundraising ability was unknown when he made the pledge , is expected to easily surpass that tally .
Though he did not frame it as such , Obama 's reversal was widely viewed by campaign finance reformers and editorial boards as a strategic choice to put his likely huge campaign cash advantage over his commitment to government reform .
They 've been mostly receptive to Obama 's forays on campaign finance issues , but many reformers dismissed his explanation for the shift : that his massive base of small online donors constitute a " parallel public financing , " and that he needed to exit the program to defend himself from the independent spending of 527 groups .
Obama 's decision to opt out of the public financing program followed his campaign 's earlier derailment of another bold campaign proposal he had at one time supported : McCain 's call for a series of town halls featuring the two candidates .
After declaring last month he would meet McCain " anywhere , anytime " to debate foreign policy — a risky proposition that had the potential to work to McCain 's political advantage —
Obama backtracked and would only offer one town hall and one extra debate in response to McCain 's suggestion of 10 .
In explaining the offer to the McCain campaign , Obama 's campaign manager , David Plouffe , said in a statement that Obama 's offer " would have been the most of any presidential campaign in the modern era — offering a broad range of formats — and representing a historic commitment to openness and transparency . "
He charged McCain 's campaign " would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country . "

With sweat cascading down his face on a steamy June night in Louisiana , the Oscar - winning director was directing James Cromwell ( playing the elder Bush ) and Josh Brolin ( starring as President Bush ) through a critical moment in “ W. , ” Stone ’s forthcoming -- and potentially divisive -- drama about the personal , political and psychological evolution of the current president .
Although the father - son patter was ostensibly friendly , the subtext was anything but , hinting at the intricate parent - child relationship that Stone believes helps to explain George W. Bush ’s ascension .
While the Bushes in this scene from 1990 were talking about the Texas Rangers ( of whom George W. once owned a share ) and Saddam Hus- sein ( against whom George H. W. was about to go to war in Kuwait ) , there was much more at stake , as Stone and screenwriter Stanley Weiser saw the fictional conversation unfolding .
“ You need to back him down and take him out -- like you did Noriega , ” George W. tells his father about Hussein .
The elder Bush was n’t sure he was going to be that rash .
“ You know I ’ve always believed in leaving personal feelings out of politics , ” the 41st president told his son .
“ But Saddam -- this aggression cannot stand .
Not gonna allow this little dictator to control 25 % of the world ’s oil . ”

As the architect of the outspoken dramas “ Platoon , ” “ Salvador , ” “ Wall Street , ” “ Born on the Fourth of July ” and “ JFK , ” Stone stands apart as one of the most openly political filmmakers in a business where it ’s usually the actors who wear their beliefs on their sleeves .
A longtime backer of Democratic candidates ( recent donations include a gift to Sen. Barack Obama ) , Stone is either the oddest person to chronicle the life of the current president or the most inspired .
Whatever the verdict , the marriage of director and subject has left nearly as many people running for the sidelines as wanting to be a part of the director ’s undertaking .
Indeed , “ W.'s ” combination of story and filmmaker and the poor track record of recent biographical movies scared off at least three potential studio distributors and any number of actors , including , initially , star Brolin , and even Major League Baseball , which declined to cooperate with the production .
Yet as Stone guided Cromwell and Brolin across Shreveport ’s Independence Bowl stadium , doubling for the Rangers ’ home field , it was possible to see that “ W. ” could be , in a complicated way , sympathetic .

The father was belittling a son , George H. W. cautioning George W. to stick to simple things : “ Maybe better you stay out of the barrel , ” the senior Bush told his son , and leave the family ’s political legacy to younger brother Jeb .
“ Well , son , I ’ve got to say I was wrong about you not being good at baseball , ” the father ultimately said , tossing him a scrap of a compliment .
The future president did n’t quite get what the reproving “ barrel ” idiom meant , but he realized his father did n’t respect him .
Brolin took in the snub , but then his bearing grew determined : George W. would have to prove himself beyond anyone ’s imagining .
Stone said it ’s part of what drove the younger Bush into the White House : to show his doubters wrong .
“ Someone who could step into that path and out - father his father , ” Stone said in his air - conditioned trailer during a break in filming .
Racing to film , edit and release the film before the November election , Stone was not always getting five hours ’ sleep .
Even though it was nearly midnight and the crew was just finishing its lunch break , the 61 - year - old director grew increasingly animated talking about “ W . ”
“ I love Michael Moore , but I did n’t want to make that kind of movie , ” Stone said of “ Fahrenheit 9/11 . ”
“ W. , ” he said , “ is n’t an overly serious movie , but it is a serious subject .
It ’s a Shakespearean story .
. . .
I see it as the strange unfolding of American democracy as I have lived it . ”

Stone , Brolin and the filmmaking team believe they are crafting a biography so honest that loyal Republicans and the Bushes themselves might see it .
Given Stone ’s filmmaking history , coupled with a sneak peek at an early “ W. ” screenplay draft , that prediction looks like wishful thinking .
Still , it ’s a captivating challenge : Can a provocateur become fair and balanced ?
And if Stone is , in some way , muzzling himself to craft a mass - appeal movie , has he cast aside one of his best selling points ?
Locating an inner voice
Dressed IN a suffocating Rangers warmup jacket earlier on that scorching June day , Brolin kept running into an outfield wall , trying to make a heroic catch as part of the film ’s baseball - oriented fantasy framing device .

Stone worried the leap was n’t quite athletic enough and chose to add the baseball ’s falling into Brolin ’s mitt through visual effects -- allowing the “ No Country for Old Men ” star to throw himself into doing everything else .
Brolin spent countless hours studying the president ’s speech patterns and body language but said he was n’t trying to concoct a spitting - image impression , which ran the potential of becoming a “ Saturday Night Live ” caricature .
“ It ’s not for me to get the voice down perfectly , ” the 40 - year - old Brolin said , even though he came close .
More important , the actor said , was to unearth Bush ’s inner voice -- “ Where is my place in this world ?
How do I get remembered ? ”
Like other actors approached for the film ( including Robert Duvall , who was asked but declined to play Vice President Dick Cheney ) , Brolin had more than vague misgivings about starring in “ W . ”
He was , in fact , dead set against it .
“ When Oliver asked me , I said , ‘ Are you crazy ?
Why would I want to do this with my little moment in my career ? ’ ” Brolin recalled .
Then , early one morning during a family ski trip , Brolin read Weiser ’s original screenplay , which covers Bush from 1967 to 2004 .
“ It was very different than what I thought it would be , ” Brolin said , “ which was a far - left hammering of the president . ”

Brolin said many friends still were n’t buying it .
“ There were a lot of people I tried to get involved , who were very , very reluctant to do the movie , ” Brolin said .
In addition to Cromwell , the cast includes Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush , Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney , Toby Jones as Karl Rove and Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld .
While noting Bush ’s low approval ratings ( 23 % in a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll released this week ) , Brolin , like Stone , said “ W. ” is n’t intended to kick the man while he ’s down .
“ Republicans can look at it and say , ‘ This is why I like this guy , ’ ” Brolin said .
“ It ’s not a political movie .
It ’s a biography .
People will remember that this guy is human , when we are always [ outside of the movie ] dehumanizing him , calling him an idiot , a puppet , a failed president .
We want to know in the movie :
How does a guy grow up and become the person that he did ? ”
Stone , who was briefly a Yale classmate of Bush , is clearly no fan of the president ’s politics but said he ’s amazed by the man ’s resilience and ambition .
The movie is basically divided into three acts :
Bush ’s hard - living youth , his personal and religious conversion , and finally his first term in the Oval Office .
“ He won a huge amount of people to his side after making a huge amount of blunders and really lying to people , ” the director said .
What further fascinates Stone is Bush ’s religious and personal conversion : a hard - drinking C student who was able to become not only Texas governor but also the leader of the Free World .

“ We are trying to walk in the footsteps of W and try to feel like he does , to try to get inside his head .
But it ’s never meant to demean him , ” Stone said .
The movie has hired a former Bush colleague as an advisor , and labored to get the smallest details right .
For all the historical accuracy , though , “ W. ” is clearly a work of fiction .
“ We are playing with our own opinions and our own preconceptions of him , ” Stone said .
“ This is his diary -- his attempt to explain himself . ”
A project gains priority

This was n’t the movie Stone was supposed to be making .
Instead of “ W. , ” the film was going to be “ Pinkville , ” a look at the Army ’s investigation into 1968 ’s My Lai massacre in Vietnam .
Only days before filming was set to begin , with many sets already built and department heads in place , “ Pinkville ” star Bruce Willis pulled out of the film last fall , unhappy with a script that could n’t be rewritten because of the writers strike .
Stone flirted with casting Nicolas Cage in the lead role , but enthusiasm from United Artists -- whose war movie “ Lions for Lambs ” had just flopped -- had waned on fears that “ Pinkville ” was too violent .
At the same time , Stone had been working on the “ W. ” script with screenwriter Weiser , the author of Stone ’s 1987 hit “ Wall Street . ”
Stone was at first worried the topic was almost too timely -- “ When I made ‘ Nixon , ’ ” the director said , “ he had died . ”
Said “ W. ” producer Moritz Borman : “ He was n’t sure .
He worried , ‘ Is there enough material about Bush ?
Or will there be more once he ’s out of office ? ’
But then a slew of books came out . ”

Soon after “ Pinkville ” imploded , Stone returned to “ W. , ” and by early 2008 he was convinced it was not only the right time to make the movie but also imperative the movie hit theaters before the next presidential election , because its impact would be greatest then , when everybody was obsessing over our next president .
But that early release date created a post - production timetable that would be half of Stone ’s most hurried editing schedule .
Before he could set up his cameras , Stone and his team first had to answer a key question :
Who in the world was going to pay for it ?
“ You put the two names together -- Bush and Stone -- and everybody had a preconceived notion of what the film would be .
But look at ‘ World Trade Center , ’ ” Borman said of Stone ’s commercially successful 2006 movie about two Port Authority policemen rescued from Sept. 11 rubble .
“ There was an uproar when it was announced and then , when the movie got closer to release , the very people who protested it preached from the pulpit that it was a film that had to be seen . ”
Still , Borman and Stone knew few studios would commit to the movie , especially given the desired October 2008 release date , because studios often plan their release schedules more than a year in advance .
What they needed was an independent financier , someone not afraid of challenging material -- a person like Bill Block .
Block had formed QED International in 2006 as a production , financing and sales company interested in the kind of highbrow drama that studios increasingly shun .
Block saw in “ W. ” not a troublesome jeremiad but a crowd - pleaser , and QED colleagues Kim Fox and Paul Hanson quickly assembled the “ W. ” deal .

“ What Oliver is making is a splashy , commercial picture , ” Block said .
“ This is not a static biopic .
It ’s kinetic . ”
In addition to footing the film ’s $ 30 - million budget , QED also raised money to underwrite its prints and advertising costs upon release .
Any distributor committing to “ W. , ” in other words , would have no money at risk :
It could release the film , take the distribution fee of about 15 % and move on .
“ I think it ’s a no- brainer , ” Stone said .
All the same , “ W. ” could spark a potential inferno inside the White House .
“ You never know exactly why ” a studio rejects a movie , Stone said , while noting that all the major studios are small cogs in global conglomerates .
“ But at the highest levels , it did n’t pass .
Some would say it ’s too much of a risk and too much of a hot potato politically . ”
Stone declined to name names , but two people close to the film said among those considering but passing on the film were Paramount , Warner Bros . and Universal .
Harvey Weinstein ’s Weinstein Co. aggressively pursued the “ W. ” deal , but QED , Borman and Stone picked Lionsgate Films in part because of its strong balance sheet .
Also , because it ’s not part of a larger studio , Lionsgate is one of the only truly independent distributors left .
Lionsgate worried about fitting “ W. ” into its October schedule and has discussed a post- election release if the film is n’t ready in time .
But whenever it comes out , the company is ready for any backlash -- after all , it ’s the distributor of the “ Saw ” and “ Hostel ” films .

“ To the extent there is going to be heat , ” said Joe Drake , president of Lionsgate ’s motion picture group , “ we can take the heat .
That wo n’t be a problem . ”

Researchers have designed a sensor inspired by flies ’ compound eyes , which is capable of quickly locating the edges of objects .
Image credit : D. Fischer .
Robots with flies ' eyes could take advantage of the insect ’s vision system to better locate the edges and boundaries of objects .
This ability could help robots perform a variety of tasks more quickly and accurately than if they were using traditional sensors .
Researchers from the Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake , California , and the University of Wyoming have developed a fiber optic sensor inspired by the compound eye of the common housefly , Musca domestica .
One of the biggest advantages of the design is that it can quickly locate edges and boundaries of images .
Machines such as unmanned vehicles , guided missiles , and high - speed industrial inspection robots might take advantage of this ability to locate tiny , moving objects with high precision .
In a recent issue of Bioinspiration & Biomimetics , researchers D. Riley , et al. , describe how flies ’ vision systems are uniquely geared toward locating small objects with high precision .
In fact , flies possess a visual precision beyond the resolution limit – a property called hyperacuity .
This feature is actually common to many animals , including humans .
“ The fly has significant advantages with respect to tracking , ” the researchers told PhysOrg.com .
“ As a system , the fly has very quick reaction times . …
They can react and track much better than untrained humans ; however I would question that the quality of the rest of their vision is even comparable . ”
They added that , overall , insect vision ( and sensor technology inspired by it ) is still far inferior to human vision , and probably always will be .
The researchers explained that the more interesting component of the fly ’s vision system is that the field of view of each photoreceptor in a fly ’s eye overlaps with those next to it , with up to 90 % overlap .
Each eye contains about 3,000 ommatidia – the major structural unit of the eye – and each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptors .
The photoreceptors ’ main function is to convert light into ionic current , which then goes to the fly ’s processing system (s ) .
Unlike conventional image processing systems which are often digital , the fly ’s processing system is analog .
Digital systems receive data pixel by pixel , and generally require time - consuming , computationally expensive processing .
The analog system helps the fly extract edge information much more quickly , and also enables parallel processing .
Both these features contribute to the fly ’s highly accurate , high - speed vision system .
The researchers designed their sensor to mimic the fly ’s overlapping photoreceptors and analog , parallel processing system .
The sensor consists of a 1 - mm - diameter ball lens that focuses light onto an array of photodetectors , where the field of view overlaps by about 70 % .
In experiments , the sensor could locate a 1 - mm - wide string as the string moved across the field of vision at distances up to 200 mm from the lens , with minimal error .
Such a high - res vision system could have applications in a variety of medical , commercial , industrial , and defense areas .
The researchers are currently fabricating a sensor that consists of seven ommatidia with seven photoreceptors , and hope to extend the design in scale and accuracy .
“ We envision this sensor as a supplement to more traditional imaging sensors for most applications , and not as a replacement , ” they explain .
“ Just as Musca domestica has both two compound eyes and a very simple camera eye , many computer and robot vision tasks can benefit from both types of sensors . ”
More information : Riley , D T ; Harmann , W M ; Barrett , S F ; and Wright , C H G. “ Musca domestica inspired machine vision sensor with hyperacuity . ” Bioinspiration & Biomimetics . 3 ( 2008 ) 026003 ( 13 pp ) .

Europeans are following the US presidential election campaign closely , especially in Germany .
Germans seem eager to see an America led by someone other than President George W. Bush , who 's very unpopular here .
But overall , the US is suffering something of a popularity problem in Germany .
A Pew Institute survey of 47 nations conducted last year found that global opinion about the US has declined substantially since 2002 , even among close allies .
In Germany , America 's fall from grace has been especially dramatic .
Some observers say although Germany is one of America 's closest allies , Washington needs to boost efforts to improve its image here .

Exxon 's stance is an assertion that today 's primacy of oil will continue for years to come , and that what the oil giant does best is look for oil and gas , not manufacture solar panels .
But Abu Dhabi is doing the sort of forward planning that the Rockefellers wish Exxon would consider for tomorrow .
Today Masdar , part of the industrial development arm of the Abu Dhabi government , unveiled plans to invest $ 2 billion in thin - film photovoltaic solar technology .
True , this amounts to about a month of Exxon Mobil 's projected capital spending this year .
But in the solar world , it 's substantial and noteworthy and probably just the sort of thing the Rockefellers would like Exxon to do .
Abu Dhabi , the largest of seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates , is swimming in oil revenue - and it's investing some of that money in solar power .
That 's more than can be said for Exxon Mobil Corp. , which rebuffed a Rockefeller initiative at yesterday 's annual meeting to nudge the company toward renewable energy .
A shareholder resolution sponsored by the company 's founding family was easily defeated .
Steven Geiger , director special projects at Masdar , talked with me by phone today .
He said that Masdar aims to produce 1 gigawatt of panels by 2013 by adding plants , most likely in the southwest United States and Asia .
The first phase of investment will help bring solar power to Abu Dhabi and other Mideast oil producing countries , many of which still use oil to generate electricity , a practice that is wasteful and costly .
In addition , Geiger said , there is a “ staggering the growth of power demand ” in the UAE .
But the solar plants Masdar envisions will have the capacity to produce way more than those Mideast markets will buy .
Masdar is looking to become a player in the global solar market .
Until now , Geiger said , Abu Dhabi had made three modest investments in solar thin film companies .
By contrast , he said , “ this is 100 percent built and owned by Abu Dhabi . ”
Though the investment is big , it will still leave Masdar well behind the industry leader in thin films , U.S. - based First Solar , which is also the low - cost producer right now .
The way thin film works , Geiger explains , is that you spread two layers of amorphous silicon on large glass substrates , or panels .
It is n’t as efficient as some solar panel technologies , but it ’s cheaper and good to use in places with plenty of space , like the desert .
It ’s also good to use in hot places where the temperature on the surface of the panels can reach 75 or 80 degrees centrigrade .
And the more of it a company can make , the more it drives down costs .
Masdar quotes Deutsche Bank as saying that the current global PV market is worth US $ 15 billion and growing at 40 percent a year clip .
“ It ’s a scale game , ” Geiger said today .
“ I think you ’ve seen the entry of large tool suppliers into this business , the same people drove down costs in semiconductors and flat panels . ”
At this point , he said , solar has “ moved out of the garage , away from people trying to build better mousetraps to people with tool sets who are cranking out bigger volumes . ”
So Abu Dhabi is n’t waiting , he said .
While the oil is still flowing and with cash coffers brimming , it is diversifying into renewable technologies .
It ’s the sort of thing the current generation of Rockefellers would appreciate .
Music was a big focus of day one of the Mesh Conference with a keynote from Ethan Kaplan and a panel that included CRIA 's Graham Henderson , David Usher , and Arts & Crafts Kieran Roy .
Interestingly , the word " copyright " was never mentioned .
The Kaplan keynote ( liveblog here ) focused on the value of " experiencing " music over possessing the " artifact " and pointed to ways that artists can connect with their fan base .
Henderson acknowledged that the industry " backed the wrong horse " and that the DRM strategy that restricted the way consumers could enjoy their music was n't a clever strategy .
Left unsaid , however , is that if the commercial strategy was a failure then why is the industry insistent on pursuing a legal reform strategy that is based on what it admits was a mistake ?

Despite strenuous and awe - inspiring acts of imagination , impish acrobatics of diction , high jinks of imagery , large dollops of wordplay and death - defying high wire walks from sense to nonsense without a net , the poems in Matthea Harvey ’s Modern Life land with a thud .
It is impossible not to admire their ambition and marvel at their colorful performances , but while these poems give the impression of being chock - full of every sort of happening , they are constructed by stacking one declarative line on top of another and often end up sounding like a page from Ripley ’s Believe it or Not :
The man with the metal detector hovering over the elm ’s elephantine roots has no idea he just missed a buried paint can ( color : beige bal- let ) containing six letters and an engagement ring .
Pug owners are 90 % more likely to deny that they look like their pets than other dog owners .
The girl in the woolen hat holding her camera out to capture herself and her pug on the bench is in the 10 % minority and cherishes her own buggy brown eyes .
Mittens on strings are only metaphorical to people without children .
A jogger sees a small child with red mittens dangling from her sleeves and thinks memory , then imagines running around the park next Sunday with a big pair of silver scissors , tiny mittens blossoming from the mud puddles in her wake .
Mothers Beware the Mitten Marauder ! reads the headline in the Post .
Truly it ’s exhausting how many minds there are to swoop in and out of .
Thoughts criss - cross the paths like branches ; kites get caught in them .
Birds collide with dreams and are found dead on the road .
Sometimes a storm is the only answer .
I stir up such a wind it blows them all out of the park .
Then I pour down so much rain that the park sparkles with puddles , a thousand YOU ARE HERE signs blinking up at me and only me , until some intrepid soul comes stomping through with his loud thoughts of dinner .
( “ Once Around the Park with Omniscience ” )
This poem has its moments ( “. . .running around the park next Sunday with a big pair of scissors , tiny mittens blossoming from the mud puddles in her wake ” , “ Thoughts criss - cross the paths like branches ; kites get caught in them .
Birds collide with dreams and are found dead in the road .
Sometimes a storm is the only answer . ” ) and it contains nicely nascent story elements and an overall whimsical tone .
It puts me in mind of a children ’s story in early stages .
But as a finished poem for an adult , especially for one who is an experienced reader of poetry and who is both intelligent and ready to engage with it , the poem is of slight interest .
It is thin , then thinner .
In fact , there is a shallowness throughout this book that is not necessarily a commentary on the author ’s inner life ( obviously teeming ) , only on the author ’s choices ( or lack thereof ) , her apparent inability or unwillingness to signal what ’s more or less important in these lines .
This flat line phenomenon — the presentation of novelty in a dull way — turns up frequently in the work of some contemporary poets , and it ’s a phenomenon worth examining .
If one believes , as I do , that writing well includes , may even be predicated on , the higher - level ability of employing tonal shift , syntactical variation and pacing in the service of building suspense and interest for the reader , then the only conclusion I can draw is that Modern Life is not well written .
Even as a form of reportage it is too dull .
In fact , the most surprising thing about the book as a whole is its lack of surprise , line to line , poem to poem .
The effect , or affect ( as described in schizophrenia ) , stays flat , the language disconnected and tangential — not to the point , and what was the point , anyway ?
This style , in ascendance for the past decade , may also be viewed as a symptom .
As there is no one out there to talk to , the poet may as well be talking to him or herself , and the reader has the sensation of being stuck on a train and forced to listen to the wildly tedious monologues of someone whose last concern is how you feel about it .
Contemporary American poetry is like that train .
Nearly everyone except the poets got off at the last stop , yet the train barrels on .
If , on the other hand , one believes that writing such as Harvey ’s constitutes a “ project ” whereby the text is in service to some political or aesthetic idea ( cf Kenneth Goldsmith ’s “ boring , boring ” and “ unboring , boring ” project ) , is happy with the driving idea and has no need that the actual writing be of any interest , they may read her work as exemplary without expectation of either pleasure or understanding .
Not this reader .
The sections of Modern Life that tend toward something deeper , that have a unity of tone and that have received some critical attention as poems that successfully engage the modern life of the title ( “ The Future of Terror ” and “ Terror of the Future ” ) are also populated with line - stacks , resulting in poems with little syntactic variation .
A preponderance of lines in these poems exemplifies the syntactically coherent , semantically incoherent character of much post - language poetry and finally , for all their ambition , defeat any hope of interest or surprise as handily as the other poems in the book :
The generalissimo ’s glands directed him to and fro.
Geronimo ! said the uber - goon we called God , and we were off to the races .
Never mind that we could only grow gray things , that inspecting the horse ’s gums in the gymnasium predicted a jagged road ahead .
We were tired of hard news — it helped to turn down our hearing aids .
We could already all do impeccable imitations of the idiot , his insistent incisors working on a steak as he said there ’s an intimacy to invasion .
That much was true .
When we got jaded about joyrides , we could always play games in the kitchen garden with the prisoners .
Jump the Gun , Fine Kettle of Fish and Kick the Kidney were our favorites .
The laws the linguists thought up were particularly lissome , full of magical loopholes that spit out medals .
We had made the big time , but night still nipped at our heels .
The navigator ’s needle swung strangely , oscillating between the oilwells and ask again later .
We tried to pull ourselves together by practicing quarterback sneaks along the pylons , but the race to the ravine was starting to feel as real as the R.I.P.’s and roses carved into rock .
Suddenly the sight of a schoolbag could send us scrambling .
( “ The Future of Terror / 1 ” )
While this poem has been cited in some reviews as emblematic of Harvey ’s “ Terror ” sections , and while it is cohesive by comparison to others in these sections , it still posits the reader as a lost traveler receiving anonymous , monotonously declarative announcements over a megaphone hidden somewhere in an unfamiliar landscape , none of which turns out to be directions to familiar ground .
Nothing finally comes to anything , though there are moments of possible accretion ( for example , starting with “ We were tired of hard news ” would give the poem some traction ) , and the poem remains on one plane , in the reportorial style of the declarative sentence , a collection of needles without a haystack , a flock of bats without a cave .
What is the intent — or is it merely lack of intent — that creates such tedium ?
The diction is lively enough , the imagery often startling .
Why is it ultimately boring ?
Let ’s try another version :
We were tired of hard news — it helped to turn down our hearing aids .
We could already all do impeccable imitations of the idiot , his insistent incisors working on a steak as he said there ’s an intimacy to invasion .
That much was true .
When we got jaded about joyrides , we could always play games in the kitchen garden with the prisoners .
Jump the Gun , Fine Kettle of Fish and Kick the Kidney were our favorites .
But night still nipped at our heels .
The navigator ’s needle swung strangely , oscillating between the oilwells and ask again later .
Removing the generalissimo ’s glands , the horse ’s gums , the uber - goon and other portions of the poem that seem pointless or silly and unnecessary , and beginning with a statement that piques curiosity ( what is the “ hard news ” ? ) and ending with an intriguing quote , in an interesting syntactical position , enables a certain cohesion or structure and reveals a serious and frightening poem inside , one that may or may not benefit from another good line or two :
“ The sight of a schoolbag / could send us scrambling ” ( without the “ Suddenly ” of course ) or “ Never mind that we could only grow / gray things . ”
There is at least one good poem here , one that bears re-reading and takes its reader seriously enough not to strew red herrings around for the hell of it .
Glands , gums , and uber - goons are not the real problem , of course , only symptoms .
If “ to read ” means to follow with your eyes , one word after another , until a text becomes comprehensible , then I cannot say I ’ve read Modern Life .
If , on the other hand , “ to read ” means to scan , in the sense of reading labels , like a grocery store ’s optical reader , or if it means to observe various - sized and colored containers without being able to see what ’s inside , or if it means to skim , admiring the typeface design and visual placement on the page , or if it means to obtain data from a storage medium ( the page ) , and transfer said data to another storage medium ( the brain ) via the movement of eyes , then I can say I have read this book .
But what does such a reading mean ?
I ca n’t say I enjoyed it , nor can I say I did n’t enjoy it , since each word , then each poem , overwrites the previous one .
Was I changed by the experience ?
I do n’t know .
I do n’t think I had an experience .
With only other poets left to read poets , with critics at a loss to read or evaluate poems ( how to read or evaluate a poem not meant for a reader of the first type , above ? ) , and with a blurb - storm that blows over the landscape with such force the landscape is itself is in danger of being obliterated , poetry has entered its Golden Age of Logorrhea .
So : I put on my coat of pastilles and glass and hit the road with a Phillips screwdriver .
Dog Pants .
The way out is in , cried a newly promoted magpie .
Look inside me , Trojan the Horse said .
Someone succumbed to a shape of stars .
Someone folded in like an Robo- accordian .
Someone smelled a herd of centipedes .
Someone wondered why poetry so publicly acclaimed could be so barren of life .
Nanotechnology is paving the way toward improved solar cells .
New research shows that a film of carbon nanotubes may be able to replace two of the layers normally used in a solar cell , with improved performance at a lower cost .
Researchers have found a surprising way to give the nanotubes the properties they need : add defects .
Currently , these solar cells , called dye - sensitized solar cells , have a transparent film made of an oxide that is applied to glass and conducts electricity .
In addition , a separate film made of platinum acts as a catalyst to speed the chemical reactions involved .
Both of these materials have disadvantages , though .
The oxide films can't easily be applied to flexible materials : they perform much better on a rigid and heat resistant substrate like glass .
This increases costs and limits the kinds of products that can be made .
And expensive equipment is necessary to create the platinum films .
Jessika Trancik of the Santa Fe Institute , Scott Calabrese Barton of Michigan State University and James Hone of Columbia University decided to use carbon nanotubes to create a single layer that could perform the functions of both the oxide and platinum layers .
They needed it to have three properties : transparency , conductivity , and catalytic activity .
Ordinary carbon nanotubes films are so - so in each of these properties .
The obvious ways of improving one , though , sacrifice one of the others .
For example , making the film thicker makes it a better catalyst , but then it 's less transparent .
Previous theory had suggested that materials may function better as catalysts when they have tiny defects , providing sites for chemicals to attach .
So the researchers tried exposing the carbon nanotubes to ozone , which roughs them up a bit .
Very thin films , they found , became dramatically better catalysts , with more than ten - fold improvement .
Thin , transparent nanotube films catalyze the reduction of triiodide , a reaction important for the dye - sensitized solar cell , with a charge - transfer resistance as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that decreases with increasing film thickness .
Moreover the catalytic activity can be enhanced by exposing nanotubes to ozone to introduce defects .
Ozone - treated , defective nanotube films could serve as catalytic , transparent , conducting electrodes for the dye - sensitized solar cell .
Other applications include batteries , fuel cells , and electroanalytical devices .
In fact , the performance gets close to that of platinum .
" That 's remarkable , " Trancik says , " because platinum is considered pretty much the best catalyst there is . "
In order to address the trade - off between transparency and conductivity , the researchers tried another trick on a bottom layer of tubes : they created carbon nanotubes that were longer .
This improved both conductivity and transparency .
The carbon nanotube films might be used in fuel cells and batteries as well .
" This study is an example of using nanostructuring of materials -- changing things like defect density and tube length at very small scales -- to shift trade - offs between materials properties and get more performance out of a given material , " Trancik says .
" Making inexpensive materials behave in advanced ways is critical for achieving low - carbon emissions and low cost energy technologies . "
The researchers published their results recently in Nano Letters .
They are currently in the process of filing a patent application for their techniques .

Updated , 2:49 p.m. | Bowing to pressure from Gov. David A. Paterson and State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo , the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted unanimously on Wednesday morning to revoke free travel privileges it had extended to former and current members of its board , allowing them unlimited use of E - ZPass tags as well as travel on the authority ’s commuter railroads , subways and buses .
The vote , which was made at the authority ’s Madison Avenue headquarters after board members met behind closed doors for an hour and 18 minutes , occurred without public debate .
The vote was 12 to 0 , with one member abstaining .
Under the new policy , former board members , and spouses of former and current board members , will not receive any free travel privileges .
Current board members may still use E - ZPass tags and travel for free on the authority ’s railroads , subways and buses — but only while traveling on official M.T.A. business .
The vote represented an end to the highly publicized hubbub that started late last month , when Mr. Cuomo warned that the authority ’s practice of extending free travel benefits violated state law , which requires that board members serve without compensation .
Board members at first threatened to go to court to defend the free travel privileges , but facing mounting public pressure , the board backed down and said it would change its policies .
That seemed to end the matter .
But then , last week , some board members said they had second thoughts and defended the free travel as an important part of their jobs overseeing the region ’s mass transit system .
“ Why should I ride and inconvenience myself when I can ride in a car ? ” asked David S. Mack , a board vice chairman who represents Nassau County .
The comment , which was widely reported in the news media , drew scorn from officials .
Mr. Paterson said that any attempt to hold on to the travel privileges would show “ an utter contempt for average New Yorkers ” at a time of rising gas and food prices .
The board quickly backed down , once again , and Mr. Mack , in a statement last Wednesday , said , “ I regret that my comments yesterday did not reflect my commitment to the M.T.A. and the work it does to provide the best public transportation system in the United States . ”
Today ’s vote occurred after board members met in executive session , their deliberations closed to the public .
Normally , the board is required to hold all its meetings in public , but members said that the potential for litigation from Mr. Cuomo ’s office justified their meeting in private .
In the public vote that followed the executive session , one member , James L. Sedore Jr. , who represents Dutchess County , abstained .
Two members , Andrew M. Saul , a vice chairman of the board who represents Westchester County , and Robert C. Bickford , a new board member representing Putnam County , were absent .
( One board member , Francis H. Powers of Staten Island , died on Saturday and has not been replaced . )
The M.T.A. board is a complex entity .
The 17 voting members are all technically appointed by the governor , but effectively , six report to the governor , four represent the mayor of New York City , and three are delegates from Westchester , Nassau and Suffolk Counties .
The last four voting members , all from suburban counties , collectively share one vote .
There are 14 votes .
There are six additional , nonvoting members , representing labor unions and riders ’ advocacy groups .
On Wednesday afternoon , a few hours after the vote , the authority also said that former board members would also be required to return parking placards issued by the authority ’s Police Department .
Current members will continue to be allowed to use the placards on official business .
H. Dale Hemmerdinger , the M.T.A. chairman , said in a statement : “ No M.T.A. board member serves for a free pass — we are all here to serve the public good .
We hope that this policy change will make that clear and allow us to return our focus to tackling the difficult challenges facing the transportation system . ”

Following the recent post , State pattern using Modules and Facets Aman King asked :
In Aman 's comment he also points out that the Programming Ruby provides the following information .
Part of the answer to Aman 's question is in the statement from Programming Ruby .
The way I think of it , each class can have zero or one superclass ; however , each class may also have zero or many ancestors that are proxies to modules .
You could simplify the previous statement and think of the modules themselves being an ancestor , but it can be important to note the difference because a change to a module will be reflected by all classes that include that module ( even classes that included the module before the new behavior was added to the module ) .
Let 's look at an example of a classes ' ancestors .
The ancestors collection includes the class itself [ Family Member ] , all included modules [ Lynn , James , Kernel ] , and the superclass [ Object ] .
The order of the ancestors collection is also important .
The order of the ancestors is the order that the methods will be looked up when the object receives a message .
Therefore , any message that is sent to a Family Member instance will first look in the methods of FamilyMember , then in Lynn , then James , etc .
If Lynn and James were to define a method , both of those methods would live on the proxies themselves , not on the Family Member class .
Since the methods live on the proxies , including more modules will not overwrite a previous method definition ; however , the last included module to define a method will be the first consulted when that message is sent .
The module that was included last ( and defines the method ) will execute and return , and any other definitions of that method ( found on other ancestors ) will not be executed .
So , given the above , how does Kernel .as allow me to call the methods of James even though Lynn clearly has precedence ?
Let 's look at the implementation :
For performance reasons ( I assume ) , Kernel .as stores the As instance in a hash ; however , for the purposes of our example the only thing worth noting is that Kernel .as returns an instance of the As class initialized withand the .
Generally , the As instance is returned and a method is immediately called on the As instance .
If the As instance does n't respond to the message it is sent , the method_missing method is invoked .
The above method_missing definition is what allows you to call a method on any ancestor .
Let 's start with an example and then walk through the method_missing definition to see how it works .
In the above example the member instance receives the messagewhich returns an instance of As initialized with the member instance and the module James ( as the ancestor ) .
Following the return of the As instance , it receives themessage .
Since the As instance does n't define , method_missing is called passing inas the first argument ( sym ) .
Within method_missing , the ancestor ( James ) receives the messagewith the sym ( : name ) as the argument .
Themethod will return the unbound methodfrom the ancestor ( James ) .
Next , method_missing binds the unbound method ( name ) to the subject ( the member instance ) and sends themessage ( with arguments , which are empty in our example ) .
When the unbound method executes bound to the subject it can access any state or behavior of the subject .
In our example , the method merely returns " James " ; however , the example from State pattern using Modules and Facets verifies that a method from the subject may be called from the unbound method when it is bound to the subject .

As the U.S. burns our food supply by producing government subsidized corn ethanol , riots over food shortages and skyrocketing prices are taking place around the globe , some resulting in deaths .
Yet the president has mandated the burning of our food to make a “ green ” fuel .
Hold on now ; do n’t get your exercise jumping to conclusions .
George Bush ai n’t the sharpest knife in the drawer , but he has 535 buddies who take a cue from the chickens as to when it ’s time to come in out of the rain .
The folks on the Democratic side of the aisle nearly died from joy when “ Badlands ” Bush announced the “ great green plan . ”
I watched that particular speech and I thought the riot police were going to have to be called in to calm down the celebration that broke out on both sides of the aisle .
Have you ever seen Jeff Foxworthy ’s , “ Are You Smarter than A Fifth Grader ? ”
They ask adults grade school questions , and for the most part , they ca n’t answer them .
So far , no one from Congress has qualified to be on the show .
Let ’s play a little game today on Brother Foxworthy ’s theme .
Here ’s the question , “ If in years past , we planted and harvested crops across America for use as food , or to produce food such as meat .
And , you suddenly started to burn these crops up in the tank of your automobile , what would happen ?
The fifth grader would answer , “ I do n’t have an automobile , ” after which they would say , “ Buy corn and grain futures and you will become a millionaire while people all over the world starve . ”
Congress would answer , “ Huh ? ” After which they would say , “ I had no idea why my stock broker invested my money in commodities . ”
They would then look into the camera and say , “ I ’m not smarter than a fifth grader . ”
Readership on this site is up …a lot .
Thanks to all of you who are reading and commenting on these important issues .
While I add a little humor to the mix , I predicted the ethanol debacle from the outset and so did the fifth graders .
It ’s important to understand just how barn broom dumb our leaders are .
Consider the childish behavior and name calling of our top three contenders for president as a sterling example .
If even one of them had the slightest clue as how to bring back the jobs , rather than talk about he said and she said , they would trot out a plan to save Middle America … except that , they do n’t have a plan .

Vice President Dick Cheney used every trick he could to evade the draft and military service altogether during the Vietnam War .
His evasion of service has significant ramifications in his execution of the Iraq War .
Americans should demand more in their vice president .
There does n't seem to be much that Cheney would n't do to avoid service in Vietnam .
Cheney applied for and received four draft deferments for being a student at Casper College and University of Wyoming between 1963 and 1965 .
On August 7 , 1964 , Congress approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which greatly increased Cheney 's chance of being drafted , but 22 days later , he married Lynne .
At the time , married men were exempt from being drafted .
Hence if student deferments were to become disallowed , his marriage might still decrease his chances of being drafted .
But the war kept demanding more troops , and the number of people eligible for the draft rapidly expanded .
On May 19 , 1965 , Cheney was reclassified with the most dangerous draft status .
On July 28 , 1965 , President Lyndon Johnson announced that the number of people drafted would double .
Then on October 26 , 1965 , the Selective Service announced that it would start drafting married men with no children .
Married men with children were still exempt from the draft .
Exactly nine months and two days later , Cheney 's first daughter , Elizabeth , was born .
During the first trimester of Lynne 's pregnancy , Cheney applied for and received another draft deferment .
Altogether , Cheney finagled five draft deferments .
This is n't what Cheney recalled in 1989 during a Senate confirmation hearing to be secretary of defense to the first President Bush .
Cheney was questioned about his failure to serve and responded , " I would have obviously been happy to serve had I been called . "
Cheney admitted in the same year to a Washington Post reporter that he " had other priorities in the 60s than military service . "
Cheney said he had " other priorities " than military service , but many brave men from Cheney 's hometown of Casper , Wyoming , such as Specialist 4 Richard Sweeney , Gunnery Sergeant Robert Grove , and Captain Carlton Holland , served instead of Cheney and died in Vietnam .
Cheney was busy with his " other priorities " while supporting the war in which he was too lily - livered to fight .
During the 2004 election campaign , Cheney strongly criticized the national defense commitment of Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) , the Democratic nominee for president .
This criticism was outrageous and disgraceful because Kerry was a Vietnam War hero who volunteered for service in the U.S.
Navy , requested duty as a swift boat officer , which was one of the most dangerous combat duties in Vietnam , and demonstrated exceptional valor in combat , which resulted in winning a Silver Star , a Bronze Star , and three Purple Hearts .
Kerry served America with tremendous courage , honor , and distinction during two tours of duty , and to this day , he still has shrapnel left in a leg from his battle wounds .
Cheney was supportive of the Vietnam War , but used every dirty trick he could find to avoid serving in it .
Then he had the gall to criticize Kerry 's commitment to national defense .
Kerry could have used his privileged background to evade service in Vietnam like Cheney , who finagled five draft deferments .
But Kerry volunteered to serve , even though he did n't believe the war was worthwhile , because he knew if he did n't go , another young American would be sent in his place .
Besides criticizing Kerry 's commitment to national defense , Cheney stood by while his surrogates distorted and skewered Kerry 's honorable and courageous service in Vietnam .
Referring to Cheney 's criticism of Kerry 's commitment to national defense , Senator Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , another Navy veteran , responded , " When I hear this coming from Dick Cheney , who was a coward , who would not serve during the Vietnam War , it makes my blood boil .
Those of us who served and those of us who went in the military do n't like it when someone like a Dick Cheney comes out and he wants to be tough .
Yeah , he 'll be tough .
He 'll be tough with somebody else 's blood , somebody else 's kids .
But not when it was his turn to go . "
" Our problem with this current war in Iraq is that we 're being governed by the chickenhawks , " said former Governor Jesse Ventura , a Vietnam veteran .
" You know what a chickenhawk is ?
That 's somebody when it was their time to serve they were chicken .
But now they come back when they 're 50 years old and they 're hawks .
I laugh when President Bush says - he come out a few months ago and said the problem with Vietnam was we left too soon .
Well , why did n't he come over and help out ?
Or why did n't five or four or five deferment Dick Cheney show up ?
And how is it that a guy with four or five deferments from the military can end up the secretary of defense ?
Should n't you have at least served ?
You 're the main liaison between civilian and military .
Should n't you have at least had military service ?
And yet here 's Dick Cheney , a [ former ] secretary of defense . "
Cheney was recently asked about the milestone of 4000 American troops being killed in Iraq .
He responded , " The president carries the biggest burden , obviously .
He 's the one who has to make the decision to commit young Americans . "
Lieutenant General Gregory Newbold , the former director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , described Cheney 's attitude well when he said , " The commitment of our forces to this fight was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special province of those who have never had to execute these missions or bury the results . "
Cheney says that Democrats favoring a timetable for withdrawal of American troops believe in " cut and run , " as if he is the courageous one for staying the course , but he is n't among the troops facing the prospect of death every day in Iraq .
Cheney cut and run when his country needed him in Vietnam .
As a result of his evasion of service in the Vietnam War , Cheney has no firsthand experience in or appreciation of the risks of war , such as becoming a prisoner of war .
This truancy undoubtedly contributed to troops being sent into combat without proper body armor and enough armored vehicles .
It contributed to him supporting policies that created so many more insurgents and enemies of America instead of winning over hearts and minds in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This includes being indifferent to tremendous civilian casualties , allowing Iraqi home invasions , imprisoning numerous innocent people including children , holding detainees for years without charges , eliminating their right of habeas corpus , sanctioning the abuse and torture of prisoners , and gutting the Geneva Conventions meant to protect American and foreign troops .
All of these policies created many more enemies and thus many more American casualties .
Cheney never needed the protection of the Geneva Conventions , but American troops do .
Because Cheney helped discard the Geneva Conventions for enemy combatants who become prisoners of war , American troops who become prisoners of war can't expect to be treated under the Geneva Conventions by the enemy .
Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the former leader of Al - Qaeda in Iraq , beheaded American Nick Berg as revenge for humiliation and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison by American troops .
What a way to die .
The American public should be outraged that this beheading was caused by the Bush Administration 's policies for treatment of prisoners .
Cheney acts as the de facto behind - the - scenes president on foreign policy .
This chickenhawk does n't have the moral authority to send troops into combat when he was too scared to serve in the war fought by his generation .
Cheney supported the Vietnam War as long as he did n't have to fight in it .
While he evaded service in Vietnam , many other young Americans died in his place .
Why would any veteran or member of the military support someone who shirked his duties when he honorably performed or is performing his duties ?
Why would any citizen support someone with such a disgraceful record of evading military service ?
Why would anybody reward cowardice over courage ?
Through his actions and words , Cheney said that if his country needed him , do n't come calling on him , but send someone else in his place .
Now Cheney thinks he can be a leader for the armed services and the country .
Wake up , America .
If he did n't have the courage to serve , he does n't have the courage to lead .
Takashi Murakami , My Lonesome Cowboy Courtesy of Sotheby’s
Of the many happy campers at the record - demolishing ( and economy - confounding )
Sotheby ’s auction last night , Takashi Murakami may have been the happiest .
Drawing stares from art - world veterans — one told us she ’d never seen an artist show up to watch his own work on the block — the Japanese Pop maestro sat in the back of the room with a serene smile as My Lonesome Cowboy , his larger - than - life sculpture of a boy waving an ejaculate lasso , brought in $ 15.2 million — quintupling the artist ’s previous record at auction .
( The signature piece , an edition of which is currently on view at the artist ’s Brooklyn Museum show , was sold by his former dealer Marianne Boesky . )
“ Oh , it ’s not surprising , ” Murakami said as he huddled with his Paris dealer , Emmanuel Perrotin , after the auction .
Pretty gratifying , though ?
“ Yeah , yeah , yeah , ” he said .
“ Basically . ”
Another contented observer of the auction , albeit from the astral plane , was Robert Rauschenberg .
Two days after the artist ’s death at 82 , his painting Overdrive did , as speculated , set a record , bringing in $ 14.6 million .
( All Sotheby ’s figures include their commission , which is about 10 percent atop the winning bid . )
The big winner of the night , however , was Francis Bacon , whose triptych set a new record for the artist when it went to a phone bidder for a staggering $ 86.3 million .
( “ Be brave , ” auctioneer Tobias Meyer had exhorted the buyers calling in , presumably from oversees .
“ Look at the Euros . ” )
There were some surprises at the sale , however .
Most notably , a massive Rothko failed to draw a single bidder .
( Sotheby ’s , which devoted a full eight pages to the work in the night ’s catalogue , had forecast it would earn more than $ 35 million . )
“ We ’ve seen an inevitable moving towards bigger and bigger , ” Nick Lawrence , the Freight +
Volume gallerist , said .
“ When will it get to where the center cannot hold ? ”
But on a night that drew out many of the major players , it appeared that the center was holding just fine for the time being .
“ At first I wondered whether the famous irrational exuberance might be at work , ” said writer Anthony Haden - Guest , who is working on a book about the history of the thrumming market .
“ But no , it started real strong , though it molted a bit towards the end .
I think it ’s certainly remarkable . ”

Takashi Murakami Watches From the Wings at Sotheby’s
Menzie Chinn listens to George W. Bush and is driven positively shrill .
Menzie :
Econbrowser : " Harvard 's Feldstein Says U.S. Economy in Recession " : [ This ] highlights an interesting counterpoint between the statements coming out from the Administration , on one hand , and from academic and financial sector economists , on the other ....
[ C ] onsider the speech President Bush delivered today at the Economic Club of New York .
First of all , in a free market , there 's going to be good times and bad times .
That 's how markets work .
There will be ups and downs .
And after 52 consecutive months of job growth , which is a record , our economy obviously is going through a tough time .
It 's going through a tough time in the housing market , and it 's going through a tough time in the financial markets .
And I want to spend a little time talking about that , but I want to remind you , this is not the first time since I 've been the President that we have faced economic challenges .
We inherited a recession .
And then there was the attacks of September the 11th , 2001 , which many of you saw firsthand , and you know full well how that affected our economy .
And then we had corporate scandals .
And I made the difficult decisions to confront the terrorists and extremists in two major fronts , Afghanistan and Iraq .
And then we had devastating natural disasters .
And the interesting thing , every time , this economy has bounced back better and stronger than before .
So I 'm coming to you as an optimistic fellow ....
Our job in Washington is to foster enterprise and ingenuity ....
And the challenge is not to do anything foolish in the meantime ....
But as Glenn mentioned , these are tough times .
Growth fell to 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year .
It 's clearly slow .
The economy shed more than 80,000 jobs in two months .
Prices are up at the gas pump and in the supermarket .
Housing values are down .
Hardworking Americans are concerned -- they 're concerned about their families , and they 're concerned about making their bills .
Fortunately , we recognized the slowdown early and took action .
And it was decisive action , in the form of policies that will spur growth .
We worked with the Congress .
I know that may sound incongruous to you , but I do congratulate the Speaker and Leader Reid , as well as Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Secretary Paulson , for anticipating a problem and passing a robust package quickly .
This package is temporary , and it has two key elements .
First , the growth package provides incentives for businesses to make investments in new equipment this year .
As more businesses take advantage , investment will pick up , and then job creation will follow .
The purpose was to stimulate investment .
And the signal is clear -- once I signed the bill , the signal to folks in businesses large and small know that there 's some certainty in the tax code for the remainder of this year .
I have two observations : First , I 'm not sure the President read the Policy Statement of The President 's Working Group on Financial Markets .
From the speech :
... yesterday Hank Paulson announced new recommendations to strengthen oversight of the mortgage industry , and improve the way the credit ratings are determined for securities , and ensure proper risk management at financial institutions .
In other words , we 've got an active plan to help us get through this rough period .
We 're always open for new ideas , but there are certain principles that we wo n't violate .
And one of the principles is overreacting by federal law and federal regulation that will have long - term negative effects on our economy .
From the Policy Statement of The President 's Working Group on Financial Markets ( Section III .
Policy Issues and Recommendations , page 11 ) :
Federal and state regulators should strengthen and make consistent government oversight of all entities that originate and fund mortgages and otherwise interface with customers in the mortgage origination process .
All states should work towards adopting the principles set forth in the guidance developed by the federal regulators for nontraditional and subprime mortgage lending and ensure that effective enforcement mechanisms are in place to deal with noncompliance with such standards .
One key step that already has been taken is that the Conference of State Bank Supervisors ( CSBS ) issued principles - based underwriting guidance on subprime mortgages in July 2007 that was nearly identical to guidance issued earlier by federal supervisory agencies .
In addition , a group of supervisors has launched a pilot program to review the underwriting standards and senior management oversight of risk management strategies for ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations .
3
The results of these reviews should be analyzed in order to determine whether to continue the project and , if so , how to focus future reviews .
Presumably , there 'd be no need to strengthen oversight if oversight had been sufficient in the run-up to the bust ... the President apparently still has little understanding of how his Administration 's policies have led to where we are .
That includes a deregulatory zeal that set the stage for at least the housing market portion of the financial meltdown ( see [ 0 ] , [ 1 ] ) .
Of course , not all of the housing boom was due to the failure of prudential regulation on the part of the Federal government ; but if the Administration was happy to take credit for the frenzied buildup , it should be willing to take its share of the blame ( deserved in my mind ) for the downturn .
Second , I 'm not sure he has a clear idea of the head - winds the economy is facing [ 2 ] .
Even taking into account the fact that the President has to put a positive gloss on the current economic situation in order to maintain confidence , to say that " there will be ups and downs " strikes me as a little blithe .
Fortunately , we can use fiscal policy to get us out of this downturn , should it turn out to be more severe than the previous two recessions , as hinted in the latest WSJ poll of ( primarily nonacademic ) economists ( ok , it 's only 47 % who say that , but remember most of the surveyed economists did n't predict a recession until this survey ... ) .
Oops , I forgot we used up our fiscal ammunition in two tax cuts [ 3 ] , a war of choice ( at least $ 10 billion per month in direct fiscal costs ) [ 4 ] , and implementing Medicare Part D ( CBO letter [ pdf ] , [ 5 ] ) .
Let 's hope the Chinese , and the sovereign wealth funds of the Persian Gulf countries [ 6 ] , are going to be willing to re-capitalize the banking system .
The more traditional event spectators at the Head of the Charles Regatta have their spots along the banks of the Charles , on docks and on the car bridges crossing from Cambridge .
From almost any spot you hear the banter of the coxes , the cutting of the water by oars , or the slapping of the water when some of the boats made their way to the starting line .
Thomas Doggett , an Irish comedian and joint manager of the Drury Lane Theatre , provided in his will dated 10th September 1721 , for a prize of a coat and silver badge to be rowed for annually by six watermen within a year of completing their apprenticeships .
As a real test of stay and endurance , the race used to be rowed in heavy old wherries which had to be pulled up against the ebb tide - sometimes it took contestants nearly two hours to row the distance !
The race soon became open to abuses as contestants realized the advantages of using lighter undersized vessels .
In some instances riotous behavior was reported between competitors .
In 1723 , one of the leaders of the race had his “ scull knocked away and a big boat rowed across his bows " .
The Head of the Charles Regatta is the world 's largest two - day rowing event .
The first race took place October 16 , 1965 .
In its 40 - year history , the race has grown into a regatta which draws over 300,000 fans and over 5,400 athletes from around the world .
For more pictures from Rowing Regatta read : Rowing boats ( or similar vessels ) have been around for centuries .
And for more Rowing Lore read :
The last boat standing was referred to as the " head of the river . "

Oxfam says there is an " invisible army " of exploited workers in Britain Up to two million workers in Britain are at risk of exploitation because of their vulnerable work status , a report by the TUC has suggested .
Its research found some employees being paid £ 1 an hour , some working 70 hours a week and others facing sexual abuse .
The union body , which set up a commission to uncover the extent of such poor treatment , described the situation as a " national scandal " .
The government said it was boosting penalties for rogue employers .
The TUC , which set up the Commission on Vulnerable Employment last year , said exploitative employment practices seen in the 19th Century were still being used by some employers today .
It found home - workers being paid £ 1 an hour , fast food employees working 70 hours a week and domestic staff facing physical and sexual abuse .
' Blind eye ' Kate Wareing , director for UK Poverty for the charity Oxfam , said there was an " invisible army " of exploited workers in the UK , who were doing some of the lowest paid , most insecure and unpopular jobs in the country " .
Good employers have nothing to fear - and much to gain - from policies that stop them being undercut by bad employers who break the law
Brendan Barber
TUC
The report called for a campaign to raise people 's awareness of workers ' rights , extra funding for bodies such as the Heath and Safety Executive and the setting up of a special Fair Employment Commission to police rogue employers and enforce workers rights .
Commission member Kevin Beeston , chairman of public service management company Serco , said it was " time society stopped turning a blind eye to these workplace abuses " .
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said the treatment uncovered by the commission was a " national scandal " and said urgent action was needed .
" Good employers have nothing to fear - and much to gain - from policies that stop them being undercut by bad employers who break the law or use loopholes to get round it , " he added .
' Clear exploitation '
As part of the commission 's report , a Community union survey of 8,000 workers also found three out of four workplaces used temporary and agency workers , with some on contracts of a week or under .
Some were on just two hours ' notice .
Most employers do the right thing , but some are doing the wrong thing , so it 's vital we enforce the law
Pat McFadden
Employment relations minister General secretary Michael Leahy said this was " clear exploitation " of agency workers , who , he said , were being used to undermine the pay and conditions of permanent staff .
Employment relations minister Pat McFadden said the TUC 's report would be looked at as part of the government 's vulnerable workers ' forum , which is due to report back in the summer .
But he said the exploitation of such workers was " unacceptable " and the government had worked hard to bring in extra employment rights such as the national minimum wage , paid holidays , health and safety regulations , statutory maternity and paternity leave and sick pay .
" Most employers do the right thing , but some are doing the wrong thing , so it 's vital we enforce the law , " he said .
" That 's why we 're boosting penalties and enforcement to catch those who do n't pay the national minimum wage and doubling the amount of agency inspectors to investigate abuses . "
New regulations also ensured bosses could not unfairly deduct accommodation and other expenses from people 's wages , he added .

What are these ?
Indeed , the bill included too many things that lawmakers of both parties , from farming regions and big cities alike , held dear , so Mr. Bush was overridden hours after he reiterated his objections .
“ For a year and a half , I have consistently asked that the Congress pass a good farm bill that I can sign , ” Mr. Bush said in his veto announcement .
“ Regrettably , the Congress has failed to do so .
At a time of high food prices and record farm income , this bill lacks program reform and fiscal discipline . ”
Mr. Bush said the bill included too many subsidies for wealthy farmers and “ budget gimmicks ” to hide its most egregious spending .
Executed without ceremony , the veto was the 10th of Mr. Bush ’s presidency , and there was no optimism at the White House that it would stand .
The president ’s spokeswoman , Dana Perino , conceded as much .
“ If you look at the vote count , an override is probably likely , just looking at the raw numbers of it , ” she said at a news briefing hours before the House vote .
She was alluding to last week ’s voting , when the bill cleared the House by 318 votes to 106 , and the Senate by 81 votes to 15 .
“ But I do think that members are going to have to think about how they will explain these votes back in their districts at a time when prices are on the rise , ” Ms. Perino continued .
“ People are not going to want to see their taxes increased for farmers that we believe are already well taken care of in the marketplace . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Earnings at Morgan Stanley fell by more than half last quarter , hurt by a decline in its investment banking and sales and trading businesses , the company reported Wednesday .
The No. 2 investment bank reported a 57 % decline in profits from continuing operations to $ 1.026 billion , or 95 cents per share , down from $ 2.363 billion , or $ 2.24 per share , a year ago .
The results , however , were better than expected on an earnings - per - share basis .
Analysts had forecast the company would report a profit of 92 cents a share , according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters .
Revenue at the firm suffered , falling well short of analysts ' estimates .
During the quarter , it dropped 38 % to $ 6.5 billion from $ 10.52 billion a year ago .
Analysts had expected sales of $ 7.05 billion .
Investors were not comforted by the news .
Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) shares fell nearly 4 % in afternoon trade .
" Morgan Stanley 's earnings today suggest that even the most well oiled sports cars face engine troubles from time to time , " wrote David Easthope , senior analyst at independent research and consulting firm Celent LLC .
Morgan Stanley 's chairman and CEO John Mack blamed tough market conditions and lower levels of client activity , which ended up hurting results in a number of different divisions .
Among the hardest hit was the company 's asset management division , which posted a pre-tax loss of $ 227 million , hurt by losses on investments in real estate and private equity that had helped produce a $ 303 million profit just a year ago .
The company 's fixed income business also got dinged , particularly in sales and trading as well as underwriting .
Revenue at its institutional securities business sank to $ 3.6 billion , less than half of last year 's levels of $ 7.4 billion .
Investment banking revenues slipped as well , falling 49 % to $ 875 million during the quarter .
The company also booked a $ 519 million loss related to leveraged loans and noted that the performance of its commodities business was hurt by bad bets on electricity and oil .
Morgan Stanley management also took the earnings announcement as an opportunity to reveal that it suffered a $ 120 million loss after one of its London - based traders mismarked its books .
Colm Kelleher , the company 's chief financial officer , said during a conference call with analysts the individual was suspended and that the company was conducting a full internal review of the matter .
Offsetting those woes was a $ 1.43 billion pre-tax gain from asset sales , which included one of its Spanish wealth management businesses .
But if Morgan Stanley management had a message to deliver Wednesday , it was that it was exercising caution , especially when it came to taking risks .
During the quarter , the company did just that , by shrinking its balance sheet and reducing its leverage .
" We will continue to stay close to shore given the current market conditions and focus on our balance sheet and liquidity , " Kelleher told analysts during the conference call .
Wednesday 's results , while troubling , are a far cry from where Morgan Stanley was just six months ago .
In the fourth quarter , the company posted a $ 3.59 billion loss -- the first in the company 's 72 - year history .
But the horizon has looked dreary as of late for Wall Street .
Some underwriting activity has slowed , investment banks are relying less on leverage to boost their returns and have been cutting jobs to deal with the credit crisis .
" There is a great deal of market skepticism building for many of these firms , " said Dan Alpert , managing director of the boutique New York City - based investment bank Westwood Capital .
" To replace their earnings and earnings growth in prior years is going to be incredibly difficult . "
Morgan Stanley is the latest investment bank to report this week that its results have taken a hit due to the credit crunch .
Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) confirmed its previously announced $ 2.8 billion second - quarter loss on Monday while its management sought to ease concerns about the firm 's underlying health .
And while Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) posted a much better - than - expected $ 2.1 billion quarterly profit on Tuesday , earnings were still lower than a year ago .
Goldman also reported sluggish activity in its investment banking division and suffered a $ 500 million hedging loss .

Avoiding the OOM killer with mem_notify
LWN .net needs you !

Having applications that use up all the available memory can be a fairly painful experience .
For Linux systems , it generally means a visit from the out - of - memory ( OOM ) killer , which will try to find processes to kill .
As one would guess , coming up with rules governing which process to kill is challenging — someone , somewhere , will always be unhappy with a choice the OOM killer makes .
Avoiding it altogether is the goal of the mem_notify patch .
When memory gets tight , it is quite possible that applications have memory allocated — often caches for better performance — that they could free .
After all , it is generally better to lose some performance than to face the consequences of being chosen by the OOM killer .
But , currently , there is no way for a process to know that the kernel is feeling memory pressure .
The patch provides a way for interested programs to monitor the / dev/mem_notify file to be notified if memory starts to run low .
/ dev/mem_notify is a character device that signals memory pressure by becoming readable .
Interested programs can open the file and then use poll ( ) or select ( ) to monitor the file descriptor .
Alternatively , signal - driven I/O can be enabled via the FASYNC flag and the system will deliver a SIGIO signal to the process when the device becomes readable .
If it becomes readable , the process should free any memory that it can afford to give up .
If enough memory is freed this way , the kernel will have no need to call in the OOM killer .
The crux of the patch is how to decide that memory pressure is occurring .
mem_notify modifies shrink_active_list ( ) to look for movement of an anonymous page to the inactive list , which is an indication that some will likely be swapped out soon .
When that occurs , memory_pressure_notify ( ) ( with the pressure flag set to 1 ) will be called for that zone .
When the number of free pages for the zone increase above a threshold — based on pages_high and lowmem_reserve for the zone — memory_pressure_notify ( ) is called again , but with the pressure flag set to 0 , effectively ending the memory pressure event for that zone .
If there are numerous processes waiting for a memory pressure notification , it could be counterproductive to wake them all at once — the " thundering herd " problem .
To combat this , the patch set adds the ability to wake fewer processes than are waiting on the poll event , by adding the poll_wait_exclusive ( ) function . poll_wait_exclusive ( ) will in turn call add_wait_queue_exclusive ( ) so that a member of the wake_up ( ) family can be used that will limit the number of processes woken up .
Previously , only poll_wait ( ) was available , it uses add_wait_queue ( ) , which does not provide this ability .
Also , to reduce the frequency of processes waking up to reclaim memory , memory_pressure_notify ( ) will only do that once every five seconds .
The / proc / zoneinfo output has been changed to include the mem_notify status .
This can be used by a human for diagnostic purposes or by a program to check the current status of zones for memory pressure .
The embedded community has a lot of interest in seeing this feature get added to the kernel .
Devices like phones and PDAs are often running close to their memory limits and the OOM killer is currently unavoidable when the user opens yet another application .
With this patch in place , programs that use a lot of memory , but could get by with less , can be changed to free up their caches and the like when memory gets tight .
As memory hungry programs get changed , other users will benefit as well .
The patch , submitted by Kosaki Motohiro , has been through several iterations on linux - kernel .
The work was originally started by Marcelo Tosatti , with the fifth version recently posted by Kosaki .
Previous versions have been well received and with relatively few comments on this iteration , it would seem to be getting close to being merged .

Want a sure bet ?
Bet on deleveraging �the only place where deflation and inflation make common cause �
***
So many foreclosures , so little time �apartment sales in Manhattan are at an 18 - year low - but prices are still higher than ever !
***
Argentina may face worst unrest since the 1970 's �a neighbor you would definitely want to lend you some sugar �and more !
---------------------
It is a " leveraged planet , " says the New York Times .
It explains that an ounce of leverage in Manhattan is likely to turn into a pound of credit in Dubai �which could quite possibly fall as a ton of debt on someone 's head in Norway .
Norwegian fishermen were surprised when they discovered that they were taking losses from US subprime mortgage debt .
So were German dentists .
But that 's just the way globalization works .
We have nothing against it , but neither would we mind if there were less of it .
Which raises the big question : is the leveraged planet becoming even more leveraged �or less so ?
Ah , dear reader �this is where inflation and deflation make common cause .
They both de-leverage the world �reducing the value of debt - either by defaults or by lowering the real value of the debt itself .
That is the real story in the financial markets �and in the housing market : leverage is being marked down .
A residential mortgage worth $ 200,000 two years ago may be worth only $ 150,000 now , for example .
Bear Stearns - worth billions a few months ago - is now worth peanuts .
Inflation takes leverage down too .
All those U.S. dollars held abroad ( and at home , for that matter ) �all those dollar - denominated Treasury bonds �all those dollar denominated I.O.Us - they all lose value as inflation increases .
Just take those 2 trillion odd dollars outside America .
Every one of them is a claim against U.S. assets - land , houses , tractors , food , stocks , buildings , you name it .
And as inflation takes prices upwards , each of those dollars falls to the ground �it will buy less of what the United States has to offer .
We have been talking about the battle raging between inflation and deflation .
But this is one way to win , no matter which side comes out ahead .
Want a sure bet ?
Bet on deleveraging .
How do you do that ?
There are many ways .
Sell the industry that provides leverage , for example - the financial sector .
Sell Wall Street on rallies , in other words .
Yesterday was a good day to sell .
After having gone up more in a single day than the entire value of the Dow in ' 29 , it was time to take profits .
And that 's what investors did .
The Dow sold off a little .
Gold , meanwhile , gave investors a buying opportunity .
At $ 887 , we 're not saying that that is the best price this correction will offer �but it was n't bad .
And many buyers decided to take advantage of it .
Gold rose back to $ 900 .
Now let 's look at the U.S. economy itself .
Ah�so many foreclosures �so little time .
Food up 9 % .
Houses down 11 % .
What 's an upside - down homeowner to do but walk away ?
According to yesterday 's USA Today , so many are walking away in Denver that it is producing an ' Exodus ' of Biblical proportions .
Some neighbors have one out of 8 houses in foreclosure .
Citywide , the total last year was one out of 32 .
Where do these people go ?
They rent , naturally .
Rental vacancy rates have fallen from 10 % two years ago to 5 % today Meanwhile , from Manhattan come two bits of conflicting news : apartment sales are down to an 18 - year low �but prices are at an all - time high .
Buyers are holding back , in other words �but sellers hold out too - for more money .
Across the nation , repossession filings are up 93 % from last year .
And as we saw yesterday , food stamps are up big time .
But there really are n't any " stamps " any more .
Now , the food comes via plastic , a type of credit card that can be used - theoretically - only for buying food .
In practice , nice shopkeepers in bad neighborhoods take the card and give back cash at steep discount .
Say a $ 10 charge for 7 bucks worth of cash to buy life 's real necessities - liquor , cigarettes and gas .
It 's all going according to plan , as we see it .
The empire is rolling over .
Now , in its advanced , decadent phase , the imperial government must provide bread - in the form of plastic food stamps �and circuses - in the form of national party conventions , elections and foreign wars .
The combination settles the public �and distracts them .
They become docile , subservient , willing to stand in line to protect themselves from make - believe threats �and ready to put up with any nonsense , no matter how grotesque , absurd or faithless .
In the latest financial news comes word of new proposals to " regulate " Wall Street �and new initiatives to " save " homeowners .
The free market is out .
' Public responsibility ' is in .
Treasury Secretary Paulson : " I think you will continue to see flexibility as we learn and go forward , '' changing his tune from last month when he said proposals to use government funds were a " non- starter . "
Why are they a starter now ?
People come to believe what they must believe when they must believe it , is our observation .
Both private citizens and the government too have taken on obligations that they can't possibly fulfill .
Since it can not be paid , the debt must be made to disappear .
The world - or at least most of the Anglo - Saxon part of it , must be de-leveraged .
So , people must believe in a fantasy about how the government will " bail out " the homeowners �and how the Fed will " rescue " Wall Street .
How could they perform such miracles ?
When a man cannot pay for his house , can the feds make the mortgage disappear ?
When Wall Street has blundered - forgetting to sell its cheesy debt before it started to stink - what can the feds do about it ?
All they can do is to spray some deodorizer around the room Still , the voters have been conditioned by television , public education , and maybe something in the water ; people will believe anything .
And what they need to believe now is that the feds can somehow ease their hurt .
This will make it possible to shift the debts that cannot be paid onto the government , where they will not be paid .
Among all the great debtors in the U.S.A. , circa 2008 , only one has the power to pay its debts - no matter how large they are .
Only one has printing presses that turn out pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on them .
And only one can trade bad debt for political favor .
That one is , of course , the U.S. federal government �lender of first , last , and holiday resort .
Already , the Fed has taken onto its balance sheet some $ 30 billion in smelly collateral from Bear Stearns �and billions more from other financial institutions .
That is just the beginning .
Somehow , the whole shebang of mistakes , misjudgments , greed - stoked miscalculations will end on the shoulders of the U.S. Treasury �on the backs of U.S. citizens �and dollar holders all over the world .

Uh oh , what 's this ?
" Argentina may face worst unrest since the ' 70s , " says a headline in the TIMES of London .
Hmmm�we 're on a way to Argentina on Friday �to see our new grandson .
The last thing we want is trouble .
But apparently , " a farmers strike has emptied the shelves of meat , cereals and milk . "
More than 400 roads are blocked .
Much of the discontent followed a disastrous speech by the president of the country , Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner , which is said to have alienated the farmers even further .
At the heart of the matter is a new tax - up to 49 % - on soy exports .
Argentina is a farming nation .
And soy prices are so high , the farmers planted every available acre , hoping to score big on international grain markets .
And now the government has stepped in to take half their money ; no wonder they have their bombachos in a twist .
This just goes to illustrate our point : no situation is ever so beneficent that politicians wo n't find a way to make a hash of it .
The oil exporters are getting a once - in - a - lifetime windfall from high energy prices .
What are they doing ?
Building empty skyscrapers and adding social welfare promises faster than the pumps can put out oil .
They 've managed to squander most of their profit margins and then some .
Just look at Hugo Chavez .
He had so much oil he was able to throw his weight around all over Latin America .
But the dumbell has so mismanaged his own economy that the place is said to be falling apart .
And look to at the US of A .
What a bonanza it was to have the world 's biggest military�its richest economy �and its only reserve currency .
The rest of the world seemed to want to give Americans valuable goods and services , expecting nothing in return but pieces of green paper .
It was like manna falling from heaven .
How did Americans manage to turn that into the biggest financial trap in history - actually growing poorer during the greatest boom the world had ever seen ?
And now Argentina �with the world 's richest farmland �the world 's flattest , best watered fields , and some of its best weather �has found a way to turn the highest grain prices in history into a financial crisis .
Bravo !
Bravo to us all !

One of the world 's most fascinating people is surely the first lady of France , Carla Bruni .
She dined with Queen Elizabeth II last week .
Amid all the glamorous guests , glitzy table setting and diamonds , it was she who sparkled most .
What follows has no apparent connection to our beat - money .
Nor does it have any particular connection with anything .
Still , women represent half the human population .
As poets , we are fascinated by them .
As philosophers we are intrigued .
And as economists , we can not ignore them .
Mr. Sarkozy 's wife is a woman , but not just any woman ; she seems to us to be a kind of �berfemale .
Almost unnaturally gifted , talented , beautiful and corrupt .
The trouble with economics - one of them - is that economists are almost all male .
And thus they are completely incapable of understanding the motives or methods of half the population they are meant to be studying .
That is why we turn our attention to Carla .
She is such an extreme example of womanhood , perhaps we can learn something .
For readers who have not followed the French press , Ms. Bruni is an extraordinary subject .
The French say she is a " croqueuse d'hommes " - which is to say , a man-eater .
It was she , according to the press , who had such an affair with Mick Jagger that it destroyed his long marriage to that tough , smart and talented Texan , Jerry Hall .
And it was she , too , who is said to have had affairs with Eric Clapton and Donald Trump .
Then , she lived with a French philosopher , Jean - Paul Enthoven , until she took a fancy to his son , Raphael , with whom she had a son , Aurelien .
Nor was she particularly demeure about the whole thing ; she wrote a song called " Raphael " describing how she had fallen madly in love and had great sex with him .
She is so " properly , old - fashionedly beautiful , " writes India Knight in the TIMES of London , " with non-inbred aristocratic features and good bones ; so beautiful that she makes everyone else look like pudding . "
Not only that , she speaks three or four languages �comes from a fabulously rich family �and can sing .
At the Queen 's state dinner , practically every one of the hundreds of guests had seen her naked photo in the tabloids the day before .
Yet , she was reportedly the most composed , most confident person there .
According to reports , she is irresistible at every level - intellectually , emotionally , sexually and artistically .
What 's more she lives around the corner from your editor 's Paris apartment .
" I saw her go by last night , " said a neighbor on Saturday .
" She had a whole squad of police with her . "
" Why does n't she move into the Elysee Palace with her husband ? " we wanted to know .
" Apparently , she likes to keep her independence . "
Madame Sarkozy is like no first lady France has ever seen .
Nor is she like any first lady any country has ever seen .
She says she finds monogamy " boring . "
She further observed that " love lasts a long time , but burning desire - two to three weeks . "
Here is the world 's most desirable woman - married to a cad .
But she is the perfect political prop�a woman who plays her role superbly - according to the local gossip , both in public and in private - and who otherwise goes on her way and amuses herself .
What do other women think of her ?
Around the corner , from what we hear , they barely let their husbands out of sight .
Your editor is an old - fashioned fuddy duddy ; he admits it .
He turns his tired eyes to politics , economics and finance - and sees only frauds and mountebanks .
But when he comes home at night , he is charmed .
In the newspapers , he regards the chatter on the editorial pages as all lies and claptrap ; but at home he believes every fairy tale .
When his broker proposes a hedge fund with a leveraged portfolio of private equity deals , he practically laughs in his face .
But when his priest promises him everlasting life , what reason has he to doubt ?
And when his daughter says , " Oh Daddy � I just dropped by the office to say hello , " he 's delighted , scarcely noticing that she leaves with $ 50 to buy a new pair of blue jeans .
There is a place for cynicism , he says to himself , and a place to believe .
Poor Carla does n't seem to know the difference .
Still , she lives so close by .
Better to keep an open mind .
Besides , says your editor remembers that he has a couple weeks of vacation coming up �
Until tomorrow , Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning ---------------------
The Daily Reckoning PRESENTS : Working to better the U.S. 's energy policy is obviously one of the biggest challenges facing our nation .
And one of the biggest hurdles to the U.S. getting energy right is that the mainstream media infotainment circus has not prepared people to connect the dots of what they already know .
Byron King explains � ENERGY POLICY : GET IT RIGHT�OR ELSE !
by Byron King Energy policy - and getting it right - is a long - running theme for both Kevin Kerr and me in Outstanding Investments .
And if the U.S. does not get energy right , nothing else really matters all that much .
Bad U.S. energy policy will take down everything .
You name it .
Pick your favorite issue : the economy , health care , Social Security , education , immigration , the environment �
Without assured supplies of good - quality energy - which will not come cheap or fast - all of these problems will just get much worse .
If the U.S. could get energy right , the impact would improve a lot of those other problems .
So we as a nation had better get it right .
And while I am talking about Kevin behind his back , I want to say that I truly enjoy working with him .
I tend to take a long view of the investment world , and Kevin offers the shorter - term vision .
We think that this helps you , the subscriber , obtain a larger perspective .
And it 's kind of amusing , because in real life , my eyes are nearsighted and Kevin 's are farsighted .
Go figure .
Still - and with our eyeglasses firmly planted on our respective noses - every day , Kevin and I hawk the screens to keep up with critical prices and other indicators .
We watch prices for gold , silver , oil and natural gas .
We also watch prices for many other commodities , from copper to platinum , and lumber to cotton .
And we look at many different stocks , way more than are in the OI portfolio .
We are always trying to make sense of it all .
For Kevin and me , it is not just , " What is the story ? "
It is , " What is driving the story ? "
We want to be a few steps ahead of everyone else so we can offer the best advice to you , the reader .
So what have we been seeing lately ?
Well , the screens have been hopping .
Prices for just about every commodity have been gyrating .
And I do n't need to comment too much on the general stock market .
Days of deep losses are followed by some days of spectacular gains .
Every day , I open the newspapers or fire up the screen and wonder what new monetary disaster is going to surface .
Will the Fed lower rates some more ?
Yes , indeed .
That 's what this world needs - more cheap money ( just kidding ) .
Or perhaps another silly piece of " feel good " legislation is working its way through Congress .
Did you see that the Senate just voted to extend the ban on drilling offshore the U.S. East and West coasts ?
Whew !
We dodged that bullet , huh ?
Thanks , guys .
I guess the politicians are waiting for physical oil shortages in the world .
And do n't think that the rest of the world is not watching us .
People in world capitals are asking , " Is the U.S. serious about its energy issues ?
Or is the U.S. just wasting time ?
Are its people just collectively flattering themselves with their sense of exceptionalism ? "
The U.S. is a world - class laughing stock when it comes to its national energy policy .
Maybe when oil prices get to $ 250 per barrel , Congress will finally allow those evil oil companies to park some rigs offshore and drill that oil .
But do n't hold your breath .
If the U.S. started an offshore leasing and drilling program tomorrow morning , it might take 10 years for the first barrel of oil to make landfall .
That would be� um � Easter 2018 .
I know I can't wait .
When I am not worrying about U.S. energy policy , I look to see which major bank will announce more bad news .
Or what big brokerage house is on the verge of failing .
( Maybe they should n't have paid out all those big bonuses last December . )
Or what part of the world 's energy supply chain got blown up overnight .
You get the picture .
What can you do at a time like this ?
Well , you can always just sell everything .
Liquidate and take the money and stuff it into your mattress .
But even going " long cash and mattress " is an investment decision .
And eventually , you will probably regret the decision .
You will wake up one day and find out that your mattress stash has lost a lot of its purchasing power to inflation .
( Thanks , Fed . )
Should you sell just some of your stocks ?
Or should you buy some shares , even now ?
And if so , which ones should you sell or buy ?
Well , no one can predict the future with absolute certainty .
But we might be in for a modest correction in some of the run-up we have seen in the prices for gold , silver and oil .
So let me offer some last words of advice .
Kevin and I work hard to give you the best ideas we can find .
But we cannot control the larger investment climate or the bad energy policy of the U.S.
We can just try to make good investments " around " that difficult climate and bad policy .
One of the biggest hurdles to the U.S. getting energy right is that the mainstream media infotainment circus has not prepared people to connect the dots of what they already know .
Think about your own daily observations .
People " see " information that tells them how much oil , for example , is in the hands of the national oil companies of many foreign nations .
But the mainstream media ( MSM ) - and a lot of U.S. politicians - corporately hate Big Oil so much that they wo n't inform viewers and readers how little control the name - brand players have anymore .
Really , in a lot of respects , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Chevron are now bit players in oil .
The MSM are stuck in the 1970s , in the thought processes of the disco era .
Really , the MSM need to lose the polyester leisure suits .
The MSM could help the situation if they emphasized that we live in an era of less oil , higher prices and a lot more competition for the same old stuff .
They could point out to viewers and readers that the developing world is � um�. developing .
And we in the U.S. are not .
We are just living off the past , drinking from wells we did not dig and running down the energy inheritance .
The world is changing so quickly that a lot of what the media know is quickly becoming obsolescent - if not already obsolete .
The MSM have just plain missed the energy and resource story .
I guess it is over their heads .
Zoom .
Until next we meet , Byron King
for The Daily Reckoning P.S. I have a great new investment recommendation for you in this next issue .
It is a great , old American company that is transforming itself into a world - class player in its niche .
And Kevin has some comments on alternative fuels that will surely make you think .
In a nutshell , Kevin is discussing the need for the U.S. to " get energy right " - which is not happening just now .
The U.S. is getting energy " wrong , " for a variety of reasons .
Kevin will dissect one of those reasons down to the gristly bone .
Kevin Kerr and I spent much of the past week putting together the next monthly issue of Outstanding Investments .

A new combination of nano and solar technology has made it possible for solar electric generation to be cheaper than burning coal .
Nanosolar , Inc. has developed a way to produce a type of ink that absorbs solar radiation and converts into electric current .
Photovoltaic ( PV ) sheets are produced by a machine similar to a printing press , which rolls out the PV ink onto sheets approximately the width of aluminum foil .
These PV sheets can be produced at a rate of hundreds of feet per minute .
"
It 's 100 times thinner than existing solar panels , and we can deposit the semiconductors 100 times faster , " said Nanosolar 's cofounder and chief executive officer , R. Martin Roscheisen .
" It 's a combination that drives down costs dramatically .
" Because of their light weight and flexibility , the PV sheets ( dubbed PowerSheets ) are much more versatile than current PV panels , which must be mounted on sturdy surfaces like roofs or the ground .
In addition , because there is no silicon used in the production of the sheets , they cost only 30 cents per watt of power produced .
Traditional PV cells cost approximately $ 3 per watt , while burning coal costs about $ 1 per watt .
" This is the first time that we can actually drop the cost of solar electricity down to a level that would be competitive with grid electricity in most industrialized nations , " said Nanosolar co-founder Brian Sager .
Nanosolar is ramping up production of its PowerSheets at factories in San Jose , California , and Berlin , and expects to have them commercially available before the end of the year .
The buzz around the PowerSheets is so strong that the company already has a three to five year backorder , and the company has raised more than $ 150 million from venture capitalists , including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin .
" Solar panels have not been very popular to the American people because they 've been too expensive .
That 's what we 're changing now , " Roscheisen said .

They beamed , hugged and praised one another .
Their outfits even matched .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton introduces her former Democratic rival at a rally in Unity , New Hampshire , Friday .
The long - awaited Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton unity event in Unity , New Hampshire , on Friday was carefully choreographed , with the images and speeches all designed to achieve one goal : returning Democrats to the White House .
Obama and Clinton appeared together in a town where they tied in the January primary .
" We may have started on separate paths ... today our hearts are set on the same destination for America ... to elect Barack Obama as the next president of the United States , " Clinton said .
" We are one party ; we are one America , " she added .
The two Democrats walked onstage together to U2's song " Beautiful Day " as an enthusiastic crowd chanted : " Yes , we can ! "
Large signs reading " Unite For Change " and " UNITY " were held aloft throughout the outdoor rally as an enthusiastic crowd cheered Clinton and Obama .
Watch Clinton praise Obama at the rally »
Obama praised the New York senator for helping " bring this country a new and better day . "
" For 16 months , Sen. Clinton and I have shared the stage as rivals .
...
But today , I could not be happier and more honored and more moved that we 're sharing the stage , " Obama said .
" I 've learned from her as a candidate .
...
She rocks !
She rocks !
That 's the point I 'm trying to make , " he joked .
Watch more of Obama 's speech »
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also talked about the tension the two faced during the primary season .
" Now , I do n't pretend that one election can erase all the past biases and outdated attitudes that we 're still wrestling to overcome .
And I know that there have been times over the last 16 months where those biases have emerged , " he said .
" But I also know that while this campaign has shown us how far we have to go , it has also proven the progress we have made . "
Obama referred to the significance of the town 's name and its primary , in which he and Clinton each received the same number of votes .
" It is fitting that we meet in a place called Unity , because the truth is , that 's the only way we can solve the challenges facing this country .
Today , we look back at the votes cast here in the snows of January not as 107 votes for Hillary Clinton and 107 votes for me but as 214 votes for change in America , " he said .
Earlier , Clinton took aim at Sen. John McCain 's candidacy .
" McCain is simply offering fours years more [ of the Bush administration ] .
... John McCain and President Bush are like two sides of the same coin , and it does n't amount to a whole lot of change , " she said .
" If you think we need a new course ... vote for Barack Obama and get the change we need and deserve . "
Watch Clinton bash McCain »
Obama also criticized McCain 's stand on health care .
" You can go with John McCain 's plans to do nothing , or you can stand side - by - side with me and Hillary Clinton and finally , once and for all , provide the health care that every American needs , " he said .
The former rivals flew together from Washington .
They shared a polite kiss on arrival at Reagan National Airport and sat side - by - side on the flight to New Hampshire .
Clinton campaign manager Terry McAuliffe said Friday that her team had been working to drum up support for Obama since Clinton suspended her campaign this month and endorsed Obama .
" We have done this now for three weeks , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
" We 've done conference calls all over the country to all of our people .
' OK , we tried .
We gave it everything we had .
Now we need to move forward and support Sen. Obama . ' "
Asked about the possibility of an Obama - Clinton ticket , McAuliffe said , " I think if she were on the ticket , I think we honestly ... would control the White House for 16 years .
... But Sen. Obama 's got to make that decision himself . "
Obama has shied away from any talk of a possible joint ticket , although he 's said Clinton " would be on anyone 's short list . "
" I think we will have a terrific time together in New Hampshire .
And I think that she will be very effective all the way through the election , " he said Thursday night .
This week , Obama asked top contributors to help Clinton retire her campaign debt of $ 22 million , about $ 12 million of which she loaned to her own campaign .
Obama and his wife , Michelle , each donated $ 2,300 Thursday to Clinton 's campaign , which is millions of dollars in debt
That 's the maximum an individual can legally donate .
On Friday , Clinton and her husband , former President Clinton , each donated the maximum to Obama 's campaign .
CNN 's Ed Hornick and Sasha Johnson contributed to this report .
All About Hillary Clinton • Democratic Party
When I first heard about the MV Agusta F4CC , I thought : Yeah , right .
What thrill could I get for $ 120,000 that I could n’t for one - tenth the price ?
Then MV gave me the bike .
Even better , they provided the key .
In my job , it ’s easy to be a power junkie .
I get to sample all kinds of yummy fun sport bikes that tempt me to get into all kinds of trouble with a simple flick of the wrist .
Usually , I ’m able to get my ya - yas out without going completely overboard , which explains why I ’m still standing after two years of riding more than 100 different bikes .
But the F4CC broke my will .
Riding the world ’s most expensive ( limited ) production sport bike , I felt like Zeus .
I was fast .
I felt rich .
I felt sexy .
Though , riding a bike that costs more than my annual salary , I did n’t exactly feel carefree .
Advertisement
It ’s difficult to ride a 200 - horsepower , $ 120,000 sport bike to its full potential .
First , my name ’s not Valentino or Dani or that of any other top racer .
Second , it ’s easy to be psyched out by the price .
Confident as I am in my riding ability , I was plagued by the fear that I ’d drop it , cause thousands of dollars of damage , draw all kinds of attention to my newspaper for the wrong reasons , lose my job , lose my house , lose my kid and end up on the street eating Snausages .
It ’s enough pressure as it is to be a female motorcycle critic for the mainstream press in a male - dominant enthusiast - driven sport , and the F4CC did n’t help .
I ’m the sort of person who flubs when I ’m trying to show off anyway .
Dress me up in heels and they ’ll walk their way onto the nearest banana peel , which was pretty much what happened in my first day with MV ’s most exclusive bike , though it started well enough .
The first stares I got atop the F4CC happened before I ’d even left the L.A.
Times parking garage .
The first roll - down - the - window compliment : within two blocks .
When you pay so much money for such a high - class bike , that ’s exactly what should be happening .
But riding a bike that draws so much attention made it all the more mortifying when I was stuck at the front of a line for a left - turn arrow at an exceedingly long red light because of a train .
I glanced down at the dash and saw the engine temperature clicking up a couple degrees every few seconds .
That is n’t unusual for a high - performance machine , but it kept going up .
Advertisement
When it got to 234 degrees , the number started blinking .
I started panicking .
And in an effort to avoid an impending meltdown , I turned off the ignition .
Then the arrow went green , the engine had n’t cooled enough to want to turn back on , and I was stuck .
By the time I got the bike to go , I was over - revving , running a red light and looking like I ’d learned to ride yesterday .
I ’ve never been so relieved to get on the freeway , which thankfully was just around the corner .
But just as I entered the 210 and was about to crack the throttle to leave that memory in the dust , I saw a black - and - white .
So I stayed in first gear , which on the F4CC meant I was n’t even straining at 75 mph .
The F4CC uses a modified version of the 190 - horsepower , 1,078 cc , inline - four motor used on MV ’s new F4 RR 312 1078 -- a $ 30,000 - ish bike that looks like a spittoon next to the F4CC .
The CC ’s additional 10 horses are derived , in part , from the lighter - weight titanium intake valves and oversize throttle bodies -- improvements that will trickle down to the production F4 in a year or so .
It also features the F1 - derived Torque Shift System that MV introduced on an earlier limited - production F4-1000 , the Tamburini .
But that is n’t the reason the F4CC costs twice as much per pound as a Ferrari .
Only 100 F4CCs have been built , and 90 % of each one of them was made made by hand .
The steering damper , hand levers , foot pegs and fork feet were all machined and hand - assembled by MV ’s top artisans rather than the Regular Joes on the assembly line .

The F4CC is the bike that MV Agusta President Claudio Castiglioni wanted for himself , which is why it was built and where it gets its name .
The bike I was riding was No. 001 -- the first one built .
Not only did it belong to Castiglioni personally , his signature was on the carbon - fiber body .
The F4CC is the sort of bike that needs its own bodyguard .
It ’s the kind of bike that wants to be fed high - octane gas and bathed with Evian and buffed with a silk rag dipped in rare Camellia seed oil .
But it also wants to be ridden hard and fast .
Despite my fears of dumping it , I was happy to oblige because the F4CC is about excess .
“ When in Rome ” was pretty much my justification for riding faster than I ever had previously .
I ’m sure some will say I was reckless , and maybe I was .
While I never used more than four of the bike ’s six gears or came anywhere near its 17,000 rpm max , I wanted to feel the power and savor the grumble and growl of its pipe - organ titanium racing exhaust , which to me was catnip .
Advertisement
Riding the F4CC , I felt as if I ’d been touched by the hand of God , and , in a way , I probably had been .
I was pulled over on this bike , and I did n’t get a ticket .
I like to think it ’s because the authorities were as blown away by MV Agusta ’s premium product as I was .
Sadly , the legendary MV Agusta is in financial trouble right now , due to problems with the Italian banking system and a weak dollar that ’s eroding the company ’s profitability in its second most lucrative market -- the U.S.
The problems are so dire that Castiglioni is looking for a business partner , even one that would hold a majority stake .
According to Larry Ferracci , chief executive of the firm ’s U.S. importer , Cagiva USA , companies from India , Italy and the U.S. are in talks with MV , which is likely to finalize a business partnership with one of them this summer .
Personally , I think MV could solve its financial problems by renting saddle time on the F4CC .

More than 20 dolphins have died and several others remain stranded after swimming up a river in Cornwall , in what rescuers have described as the biggest mass stranding of marine life for 27 years .
Coastguards were alerted at 8.30 am today after a visitor at a nearby guesthouse noticed a dolphin that appeared to have beached itself in Porth Creek , near Falmouth .
When they arrived to launch a rescue operation , many more dolphins had become stranded .
It is thought the first dolphin may have sent out a distress signal that lured the others up the river Percuil .
" Initially , one swam up and got disoriented in shallow water , " said Neil Oliver , from the Falmouth coastguard .
" It put out a distress call and it looks as though the others have followed and thought ' We 'll find out what 's going on ' . ''
Divers , the fire brigade , conservationists and lifeboats were taking part in the rescue mission .
Dave Nicoll , a lifeboat helmsman , said : " It 's a horrible scene of carnage with bodies everywhere , but we are doing our best to help and will continue to support the expert groups .
" We have been trying to help those who are alive and have already succeeded in getting five back into the water .
We think the pod have been attracted by the cries for help from those that are stuck in the creek . "
A spokeswoman for the RNLI said three volunteer lifeboat crew members had managed to help five dolphins back out to deeper water .
Many dolphins were already dead when they arrived and others were struggling in the shallow waters .
Tony Woodley , the national spokesman for British Divers Marine Life Rescue , said the charity would put all of its resources into the rescue operation .
" We have n't seen a stranding anywhere near this scale since 1981 when pilot whales were beached on the east coast .
This is extremely rare .
We are warning people that many will die but we may be able to save some . "
It is understood the creatures are striped dolphins , which are not naturally a coastal breed .
Woodley said they were ocean - going and had probably followed fish that were feeding on a large algal bloom in the area .
" Logistically , a rescue like this is a minefield .
It is very difficult to manage .
You have to get all the dolphins together ; if one or two leave the river system they will just come back to rejoin the main social group . "
As we throw a few fireworks in the air and whoop it up for our own independence this weekend , take a quick peek at some other awesome celebrations of freedom across the globe .

A couple of years ago , I parked a Hummer H2 , in all its blunt - trauma enormity , in front of a coffee shop in Santa Monica .
When I returned I discovered a note written on a paper napkin under the windshield .
“ This thing is so stupid !
Why do n’t you grow up ? ”
America just got the memo .
General Motors Corp. said this week that it was considering ways to downsize the brand -- last month , sales plummeted 60 % compared with May 2007 -- sell it off or kill it outright .
Chairman Rick Wagoner ’s “ all options ” remark did n’t leave a lot of hope for fans of the quasi-military sport utility vehicle .
Obituaries will be many and eulogies will be few .
“ GM killed the electric car and now skyrocketing gas prices have crushed the Hummer , ” said Arianna Huffington , who founded the Detroit Project , an effort to pressure automakers to make more fuel - efficient cars .
FOR THE RECORD :
GM Hummer :
In this article , the last name of Keith Bradsher , the author of the 2002 book “ High and Mighty , ” was spelled Brasher .
FOR THE RECORD :
Hummer sales :
A chart that appeared with an article in Business on Saturday about declining sales of Hummers compared sales and mileage of 14 top - selling motor vehicles in May but erred in the way it referred to four of the vehicles .
The chart showed sales of the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Honda Accord Hybrid at more than 40,000 each , Nissan Altima Hybrid sales at 30,000 to 40,000 and Ford Escape Hybrid sales at less than 20,000 .
Those figures were for all versions of those vehicles , not just the hybrids .
Figures for the Honda Accord included sales of its hybrid version , discontinued in 2007 , that were still on dealers ’ lots .
Also , the fuel efficiency and price data for the four vehicles were based on the non -hybrid versions . —
“ The Hummer embodied the worst impulses of the American auto industry , ” said Josh Donner , spokesman for the Sierra Club , which also created a shame - based campaign against the Hummer , including the satiric website Hummerdinger.com .
“ GM ’s move this week shows the absolute bankruptcy of GM ’s business model . ”
And yet , Hummer lovers are a resilient bunch , and , while the skirmish line has moved , it ’s clear many are not prepared to disarm in the automotive culture wars .
“ Whatever the price of gas , ” said Glen Peck , director of the Hummer Club , a national organization of enthusiasts , “ we ’ll drive them to hell and back . ”
The fate of the Hummer brand is up in the air .
GM , which bought the brand from military contractor AM General in 1998 , has plowed a load of capital into Hummer , including $ 250 million for a plant expansion in Shreveport , La .
It has a pickup truck version of the mid-size H3 , the H3T , in the pipeline for a summer release .
Meanwhile , product development is well along on a Jeep Wrangler - size 4x4 called the H4 .
Hummer is a charismatic brand with its own merchandising , including fleece jackets and flashlights .
Even if the division operated at a fraction of its historical volume , Hummer could be an attractive proposition to a potential buyer .
India ’s Economic Times reported Thursday that India ’s Tata Motors and Mahindra have each made overtures to GM about Hummer .
If this is the end of Hummer , it would close the books on what will probably go down as the most controversial vehicle since the Chevrolet Corvair .
Hummer was always unavoidably political .
The name began as a soldier ’s nickname for the “ HMMWV ” ( High - Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle , or Humvee ) , the mega - Jeep that drove into America ’s living rooms during news coverage of the Persian Gulf War .
In the early 1990s , AM General , allegedly at the suggestion of Arnold Schwarzenegger , produced a civilian version of the enormous tractor - like truck .
It was here that the brand ’s cultural DNA was fixed as a twin helix of oil and militarism .
The H1 did n’t arouse much ire , however , because it was a relatively low - volume vehicle ; at worst , an appalling curiosity .
It was the H2 , introduced in 2002 , that became the lightning rod for criticism .
A 6,614 - pound , 6 - foot - 8 goliath , all armor and bolts and bumpers , with fenestration like gun slits and a grille like the bared teeth of a charging infantryman , the H2 set off a fury .
“ It was just so over the top , ” said Michael Marsden , an auto culture historian at St. Norbert College .
“ It had excess written all over it , the SUV times 10 .
Everything about it suggested not practical , not reasonable .
It was consumerism at its peak . ”
And fuel economy at its nadir .
The H2 returned single - digit fuel economy at a time when the American body politic had largely squared off on matters of energy and the environment .
“ The eco movement needs a villain , and , unfortunately , the Hummer has been drafted to play the role , ” said Bryan Pullen , a Hummer owner from Davis , Okla .
The H2 was also featured in a minor drama involving the U.S. tax code , which provided massive tax breaks for vehicles over 6,000 pounds that were used for business .
Clearly , for many H2 buyers , who never thought of taking the rugged trucks off - road , the H2 ’s excessiveness was part of its charm .
Hummer prospered in part because it came along just as automotive culture was exploring the limits of wild , chrome - rimmed excess : bling .
The Hummer was embraced by hip - hop stars , professional athletes and , of course , “ CSI : Miami ” detectives .
“ I will have to admit that when I see some little blondie , obviously some older man ’s princess , pile out of an H2 at the mall it makes me cringe , ” said Otto Frederick , a Hummer advocate from Lakeland , Fla .
“ The H2 was not built to be a princess car , but that ’s what it became . ”
As the biggest , baddest SUV on the planet , it was natural that the H2 become the target of cultural blowback against the category , which came in many forms .
Keith Brasher ’s 2002 book “ High and Mighty ” psychologized big-SUV owners as vain , self - centered and insecure .
The Hummer became shorthand for cynicism and excess , an indictment of the American psyche on wheels .
Whatever profit - and - loss realities are at work in GM ’s announcement this week , one thing is certain :
The company , now desperately tacking to get on a greener course , no longer wants to deal with the contradictions and image liabilities that Hummer represents .
“ Cutting jobs is never good press , but for a company to go green is , ” said Hummer owner Steve Scott of Plano , Texas .
“ This is GM ’s attempt to do both at the same time . ”
Hummer owners are feeling misunderstood .
In spirited e-mail exchanges this week , many point out that although the H2 was a gas guzzler , the smaller , similarly styled H3 , based on GM ’s mid-size truck platform , gets better fuel economy than many competitive vehicles .
“ When the H3 came along , it was branded .
Hummer was synonymous with bad gas mileage , ” Hummer owner Scott said .
Advocate Frederick noted : “ H3 owners resent the fact that many people ca n’t tell the difference between an H2 and H3 . ”
With all the controversy , it ’s perhaps surprising to find that people are still buying the iconic H2 .
Tarek Abdellatif is now the lone salesman in the Hummer showroom at Clippinger Chevrolet in West Covina , where an arsonist firebombed Hummers on the lot in 2003 .
“ My sales manager quit two weeks ago , ” he said .
“ People are jumping like rats from a ship , but I stay because I love Hummer so much . ”
And for him , business is good .
Abdellatif said he had sold “ seven or eight ” in the last month .

American farmers are planting 324 million acres this year , up 4 million acres from 2007 .
Too much of the best land is waterlogged , however .
Indiana and Illinois have been the worst hit , although Iowa , Wisconsin and Minnesota were inundated last weekend .
Bob Biehl , whose farm is near St. Louis , has managed to plant only 140 of the 650 acres he wanted to devote to corn .
Some farmers in his area “ have n’t even been able to take the tractor out of the shed , ” he said .
United States soybean plantings are running 16 percent behind last year .
Rice is tardy in Arkansas , which produces nearly half the country ’s crop .
“ We ’re certainly not going to have as good a crop as we had hoped , ” said Harvey Howington of the Arkansas Rice Growers Association .
“ I do n’t think this is good news for anybody . ”
Harvests ebb and flow , of course .
But with supplies of most of the key commodities at their lowest levels in decades , there is little room for error this year .
American farmers are among the world ’s top producers , supplying 60 percent of the corn that moves across international borders in a typical year , as well as a third of the soybeans , a quarter of the wheat and a tenth of the rice .
“ If we have bad crops , it ’s going to be a wild ride , ” said the Agriculture Department ’s chief economist , Joseph Glauber .
“ There ’s just no cushion . ”
As every farmer knows , trouble can come at any point before the harvest is complete .
Danny and Karen Smith get up in the middle of the night at their wheat farm in Milton , Kan. , whenever they hear thunder .
In a few weeks , the wheat they planted last fall will be ripe .
A bad storm or , worse , a tornado could destroy it .
Last year , the Smiths lost nearly all their wheat to a late freeze compounded by too much rain .
While NTS included a series of server applications not bundled with NTW , Microsoft maintained that the NTW and NTS operating systems themselves were , " two very different products intended for two very different functions . "
NTS , Microsoft claimed , was suited and tailored for use as an Internet server while NTW was grossly inadequate .
Aiming to enforce this difference , both the NTW code and the license agreement restricted users to no more than ten concurrent TCP / IP ( i.e. , Internet ) connections ; NTS remained unlimited .
Many users noticed that NTW and NTS were very similar .
Digging further , an analysis published by O'Reilly revealed the kernel , and in fact every binary file included in NTW , was identical to those shipped in NTS .
The sole difference between the two products ' cores lay in the operating systems ' installation information .
The server version contained several options or flags that marked it as either NTW or NTS .
If the machine was flagged as NT Workstation , it would disable certain functionality and limit the number of network connections .
Billed as a simple web server useful for personal use , Microsoft 's Personal Web Server ( PWS ) included on NTW was , in fact , identical to the company 's enterprise - focused IIS shipped with NTS ; when IIS started on a machine flagged as NTW , it would proceed to eliminate and limit functionality .
On NTS where flags were set differently , new functionality would appear , and limitations -- including the ten- connection ceiling -- disappeared .
The ability to run an unlimited number of connections , as well as many of the other characteristics that differentiated NTW and NTS , are what I call antifeatures .
An antifeature , in the way I use the term , is functionality that a technology developer will charge users to not include .
It is more difficult for Microsoft to limit Internet connections than it is to leave them unconstrained , and the limit is not something that any user would request .
DRM and Treacherous Computing systems are , in many ways , extreme examples of antifeatures .
Users do n't want either and they are hugely expensive and extremely difficult for developers to implement .
Region - coded DVDs , copy - protection measures , and Apple 's optional DRM music store -- where users initially paid more for the DRM - free tracks -- are also excellent examples .
It takes a large amount of work to build these systems and users rarely benefit from or request them .
Like blackmail , users can sometimes pay technology providers to not include an antifeature in their technology .
But sometimes , as in the case with many DRM systems , users cannot pay to turn their antifeatures off at all !
An example of such an antifeature can be seen in the fact that Mozilla and Firefox were blocking pop-ups for years before Microsoft got around to adding the feature to its competing Internet Explorer browser .
Despite the fact that Firefox has become fancy about pop-up blocking recently , simply not showing pop-ups ( i.e. , the way the feature was originally implemented in Mozilla and celebrated by users ) is easier than showing them .
Microsoft held back not because it was difficult , but because others parts of Microsoft , and their partners , used and made money from pop-ups .
Ultimately , Microsoft lost droves of users to the free alternative that was willing to put users first .
Until 2005 , another proprietary web browser , Opera ( which offered pop - up blocking before Firefox did ) displayed an irremovable banner advertisement unless users paid for premium version of the software .
No users liked the banners , and obviously , it 's more difficult to show advertisements than it is to leave them out .
Unfortunately , for the companies and individuals trying to push antifeatures , users increasingly often have alternatives in free software .
Software freedom , it turns out , makes antifeatures impossible in most situations .
Microsoft 's predatory NT pricing is impossible for GNU / Linux , where users can program around it .
A version of Firefox funded by advertisements would be too-- users would simply build and share a version of the software without the antifeatures in question .
Ultimately , the absence of similar antifeatures form some of the easiest victories for free software .
It does not cost free software developers anything to avoid antifeatures .
In many cases , doing nothing is exactly what users want and what proprietary software will not give them .
" They 're putting in time when they could be out partying or whatever because they really believe in Barack Obama , " Stewart said .
" He spends a lot of effort hearing students out , and I think they appreciate that and they know that he 's willing to fight for their concerns . "
The laws have prompted criticism from civil liberties campaigners
Sweden 's parliament has approved controversial new laws allowing authorities to spy on cross - border e-mail and telephone traffic .
The country 's intelligence bureau will be able to scan international calls , faxes and e-mails .
The measure was passed by a narrow majority after a heated debate in the Stockholm parliament .
Critics say it threatens civil liberties and represents Europe 's most far - reaching eavesdropping plan .
" By introducing these new measures , the Swedish government is following the examples set by governments ranging from China and Saudi Arabia to the US government 's highly criticised eavesdropping programme , " said Peter Fleischer of Google .
Checks and balances
But those who support the plans say such measures are needed to protect national security from those increasingly using such technology to plan attacks .
The government insists that it will filter out domestic communication and monitor only international calls , faxes and messages .
Some experts argue that it is impossible to differentiate between domestic and international traffic .
Under the new law , Sweden 's intelligence bureau will no longer need a court order to begin surveillance , unlike the police .
The former head of the country 's intelligence agency , Saepo , said the law failed to safeguard individual rights and should be scrapped .
" I think the law needs to be re-written .
It is not enough to create a few checks and balances ...
It is the law itself , there is something wrong with it , " Anders Eriksson told Swedish radio ahead of the vote .
Seeking to convince voters that she can end the Iraq war , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has touted her role in the congressional effort to force President Bush to bring the troops home .
“ I ’ve been working day in and day out in the Senate to provide leadership to end this war , ” Clinton recently told an audience at George Washington University , contrasting her experience with that of rival Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
Clinton has been a vocal war critic and introduced three bills last year to curtail the U.S. military role in Iraq .
The New York senator has also aggressively questioned administration officials involved in the war .
But since Democrats took control of Congress , Clinton has done relatively little to advance legislation to force the Bush administration to withdraw from Iraq , according to congressional records and lawmakers and staff members who have worked on the issue .

Instead , Clinton largely remained on the sidelines of the congressional debate , her legislation ignored as the Senate focused on measures developed by lawmakers who were more central to the legislative drive to end the war :
* Clinton played a marginal role in Democratic efforts to confront the president ’s troop “ surge ” early last year and later in developing the party ’s legislative strategy of tying money for the war to a timeline for a withdrawal .
* None of her war - related proposals -- which often mirrored measures introduced by other senators -- ever came up for a vote .
* She did not work with moderate Democrats who built GOP support for bipartisan antiwar legislation to overcome Republican - led filibusters .

* And Clinton not only did not develop any measures to mandate a pullout deadline , she actively opposed them until early last year .
“ She lent her voice to the Democratic Party ’s criticism of the administration , which was important , ” said Julian Zelizer , a Princeton University historian who has written extensively about the current Congress .
“ But she certainly was not at the head of the move to legislate the end of the war . ”
Obama was equally peripheral to the Iraq war debate , but he has not claimed a similar leadership role .
He has argued instead that his opposition to the war in 2002 , two years before he was elected to the Senate , makes him the superior candidate .
In contrast to both Democrats , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , was a leading voice in the debate , arguing for more troops in Iraq .

Clinton , who voted to authorize the war , has made her Senate experience -- along with her eight years as first lady -- a cornerstone of her argument that she is best prepared to be commander in chief “ on Day One . ”
In Des Moines last summer , she announced a three - step plan to end the war , discussing her legislation “ to begin bringing our troops home within 90 days ” and to revoke the war authorization Congress gave President Bush .
“ It is long past time that the president ended American combat involvement in Iraq ’s multi-sided , sectarian civil war .
. . . ” she said .
“ That is what I have been trying to do in the Senate . ”
In a March 17 speech in Washington to mark the fifth anniversary of the invasion , she explained that ending the war had been her “ mission in the Senate . ”

And she pointed to another bill she introduced last year .
“ I ’ve started laying the groundwork for a swift and responsible withdrawal beginning in early 2009 by demanding that the Pentagon start planning for it now , ” Clinton said .
Clinton has earned the support of some of the war ’s fiercest critics on Capitol Hill .
Sixteen members of the House Out of Iraq Caucus recently signed an open letter praising Clinton as “ the candidate with the stature , strength and experience needed to end this war as quickly and responsibly as possible . ”
( More than 20 caucus members are backing Obama . )
“ For years , Sen . Clinton has been committed to finding any and all possible ways to get the president to reverse his failed policies in Iraq and end the war , ” said senior Clinton advisor Philippe Reines , noting her three visits to Iraq , her work on the Armed Services Committee , her speeches in favor of a withdrawal and her legislative proposals .
Yet , while Clinton introduced Iraq - related bills -- as have scores of lawmakers -- other senators wrote the war - related legislation that was actually considered , handled delicate negotiations over compromise proposals and worked to round up votes .
Advertisement
These included Delaware ’s Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michigan ’s Carl Levin , the chairmen of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) early last year asked them to draft a resolution with Republicans opposing Bush ’s surge plan to send about 30,000 more troops to Iraq .
Biden and Levin were among a small group of Senate Democrats that Reid regularly convened in his second - floor Capitol office to strategize about Iraq legislation .
The group included not only members of the Democratic leadership but other lawmakers interested in Iraq , such as Rhode Island ’s Jack Reed , an Army veteran , and Wisconsin ’s Russell D. Feingold , a staunch war opponent .
The group did not include Clinton .
Clinton did not work on the anti-surge resolution that Biden and Levin developed , according to Senate aides who asked not to be identified when discussing Senate negotiations .
She did sign onto the legislation after it was introduced , as did 17 other senators .
Advertisement
She also did not collaborate with a second bipartisan group of senators led by Republican John W. Warner of Virginia , who drafted an alternative resolution .
On Feb. 16 , 2007 , as senators were debating the surge , Clinton filed her first Iraq - related bill of the new Congress , a proposal to halt the surge and to link continued authorization for the war to a troop withdrawal .
She rounded up no co-sponsors .
And her bill was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee , becoming one of dozens of pieces of Iraq - related legislation that were never debated .
Obama ’s only legislation to end the war , which would have stopped the surge and mandated a phased withdrawal , was similarly shunted off to the committee after he introduced it on Jan. 30 , 2007 .
Advertisement
Most of the Capitol was at that time focused on the next question in the Iraq debate : Would Democrats try to restrict money for the war ?
Once again , other lawmakers played the leading roles in that intraparty debate .
Feingold pushed for a withdrawal deadline enforced by a funding cutoff .
Levin and Reed drew up an alternative that conditioned additional funding on a withdrawal timeline .
Clinton was simply one of 51 senators who ultimately voted for the Levin - Reed plan .
She did not participate in the Senate debate in the week leading up to the March vote on the measure , according to the Congressional Record .
Advertisement
Two months later , in May , Clinton announced that she and Sen. Robert C. Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) would introduce legislation to end the authority for the war in Iraq , an idea that Biden and Levin had explored earlier in the year but then dropped .
Like her earlier legislation , Clinton ’s proposal never came up for a vote .
In July , Clinton trumpeted a bill she planned to sponsor that would require the Pentagon to give Congress a report on contingency plans for redeploying U.S. forces from Iraq .
But again , other senators had taken the lead in pushing that concept .
Just a week before , Republicans Warner and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana had introduced a measure to do essentially the same thing .
Advertisement
Clinton did not work with the senior GOP lawmakers , however .
Her proposal went nowhere .
Nor did she participate in efforts by centrist Democrats , such as Nebraska ’s Ben Nelson or Indiana ’s Evan Bayh , to write legislation with moderate Republicans .
Aides to Maine ’s Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe , two of the most influential moderate Republicans , said they never heard from Clinton ’s office .
By then , Clinton , who was courting antiwar Democrats still angry about her vote to authorize the war , had embraced the strongest antiwar legislation pushed by Feingold .
That proposal , which Clinton had voted against a year earlier , would have cut off funding for all but a limited number of military missions .
At a September hearing on Capitol Hill , Clinton told Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , and Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the senior U.S. commander in Iraq , that their upbeat reports on the surge required “ the willing suspension of disbelief . ”
Advertisement
And in December , she attracted eight co-sponsors , including Obama , for her bill calling on the president to seek congressional approval for any long - term security agreements with Iraq .
But when Democrats pushed anew for legislation mandating a withdrawal in December and then again in February , Clinton was n’t there .
She missed the votes .

As a research intern here at Last . fm , dealing with huge datasets has become my daily bread .
Having a herd of yellow elephants at my disposal makes this a lot easier , but the conventional way of writing Hadoop programs can be rather cumbersome .
It generally involves lots of typing , compiling , building , and moving files around , which is especially annoying for the “ write once , run never again ” programs that are often required for research purposes .
After fixing one too many stupid bugs caused by this copy / paste - encouraging work flow , I finally decided to look for an alternative .
The sluggishness of the conventional Hadoop work flow is mainly caused by the fact that Java is a very verbose and compiled programming language .
Hence , finding a solution basically boils down to replacing Java .
Since simplicity and programmer productivity were my main goals , it did n’t take me too long to decide that I wanted to use Python instead .
The approach described here is the most convenient way of writing Hadoop programs in Python that I could find on the web , but it still was n’t pythonic enough for my taste .
The mapper and the reducer should n’t have to reside in separate files , and having to write boilerplate code should be avoided as much as possible .
To get rid of these issues , I wrote a simple Python module called Dumbo .
The word count example can be written as follows using this module :
def mapper ( key , value ) : for word in value.split( ) : yield word , 1 def reducer ( key , values ) : yield key , sum ( values ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : import dumbo dumbo.run ( mapper , reducer )
Compare this to the 60 lines of code required to do exactly the same thing in Java !
On a UNIX machine , this program can be run locally by executing the command
python wordcount.py map < wc_input.txt | sort | \ python wordcount .py red > wc_output.txt
and running it on a Hadoop cluster is as simple as typing
python -m dumbo wordcount .py \ - hadoop / path / to/hadoop \ - input wc_input.txt - output wc_output
To put some icing on the cake , Dumbo also offers a few handy extras .
You ’ll have to read the documentation or even the code to discover them all , but one worth mentioning is that you can implement combiner - like functionality by passing a third parameter to “ dumbo.run ” .
For instance , the amount of network traffic can be reduced substantially in the example above by adding “ reducer ” as a third parameter to “ dumbo.run ” .
Obviously , the combination of Hadoop Streaming and Dumbo is not a one - size - fits - all solution .
Java code is still faster and provides the programmer more flexibility and control .
Even with several liters of the finest Belgian beer , there is no way I could convince Johan or Martin to port their heavy regularly - running Hadoop programs to Python .
In many cases , however , it makes perfect sense to trade some speed and flexibility for programmer productivity .
It definitely allows me to get more work done in less time .
Profitability often requires better rules and speed , not more time .

I wrote this “ margin manifesto ” several months ago and somehow neglected to post it .
Your requests for more content on start - up economics and processes reminded me .
These are the principles I review whenever facing operational overwhelm or declining / stagnating profits .
Hope you find them useful .
###
The financial goal of a start - up should be simple : profit in the least time with the least effort .
Not more customers , not more revenue , not more offices or more employees : more profit .
Based on my interviews with high - performing ( using profit - per - employee metrics ) CEOs in more than a dozen countries , here are the 11 basic tenets of the “ Margin Manifesto ” … a return - to - basics call that gives permission to do the uncommon to achieve the uncommon : consistent profitability ( or doubling of it ) in 3 months or less .
1. Niche is the New Big — The Lavish Dwarf Entertainment Rule :
Several years ago , an investment banker was jailed for trade violations .
He was caught partly due to his lavish parties on yachts , often featuring hired dwarves .
The owner of the dwarf rental company , Danny Black , was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying : “ Some people are just into lavish dwarf entertainment . ”
Niche in the new big .
But here ’s the secret : it ’s possible to niche market and mass sell .
iPod commercials do n’t feature dancing 50 - year olds , they feature hip and fit 20 - 30 - somethings , but everyone and his grandmother wants to feel youthful and hip , so they strap on Nanos and call themselves Apple converts .
Who you portray in your marketing is n’t necessarily the only demographic who buys your product — it ’s often the demographic that most people want to identify with or belong to .
The target is n’t the market .
No one aspires to be the bland average , so do n’t water down messaging to appeal to everyone –it will end up appealing to no one .
2. Revisit Drucker — What Gets Measured Gets Managed :
Measure compulsively , for as Peter Drucker stated : what gets measured gets managed .
Useful metrics to track , besides the usual operational stats , include CPO ( “ Cost - Per - Order , ” which includes advertising , fulfillment and expected returns , chargebacks , and bad debt ) , ad allowable ( the maximum you can spend on an advertisement and expect breakeven ) , MER ( media efficiency ratio ) , and projected lifetime value ( LV ) given return rates and reorder %.
Consider applying direct response advertising metrics to your business .
3. Pricing before Product – Plan Distribution First :
Is your pricing scalable ?
Many companies will sell direct - to - consumer by necessity in early stages , only to realize that their margins ca n’t accommodate resellers and distributors when they come knocking .
If you have a 40 % profit margin and a distributor needs a 70 % discount to sell into wholesale accounts , you ’re forever limited to direct - to - consumer … unless you increase your pricing and margins .
It ’s best to do this beforehand if possible – otherwise , you ’ll need to launch new or “ premium ” products — so plan distribution before setting pricing .
Test assumptions and find hidden costs by interviewing those who have done it : will you need to pay for co-op advertising , offer rebates for bulk purchases , or pay for shelfspace or featured placement ?
I know one former CEO of a national brand who had to sell his company to one of the world ’s largest soft drink manufacturers before he could access front - of - store shelving in top retailers .
Test your assumptions and do your homework before setting pricing .
4. Less is More – Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit :
Is more distribution automatically better ?
No .
Uncontrolled distribution leads to all manner of head - ache and profit - bleeding , most often related to rogue discounters .
Reseller A lowers pricing to compete with online discounter B , and the price cutting continues until neither is making sufficient profit on the product and both stop reordering .
This requires you to launch a new product , as price erosion is almost always irreversible .
Avoid this scenario and consider partnering with one or two key distributors instead , using that exclusivity to negotiate better terms : less discounting , prepayment , preferred placement and marketing support , etc. From iPods to Rolex and Estee Lauder , sustainable high - profit brands usually begin with controlled distribution .
Remember , more customers is n’t the goal ; more profit is .
5. Net -0 — Create Demand vs. Offering Terms :
Focus on creating end - user demand so you can dictate terms .
Often one trade publication advertisment , bought at discount remnant rates , will be enough to provide this leverage .
Outside of science and law , most “ rules ” are just common practice .
Just because everyone in your industry offers terms does n’t mean you have to , and offering terms is the most consistent ingredient in start - up failure .
Cite start - up economics and the ever - so - useful “ company policy ” as reasons for prepayment and apologize , but do n’t make exceptions .
Net - 30 becomes net - 60 , which become net -120 .
Time is the most expensive asset a start - up has , and chasing delinquent accounts will prevent you from generating more sales .
If customers are asking for your product , resellers and distributors will need to buy .
It ’s that simple .
Put funds and time into strategic marketing and PR to tip the scales in your favor .
6. Repetition is Usually Redundant — Good Advertising Works the First Time :
Use direct response advertising ( call - to - action to a phone number or website ) that is uniquely trackable – fully accountable advertising — instead of image advertising , unless others are prepurchasing to offset the cost ( e.g .
“ If you prepurchase 288 units , we ’ll feature your store / URL / phone exclusively in a full - page ad in … . ” ) .
Do n’t listen to advertising salespeople who tell you that 3 , 7 , or 27 exposures are needed before someone will act on an advertisement .
Well - designed and well - targeted advertising works the first time .
If something works partially well ( e.g. , high response with low percentage conversion to sales , low response with high conversion , etc. ) , indicating that a strong ROI might be possible with small changes , tweak one controlled variable and micro-test once more .
Cancel anything that cannot be justified with a trackable ROI .
7. Limit Downside to Ensure Upside — Sacrifice Margin for Safety :
Do n’t manufacture product in large quantities to increase margin unless your product and marketing are tested and ready for roll - out without changes .
If a limited number of prototypes cost $ 10 per piece to manufacture and sell for $ 11 each , that ’s fine for the initial testing period , and essential for limiting downside .
Sacrifice margin temporarily for the testing phase , if need be , and avoid potentially fatal upfront overcommitments .
8. Negotiate Late — Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves :
Never make a first offer when purchasing .
Flinch after the first offer ( “ $ 3,000 ! ” followed by pure silence , which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once ) , let people negotiate against themselves ( “ Is that really the best you can offer ? ” elicits at least one additional drop in price ) , then “ bracket ” .
If they end up at $ 2,000 and you want to pay $ 1,500 , offer $ 1,250 .
They ’ll counter with approximately $ 1,750 , to which you respond : “ I ’ll tell you what — let ’s just split the difference .
I ’ll overnight FedEx you a check , and we can call it a day . ”
The end result ?
Exactly what you wanted : $ 1,500 .
9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity — 80/20 and Pareto ’s Law :
Being busy is not the same as being productive .
Forget about the start - up overwork ethic that people wear as a badge of honor–get analytical .
The 80/20 principle , also known as Pareto ’s Law , dictates that 80 % of your desired outcomes are the result of 20 % of your activities or inputs .
Once per week , stop putting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you ’re placing effort in high - yield areas :
What 20 % of customers / products / regions are producing 80 % of the profit ?
What are the factors that could account for this ?
Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your weaknesses .
10 . The Customer is Not Always Right — “ Fire ” High - Maintenance Customers :
Not all customers are created equal .
Apply the 80/20 principle to time consumption :
What 20 % of people are consuming 80 % of your time ?
Put high - maintenance , low - profit customers on auto - pilot–process orders but do n’t pursue them or check up on them–and “ fire ” high - maintenance , high - profit customers by sending a memo detailing how a change in business model requires a few new policies : how often and how to communicate , standardized pricing and order process , etc .
Indicate that , for those clients whose needs are incompatible with these new policies , you are happy to introduce other providers .
“ But what if my largest customer consumes all of my time ? ” Recognize that 1 ) without time , you cannot scale your company ( and , oftentimes , life ) beyond that customer , and 2 ) people , even good people , will unknowingly abuse your time to the extent that you let them .
Set good rules for all involved to minimize back - and - forth and meaningless communication .
11 . Deadlines over Details – Test Reliability Before Capability :
Skills are overrated .
Perfect products delivered past deadline kill companies faster than decent products delivered on - time .
Test someone ’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them based on a dazzling portfolio .
Products can be fixed as long as you have cash - flow , and bugs are forgiven , but missing deadlines is often fatal .
Calvin Coolidge once said that nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent ; I would add that the second most common is smart people who think their IQ or resume justifies delivering late .

One of my best friends passed along a story that is a great reminder of the power of creativity and innovation .
The story revolves around the growing of square watermelons in Japan ( a confirmed true story from Snopes ) .
Below is the email he passed along :
Japanese grocery stores had a problem .
They are much smaller than their US counterparts and therefore do n’t have room to waste .
Watermelons , big and round , wasted a lot of space .
Most people would simply tell the grocery stores that watermelons grow round and there is nothing that can be done about it .
But some Japanese farmers took a different approach .
“ If the supermarkets want a space efficient watermelon , ” they asked themselves , “ How can we provide one ? ”
It was n’t long before they invented the square watermelon .
The solution to the problem of round watermelons was n’t nearly as difficult to solve for those who did n’t assume the problem was impossible to begin with and simply asked how it could be done .
It turns out that all you need to do is place them into a square box when they are growing and the watermelon will take on the shape of the box .
This made the grocery stores happy and had the added benefit that it was much easier and cost effective to ship the watermelons .
Consumers also loved them because they took less space in their refrigerators which are much smaller than those in the US – which resulted in the growers being able to charge a premium price for them .
What does this have do with anything besides square watermelons ?
There are a five lessons that you can take away from this story which will help you in all parts of your life .
Here are a few of them :
1. ) Do n’t Assume :
The major problem was that most people had always seen round watermelons so they automatically assumed that square watermelons were impossible before even thinking about the question .
Things that you have been doing a certain way your entire life have taken on the aura of the round watermelon and you likely do n’t even take the time to consider if there is another way to do it .
Breaking yourself from assuming this way can greatly improve your overall life as you are constantly looking for new and better ways to do things .
2. ) Question Habits :
The best way to tackle these assumptions is to question your habits .
If you can make an effort to question the way you do things on a consistent basis , you will find that you can continually improve the way that you live your life .
Forming habits when they have been well thought out is usually a positive thing , but most of us have adopted our habits from various people and places without even thinking about them .
3. ) Be Creative :
When faced with a problem , be creative in looking for a solution .
This often requires thinking outside the box .
Most people who viewed this question likely thought they were being asked how they could genetically alter water melons to grow square which would be a much more difficult process to accomplish .
By looking at the question from an alternative perspective , however , the solution was quite simple .
Being creative and looking at things in different ways in all portions of your live will help you find solutions to many problems where others can’t see them .
4. ) Look for a Better Way :
The square watermelon question was simply seeking a better and more convenient way to do something .
The stores had flagged a problem they were having and asked if a solution was possible .
It ’s impossible to find a better way if you are never asking the question in the first place .
Always ask if there is a better way of doing the things that you do and constantly write down the things you wish you could do ( but currently can ’t ) since these are usually hints about steps you need to change .
Get into the habit of asking yourself , “ Is there a better way I could be doing this ? ” and you will find there often is .
5. ) Impossibilities Often Are n’t :
If you begin with the notion that something is impossible , then it obviously will be for you .
If , on the other hand , you decide to see if something is possible or not , you will find out through trial and error .

About 2 hours ago , the Mars Phoenix rover twittered that it had found evidence of ice on Mars .
Are you ready to celebrate ?
Well , get ready :
We have ICE !!!!!
Yes , ICE , * WATER ICE * on Mars ! w00t !!!
Best day ever !!
The Mars rover said “ w00t ” .
Here ’s the w00t - less press release and the associated images that show the ice sublimating from the surface over the last four days .
Tiffany Shepherd Bikini Mate , Science Teacher Fired
was a high school science teacher in Florida 's St. Lucie County School District until very recently .
School administrators fired the 30 year old single mother of three young children .
The school board says the dismissal is based upon poor job performance but Shepherd is crying foul .
It all started when the young woman and her husband divorced in early 2008 .
In order to make ends meet , Tiffany secured a part time job working for Gil Coombes on weekends .
Coombes and his wife run a charter fishing boat operation called Smokin ' Em Charters .
The charter 's website offers up charter services for bachelor parties as well as for groups of varying sizes that are interested in inshore and offshore fishing .
Shepherd and a few other attractive women are employed as bikini mates .
The women mingle with the paying customers and some are reportedly topless .
Tiffany says that she keeps her bikini firmly in place and does n't believe she is doing anything inappropriate .
She makes $ 600 for two days of fishing , which was more than what she could earn during a full week at her teaching job .
The conflict occurred , according to Tiffany , when the charter service displayed sexy photos of the bikini mates on the website that they use to advertise their business .
Shepherd believes that administrators in her school district were put off by her moonlighting and that they trumped up the poor job performance charges as a way to sever ties with someone who did n't meet their standards .
The district indicates that Shepherd missed 30 days of school this year and received two written reprimands prior to being fired .
Looks like the young woman will have to take on a few more days of fishing each week in order to support her youngsters , now that the school system has cut her loose .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) has declined a request by the ACLU to release court records for rulings that pertain to the NSA surveillance program .
The secretive FISC , which has issued only three public decisions in its history , will not disclose the details or reasoning behind critical rulings that evaluate the legality of the NSA surveillance program because the court argues that doing so would endanger national security and hamper the federal government 's intelligence gathering abilities .
The classified status of FISC documents is dictated by the executive branch of the federal government .
The ACLU 's request called for independent judicial review of relevant documents so that wrongfully classified material could be declassified and disclosed to the general public .
It is important to note that the ACLU did not request unconditional disclosure of classified material .
The ACLU 's request explicitly excludes material that , upon judicial review , is deemed to be properly classified .
The ACLU argues that the executive branch should not be able to unilaterally obscure access to information that could provide essential insight into the legal basis for national surveillance programs .
The ACLU hoped that the FISC would take on an oversight role to prevent the executive branch from abusing its power to determine what documents are classified .
Such oversight is consistent with the underlying intent of the Separation of Powers doctrine , claims the ACLU , but the court concluded that instating FISC oversight of classification status would jeopardize national security and undermine the nature of the FISC process .
" Under FISA and the applicable Security Procedures , there is no role for this Court independently to review , and potentially override , Executive Branch classification decisions , " wrote Judge John D. Bates in the FISC decision ( PDF ) .
" If the FISC were to assume the role of independently making declassification and release decisions in the probing manner requested by the ACLU , there would be a real risk of harm to national security interests and ultimately to the FISA process itself . "
The court acknowledges that public disclosure of the material requested by the ACLU could potentially prevent government abuse of surveillance powers , but denies that the good would outweigh the potential consequences .
" The ACLU is correct in asserting that certain benefits could be expected from public access to the requested materials .
There might be greater understanding of the FISC 's decisionmaking .
Enhanced public scrutiny could provide an additional safeguard against mistakes , overreaching or abuse .
And the public could participate in a better - informed manner in debates over legislative proposals relating to FISA , " Bates wrote , " [ but ] the detrimental consequences of broad public access to FISC proceedings or records would greatly outweigh any such benefits . "
Bates lists several contexts in which public access to FISC documents could prove problematic .
He argues that releasing FISC documents could potentially expose details of surveillance methods , thereby enabling suspects to evade government intelligence - gathering operations .
He also notes that disclosure of confidential sources would deter informants from providing important information to the federal government and that the risk of public scrutiny would deter the government from working through FISA .
" All of these possible harms are real and significant , and quite frankly , beyond debate , " Bates wrote .
Obviously , the reason why the ACLU asked for judicial review of the documents rather than unconditional disclosure is so that the FISC would be able to disclose , at its discretion , only the legally pertinent information that poses no risks to national security and entails no such consequences .
Judge Bates , however , believes that partial disclosure would " confuse or obscure , rather than illuminate , the decisions in question , " while creating the significant risk of accidentally exposing material that should remain classified .
The ACLU insists that present oversight of government surveillance activities is insufficient and that public access to the FISC wiretapping records is greatly needed .
" The decision is disappointing , both in its reasoning and its result , " said ACLU National Security Project director Jameel Jaffer in a statement .
" A federal court 's interpretation of federal law should not be kept secret from the American public .
The Bush administration is seeking expanded surveillance powers from Congress because of the rulings issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court earlier this year .
Under this decision , those rulings may remain secret forever . "
Balancing national security with the public 's fundamental right to know what the government is doing in its name is a difficult challenge , but no challenge should necessitate abdication of essential checks and balances .
In light of evidence of frequent and persistent surveillance abuses perpetrated by the federal government , it 's possible that the risks of limiting transparency may exceed the risks posed by the undisclosed threats from which these surveillance programs are devised to protect us .
Unfortunately , it looks like we will never know .
Saying that the current investigation into how and why the twin towers fell on Sept. 11 is inadequate , some of the nation 's leading structural engineers and fire - safety experts are calling for a new , independent and better - financed inquiry that could produce the kinds of conclusions vital for skyscrapers and future buildings nationwide .
Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , both of New York , have joined the call for a wider look into the collapses .
In an interview on Friday , Mr. Schumer said he supported a new investigation '' not so much to find blame ' ' for the collapse of the buildings under extraordinary circumstances , '' but rather so that we can prepare better for the future . ''
'' It could affect building practices , '' he said .
'' It could affect evacuation practices .
We live in a new world and everything has to be recalibrated . ''
Experts critical of the current effort , including some of those people who are actually conducting it , cite the lack of meaningful financial support and poor coordination with the agencies cleaning up the disaster site .
They point out that the current team of 20 or so investigators has no subpoena power and little staff support and has even been unable to obtain basic information like detailed blueprints of the buildings that collapsed .
' Barmaid ' Daria Weiske gets a drink for Patsy Brogan at the ' Bog Hotel ' in Bluestack Mountains , which Donegal County Council has ordered to be shut down
A LOCAL authority has taken action to shut down an alleged shebeen , deep in the hills of Donegal .
The infamous ' bog hotel ' , situated in the Bluestack mountains near Frosses , in the south west of the county , has been labelled as an unauthorised development by Donegal County Council .
The council has threatened owner Patsy Brogan with court proceedings that could end in fines of up to € 12 m and two years in jail if he refuses to comply with an order to remove a bar and lounge from a shed on his property .
It also demands that he remove old cars , caravan wrecks and lorry parts which the council says add up to the operation of an illegal scrap yard .
Mr Brogan , who has insisted that he is not running a commercial bar and it is not a shebeen , said he wo n't be removing it .
He describes it as a private facility he shares with friends and he has denied claims that he charges for drink , although some visitors are known to have left " donations " in a large jar .
" I 'm not doing anything illegal .
They will have to shoot me to get rid of the bar , " he said .
Mr Brogan added that he is trying to clean up the yard and that council officials have conceded he had made progress .
Wrecks
He said one of the wrecks he has been ordered to move is an uninhabitable caravan that is the council 's own property .
It was provided as a temporary home .
The council notice instructs him to return the shed bar to its original state .
But Mr Brogan insists he built it as a playroom for his children and , when they reached their teens , added a disco facility .
He says the bar that he built in the same shed as the disco , although up to pub standard , is no different to private bars in other homes .
He has not been prosecuted because gardai say they cannot produce evidence that drink is being sold .
There is a " barmaid " -- a 28 - year - old Polish woman , Daria Weiske -- whom the 70 - year - old Mr Brogan says is his girlfriend , although she laughs off the claim .
The council notice was pinned to the door of Mr Brogan 's home on January 29 .
When officials called him a couple of weeks later he claimed he had not seen the notice , so a copy was sent to him along with a photocopy of a photograph of a garda standing beside it on the date of the original delivery .
The notice is served under the same law that provides for the prosecution of large corporations for breaches of planning regulations .
Conviction could result in a maximum penalty of € 1,904.61 and six months jail .
If a prosecution is conducted in a higher court , the maximum penalty could be € 12.69 m and two years in jail .
The " bog hotel " earned its nickname from its remote location and its owner 's readiness to serve drink to callers , no matter what the time .
It earned widespread public attention when it was discovered to be the last place visited by a young man who died later the same day in January after a night of partying .
Gardai have ruled out any link between his death and his visit to the ' bog hotel ' .
Bush Spins Iran's Centrifuges
Those who know about the centrifuges used to refine uranium tell me they must spin at an almost unrivaled velocity — almost unrivaled , because Bush administration statements are being spun at equivalent speed by White House and corporate media spiders .

Printer friendly Without weaver - in - chief Karl Rove and former presidential spokesman Tony Snow , it is amateur hour at the White House .
And the theater would be as funny as The Daily Show were the subject not so serious .
Judging from President George W. Bush ’s words and body language he is far from giving up on ways to “ justify ” attacking Iran ’s nuclear program — weapons - related or not .
He appears convinced he must honor the pledge he has made to Israel ’s current leaders to eliminate what they have called an “ existential threat ” to Israel .
This came through in a particularly pointed way when an agitated president ad - libbed about the possibility of World War III , complaining loudly , “ We ’ve got a leader in Iran who has announced he wants to destroy Israel . ”
Not at all helpful to the president was the judgment of U.S. intelligence that the Iranians halted their nuclear weapons - related program in 2003 , a judgment the administration made public this week .
The White House knew only too well that this bombshell could not be kept secret very long — the more so since Congress ’ intelligence committees , Pentagon brass , and senior CIA officials reportedly made it clear they would go public if the White House did not publish a sanitized version of the key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate .
On Oct. 26 , Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell launched a trial balloon , declaring he would no longer declassify and release summaries of National Intelligence Estimates , but that balloon was quickly shot down .
So what can Cheney and Bush do now to “ justify ” striking Iran ?
Several months ago , about the time new intelligence established there was no active nuclear weapons program in Iran , there were signs in the rhetoric coming from the president and Gen.
David Petraeus that the argument was going to hinge on claims that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were supplying the wherewithal to kill our troops in Iraq .
Petraeus was clearly ready to play that game , but his superior , Admiral “ we ’re - not - going - to - do - Iran - on - my - watch ” William Fallon would not play along .
And neither would the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is now back from a brief visit to Iraq and his caution so far on this issue suggests he is paying more heed to Fallon than to Petraeus .
In other words , there is no sign that Gates wants to abet using Iranian meddling in Iraq as a pretext for a military strike on Iran .
Gates ’s well - deserved chameleon - like reputation counsels caution here , since a word from Cheney or Bush could conceivably make Gates a fervent champion of this pretext for war .
But people do mature ; Gates is smart ; and I doubt he would want to be so closely associated with starting a regional war , if not WW III .
Spinning Centrifuges
So where does that leave the beleaguered president ?
This week ’s spinning by the White House and subservient media suggests the administration still thinks it can make a case for war , by obfuscating the nuclear program in Iran .
This has become clearer as administration mouthpieces blur the distinction between uranium enrichment for a civilian energy use ( permitted to signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ) and the much more demanding requirements of a nuclear weapons program .
The spinners have resurrected the discredited argument that Iran ’s nuclear program must be for weapons , because Iran ’s oil and gas should suffice to meet all its energy requirements .
Thus , the administration ’s Pravda , also known as the editorial page of the Washington Post , on Dec. 5 : “ Iran ’s massive overt investment in uranium enrichment meanwhile proceeds ... even though Tehran has no legitimate use for enriched uranium . ”
And thus another major administration mouthpiece , also known as the New York Times , on Dec. 6 , in an op -ed , “ In Iran We Trust ? ” by Valerie Lincy and Gary Milhollin : “ Why , by the way , does Iran even want a nuclear energy program , when it is sitting on an enormous pool of oil that is now skyrocketing in value . ”
This is a familiar canard ; i.e. , that Iran ’s claim that its nuclear program is for electricity production is given the lie by its own large oil and natural gas reserves , so uranium enrichment must be for nuclear weapons development .
Condoleezza
Rice took that line over a year and a half ago ( shades of those ( in ) famous aluminum tubes that she said could “ only ” be used in a nuclear application but turned out to be for conventional artillery ) .
At about the same time Dick Cheney complained that since the Iranians are “ already sitting on an awful lot of oil and gas , nobody can figure why they need nuclear as well to generate energy . ”
It all makes me think of Harry Truman ’s complaint : “ They must think we were born yesterday ! ” Rice and Cheney have selective memories — or take us for fools .
Back in 1976 — with Gerald Ford president , Dick Cheney his chief of staff , Donald Rumsfeld secretary of defense — the Ford administration bought the Shah ’s argument that Iran needed a nuclear program to meet its future energy requirements .
That argument , of course , is even more valid today , with the price that can be obtained for oil and the specter of Peak Oil .
Cheney and Rumsfeld persuaded a hesitant President Ford to offer Iran a deal that would have meant at least $ 6.4 billion for U.S. corporations like Westinghouse and General Electric , had not the Shah been unceremoniously dumped three years later .
The offer included a reprocessing facility for a complete nuclear fuels cycle — essentially the same capability that the U.S. and Israel now insist Iran can not be allowed to acquire .
A pity that our domesticated media seem unable to catch the disingenuousness .

So do stock markets .
Day after day , there is bad news from the banking sector in Europe and America .
There is bad news from the housing markets all over the world .
There is bad news from the Institute for Supply Management , which reports on the state of suppliers .
The service sector in January fell to 41.9 % , with 50 % as the borderline between contraction and expansion .
In December , it was 54.4 % .
This is a very sharp decline .
The drip , drip , drip of bad news has a cumulative effect .
It undermines investors ’ confidence in the economy .
This calls the stock market into question .
PANIC SELLING
Panic selling does not hit a market without warning , smashing it into a meltdown that lasts for years .
It hits after years of nagging doubts , followed by months of bad news in relentless sound bites , and then one unpredictable event that triggers a massive one - day sell - off , which is followed by more days of sell - offs .
Woe unto the investor who is caught fully invested in that initial sell - off .
He will look in horror , paralyzed , denying the obvious .
The market keeps going down , day after day .
Tout TV commentators ( age 30 ) interview fund managers , who deny that it ’s a meltdown , recommend “ buying sector stocks , ” and say , “ Buy on the dips . ”
Dips ?
The market is collapsing .
Then the poor soul who bought and held finally calls his broker or sends a message to his retirement fund : “ Sell ! ”
Too late .
Once smashed , a market can take years to recover .
Gold and silver did not recover for 21 years , 1980 — 2001 .
We have seen this kind of sell - off more recently .
It began on March 24 , 2000 .
On that day , the NASDAQ peaked , intra-day , at 5132.52 .
It closed at 5048 .
This marked the end of the dot - com bubble .
You need to see a graph of that collapse , just to remind yourself of just how bad it can be next time .
It bottomed on October 9 , 2002 at 1114 .
On January 2 , 2002 , it closed at 2059 .
That was down 60 % from the peak .
The chart of that decline looked bad .
But was n’t good news straight ahead ?
Had n’t the bad news been discounted ?
No .
The NASDAQ fell another 46 % over the next ten months .
Look at the chart .
Today , it is in the range of 2300 .
The consumer price index has risen by over 20 % , 2000 to 2008 . ( www.bls.gov).
It rose by 15 % , 2002 — 2008 .
So , discounting for price inflation , the NASDAQ is lower today than it was in early January , 2002 .
Plus , the person who bought and held in 2002 suffered a 46 % loss of capital in 2002 .
Had he sold in January and repurchased in October in a tax - deferred IRA or other retirement fund , he would have avoided this loss .
I know people who told me in January , 2000 , that the NASDAQ ’s price / earnings ratio of 206 was reasonable .
I thought it was n’t , and I warned my readers to sell in February and March .
No one on Tout TV ever mentions this .
No one says , “ This can easily happen again . ”
No one says , “ The NASDAQ has been in a bear market ever since March 24 , 2000 .
The recovery after October 2002 is a bear market rally .
That rally is fading . ”
VOLATILITY
Day after day , the Dow is up or down 100 points or more , sometimes 200 , sometimes more .
Why ?
If the best forecasting minds on earth agree on the value of shares , should n’t the Dow rise or fall by under 50 points ?
Should n’t there be a trend , one way or the other ?
We are seeing massive moves in and out of shares .
The experts are not only not agreed , they are not agreed in a fundamental way .
These are not random moves , in the sense of movements in response to unknown changes in perception at the margin .
These are clashes between fundamental views of the future of this stock market and the international economy .
Yes , these views are at the margin .
All economic change is at the margin .
But these are much larger moves than normal .
The investors at the margin are much more aggressive , and they do not agree on what is coming .
The investor with money in his pension fund looks at these swings , and he has to wonder : “ What ’s going on ?
Why is the stock market so volatile ?
Why are downward moves so big ?
Why does the market rebound briefly , then fall again ? ”
He sees volatility , and he senses confusion at the top .
The big boys who allocate enormous pools of money just cannot get their act together .
Yes , there are always bulls and bears , but the bears rarely are in a position to swing the market this widely .
When they are in this position , this indicates that the stock market is at a crossroads .
Volatility is great for about 3 % of commodity futures speculators .
These are the people who make money .
But volatility is not good for stock market investors .
It points to major changes in both the economy and the market .
Most stock investors do not want volatility .
They want steady capital gains , year after year .
They have not gotten this since March , 2000 .
What they have gotten is a nearly flat Dow Jones and S&P 500 , and a much lower NASDAQ , accompanied by steady price inflation .
They are getting poor slowly .
They have not yet lost hope in the stock brokers ’ mantra , “ The U.S. stock market has risen by 7 % per annum . ”
Not in 1966 — 1982 .
Not since 2000 .
The victims who invest in a broad index of stocks have lost money for eight years .
They refuse to change .
They refuse to call their fund managers and say : “ Sell my stocks and move the money into a money market fund . ”
Yet they watch what is happening , and they get nervous .
They refuse to sell .
The smart ones who have automatic investing each paycheck have most of this money go into stocks .
But they do n’t like what they hear about subprime loans .
They do n’t like what they see in the stock market charts .
We are now entering the doubt stage .
It has taken eight years of negative returns in stocks .
These years can never be recovered .
Meanwhile , gold went from under $ 300 to over $ 900 .
The stock market touts who never told you to buy gold now tell you it ’s too risky .
The “ Wall Street Journal ” ran a story , “ How to Survive The New Gold Rush ” on January 29 .
What was the advice ?
Do n’t buy gold .
Why not ?
( 1 ) Gold can be “ extremely volatile . ”
( 2 ) Gold “ has n’t always kept up with inflation . ”
( 3 ) Better to invest in a commodities funds , “ advisers say . ”
What advisors ?
The blind boneheads who did n’t put gold in their portfolios or recommend gold , from $ 257 to $ 900 .
Instead , they said “ buy an index fund of U.S. stocks . ”
And what did that do for investors after March , 2000 ?
Nothing , at best .
Capital losses at worst ( NASDAQ ) .
In short , these unnamed advisors are losers until proven innocent .
Losers deeply resent winners .
They deeply resent gold because gold ’s rising price announces : “ The policies of the Federal Reserve System , the U.S. Treasury , and Wall Street have produced losses for eight years . ”
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR
Some of my subscribers have read my warnings about real estate , Federal spending , and the tight - money policies of Bernanke ’s FED for two years .
Others have refused to read my reports .
A few people have taken me seriously and have reallocated their portfolios .
They got out of stocks and into other asset classes , such as gold .
But most readers have just sat there .
They have nodded in agreement , but they have not picked up the phone to call their broker or pension fund manager to tell them to sell their shares .
The average investor does n’t read information sources like mine .
They prefer to rely on the mainstream financial press , which is advertising - supported .
They prefer to read articles that are favorable to stocks , which is what mainstream financial press advertisers are paying editorial departments to publish .
But doubts are growing .
Day after day , the news from the banks , from the American auto industry , and from the housing sector is depressing .
The drip - drip - drip factor is eroding the foundation of confidence that is necessary to sustain rising stock markets .
We are seeing the undermining of the foundation of the bulls : investor optimism .
There is no way that the news coming out of the financial sector can be interpreted as optimistic .
The good news relates to specific companies .
The bad news applies to entire sectors of the economy , and two of the biggest , housing and autos , are in trouble .
General Motors lost $ 39 billion in 2007 .
How does any company lose that much money and still stay in business ?
Yet the recession has not hit yet .
THE NEXT SUBPRIME LOAN CRISIS
In the February 13 issue of “ USA Today , ” on the front page of the Moneyline section , we read this headline : “ Car loans stretch to 7 years or longer . ”
The subhead is accurate : “ Down the road , risky practice could hurt sales . ”
But it was not sufficiently scary .
Here is what is should have read :
Auto industry adopts subprime loans .
Owners will walk away when their cars ’ equity is gone .
The depreciation effect in autos is constant and unrelenting .
Unlike houses , which used to appreciate — if owners put enough maintenance money into them — cars depreciate from the moment the new owner drives off the lot .
Seven years out , nobody but poor people and me will buy that car .
Here is some car buyer who does n’t understand compound interest , equity , and upside - down loans .
He just wants a new car .
He can not afford to buy one for cash .
He has no savings .
But he wants that new car .
So , he signs his name on a $ 25,000 car loan that he will be paying for when the car is worth $ 2,500 .
Using an amortization calculator , we find that a $ 25,000 loan at 6.5 % for 7 years requires a monthly payment of $ 371.24 .
That means $ 4,455 a year .
What will the car be worth in year 7 ?
Probably less than $ 4,455 .
Then there is the question of falling demand for cars .
In years five through seven , he will not buy a new car .
Why not ?
Because his old car , which he will still owe money for , will have no equity .
He will still be in debt .
The debt will exceed the re-sale price of the car .
The only way that he will get enough money to pay off the loan is for the new car company to offer to buy it at a trade - in price large enough to pay off his debt : above market value .
Alternatively , the car company will re-finance his old loan and apply it to a new loan .
But then the new loan is really upside - down .
The entire auto industry will be forced to extend subprime loans to buyers who are ever deeper in debt .
These are subprime buyers of depreciating assets .
They are the people who will default on their home loans and walk away .
They will walk away from auto loans , too .
America ’s two consumer industries , housing and autos , are now utterly dependent on long - term debt .
They can not survive without massive permanent debt .
The public accepts this , and therefore submits to lifetime debt .
They do not intend to pay it off .
They intend to roll it over .
This is also the assumption of the U.S. Treasury .
Its debt is perpetual .
It is for consumption — the purchase of votes — and not production .
The voters have accepted lifelong debt , at an ever - expanding rate , as basic to all politics .
This attitude is universal in the West .
It is not confined to the United States .
“ Deficits do n’t matter . ”
This is what politicians proclaim to voters , and economists then affirm as the well - paid court prophets of the modern world .
Debt is forever .
The pious Christian in the pew prays , “ Forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors ” ( Matthew 6:12 ) .
But when the ultimate debtors — the banks and the governments — decide to inflate away their debts , the pious souls who prayed that prayer and voted for the politics of debt will at last understand that God is not mocked .
“ For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind ” ( Hosea 8:7a ) .
CONCLUSION
The volatility of stocks point to economic conditions that are not understood .
The economic fools in high places who approved the subprime loans that are now going bad did not see what was coming until July , 2007 .
These fools committed their firms and their clients to debt packages that were toxic .
They did not understand their credit portfolios any more than the subprime borrowers understood the adjustable rate loan contracts that they signed .
Governments and central banks are now bailing out the dim - witted bankers to the tune of billions of low - interest loans and direct funding .
Governments are also offering band aids — or proposals for band aids — to postpone the debtors ’ day of reckoning .
But politicians know whose bread must be buttered : the multinational bankers ’ bread .
They will be bailed out .
The home owners , busted , will return from whence they came : the land of the renters .
No one really cares .
They do n’t care that large banks are too big to fail .
They do n’t care that small home owners are too small to be worth saving .
As long as the government intervenes to keep the debt structure alive , voters do n’t care whose money gets used to do the bailing .
We are addicted to debt .
But as the addiction grows , it becomes too big not to fail .
It will fail .
The question is :
In what way ?
Outright default or mass inflation ?
I predict mass inflation .
But not yet .
Not this year .
The downward pressure of the contracting housing sector and autos will keep downward pressure on prices .
The drip , drip , drip of bad economic news will eventually break the average mutual fund investor ’s will to resist this downward pressure .
“ Sell ! ”
“ To whom ?
At what price ? ”

New research finds that broadband users are increasingly turning to the web for their video content fix , but almost everyone still prefers the comforting blue glow of a television screen .
Nielsen conducted the study on behalf of the Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing ( CTAM ) , which obviously worries that the rise of online TV shows and movies could eat into cable and satellite market share .
The survey found , though , that 94 percent of cable and satellite subscribers prefer to watch content on regular TV sets .
Whew !
It 's not all good news for pay - TV , though , as the survey seems likely to undercount those who are most comfortable watching online video , as those folks are not likely to sign up for pay - TV service in the first place ( our household survives on a diet of over - the - air HD local channels , TV shows on DVD , and online sites like Hulu ) .
The survey also found that over a third of all US broadband users have watched at least one TV show on the Internet , generally at the television networks ' sites , so the shift to the web is well underway .
But most of those ( 82 percent ) who watched online shows did so because they searched for a specific program they had missed on TV , so the report points out the " critical importance of strong marketing for the initial TV showing . "
But the world is moving to the web , and cable and satellite operators desperately want to avoid becoming a dumb IP bit - hauler .
( Imagine Comcast only being able to charge $ 40 a month for a 15 M bps line , rather than more than $ 100 a month for TV programming , phone service , and Internet access , and you can see why this is a scary prospect . )
Web video is being held back not just by novelty or lack of content , but also by technical limitations .
It 's still difficult to get web video onto TVs for most people ; even if your laptop has a DVI or HDMI jack , the majority of US televisions remain mired in the analog age .
And quality can still be spotty , although ABC is now streaming episodes of Lost in HD and Hulu offers 480 p streaming for FOX and NBC TV shows .
As TV sets go digital , something that the upcoming February 2009 digital transition may help , innovative set - top boxes and easier laptop connections will help blur the distinctions between " online " and " broadcast " video .
So it 's still a good time to be in pay TV , but the lean years could be a -coming .
Right now , the government of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is considering blocking Facebook , the social networking website that has become a popular hangout for twentysomethings worldwide and a favorite venue for Egypt ’s disaffected youth .
The reason :
In April , one group of young citizens mobilized 80,000 supporters to protest rising food prices .
Facebook networking played a crucial role in broadening support and turnout for an April 6 textile workers ’ strike and protest .
The Egyptian government , which has governed for 25 years under emergency law and does n’t allow more than five people to gather unregistered , hit back hard , jailing young dissidents and torturing Ahmed Maher , a young activist who tried , unsuccessfully , to organize a second demonstration in early May .
Despite these setbacks , the “ Facebook movement ” in Egypt is significant for several reasons .
First , it challenges the perception that there is no prospect for independent , secular opposition in the country .
The majority of Egyptians are under 30 and have known no other ruler than Mubarak .
They have not seen real political parties because the government has long restricted opposition parties and free media .
The Facebook movement engaged large numbers of youth for the first time .
Second , the Web offers a safe political space -- a role the mosque has traditionally played in Egypt .
The Muslim Brotherhood has for decades been the only viable opposition .
With Facebook , young secular people can communicate , build relationships and express their opinions freely .
( Significantly , the Muslim Brotherhood opposed the successful April demonstration but supported the unsuccessful May event . )
Every member in the 100,000 - strong online community could be , at any given moment , a leader of a movement .

Third , engaging Egypt ’s youth is an important item on the agenda of Mubarak ’s son , Gamal , as he works to gain support for his succession to power .
As a young politician , Gamal established the Future Generation Foundation in 2000 , which incubated many of the current leaders of the ruling National Democratic Party and the new Cabinet .
Facebook activists and their supporters should be able to turn to this group for support .
A few weeks ago , Belal Diab , a 20 - year - old college student , interrupted one of the Egyptian prime minister ’s speeches to protest the arrests of Facebook activists , shouting : “ Look who are you fighting ; it is us , the younger generation who stood with you and supported you ! ”
Nevertheless , Facebook activists are being targeted by government - based media campaigns defaming the website and the youth activists who use it .
The government also warns media not to talk about the phenomenon .
I saw the heavy - handed efforts of the government while recording a TV show with Maher .
During the taping , Egyptian police broke into the studio , threatened the station manager and forced the guest outside the room .
What can be done to help this movement ?
The international community and the U.S. government should pressure the Egyptian government to support Internet freedom and keep Facebook accessible to Egyptians .
One young activist , Ahmad Samih , is campaigning to gain local and international support to prevent the Egyptian government from blocking Facebook .
So far , nearly 20 Egyptian human rights organizations are supporting this cause .
International human rights organizations should publicly join in that show of support .
Egyptian democrats are “ Facebooking ” their advocacy in order to escape heavy recriminations .
It would be shameful for the international community not to stand up on their behalf against a government that seeks to deny them even that small space to express themselves .
Otherwise , Mubarak ’s self - fulfilling prophesy as the only alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood will continue to hold Egypt back from the democracy its people deserve .
Do we really need another way to rot our brains ?
Yes , yes we do – and live TV on our phones is just the ticket .
The latest effort to get the boob tube on a mobile device is AT&T's Mobile TV with FLO ( Forward Link Only ) , and it 's surprisingly good .
Coupled with the LG
Vu phone , it 's a match made in couch - potato heaven .
The MediaFLO service uses an unusual , nonstandard bit of spectrum to ensure that the streaming of your favorite flicks is uninterrupted .
Instead of downloading the data over AT&T's 3 - G network , the Qualcomm - developed technology operates primarily on the old UHF television band , though it does tap into the 3 - G network in order to get started .
The result is that there 's virtually no buffering and programming starts up within a few seconds .
On the Vu ’s brilliant 3 - inch screen we found picture quality to be insanely clear and frame rates to be smooth as the ice cubes in a tumbler of 30 - year - old bourbon .
" Mobile TV " is a bit of a misnomer .
Only a few channels are simulcast , meaning you can watch them in near - real time : for instance , Comedy Central , breaking news on CNN and and selected sporting events on ESPN .
All other programming , like episodes of your favorite Fox shows ( Family Guy ! ) , are time - shifted and updated when necessary .
There are three different Mobile TV packages to choose from .
Included in the $ 30 package is unlimited Mobile TV , Web browsing and CV mobile video along with CBS Mobile , CNN Mobile Live , Comedy Central , ESPN Mobile , Fox Mobile , MTV , NBC 2 Go , NBC News 2 Go , Nickelodeon and PIX ( Sony Pictures ) .
The mid-tier package , at $ 15 , gives you unlimited Mobile TV and the CNCRT channel for a limited time .
The basic package includes CBS Mobile , FOX Mobile , NBC 2 Go and NBC News 2 Go for only $ 13 .
Watching live streaming TV or movies like The Karate Kid on the Vu's 3 - inch haptic touchscreen is , well , pretty amazing .
The user interface is fairly intuitive with straightforward menus .
And the mere fact that we can watch clips from 30 Rock while sitting on the bus is satisfying in itself .
Hell , it almost makes us want to junk our 52 - inch monster HD LCD and watch TV on our phone full time .
Almost .

MI5 has not " directly " asked the government to extend the time limit for holding terror suspects without charge , to 42 days , Jacqui Smith has said .
But the home secretary told BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show the security service had been " clear about the growing scale of the threat " to the UK .
She added that she hoped the government would not lose a crucial Commons vote on the issue on Wednesday .
The Conservatives , Lib Dems and up to 30 Labour MPs oppose the plan .
' Reasonable maximum '
The opposition parties argue the proposed pre-charge detention limit will infringe civil liberties , but ministers argue it is necessary to deal with increasingly complex terror plots .
Ms Smith said extending the limit for terror suspects from 28 days to 42 days was a " safeguard , not a target " , and that it was a " reasonable maximum " .
It 's completely against the traditions and ways of this country
Boris Johnson , London Mayor
It would allow suspects " through the criminal justice system in the most effective way " , she added .
Questioned as to whether MI5 had asked for extended detention powers , Ms Smith said : " No , not directly , but nor did they ask for the extension from 14 to 28 , nor did they ask for the extension from 7 to 14 . "
Asked whether the 42 - day plan , part of the Counter - Terrorism Bill , would get through Parliament , she replied : " I certainly hope it does , because I believe it is the right thing to do . "
The Tories have previously said MI5 is not privately pressing the case for 42 days .
Shadow home secretary David Davis told BBC One 's The Politics Show : " The question I have to ask every time is will this save lives ?
" Will this actually achieve what we are trying to achieve , or will it do the opposite ?
In my view , very plainly , it will do the opposite . "
' Entirely arbitrary ' Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " MI5 , the director of public prosecutions and senior police officers think that this is an unnecessary extra power .
" The reality is that the 42 - day proposal is entirely arbitrary . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has written to all Labour MPs , seeking their support for the plans .
He said new safeguards would mean suspects were held for six - weeks only during " a terrorist crisis situation " .
But the combined opposition to the plans raises the prospect of Mr Brown suffering his first Commons defeat since becoming prime minister last year .
Ministers are hoping the fears of potential rebels have been assuaged by an address to the Parliamentary Labour Party by Ms Smith last week , in which she proposed new safeguards to prevent arbitrary use of the new powers .
The home secretary said there was " absolutely not " an agreement to provide £ 200 m of extra funding to the administration in Stormont in exchange for the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party 's nine MPs .
She added : " This is not about doing deals .
This is about doing the right thing by the country , and this country 's security . "
Mr Brown , who has a working majority of 65 in the Commons , has made it clear that he does not regard Wednesday 's vote as a matter of confidence in his premiership .
Senior police officers have backed the 42 - day plan , but the director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald said that Ms Smith 's safeguards had made no difference to his belief that the change was unnecessary .
Parliament 's Joint Committee on Human Rights dismissed the new safeguards as " inadequate " and said the case had not been made for justifying the longer period .

What are these ?
With the world teetering on the edge of a full - blown food crisis , it may be time to cut back on biofuel , said Barack Obama yesterday .
In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press , the Democratic presidential candidate said " there 's no doubt that biofuels may be contributing " to falling food supplies and rising prices .
" If it turns out that we 've got to make changes in our ethanol policy to help people get something to eat , then that 's got to be the step we take , " he said .
During the last year , global food prices have spiked , with food riots breaking out in more than 30 countries .
The emerging crisis captured global attention after rice prices rose 50 percent in just two weeks in
March , setting off protests in Indonesia , riots in Haiti and worldwide panic .
Some experts say that food is a more pressing problem than climate change – and with dinner - table crops now headed to refineries , the booming popularity of biofuels is partly to blame .
About 100 million tons of grain – enough to feed 450 million people at a subsistence level – were turned into fuel last year .
In the United States , where corn is king , corn - based ethanol is the centerpiece of a federal mandate to meet one - quarter of the nation 's gasoline demand with renewable fuels .
Corn growers are especially powerful in Obama 's home state of Illinois , and the candidate has long been a biofuel booster – which makes his comments on Meet the Press
all the more welcome .
" We 've got a serious food problem around the world .
We 've got rising food prices here in the United States .
In other countries we 're seeing riots because of the lack of food supplies .
So this is something that we 're going to have to deal with , " said Obama .

In northern Afghanistan it appears some parents are being driven by poverty and hunger to marry off their daughters at an early age .
Jenny Cuffe investigates for Radio 4 's Seven Days .
In Wandian 's market place , farmers complain they have little to sell Farida ( not her real name ) was paid 40,000 Afghani ( £ 400 ) last summer for marrying her 13 - year - old daughter to her father 's 20 - year - old cousin .
The child , her freckled face half hidden behind a blue veil , says she does not like her husband , and begins to cry .
" I did n't want to marry , it was my parents ' decision , " she said .
" I dreamed I would be able to finish my education .
I had no choice . "
Asked why she is making her daughter unhappy , Farida replies simply : " It is her life , it is her fate . "
Badakhshan 's independent MP Fauzia Kofi says she has seen an increasing number of such child brides in the last two years .
" I do n't call it marriage , I call it selling children , " she says .
" A nine or 10 - year - old - you give her away for wheat and two cows . "
High prices
The cause of the trend , according to Fauzia Kofi , is poverty .
Farida and her daughter live in the village of Wandian , high in the mountains of Badakhshan and a fortnight 's journey by donkey from the nearest big town , Faizabad .
Badakhshan deputy governor Dr Mohammed Zarif reports 60 deaths from cold and hunger and the loss of 7,000 livestock over the five months that the district has been cut off from the rest of the world by snow .
Meanwhile , some food in the local market has doubled in price in the last year - a result both of Badakhshan 's inaccessibility , and of global food shortages .
The British aid agency , Oxfam , has brought them vegetable seeds and fertiliser , but villagers in Wandian say their oxen have died and they need a plough .
Midwife Hanufa
Mah had to help a 10 - year - old girl in labour Fauzia Kofi believes child marriages will only end if Badakhshan gets investment to reduce poverty , and more help to improve the food supply .
A midwife in the village of Khordakhan , Hanufa Mah , agrees that alleviating poverty is key .
She says she tries to teach parents not to marry their girls too young but some feel they have no choice .
One girl she helped through labour was only 10 years old .
" The girl was so small .
I held her in my lap until the child was born , " she says .
UN figures show that more women die in childbirth in Badakhshan than anywhere else in the world , and mothers under the age of 15 are most at risk .
No quick fix Afghanistan 's finance minister Anwar al - haq Ahadi does not , however , expect regions such as Badakhshan to be lifted out of poverty quickly .
" I 'm afraid it 's going to take quite a while ... what we 're trying to do now is just the very basics .
" Right now we are the fourth or fifth poorest country in the world .
" We hope we will move in ranking by another two or three steps , but still , Afghanistan in five years from now will be a very poor country . "
The outlook for girls in Afghanistan 's remote villages appears bleak then , especially if global food shortages continue .
Their hopes of education are likely to be frustrated , and they will continue to face the hazards of early pregnancy .
To hear the full story Listen again to Seven Days ...
In Afghanistan .

Just went there for my lunch ( could n't dedicate more time than that cause my work does n't permit to , plus I 'm hungry as hell now that I did n't eat , but could n't miss any opportunity I could have to show up ! )
One thing Charlie Angus said which is really important is that the NDP will introduce a law for net neutrality tomorrow !
He gave a really good motivating speech !
He suggested we write to the government once the bill is proposed and that we demand a response from MPs concerning their position on this new law , and that we mention that their position will influence our decisions on future ridings and such ...
That we do not accept a brush off or a response saying that their riding is looking into it , but a firm response on whether they support it or deny it in our letters .
I think it 's a good idea !
Thought I would share this tidbit with you folks while this is going on , gonna see if I can go back on my next break !

That is very good idea proposed by Angus about writing your MP and demanding a stance , and letting them know yours as a voter in their constituency .

Exactly , I urge everyone reading this to pay attention to the bill introduced tomorrow and if you happen to find the time to write to your MP , do n't make the letter an inquiry , make it a DEMAND to know their stance and that you want a definite answer on this and not a maybe or we 'll look into it !
As Mr. Angus has said , some people in government see us fighting this think of us as pirates , couch potatoes , or even worse , some hong kong dvd stall vendors selling pirated stuff , we are not any of that , we are citizens !
And we have rights ...
We deserve net neutrality and deserve to be heard , our votes count just as much as anyone elses .
Do n't remain silent , speak up and write to your MPs .

June 25 , 2008
T he CIA�s Torture Teachers , psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen [ see Eban and Mayer for a reminder of their work ] , are in the news again .
In a front page New York Times article on the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , it is mentioned that the subject of the story , Deuce Martinez is now employed by the dynamic torture firm :
His life today is quiet by comparison with the secret interrogations of 2002 and 2003 .
But Mr. Martinez has not turned away entirely from his old world .
He now works for Mitchell & Jessen Associates , a consulting company run by former military psychologists who advised the C.I.A. on the use of harsh tactics in the secret program .
His new employer sent Mr. Martinez right back to the agency .
For now , the unlikely interrogator of the man perhaps most responsible for the horrors of 9/11 teaches other C.I.A. analysts the arcane art of tracking terrorists .
As Katherine Eban explaines what was so distinctive about this firm : Mitchell and Jessen reverse - engineered the tactics inflicted on sere trainees for use on detainees in the global war on terror , according to psychologists and others with direct knowledge of their activities .
The C.I.A. put them in charge of training interrogators in the brutal techniques , including " waterboarding , " at its network of " black sites . "
They exemplified the CIA�s humane treatment of detainees : Mitchell had a tougher approach in mind .
The C.I.A. interrogators explained that they were going to become Zubaydah�s " God . "
If he refused to cooperate , he would lose his clothes and his comforts one by one .
At the safe house , the interrogators isolated him .
They would enter his room just once a day to say , " You know what I want , " then leave again .
As Zubaydah clammed up , Mitchell seemed to conclude that Zubaydah would talk only when he had been reduced to complete helplessness and dependence .
With that goal in mind , the C.I.A. team began building a coffin in which they planned to bury the detainee alive .
It seems that the coffin may not in the end have been used .
So Deuce Martinez , so according to the Times followed torture sessions with " rapport - based " session , getting KSM to talk .
They report that he turned down a CIA offer of specialized training in the " enhanced interrogation techniques , " aka torture , not because he objected but because he believed his talents lay elsewhere .
As Eban explains , that training would have been with the torture duo :
Interrogators who were sent for classified training inevitably wound up in a Mitchell - Jessen " shop , " and some balked at their methods .
Instead of the careful training touted by President Bush , some recruits allegedly received on - the - job training during brutal interrogations that effectively unfolded as live demonstrations .
The very fact that he accepted employment with the nation�s premier torture firm indicates that he had no ethical qualms about the Mitchell - Jessen approach .
The American Psychological Association has a long relationship with Mitchell and Jessen .
Their firm was authorized to give APA Continuing Education credits , though rumor indicates that may no longer be the case : Mitchell , Jessen , and Associates , LLC ( MJA ) is an executive consulting firm specializing in the area of understanding , predicting , and improving performance in high - risk and extreme situations .
MJA develops specialized assessment and selection programs for high - risk occupations , devises and conducts tailored training for related , high - risk programs , and is additionally approved by the American Psychological Association to offer continuing professional education for psychologists .
After the Mitchell - Jessen directed torture of Abu Zubaydah resulted in numerous false leads that wasted thousands of hours of law enforcement time , the CIA together with the APA and the Rand Corporation conducted an invitation - only workshop on the Science of Deception , Mitchell , Jessen , and their likely CIA supervisor , Kirk Hubbard , were invited .
Many APA leaders were likely also there , so it strains credulity that they are not intimately aware of Mitchell and Jessen�s work .
Interestingly , the APA leadership has conveniently " lost " the attendance list .
As a further indication of APA�s connection to the CIA�s torture firm , one of the five " governing people " on the torture firm�s Board is former American Psychological Association President , Joseph Matarazzo .
The APA is intensely disturbed by President Matzrazzo�s possible involvement in torture as can be gleamed from these ethically - principled quotes from APA leadership when Matzrazzo�s involvement was revealed last summer .
Then APA President Sharon Brehm : " No comment . "
APA Director of the Ethics Office and APA point man on torture and interrogations : " No comment . "
But one official did have a comment , which says everything one needs to knopw about the ethics of APA leadership .
" Dr. Matarazzo was president of APA 18 years ago , " Rhea Farberman , the organization�s director of public affairs , said in a prepared statement .
" Since that time , he has had no active role in APA governance but has been actively involved in the American Psychological Foundation ( APF ) , the charitable giving arm of APA .
Dr. Matarazzo currently holds no governance positions in either APA or APF , " the statement said .
Matarazzo�s " professional activities are outside and independent of any role he has played within APA and APF , " the statement said .
" We have no direct knowledge about the business dealing of Mitchell�s and Jessen�s company ; however , APA�s position is clear � torture or other forms of cruel or inhuman treatment are always unethical . "
Notice the deep concern for Mitchell and Jessen�s and , potentially , Matarazzo�s , actions expressed in this statement .
Notice the ( missing ) promise to investigate and , if confirmed , discipline this former APA President .
After all , while " torture is unethical " , this former President 's " professional activities " are no concern of the APA .
Meanwhile , the Times article informs us that Mitchell & Jessen Associates is still in the CIA�s good graces .
Most likely they still have the torture contract .
And as for the APA , they will most likely continue to forget about the firm�s connection to them .
Coincidentally , the morning before the new New York Times article appeared , a member of the APA�s Board sent out to various listserv�s an odd statement : Colleagues , I wanted to share the fact that APA is aware of the concerns that two Washington state psychologists were employed by the Department of Defense to reverse - engineer survival and resistance training ( which is designed to help U.S. military personnel in the event they are captured ) for use in interrogations .
These two psychologists are not APA members so are out of the reach of the APA�s ethics enforcement process but , nevertheless , APA�s position on inappropriate interrogations techniques is very clear .
In August of 2007 , the APA Council of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the use of 19 interrogation techniques because they were unethical , abusive and constituted torture .
These condemned techniques included waterboarding , forced nakedness , sexual humiliation , stress positions and the use of dogs to intimidate .
In terms of active duty military psychologists being used as trainers of harsh interrogation techniques , the media reports that I have seen suggest this was not the case .
Rather , these reports have singled out military psychologists as raising concerns about aggressive interrogation techniques including waterboarding , forced nakedness and sleep depravation .
Notice that this esteemed APA board member cannot distinguish between the Defense Department , the subject of this week�s Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) hearings , and the CIA that employed Mitchell and Jessen .
Notice too that she conveniently ignores former APA President Matarazzo�s possible involvement in Mitchell and Jessens 's activities and also ignores the fact that APA invited Mitchell and Jessen to the APA - CIA - Rand conference .
One also may wonder what " media reports " this Board member read which featured military psychologists protesting abuse as the main story .
After all , the Associated Press began its first story on the SASC investigation by stating : " Military psychologists were enlisted to help develop more aggressive interrogation methods , including snarling dogs , forced nudity and long periods of standing , against terrorism suspects , according to a Senate investigation . "
Further , SASC Chair Carl Levin described in his opening statement how : " a� senior CIA lawyer , Jonathan Fredman , who was chief counsel to the CIA�s CounterTerrorism Center , went to GTMO , attended a meeting of GTMO staff and discussed a memo proposing the use of aggressive interrogation techniques .
That memo had been drafted by a psychologist and psychiatrist from GTMO who , a couple of weeks earlier , had attended the training given at Fort Bragg by instructors from the JPRA SERE school .
While the memo remains classified , minutes from the meeting where it was discussed are not .
Those minutes ( TAB 7 ) clearly show that the focus of the discussion was aggressive techniques for use against detainees . "
If this esteemed Board member had paid greater attention to these SASC hearings she would have discovered that they revealed the direct involvement of several psychologists in planning Guantanamo torture .
Col. Morgan Banks , who had been appointed a member of the APA�s PENS ( Psychological Ethics and National Security ethics task force ) was described by one of the SASC witnesses as requesting training in " exploitation� of detainees " from the military�s SERE ( Survival , Evasion , resistance , an Escape ) program , which administered torture to US military personnel in case they were captured by a force that doesn�t respect the Geneva Conventions .
But , most chillingly , at the SASC hearings , 63 pages of documents were released , including the minutes of an October 2 , 2002 meeting at Guantanamo to develop torture strategy and techniques .
Psychologist Maj . John Leso , a member of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team , and the psychologist described by Levin in the quote above , attended the meeting .
According to these minutes , the BSCT proposed an approach to detainees based upon the following principles :
What �s more effective than fear based strategies are camp - wide environmental strategies designed to disrupt cohesion and communication among detainees
The environment should foster dependence and compliance Psychological stress = extremely effective ( i.e. , sleep deprivation , withholding food , isolation , loss of time ) �
Disrupting the normal camp operations is vital , We need to create an environment of " controlled chaos " Evidently , according to this esteemed APA Board member , creating an environment of " controlled chaos " designed to " foster dependence and compliance " and utilizing " sleep deprivation , withholding food , isolation , loss of time " constitutes objecting to torture .
I �m sure most who paid attention to the evidence might conclude otherwise .
Unfortunately , to this date the APA has ignored multiple ethics complaints extending back several years against Maj .
Leso based upon his documented participation in the torture of Mohammed al - Qahtani , Guantanamo prisoner 063 .
Perhaps this esteemed colleague , rather than making unsubstantiated claims about supposed anti-torture activities , will push the organization to discipline this military psychologist who is documented to have participated in abuse .
Stephen Soldz is a psychoanalyst , psychologist , public health researcher , and faculty member at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis .
He maintains the Psychoanalysts for Peace and Justice web site and the Psyche , Science , and Society blog .
He is a founder of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology , one of the organizations leading the struggle to change American Psychological Association policy on participation in abusive interrogations .
I just received word from a source of mine that SNK Playmore , the Neo - Geo creator responsible for such classic titles as The King of Fighters and Metal Slug , will soon be closing its doors , at least in the US .
This summer , the company will officially cease direct sale of its games and will instead see distribution duties go to Ignition USA .
In 2001 , the original incarnation of SNK closed as well , with company founder Eikichi Kawasaki investing in a new company known as Playmore .
By 2003 , Playmore had become SNK Playmore , sometimes just referred to by the original name of SNK .
The new distribution plans happened a while back , but it seems like things are a bit more serious .
No word on whether this is just SNKP US or if this affects Japan as well .
What I do know is that a lot of SNKP US people are out of a job .
Well , pretty much everyone from what I know .
We 'll let you know more when we hear it .
[ Update : This was apparently proven false , but all I have to go on is a leaked email from SNKP US president Ben Herman .
I can't do more than talk about what I read , and I have included the exact words after the jump for you to see if there is any other conclusion I might be able to draw from it . ]
SNKP closing again :
Here we go again .
SNK will exit direct sales by year end and plans to distribute new stuff thru Ignition USA .
I will help them close down again but my full time duties end June 30th .
Maybe something changed between now and then , but them 's the president 's words .
Maybe they 're relocating without telling him or something .

It would appear that the recording industry now likes to call any sort of business model it does n't like " piracy . "
At least that 's the only explanation I can come up with in its latest battle , where it has referred to traditional radio as " a form of piracy . "
It 's almost too bizarre to be true , and that 's before we even explain how this involves a ( literal ) can of herring .
It 's difficult to pick a side to cheer for in a dispute between the RIAA and the NAB -- as we 're talking about two organizations with a history of saying the most outrageously incorrect things in misguided attempts to " protect " the industries they represent ( which almost always ends up backfiring and hurting the industry ) .
However , in the latest battle between the two , it seems pretty clear that it's the RIAA that 's being more ridiculous .
This is the latest skirmish in the battle that the RIAA started last year , in trying to get radio stations to pay royalties to musicians .
If you 're not familiar with the details , as it stands now , radio stations have to pay royalties only to songwriters and publishers for the music they play .
The musicians themselves do n't get royalties , with the ( very reasonable ) explanation that having songs on the radio acts as a strong promotion for the musicians .
This explanation is supported by the history of radio , in which " payola " has almost always played a large role .
The record labels have always paid the radio stations to play their bands -- a rather overt admission that radio helps promote new artists .
But with the recording industry confused and struggling to adopt new business models , it wants to force radio stations to pay it , rather than the other way around .
What 's funny is that , normally , it 's the party that has more leverage that gets to demand payment .
Yet , here we have a case where it 's the weakest party demanding paymentit 's so weak .
Despite all those years of payola as proof that radio is a promotional vehicle , the RIAA actually tried to put out a totally bogus study claiming that radio play decreased the demand for recorded music .
Apparently , that was n't convincing enough , so now it 's claiming that radio is actually a " form of piracy .
" To make this even more ridiculous , this group called musicFirst , representing the recording industry , sent the NAB a can of herring ( yes , an actual can of herring ) , a dictionary and some free songs in an attempt to mock the group .
The herring was supposed to suggest that the radio stations ' argument is a " red herring " ( very clever , guys ) .
The dictionary was so that the NAB could supposedly understand the difference between " fees " and " taxes " -- since the NAB refers to the move to get radio stations to pay musicians as a " tax , " while the RIAA would prefer to think of it as a " fee . "
As for the digital songs , they were all mocking titles : " Take the Money and Run " by the Steve Miller Band ; " Pay me My Money Down " by Bruce Springsteen ; " Back In the U.S.S.R " by Paul McCartney and " A Change Would Do You Good " by Sheryl Crow .
Of course , the recording industry is wrong on just about all of this .
The idea that radio is a form of piracy is simply laughable .
We 've already pointed to the industry 's own proof ( payola ) that radio helps promote artists .
As for the definitional difference between fees and taxes , fees are agreed upon between two parties .
A tax is a fee required by the government .
Since the recording industry is asking the government to set this new rule , it would seem that the NAB is correct again that this would represent a tax , rather than a fee .

At a White House press conference on Thursday morning , George W. Bush was a bit too cute when it came to an important matter : the funding of his presidential library .
News reports have noted that the library , to be set up at Southern Methodist University , will cost more than $ 200 million .
The question is , who will pay for it ?
The tabs for presidential libraries are not covered by the taxpayers .
They are picked up by nonprofit foundations , and these foundations have no obligation to disclose their sources of money .
Bill Clinton has refused to say who is funding his library through the William J. Clinton Foundation , though the Washington Post reported that the royal family of Saudi Arabia contributed $ 10 million to the Little Rock facility .
It is troubling when the spouse of a presidential candidate receives millions of dollars secretly from one or more overseas sources .
But what ’s more problematic is the prospect of a sitting president obtaining foreign cash for a pet project and not disclosing it .
( The Saudis reportedly also gave the presidential library of the first President Bush millions of dollars .
After being generous to George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , it ’s unlikely they will stiff the younger Bush )
At the press conference , a reporter asked Bush if he would disclose the contributions received for his presidential library ?
He did n’t say yes .
He replied that “ we ’ll look at the disclosure requirements and make a decision . ”
But there are no disclosure requirements .
So that was a non-answer .
( Coincidentally –or not–Barack Obama has introduced legislation that would compel the disclosure of donations to presidential libraries . )
Bush went on to note that “ some people like to give and do n’t like their names disclosed . ”
That ’s the issue , is n’t it ?
And he added that he would “ probably take some foreign money ” for his library .
These comments raise the possibility that he or his foundation might solicit secret contributions from foreign sources–governments , individuals , corporations –while Bush is in office .
What an easy way for these foreigners to curry favor .
And , of course , the Bush Foundation could hit up American corporations and individuals looking to score points with the White House .
After Bush refused to promise any disclosure , the reporter at the press conference asked , what about the public right to know ?
Bush replied , “ We ’re taking a look … .
Nice try , though . ”
Nice try ?
This is an important matter of transparency and good government , and Bush dismissed the reporter ’s query as merely another attempt at gotcha .
And he smirked .

A late 2007 New York Times editorial urged the arrest of Ahmad Harun , Sudan 's interior minister from 2003 to 2005 , who funded and armed the janjaweed militias that are said to have murdered 200,000 people and driven 2.5 million from their homes .
Harun has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court .
The editorial calls for Harun to be surrendered to The Hague for prosecution .
It stresses that " holding government officials responsible for the genocide in Darfur is crucial ... not only as a weapon of this genocide but as a way to fight the next one . "
Every word in the editorial was true , and the Times is to be commended for calling for justice to be meted out to government officials who instigate , fund , and enable the murders of hundreds of thousands of civilians , and other crimes against humanity .
What I have a problem with is the obvious exception made in the administration of justice when it comes to crimes committed by American government officials .

Estimates of deaths in Iraq as a direct result of the American invasion vary widely , and have been routinely suppressed and creatively spun by the Bush administration .
The lowest estimates are in the area of 85,000 civilian dead , but those estimates only count civilians killed by military violence that are reported by at least two approved international media sources .
The authors of such estimates openly acknowledge that thousands of deaths go unreported in their findings , and also that they do not use any valid scientific method to arrive at their numbers .
The highest credible estimates are over one million Iraqi dead .
That Sept. 2007 study , conducted by ORB , the reputable British polling agency , found that about 1,033,000 more people have died violent deaths in Iraq since coalition forces arrived in March 2003 through August 2007 , than would have died had the invasion not occurred .
The number of Iraqi refugees who have fled to neighboring countries has now reached 2.2 million .
The number of displaced Iraqi citizens driven from their homes to other locations inside Iraq has risen to more than 2 million .
A side - by - side comparison of the alleged crimes of Ahmad Harun and those that can be attributed to Mr. Bush 's invasion of Iraq is very telling : Harun is responsible for 200,000 deaths and 2.5 million displaced citizens .
Bush is responsible for 1,000,000 deaths and 4.2 million refugees .
Uncalculated and untold civilian wounded .
Even if the math is off a bit - hell , even if you cut Bush 's numbers in half - he still beats Harun in total lives ruined .
Joshua Holland of AlterNet points out :
" These numbers suggest that the invasion and occupation of Iraq rivals the great crimes of the last century -- the human toll exceeds the 800,000 to 900,000 believed killed in the Rwandan genocide in 1994 , and is approaching the number ( 1.7 million ) who died in Cambodia 's infamous " Killing Fields " during the Khmer Rouge era of the 1970s . "
On the orders of George W. Bush , hundreds of thousands of small arms and more potent weapons have been distributed to the Iraqi military , police , and even militias , and now we are arming and funding both Shia and Sunni warlords and their gangs , many of whom have until very recently been insurgents fighting and killing American soldiers and Marines .
We are actually paying them not to shoot at us .
And George Bush and John McCain say Obama is the one " negotiating with terrorists . "
General David Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee on last Sept. 11 , that Iraq has already made a $ 1.6 billion arms deal with the U.S. , and has plans to buy $ 1.8 billion more .
A Government Accountability Office report concluded that nearly 200,000 weapons bought by American taxpayers and intended for issue to Iraqi security forces are missing .
It is feared that the infusion of arms will provide the means for a full - scale civil war and unfettered genocide , and that the U.S. may be arming their past and future enemies .
As Salon 's Mark Benjamin reports , weapons proliferation expert William Hartung of the New America Foundation says , " I think this is kind of crazy ...
Now we are making deals with some of these Sunni groups .
Well , what if they turn around and go back to being insurgents after we have built them up ?
I think the danger of these arms being misused , even in the short term , is fairly high . "
After WWII , we tried and convicted many Japanese as war criminals for waterboarding Allied prisoners .
Some of them were executed for their crimes .
Waterboarding was considered by many to be one of the worst forms of torture imaginable .
In the war crimes trial of one Japanese officer , Judge Advocate General , Lt. Col .
Allan Browne said the charge " ... includes the savage and barbarian water treatment and far exceeds in beastiality the ' run of the mine ' brutality established in this case . "
The Japanese officer was sentenced to 22 years at hard labor .
Another Japanese soldier who waterboarded a Filipino Lawyer got life .

One of the things we 're thinking about while building stackoverflow.com is how to let users style the questions and answers they 're entering on the site .
Nothing 's decided at this point , but we definitely wo n't be giving users one of those friendly - but - irritating HTML GUI browser layout controls .
I have one iron - clad design guide : this is a site for programmers , so they should be comfortable with basic markup .
None of that nancy - boy GUI toolbar handholding nonsense for us , thankyouverymuch .
If you can sling code , a little bit of presentation markup is child 's play .
We will support some sort of markup language to style the questions and answers .
But what markup language ?
I mentioned in podcast # 4 that we consider Wikipedia a defining influence .
Let 's see how Wikipedia handles markup syntax .
This is what the edit page for Joel Spolsky 's Wikipedia entry looks like :
It 's an effective markup language , but I think you 'll agree that it 's more intimidating than humane .
Wikipedia 's How to Edit a Page and the accompanying Wikipedia syntax cheatsheet helps .
Some .
I 'd argue that writing a Wikipedia entry is a step beyond mere presentational markup ; it 's almost like coding , as you weave the article into the Wikipedia gestalt .
( Incidentally , if you have n't ever edited a Wikipedia article , you should .
I consider it a rite of passage , a sort of internet merit badge for anyone who is serious about their online presence . )
Let 's consider a simpler example .
What we 're looking for is some kind of middle ground , a humane text format .
Let 's start with some basic HTML .
Lightweight Markup Languages According to Wikipedia :
A lightweight markup language is a markup language with a simple syntax , designed to be easy for a human to enter with a simple text editor , and easy to read in its raw form .
Some examples are : Markdown
Textile
BBCode
Wikipedia Markup should also extend to code : 10 PRINT " I ROCK AT BASIC ! " 20 GOTO 10
Here 's what that looks like expressed in a variety of lightweight markup languages .
Bear in mind that each of these will produce HTML equivalent to the above .

None of these lightweight markup languages are particularly difficult to understand -- and they 're easy on the eyes , as promised .
But I still had to look up the reference syntax for each one and map it to the HTML that I already know by heart .
I also found them disturbingly close to " magic " for some of the formatting rules , to the point that I wished I could just write literal HTML and get exactly what I want without guessing how the parser is going to interpret my fake - plain - text .
Which leads directly to this question : why not just stick with what we already know and use HTML ?
This c2 wiki page titled Why Does n't Wiki Do HTML ?
makes the case that -- at least for Wiki content -- you 're better off leaving HTML behind :
In a Wiki , the emphasis is on content , not presentation .
Simple Wiki markup rules let people focus on expressing their ideas .
Why not use a domain - specific markup language designed to do " the simplest thing that could possibly work " ?
Some HTML tags are difficult to work with and can break the flow of your thoughts .
The table tag , for example .
Does the average user really need total HTML and CSS layout power ?
Allowing the full range of HTML tags can lead to major security vulnerabilities .
Many people do n't know HTML .
A simple Wiki markup language is easier to learn .
I 'm not sure I agree with all of this , but it can make sense in the context of a full - blown Wiki .
It 's worth considering .
After all this research on humane markup languages , much to my chagrin , I 've come full circle .
I now no longer think humane markup languages make sense for most uses .
I agree with the guy at fileformat .
info -- HTML is generally the better choice :
Simplicity
If the source and destination are the web , why not use the native markup language of the web ?
Readability HTML is a bit less readable than the lightweight markup languages , it 's true .
But basic HTML is not onerous to read , particularly if we hide the repetitive paragraph tags .
Security
With a bit of careful coding , it is possible to whitelist specific HTML tags that you will allow .
This way you avoid exposing yourself to risky / vulnerable tags .
Conversion
It 's not at all clear that any existing lightweight markup language has critical mass , with the possible exception of Wikipedia 's flavor .
On the other hand , text parsers and tools will always understand HTML .
What people know A lot more people know HTML than any given flavor of humane text .
If you 're a programmer , you damn well better know HTML .
For the handful of wiki - like functions we may need , it 's possible to add some optional attributes to the HTML tags .
And would n't that be easier to learn than some weird , pseudo - ASCII derivation of HTML ?
I do think we 'll adopt some of the cleverer functions of Textile and Markdown , insofar as they remove mundane HTML markup scutwork .
But in general , I 'd much rather rely on a subset of trusty old HTML than expend brain cells trying to remember the fake - HTML way to make something bold , or create a hyperlink .
HTML is n't perfect , but it's an eminently reasonable humane markup language .
John McCain Withdrawing Troops " Not Too Important " Comment on Today Show ( Video )
Democrats seized an opportunity to attackafter a comment he made saying withdrawing troops from Iraq was " not too important . "
During an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show Wednesday morning McCain was asked if he had a good estimate of when he thought American troops could come home from Iraq .
" No , but that 's not too important , " he said .
" What 's important is the casualties in Iraq .
Americans are in South Korea .
Americans are in Japan .
American troops are in Germany .
That 's all fine .
American casualties , and the ability to withdraw .
We will be able to withdraw .
...
But the key to it is we do n't want any more Americans in harm 's way . " "
McCain supporters say the comment has been distorted and Democratic leaders conveniently ignored the backing context McCain offered that he is more concerned with casualties than length of deployment .
They say there is no one better placed than the former prisoner of war to understand the sacrifices made by American soldiers and military families .
" It is unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs and concerns of Americans and particularly the families of the troops who are over there , " said Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts .
During a week in which the focus has largely been on the U.S. economy , the comment has propelled Iraq and national security credentials back to the forefront of the campaign agenda .

The Novell “ partnership ” with Microsoft has been a hot topic in Linux circles since it was announced a few years ago .
Recently , Novell and Microsoft introduced a joint - marketing site to promote their collaboration .
A few years ago , I had really high hope ’s for Novell ’s forays in to Linux .
However ; bad move after bad move has left me with no confidence in Novell or their Linux products .
I ca n’t say I was shocked to find this work of misinformation touting the “ benefits ” of Novell over Redhat and “ unpaid ” Linux .
Novell has this lovely chart to highlight the benefits of SUSE over “ unpaid ” Linux .
“ Unpaid ” is a complete spin word , sounding like something Karl Rove cooked up in a focus group .
Novell FUD Chart :
With the exception of phone and on - Site support , community based Linux does everything listed in this table .
As someone who was worked with Novell and Redhat in multiple enterprise environments , their phone support offerings are not very good .
On - site support ?
For Linux ?
Why would anyone need a Novell presence on - site ?
Unless you ’re doing a training or consulting engagement ( ie not support , ) their is no need for Novell to come on site .
Online support with community distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian is generally far superior to Novell ’s online support .
Novell ’s Suse forums are a ghost town compared to the Ubuntu community .
Security and system updates via community Linux outclass Novell .
Novell ’s update system via yast is woefully inadequate .
Debian and Ubuntu provide a much better mechanism for updates .
Novell provides a crappy method for patching SLES systems , because they want their big customers to buy Zenworks to handle their Linux infrastructure .
In a nutshell , nearly every point in the Novell vs. “ Unpaid ” section is wrong with the exception of phone and on - site support .
Having dealt with Novell and other commercial distributions in the past , phone support is completely overrated .
Typically , community based distributions offer higher quality support for no cost .
So why buy Novell and Redhat ?
If you are using Linux as the platform for Oracle or some other proprietary product , typically commercial distros are the only route .
Is there any other valid reason ?
Its certainly not for the quality of support .
I guess it boils down to the fact that most IT shops want someone to blame / call when something goes terribly wrong .
" Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together . " more ..
" For those who believe no explanation is necessary .
For those who do not believe , no explanation is possible "
If Barack Obama , the presumed Democratic presidential nominee , is to defeat John McCain , he ’d better get started organizing teams of election law attorneys and other specialists to guard against efforts already underway to disenfranchise Democratic voters .
State laws imposing strict voter identification requirements have proliferated .
They will be used by Republicans in battleground states to challenge low - income voters , usually blacks and Latinos , needed by Obama .
Nonresident college students , another part of the Obama constituency , will probably also be challenged .
This means the election may have to be decided in state courtrooms and by local election boards around the country .
Scenes we remember from Florida ’s 2000 election could be repeated in many places .
Hilary O. Shelton , director of the NAACP ’s Washington Bureau , told a House committee in February that ” …
The NAACP , as well as representatives from almost every other civil and voting rights organization , all report an increase in the number of Americans — primarily racial and ethnic minority Americans — who say they have been denied their constitutional right to register and vote . ”
This is called voter suppression .
Republicans used it with great success in Florida in 2000 and in Ohio four years later .
Those contests , won by President Bush , featured shortages of voting machines in minority areas ; lost , discarded or rejected ballots ; and many challenges to voter eligibility .
In 2004 , the Bush administration added to the mix by demanding prosecution of ACORN , a grassroots group that works to register poor people to vote .
U.S. attorneys who would n’t go along were fired in one of the administration ’s nastier scandals .
This year , Republican voter suppression seems to be taking a new and more sophisticated turn .
Republican - led state legislatures are adopting strict laws requiring voters to present identification at the polls .
In April , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana ’s tough law , which requires government - issued identification , such as a driver ’s license , a passport , or a state or military ID card .
Robert Barnes wrote in The Washington Post , “ The ruling bodes well for other states that require photo ID and for states that are considering doing so . ”
The Web site electionline.org reports that Florida and Georgia , in addition to Indiana , require photo IDs .
In four states , polling officials ask for — but do n’t require — photo IDs .
Eighteen states require either photo or non-photo IDs , and their requirements vary wildly .
It ’s challenging to read just the summaries of these state laws on electionline.org .
Worse yet , most of these laws are administered by partisan state election officers and county officials who may owe their loyalty to some local party or neigborhood political boss — or who may simply be governed by their own prejudices or ignorance .
Professor Richard L. Hasen of Los Angeles ’ Loyola Law School , one of the nation ’s foremost election law scholars , said in a Stanford Law Review article that 33 chief state election officers were chosen in partisan elections .
“ In many ways , save technological improvements in the casting and counting of votes , the situation is worse than it was in 2000 .
Election administration today is more partisan and more contentious than it was before the public had ever heard of ‘ dimpled chads , ’ ” Hasen said .
I asked Hasen what form he thought voter suppression would take in 2008 .
He said he did n’t think we were likely to see a “ mass campaign against minority voters . ”
That , as the U.S. attorneys ’ scandal showed , was the Republican game plan in 2004 .
Rather , he said , there will be “ individual instances ” of voter suppression .
These will take place in countless polling places , be initially judged by local election officials , and then move up to the state chief election officers , mostly partisan , and finally to the courts , often run by political judges .
In other words , political hacks administering incomprehensible laws .
“ The most successful way of keeping minority voting down is [ using ] the law , ” Hasen said .
To counter such moves , he said , candidates needing minority votes , such as Obama , must put field workers and election lawyers into the field to educate voters on the complexities of their local laws .
They must make sure voters have the required ID .
And they must be ready to go to court in an instant when someone spots a dirty trick .
“ These kind of things have to happen now , ” he said .
An area of immediate concern should be the Western battleground states of Colorado , Nevada and New Mexico , with a total of 19 electoral votes .
Latino voter turnout will be important there , and intensive get - out - the - vote efforts by the Obama campaign are planned in Latino communities in those states .
But Antonio Gonzalez , president of the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project , told me that anti-immigrant sentiment may hurt the turnout .
In Colorado , for example , he said that 15 to 20 percent of the Latino community is foreign - born , where once it was 10 percent .
In New Mexico , he said , the foreign - born Latino population has risen from 5 percent a few years ago to 10 to 15 percent today .
Clearly , a combination of Republicans and anti-immigrant activists — sometimes the same people — could put together a strong voter intimidation campaign targeted at Hispanics .
Dirty tricks could be one of this year ’s most important election stories .
So far , it ’s been too complicated and distant for a political media hooked on instant thrills .
Only a few bloggers are on the story , such as New York University media professor Mark Crispin Miller and journalist Brad Friedman .
Loyola Law School ’s Professor Hasen offers an excellent combination of information and analysis .
At this point , what ’s more important than the coverage is that Barack Obama and his staff hustle election specialists to the battleground states .
There ’s not much glory in nosing around a Colorado county courthouse — but that ’s where this election may be decided .
You have to look hard in the scientific literature to find evidence of any age - related changes made worse by the practice of calorie restriction - the only one that springs to mind right now is that progression of ALS is likely to be worsened .
The much more common story is that detrimental change is resisted or attenuated : immune system aging , stem cell decline , heart aging , DNA damage , loss of health , loss of vitality , increase in risk of age - related disease ... all slowed by simply eating less while still obtaining optimal levels of nutrients .
Almost everything studied by reserchers to date shows strong evidence of being made better through calorie restriction as a lifestyle choice .
Now we can add sarcopenia , age - related muscle loss , to this long list .
That is counterintuitive - eating more leading to losing more muscle mass over the years - but then what is straightforward and simple in biology ?
Here 's the abstract at PubMed :
Sarcopenia , the loss of muscle mass with normal aging , devastates quality of life - and related healthcare expenditures are enormous .
The prevention or attenuation of sarcopenia would be an important medical advance .
Dietary restriction ( DR ) is the only dietary intervention that consistently extends median and maximum life span , as well as health span in rodents .
Evidence suggests that DR will have a similar effect in primates .
Furthermore , DR opposes sarcopenia in rodents .
We tested the hypothesis that DR will reduce age - related sarcopenia in a nonhuman primate .
Thirty adult male rhesus monkeys , half fed a normal calorie intake and half reduced by 30 % in caloric intake , were examined over 17 years for changes in [ muscle mass ] .
Body weight - adjusted skeletal muscle mass declined somewhat in both groups but was far more rapid in the control group .
We have shown that moderate , adult - onset DR can attenuate sarcopenia in a nonhuman primate model .
That would seem to shoot down the sarcopenia as dietary issue theory , in which the lower - protein diets of the elderly are supposed to cause problems .
In fact , those diets should be protective , if this calorie restriction connection follows through to humans .
You might also look back at evidence suggesting that sarcopenia stems from one obscure but important biochemical process becoming slowly less efficient , and that leucine supplementation from middle age onwards may reverse this growing inefficiency .
For my money , in advance of further research , I suspect that the stem cell connection is the easy answer .
If calorie restriction slows the decline in stem cell activity , then the normal ongoing turnover in muscle tissue should be more readily maintained .
We shall see what the real answer is in due course , but practicing calorie restriction in the meantime is still the smart thing to do .
Buoyed by enthusiasm among Democrats and public concern over the economy , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) has taken a sizable lead over Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) at the opening of the general election campaign for president , a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
In a two - man race between the major - party candidates , registered voters chose Obama over McCain by 49 % to 37 % in the national poll , conducted Thursday through Monday .
On a four - man ballot that included independent candidate Ralph Nader and Libertarian Bob Barr , voters chose Obama over McCain by 48 % to 33 % .
Obama ’s lead -- bigger in this poll than in most other national surveys -- appears to stem largely from his positions on domestic issues .
Both Democrats and independent voters said Obama would do a better job than McCain at handling the nation ’s economic problems , the public ’s top concern .
Advertisement
In contrast , many voters said McCain was the more experienced candidate and better equipped to protect the nation against terrorism -- but they ranked those concerns below economic issues .
McCain suffers from a pronounced “ passion gap , ” especially among conservatives who usually give Republican candidates a reliable base of support .
Among voters who described themselves as conservative , 58 % said they would vote for McCain ; 15 % said they would vote for Obama , 14 % said they would vote for someone else , and 13 % said they were undecided .
By contrast , 79 % of voters who described themselves as liberal said they planned to vote for Obama .
“ I ’m a Republican . . . but I do n’t like some of the things McCain voted for in the Senate , especially immigration , ” said poll respondent Mary Dasen , 77 , a retired United Way manager in Oscoda , Mich. , who said she was undecided .
“ There ’s a big chance I might stay home and not vote . ”
Even among voters who said they planned to vote for McCain , more than half said they were “ not enthusiastic ” about their chosen candidate ; 45 % said they were enthusiastic .
By contrast , 81 % of Obama voters said they were enthusiastic , and almost half called themselves “ very enthusiastic , ” a level of zeal found in 13 % of McCain ’s supporters .

“ McCain is not capturing the full extent of the conservative base the way President Bush did in 2000 and 2004 , ” said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus .
“ Among conservatives , evangelicals and voters who identify themselves as part of the religious right , he is polling less than 60 % .
“ Meanwhile , Obama is doing well among a broad range of voters .
He ’s running ahead among women , black voters and other minorities .
He ’s running roughly even among white voters and independents . ”
Among white voters , Obama and McCain are each at 39 % , the poll found .
Earlier this year , when Obama ran behind Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) among whites in some primary elections , analysts questioned whether the African American senator could win white voters in the general election .
But the great majority of Clinton voters have transferred their allegiance to Obama , the poll found , with 11 % of Clinton voters defecting to McCain .

Both Nader -- a consumer advocate who was the Green Party candidate in 2000 and an independent candidate in 2004 -- and former Rep. Barr ( R - Ga. ) appear to siphon more votes from McCain than from Obama .
When Nader and Barr are added to the ballot , they draw most of their support from independent voters who said they would otherwise vote for the Republican .
Nader was the choice of 4 % of respondents , Barr of 3 % .
Nader is seeking to place his name on the ballot as an independent in at least 45 states and so far has succeeded in four .
Barr ’s Libertarian Party is on the ballot in 30 states and is working on the remaining 20 .
Obama ’s strong showing seems to stem from a general trend of increased support for Democratic candidates and Democratic positions after almost eight years of an increasingly unpopular Republican administration .
In this national poll ’s random sample of voters , 39 % identified themselves as Democrats , 22 % as Republicans and 27 % as independents .
In a similar poll a year ago , 33 % identified themselves as Democrats , 28 % as Republicans and 30 % as independents .

Such numbers often ebb and flow with the popularity of each political party .
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , when Bush ’s popularity soared , the number of voters who described themselves as Republicans rose too .
During the last three years , as his popularity slumped , the number who identify themselves as Republicans also dropped .
The survey found public approval of the president ’s job performance at a new low for a Times / Bloomberg poll : 23 % , compared with 73 % disapproval .
Fifty - one percent of voters said they had a “ positive feeling ” about the Democratic Party ; 29 % said that of the Republican Party .
“ It appears to be a Democratic year , ” Pinkus said .
“ This election is the Democrats ’ to lose . ”

On domestic issues , voters preferred Obama ’s healthcare proposals to McCain ’s by a margin of almost 30 percentage points : 53 % to 26 % .
They also preferred Obama ’s proposals on taxes , 45 % to 31 % , and on relief for homeowners facing foreclosure , 44 % to 32 % .
But voters considered McCain better equipped to protect the country from terrorism , 49 % to 32 % .
And though 68 % favored withdrawing troops from Iraq within the next year or even sooner , a position close to Obama ’s , many were not sure Obama was the right candidate to lead that effort .
When asked which candidate would be best at handling the war in Iraq , voters split about evenly : 44 % named McCain and 42 % named Obama .
That result reflected persistent doubts among many voters as to whether Obama is sufficiently experienced to be president .
Voters split about evenly on that question too , with 46 % agreeing that Obama is “ too naive and inexperienced for the job ” and 50 % disagreeing .
Among independents , 54 % said Obama was too inexperienced -- a potential vulnerability for him .

McCain , by contrast , was seen as better prepared for the presidency .
Asked which candidate has the right experience for the White House , 47 % picked McCain , 27 % Obama .
The Times / Bloomberg poll , conducted under Pinkus ’ supervision , interviewed 1,115 registered voters .
Its margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Orgasme en direct dans un train des chemins de fer hollandais
AMSTERDAM
Étonnement à bord d'un train qui effectuait il y a quelques jours la liaison entre les villes de Zwolle et Leeuwarden , aux Pays - Bas .
Les voyageurs ont été surpris par le message pour le moins érotique diffusé dans les haut - parleurs .
La conductrice du véhicule , en pleine séance de masturbation , avait oublié de débrancher son micro .
Du coup , par haut - parleurs interposés , les voyageurs ont pu assister en direct à l'orgasme de la cheminot .
Un pur moment de bonheur et de fous rires .
Tous n'ont pu en croire leurs oreilles .
La minute trente qu'a duré la séance aura en tous les cas pu être partagée avec le plus grand nombre puisqu'un passager un peu voyeur a eu l'indécence - le vilain !
- de filmer l'instant et de le poster sur le plus célèbre des sites d'échanges de vidéos , Youtube .
À toute vapeur !

Those wacky porn stars ... is there anything they wo n't do ?
Well yes , actually .
Though some adult performers are up for anything , others shy away from things like double anal or even interracial scenes ( to say nothing of the more hardcore dirtpipe milkshake ) .
But of the many things that make up the standard porn arsenal , which acts are commonplace and which are , uh , harder to come by ?
Based on the listings on one adult talent agency 's website , an enterprising blogger has done a bit of research ... and the answers may surprise you .
Out of just over 900 porn stars , how many would participate in a solo shoot ?
Boy / girl ?
Double vaginal ?
Actual acting ?
Answers ( with some helpful photo illustrations ) after the jump .

The disparity in media coverage between Rev. Jeremiah Wright and John McCain 's multiple pastor scandals has been widely documented .
McCain 's Media has done a splendid job of running cover for their candidate while hammering away at Obama -- but according to Morning Joe 's Mika Brzezinski , that 's all hogwash and how DARE anyone suggest otherwise ?
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
During this morning 's show , while talking about Senator Obama 's decision to resign from his church , they read a viewer 's e-mail complaining of MSNBC 's obsession with his church while barely giving lip service to McCain 's pastor problems .
Mika was none too happy with the viewer 's astute observations and shot back with one of the biggest , bald faced lies I 've heard in quite some time :
" Okay , umm ... first of all , I think we covered the Hagee story as much , umm ... the Reverend Wright situation injected itself into the news cycle for sure , but having said that , do n't you think that there is a difference or is there not , especially given the fact that he resigned from his church . "
To say that MSNBC and Morning Joe covered the Pastor Hagee story as much as the Rev Wright story is laughable and an outright lie .
Joe Scarborough ran wall to wall with with the Wright story for weeks on end , constantly chastising Senator Obama and obsessed over the church and the issue of race -- usually only stopping for headlines and weather in between .
Mika was right in the middle of all this coverage , she should know better than to say something so ignorant and easily debunked .
Contact MSNBC and demand a retraction .
Update : I thought it only fair to MSNBC that I acknowledge Keith Olbermann 's extensive coverage of not only John Hagee , but McCain 's other controversial religious endorsements as well as his pandering to the likes of Rev Jerry Falwell .
Dining Here is Always a ‘ Crappy ’ Experience
Wang Tzi -wei is the owner of a chain of twelve theme based restaurants in Taiwan .
Now theme based restaurants are nothing new .
Hard Rock Cafes have made a fortune for their owners with theme based restaurants .
The theme Wang Tzi - wei chose is just a trifle out of the ordinary , in fact one might say a bit bizarre .
His choice , which was an idea he got from a popular Japanese cartoon , was a toilet .
In fact his restaurants are actually named “ Modern Toilet ”  .
Patrons sit on toilets for seats and eat food off covered sinks and bathtubs .
The food is served in a mini - toilet bowls and patrons drink out of mini travel potties .
To finish the atmosphere , toilet paper is provided in the place of napkins .
Teens and young adults are the targeted customers , but quite a few older customers try it out at least once , just for the novelty .
Reactions are mixed , although most comments are positive .
“ It ’s really unusual , so special that it does n’t gross me out , ” said Betty Tsai , 16 , a Taipei high school sophomore trying Modern Toilet for the first time on a friend ’s recommendation .
But for a few customers , the toilet humor is too much .
“ My son thought it was disgusting and did n’t know if he could finish his food , ” said Taipei mother Lin Li-ju .
It makes me wonder , if all the toilets are on the restaurant floor , what fixtures are in the bathrooms ?

More than 500 women and children have left the sect 's compound Investigators searching the temple of a polygamist sect in Texas found a bed used by men to have sex with their under-age " wives " , court papers reveal .
Girls as young as 13 were " spiritually married " to older husbands in the sect , investigators say , in a cycle of abuse .
More than 400 children and 130 women have been removed from the compound since it was raided on 3 April .
The sect 's lawyers had sought to limit a search but have agreed temple records can be scrutinised under supervision .
A representative of the sect will be appointed to vet documents , computer files and family Bibles for records that should not be used as evidence for legal or religious reasons , the Associated Press reports .
The compound belongs to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) , a breakaway branch of Mormonism .
Locked vaults
According to court papers released on Wednesday , the temple in the compound " contains an area where there is a bed where males over the age of 17 engage in sexual activity with female children under the age of 17 " .
Troopers raided the FLDS compound after a girl called authorities
The bed had disturbed linen and what appeared to be a female hair , according to an affidavit signed by a Texas Ranger .
Investigators also found " multiple locked safes , locked desk drawers , locked vaults , as well as multiple computers and beds " , the court papers said .
The search has turned up documents mentioning a 16 - year - old girl who had four children and a man living at the site who has 20 " wives " .
State troopers have also now completed a week - long search of the 1,700 - acre grounds of the compound in Schleicher County .
Texan authorities currently have legal custody of 416 children , all of them believed to have been living at the ranch .
They were taken to Fort Concho , an old frontier fort .
State troopers and officials moved in last week after a teenage girl phoned a domestic violence centre to say she had been abused at the 1,700 - acre Yearn for Zion ( YFZ ) ranch .
In court documents released on Tuesday , investigators alleged a cycle of sexual and physical abuse of children by older men within the sect .
Jailed ' prophet '
The sprawling ranch is located about 160 miles ( 260 km ) north - west of the Texan city of San Antonio and includes large housing units , a medical facility and a temple .
Warren Jeffs has led the breakaway Mormon sect since 2002
It has been under surveillance by the authorities since it was bought by the FLDS five years ago .
The sect 's prophet is Warren Jeffs , a self - confessed polygamist who was jailed in Utah last year for being an accomplice to the rape of a 14 - year - old girl who married her cousin .
The self - proclaimed prophet is currently awaiting trial in Arizona on separate charges of being an accomplice to four counts of incest and sexual conduct with a minor stemming from two arranged marriages .
His 10,000 - strong sect , which dominates the towns of Colorado City in Arizona , and Hildale , Utah , split from the mainstream Mormon church more than a century ago .
Members believe a man must marry at least three wives in order to ascend to heaven .
Women are taught that their path to heaven depends on being subservient to their husband .
Polygamy is illegal in the US .

Not a lot of information on this incident so far ... only found the following on Wikipedia :
" In the morning of may 13th , 2008 a fire started on the seventh floor of the faculty of architecture .
The fire quickly spread out to the entire building .
No persons were hurt in the fire .
The damage to the building is extensive .
As the building is still burning at the time of writing the total damage is not certain yet .
A total loss of the faculty building is considered very likely .
" The collapse may not have happened yet at the time the above was written .
Last American nuclear bombs leave Britain after half a century of protest
America has withdrawn the last of its nuclear weapons from military bases in Britain , it was claimed yesterday .
The remaining 110 freefall nuclear bombs are understood to have been removed from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk on President George Bush 's orders .
News of the apparent withdrawal emerged in a report by the Federation of American Scientists , a group set up in the Cold War by U.S. physicists .
Controversy :
The removal of U.S. bombs from RAF Lakenheath brings protests like this to an end
But author Hans Kristensen , a leading expert on the U.S. nuclear arsenal , said it was unclear exactly when the last bombs were removed from Lakenheath .
All movements of such weapons are shrouded in secrecy and the Pentagon has long adopted a policy of refusing to ' confirm or deny ' the presence of nuclear warheads at any of its bases around the world .
But a U.S. Air Force document dated January last year , setting out details of safety inspections at American military nuclear sits , lets slip that a series of emergency drills are ' not applicable to Lakenheath . '
The last remaining weapons at Lakenheath are reported to have been relatively primitive B - 61 freefall bombs , designed in the 1960s to be dropped from long - range bombers onto targets into the Soviet Union .
Mr Kristensen said the presence of such bombs in Britain was ' not very relevant any more ' , with America focusing its nuclear presence in southern Europe - particularly at Aviano in Italy and Incirlik in Turkey .
American warheads were withdrawn from Greece in 2001 , he said , and the trend undermined the case for continuing to keep an estimated 250 U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe - which analysts believe now fulfil more of a political than a military role , in maintaining America 's close ties with its European Nato allies .
America 's silence over the withdrawal was ' puzzling ' , Mr Kristensen added , as the news could help reassure Russia and achieve matching cuts in its own nuclear stockpile .
America first based its nuclear weapons in Britain in 1954 , and at one stage had hundreds of warheads stored at UK bases .
The arrival of 160 nuclear - tipped cruise missiles at Greenham Common and Molesworth in the early 1980s sparked huge protests , which continued at each site for years - even long after the weapons were withdrawn from Britain under the terms of an arms reduction treaty with the USSR .
Britain's own remaining nuclear deterrent has for the last 10 years been limited to the Trident missiles carried by four Vanguard class Royal Navy submarines based at Faslane , near Glasgow .
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament welcomed the report yesterday , but warned against replacing American warheads with interceptor missiles as part of America 's fiercely controversial missile defence network .
Chairwoman Kate Hudson said : ' We would like official confirmation from the government that this has happened and believe an open admission will be a confidence - boosting measure for future disarmament initiatives .
' However , withdrawal of the tactical nuclear weapons from Lakenheath should not now give way to the installation of interceptor missiles for the US Missile Defence system - a proposal Tony Blair put to the U.S. last February .
' To withdraw the Cold War weapons but still pursue U.S. Missile Defence would replace one historical arms race with another , with Europe again at the centre . '
Are You Scheduled for Political - Termination ?
HR 1955 & S.1959 by Ross Stone
Monday Dec 24th , 2007 4:48 PM
Stop the “ The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act . "
Could be used by Government to add thousands of activist organizations and millions of Americans to no travel lists .
Starting February 2008 , U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) will put into effect “ Advance Passenger Information System ( APIS ) . ” U.S. Citizens will need permission from the United States Government to travel on air and sea vessels from or through the U.S.
That includes foreign visitors .
The Nazis in 1933 invoked similar cross border travel measures against Germans Citizens who tried to leave the country .
Unlike America , Germany was n't building a huge fence on its border that could contain its Citizens .
Subsequently Nazi police started checking Citizens ' ID Cards when traveling on local bus and passenger trains .
Police selectively targeted known political and labor activists , and persons of interest .
The police delighted in stopping targeted persons from traveling to work so they would lose their employment .
The Gestapo referred to this as the " Do n't Live List . "
Beginning February 8 , 2008 , U.S. Government 's issuance of " right to travel passes " will mirror Nazi ' travel - restrictions if the United States is allowed to stop U.S. Citizens using air and sea travel without evidence they committed a crime .
Perhaps by coincidence , Rep. Jane Harman ’s current bill HR1955 “ The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " and S.1959 would create a “ new government commission ” with the power to determine which Americans and Organizations are " ideologically based toward violence " , promote or support " Violent Radicalization or Homegrown Terrorism . ”
Several vague provisions in HR 1955 and S.1959 such as “ facilitate ” could be used by Government to add thousands of activist organizations and millions of Americans to no travel lists .
Anyone attending a " planned anti war rally " or environmental meeting could under these two bills be alleged as “ facilitators ” to promote violence or planing to coerce a government and its people .
Joining or contributing money to an organization that is subsequently deemed by the “ new government commission ” as " ideologically based toward violence " might get a lawful Citizen on a corporate or government no hire black list .
How the Nazis expanded its “ Do n’t Live List . ”
After thousands of Germans were prohibited from leaving Germany , the Nazi Government ordered landlords not to harbor or rent to Jews , anyone the Nazis said were on their black list .
Soon targeted citizens and several ethic groups had no employment , no place to live except the street .
Displaced and starving these citizens were easily arrested for loitering and under broad provisions of “ 1933 German Discriminatory Decrees ” that are too similar to provisions found in the Patriot Act .
Evaluating the Cleanliness of Solar Photovoltaics Can Be Complicated
June 19th , 2008 by Rod Adams
I am a frustrating individual who likes to delve deeply into decision making computations and hates easy answers that sound like sales pitches .
One of the best compliments I ever received came from one of my division officers when I was serving as the Engineer Officer on a submarine – he told me “ Eng , you ask hard questions . ”
As vocal advocate for nuclear fission power I recognize that it has many associated questions , but I after 30 years of study , I have determined to my own satisfaction that most of the important questions have reasonably good answers .
In contrast , I have not yet found reasonable answers for many of my questions related to other renewable energy sources .
( Yes , I – perhaps controversially – classify fission as renewable , but that is a discussion for a different post . )
Solar photovoltaic ( PV ) cells are a popular and often discussed ( see , for example Atlantic City Convention Center Plans Largest Solar Roof in U.S. , 10 % of U.S. Electricity From Solar by 2025 , SF Passes Largest City Solar Program in U.S. ( Finally ) , all of which were published within the past week ) form of “ renewable ” or “ green ” energy , but a casual scratching of the surface knowledge that many people have about the technology reveals some troubling details .
Not only are the panels expensive sources of electricity , but they do not last as long as advertised , they do not provide as much energy as the nameplate capacity implies , they consume significant quantities of energy in their production , installation and transportation , and they often use some very nasty materials in their manufacturing process .
The longevity of a solar panel will vary greatly depending on where it is installed , but any customer should remember that they are buying a product that will inherently need to spend as much time as possible fully exposed to the sun and weather .
Though there are no visibly moving parts in a solar PV panel , there are many parts of the system where continuous chemical and physical reactions take place that can eventually lead to system degradation and failure .
Take a good look at panels that have been installed for several years and you will notice discontinuities and shiny areas where the components have been damaged and where the power production is reduced .
If you have any panels , might want keep a record of the current production so that you can see this effect – or perhaps you will not want to find out just how fast that long term investment is decaying .
The literature accompanying most solar panels provide customers with numbers related to their peak capacity – what I call “ noon on a clear day at the Equator ” .
That quantity of power is only available when the sun is directly overhead , when the panel is perfectly clean and when there are no clouds shading the cells .
The cleaning part is important , any panel owner that wants maximum performance needs to set up a routine for cleaning and clearing the panels of any debris .
Leaves and snow are particular nuisances for rooftop solar panels , but sand and bird droppings can be important in some areas as well .
Not that the article was specifically discussing PV panels , but I recently read about the 4,000 gallon water tanker trucks that are part of the maintenance equipment at some desert solar power plants .
Some of the most energy efficient solar panels , in terms of both the energy required to produce the panel and the panel operating efficiency are made of a semiconductor material called CdTe ( Cadmium Telluride ) .
Companies that make CdTe cells like to brag about the quality of their products , but they have also recently had to warn their investors that they may not be able to sell their panels in the EU for much longer because of rules about using toxic heavy metals in electronics .
What they have not made clear yet is what their long term liability is for the panels that they have already sold .
What will happen in 5 , 10 or 20 years when the panel output is no longer useful and the materials need disposal ?
Can they be recycled without releasing the heavy metals ?
Will their customers be able to return the panels to the original producer ?
Will they make the effort or simply take the systems to the dump like many consumers do with batteries made of similar materials ?
( Those are the kinds of questions that my former division officer was talking about . )
There are definitely answers to some of the questions that I have about solar PV , but that does not mean that the issues are fully solved .
If you are in the market for solar PV systems , please ask the hard questions and realize that anyone who wants you to buy the systems without good answers is just a salesman who is not much different from any other salesman .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Pauline Pierce was friends with Aleister Crowley , maybe more than friends .
Pauline had a reputation of being a bit on the wild - side in the 20's .
It 's been reported that she and Aleister were in France together around September / October of 1924 .
Upon return to America and her boyfriend here , Pauline gave birth to Barbara Pierce .
Fearing retaliation from James I , the Pierces changed their name from Percy to hide from their involvement in the " Gun Powder Plot " of 1605 , starring Thomas Percy , Robert Catesby , and , of course , Guy Fawkes , the fall guy .
We actually get the word , guy , from Guy Fawkes .
He was also known as Guido , but I digress .
The " Gun Powder Plot " was designed to make James I of Biblical fame , harsher on the Catholics , for he was the target of all that gun powder .
With a few plot twists , Lord Robert Cecil , the Earl of Salisbury and Venetian Intelligence , councilor to James , informed him of the plot .
Cecil was behind the plot .
Guy Fawkes took the fall .
He was the Timothy Mc Veigh of his time .
For those of you that believe it would make an impact to dress as this patsy , it would do better to use your own imagination rather than that provided by the magician 's wand .
Even now , few understand that plot :
Guy was no fox but a dupe ensnared by the chief minister himself in a madcap scheme to blow up King and Parliament .
The real plot was royally successful : to invent a pretext for war with Spain .
This fraud was the foundation of the British Empire .
Fawkes was discovered and arrested during a raid on the cellar in the early morning of 5 November .
Catesby and Percy were cut down in the process and killed on the spot .
Guy was immediately taken to the Tower of London and tortured over the next few days , after special permission to do so had been granted by the King .
On 31 January , Fawkes , and a number of others implicated in the conspiracy , were tried in Westminster Hall , and after being found guilty , were taken to Old Palace Yard in Westminster and St. Paul 's Yard , where they were hanged , drawn , and quartered .
Fawkes cheated this fate in a way : though weakened by torture , he jumped from the gallows and snapped his neck rather than being hanged until almost dead .
Quite simply , all the fireworks are to celebrate the torture and execution of Mr. Fawkes , who , along with several other Catholics , conspired to blow up Parliamentor did they ?
It seems that the " gun powder " was corn powder and would not have exploded .
The " Hidden Hand " was behind the works and the Wizard of Oz is Lord Robert Cecil , the Earl of Salisbury and Venetian Intelligence .
Venice needed England to war with Spain to keep the money rolling in .
They were the CIA of their day .
So why did I start this with Pauline Pierce , you ask ?
Pauline Pierce , after sexcapades with Aleister Crowley , gave birth to Barbara Pierce who became Barbara Bush , who gave birth to none other than , George VV Bush , Aleister 's grand - son .
Barbara Pierce is a descendant of President Franklin Pierce , Sr ( not a Freemason ) , who is a descendant of Thomas Percy who tried to blow up the Parliament and King James I. Franklin Pierce lost favor over wanting to keep slavery alive and was replaced by James Buchanan ( Freemason ) who is a descendant of James I and both James are accused of being homosexual .
You could n't make this stuff up !
And what revelation does this tale of V portend ?
These vilest of villians will get you to do their dirty work and kill you in the end for the vacuous endeavor of making slaves of men .
Or Is She ?

前に 欲しいと書いた API のユーザビリティテスト .
実際にやってみたぜという話を読んだ .
" The Factory Pattern in API Design : A Usability Evaluation ( PDF ) " という記事がそれ .
俎上に載ったのは factory パターン .
素のコンストラクタとどちらが使いやすいかを比べてみたという.
そんなの , Factory が腐ってるだなん て Joel ...じゃなくて Joel の読者も言っている .
実際この調査でも " factory は使いにくい " という思ったとおりの結論 .
面白さはユーザビリティテストをした事実そのものにある.
調査では 12 人の被験者をあつめ , 5 つの課題をこなしてもらう .
コードはぜんぶ Java .
課 題1 : メールを送信する .
ライブラリを使ってこんな風に書けたらいいなと思うコードを notepad で書いてもらう .
正解はない .
課 題2 : 出題者の用意したライブラリを使って実際にメール送信のコードを書く.
これ以降は Eclipse をつかう .
課 題3 : 意味をもたないふたつのクラス , Thingy と Squark をインスタンス化し , 所定のメソッドを呼び出す .
課 題4 : GUI レイアウトライブラリのバグ修正 .
Mac 上でも Windows 標準のレイアウトとをしてしまうバグをなおす .
課 題5 : SSLSocket および MulticastSocket を使った通信をおこなう .
課題に登場するクラスは一方が factory パターンに従い , 他方は public なコンストラクタを持つ .
結果は , 4 以外すべてのタスクでコンストラクタを使ったクラスが好成績を収めたという.
バグ修正を行う 4 だけ factory が勝ったのは興味深い .
( ただし僅差 . )
同じ研究チームは , " 引数なしコンストラクタ + パラメタのアクセサ " と " 引数のあるコンストラクタ " も対決させている .
そっちは引数なしコンストラクタが勝利.
( " Usability Implications of Requiring Parameters in Objects ' Constructors ( PDF ) " )
Microsoft による実 践
アカデミックだけではなく , 現実の API 設計でこうした調査を用いる組織もある .
みんな大好き Microsoft は , .NET API の開発にあたりユーザビリティのテストを行ったという .
( " Measuring API Usability " ) 実際の調査の様子は Channel9 にビデオ がある .
被験者が API を探す様子をみながら , " あーそっちじゃなくて , Activities プロパティだよー " と壁の裏でわめいたり , ウェブをぐぐる被験者をみて " そういえば答えに近い話を blog に書いちゃったなあ " とぼやいたり , 観察している開発者の様子もなかなか面白い .
記事の著者 Steven Clarke は blog も書いており , API ユーザビリティについて詳しい解説をしている .
最近更新がないのは残念だけど , 思わず通読してしまった .
ユーザビリティテスト実施 HOWTO のシリーズまである .
( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )
Cognitive Dimensions
MS における API ユーザビリティを支えるのは " Cognitive Dimensions " ( CD ) という アイデアらしい .
CD はユーザビリティや HCI の分野で 90 年代に生まれた .
数値的なメトリクスを必要とする専門家むけのツールではなく , 在野の職業人が使うことを意識した定性的な枠組みだという.
CD では直交する 12 の評価基準 ( dimension ) を定義する .
ユーザビリティの実験結果やトレードオフを議論するとき , どの軸に焦点を合わせているのかを意識しましょう , そうすれば議論が発散しませんよ , というのが CD のおおまかな主張である( と私は理解した ) .
チュートリア ル( PDF ) によればこんな評価軸がある :
粘 度( Viscosity ) : 変更にかかる手数など
隠れた依存 ( Hidden Dependency )
早計な決断 , 先読みの強 要( Premature Commitment and Enforced Lookahead )
抽象 , 抽象不足 , 抽象難 ( Absractions , Abstraction Hunger , Abstraction Barrier )
補助記法 ( Secondary Notaion ) : 挙動に影響しない補助的な情報 : インデントやコメントなど
可視性 , 比較 性( Visibility & Juxtaposability )
対応づけの近さ ( Closseness of Mapping )
一貫性( Consistency )
冗長 さ( Diffuseness )
エラー傾 向( Error-proneness )
精神的な負荷 ( Hard mental operations )
累進的評価 ( Progressive evaluation ) : 作りかけの状態で動かせるかなど
暫定可能性 ( Provisionality )
役割のあらわれ ( Role- expressiveness ) : 見ればわかる度
また , タスクの種類を 4 つに分類してい る
追加 ( incrementation )
変換 ( transcription ) : 紙のデータを入力するとか
変更 ( modification )
探索的設計 ( exploratory design )
この分類にしたがい , どの種の作業ではどの評価軸の影響が大きいか , どちらに倒すべきか .
どんなトレードオフが可能かを考えていく.
チュートリアルの中では , 軸ごとに代表的な workaround をいくつか紹介している .
見ればわかるように , CD の評価軸は特段 definitive というわけでもない .
だいたいほんとに直交しているのかも怪しい.
実際 , Microsoft は上の軸のいくつかを排し , かわりに独自の軸を加えている ( 詳しく は( Clarke の 連載 参照 . ) :
学習の様式 ( Learning style ) : トップダウンかボトムアップか
作業フレームワーク ( Working framework ) : 局所性の程度
作業の単 位 ( Work step unit ) : 実作業とコードの対応づけ
透過性 ( Penetrability ) : 裏の実装をどれだけ隠しているか
精巧さ ( API elaboration ) : どれだけ凝ったつくりか
分野との対応 ( Domain correspondence ) : 作業分野とコードがどのくらい対応しているか.
( Closseness of Mapping 相当. )
また , タスクを分類するかわりに ユーザ種別を分類している .
ペルソナみたいなもんね .
Systematic Programmer : 厳格なスタイルでコードを書く .
環境への前提はもたず , まずは試す .
コード量が増えたり理解に時間がかかっても全部いじれるのを好む.
Pragmatic Programmer : 上ほど厳格ではない .
生産性と自由度の引き換えには前向き.
必要に応じて詳しく調べるが , そういうのが好きというわけでもない.
Opportunistic Programmer : 自由度より生産性重視 .
IDE やサードパーティのライブラリを使って本業に集中したい .
タスクでなくユーザを分類するのは , 同じタスクでもペルソナによってアプローチが異なるからだという.
異なるペルソナには異なる抽象を用意すべきだ.
Clarke はそう主張している .
" good language design boils down to assembling a team of people who have good taste " という Anders Hejlsberg の 発言 にも , 彼は同様の理由で 異議をとなえる .
C# チームと違う taste をもつ顧客が相手だったらどうするのと .
ユーザビリティという最適化
Clarke のいうように , ユーザに合わせた抽象が開発者にとって都合の良い抽象とは限らない.
ユーザは API にユーザビリティの高い抽象を求める .
開発者は他の品質 , たとえば保守性を大事にしたい .
ギャップを埋める代表的な方法は , 開発者の抽象をラップしてユーザ向けの抽象をつくることだ.
けれどラップには冗長性が伴う. 気に入らない .
ただ少し考えると , このトレードオフは馴染みのあるものだと気付く .
たとえば高速化に使うキャッシュは冗長だし , データベースの非正規化も冗長だ. このとき開発者は性能のために冗長性を受けいれている.
素朴な方法では実現できない目的のためにプログラマが苦労するのは , 気が進まないにせよ必要なこと. ユーザビリティの改善は広い意味で最適化のひとつだと言える.
実行速度ではなく利用者の作業速度を高速化するわけ.
さて , ここでダイクストラの警句を思いだそう : " 諸悪の根源は最適化である . " そして , 誰もが口にする言葉 : " 計測せよ . "
これは API のユーザビリティにもあてはある .
根拠もなく内部の抽象を覆い隠すべきではない.
ユーザのためを思い , 開発者が内部で使う抽象とは別の API を用意しても , それは単なるお節介かもしれない .
計測なしに効果を知ることはできない .
もちろんこれは粗雑な設計をそのままにすべきだという話じゃないし , どうせわからないなら身勝手なコードを書こうという話でもない.
premature optimization が悪であるように , premature pessimization もまた忌むべきものだ .
トレードオフがないなら , あるいは僅かなコストで実現できるなら , 一般に " 良い " とされる API 設計には従うのが良心だとおもう .
いずれにせよ , 良い評価方法だけがあっても片手落ちだ .
ユーザビリティテストは開発者が設計をさぼる口実にはならない.
より良い設計を生み出す責任は開発者に残されている.
一本道の傍ら で
実際のところ , ユーザビリティの評価には手間がかかる .
API のユーザビリティ評価は GUI アプリケーションのそれよりは手間だという .
コードを書くのはアプリケーションの操作より時間がかかるからだ.
Microsoft のように数千数万の開発者に使われる API の評価は割があうだろうが , どの規模のユーザを相手にすれば元がとれるのかは自明でない.
多くの API はこの先も開発者の " taste " と伝承に従い続けるのだろう .
それでも , こう期待せずにはおれない : ペーパプロトタイピングにあたる手軽な評価手法が , API の評価にもないだろうか .
たとえば , お昼休みに印刷した javadoc を配ってクイズに答えてもらうのは？ あるいはより今時な野心をもって , 集合知な評価はできないか ?

Ingenious hack to enable those cheap tiny keychain digital picture frame to display videos from your desktop
Jeroen Domburg provides instructions on how to hack those ubiquitous keychain digital picture frames so that it can stream video from a desktop ( unfortunately , only for the Linux / Mac ? at this point )
Jeroen provides a detailed analysis of the internals of the digital picture frame , and the steps he took to be able to stream a video from his cpu to the device .
Other individuals have developed their own apps to display cool widgets on the lcd such as integration into flickr to display images from the Internet and lcd4linux , which make the lcd a mini console .
He also provides a download ( tgz ) for the software necessary to modify the firmware of the digital picture frame to enable this awesome hack .
Heres a youtube video of a video stream to the device :
Original Site Here : http://spritesmods.com/?art=picframe&page=1
He has also setup a wiki here : http://picframe.spritesserver.nl/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
This is an awesome hack , as it could be possible to enable these cheap digital picture frames to act as a secondary monitor that can display widgets such as IM notifications , twitter , rss feeds , CPU and memory utilization , photshop tool details , stock feeds , email notifications , mrtg graphs , system monitoring notifications etc !
Apparently this Digital Picture Frame from Amazon or this one from dealextreme works with the mod / hack .
Here is a complete list of compatible devices

The Guinness book of World Records is yet to verify the record
A 100ft tower made out of Lego bricks will be verified as an official world record , organisers hope .
Thousands of children and their families used almost 500,000 bricks to build the structure at the Legoland theme park in Windsor , Berkshire .
The tower is designed to resemble a Viking longboat mast to mark the opening of the new Land of the Vikings .
It is yet to officially verified , but the next biggest Lego tower is just over 96ft built in Toronto last August .
The Viking mast tower was created over the Bank Holiday weekend with each of the top sections lifted into place with a crane .
Lego has recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of the iconic brick .
Penny Jenkins , the park 's special events manager , said : " We are thrilled to [ hopefully ] bring the world record to Legoland Windsor after four days of hard work , not to mention nearly 500,000 bricks .
" It has been a great way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Lego bricks . "
In January 1958 , Lego's Danish founder Ole Kirk Christansen secured the patent for the modern day brick design .
The toy has gone onto to become one of the biggest sellers in history .
It seems like every blog on the internet has one of these , so here ’s my picks for the top 20 Linux applications .
I ’ll be covering programs from all different categories that I think stand out and shine as true wonders of Linux and will be presented in no particular order .
I ’ll even go over a few that I think could use some work but have potential to be something great .
Audio / Video
1.K3B
K3B is KDE ’s cd burning application and it has nearly every feature you ’d want .
It has an interface similar to Nero and its capabilities are on par with Nero .
I use this application for all my burning needs .
It is a standard program and should be in all major distributions ’ package managers .
2.Audacity
Audacity is an audio editing software that lets you edit audio tracks quickly and easily and gives you a nice selection of default effects to modify your tracks .
This is an excellent program for beginners that need to edit some audio for a home movie .
It is also excellent for bands with low budgets to get some experience mixing and mastering their own tracks , I ’ve heard some excellent sounding cds come as a result of Audacity .
3.Amarok
Amarok is an advanced media player for KDE .
It features playlists , an equalizer , iPod support , video support , the Magnatune music store , album art , Wikipedia information for the selected band , Lyrics , a file browser to open tracks not yet in your library , last .
fm support , custom themes , and alot more .
Amarok is a full - featured product and can stand toe to toe with Windows Media Player .
4.DeVeDe
DeVeDe is a DVD ripping application with one of the simplest interfaces I ’ve ever seen .
You can burn it to disc , to an iso , or convert your video files to MPEG files .
Quick and easy way to rip DVDs .
File Sharing
5.Deluge
Deluge has become my default torrent application .
It has a simple interface but respectable options under the hood including encryption , plugins , and torrent creation .
The protocol implementation in Deluge is impressive and transfer speeds are fast .
Azureus is a good client , it has nice features and a well - designed interface but it is a memory hog .
Deluge is the best Linux torrent client I ’ve found and runs much faster and consumes far less resources than Azureus .
6.Tribler
An interesting combination of file sharing and social networking .
It exists as a network of people who share their torrents and files and you can search for torrents right in the client .
It ’s basically taking web trackers out of the equation and creating a decentralized tracker .
Features are a bit lacking and its still fairly buggy but its an interesting concept and could work if the app is nurtured well .
VoIP
7.mumble
mumble and murmur are open source alternatives to Teamspeak and Ventrilo .
mumble is the client and murmur is the server .
The interface is simple and intuitive , user management is handled in the client as of the latest svn release , and the sound quality is fantastic .
The major kicker for this one is its efficient use of bandwidth .
mumble uses significantly less RAM and bandwidth than either Teamspeak or Ventrilo .
It is built on QT4 so you ’ll need to get those extra libraries .
This program could quite conceivably dethrone the big boys in their gaming VoIP dominance .
mumble is available for both Linux and Windows so no matter which OS you game on , you can communicate with the rest of your friends .
Graphics
8.GIMP
The venerable GIMP has been around for a long time and has evolved into a serious competitor to Photoshop .
I personally prefer to work in GIMP rather than Photoshop as most of the functions that I do alot are more easily accessible and the Script - Fu scripting language makes for easy creations of additional plugins .
The interface can be a nuisance for some but once you get used to it , it ’s hard to go back to Photoshop .
Available for Linux and Windows .
9.Blender
Blender is a 3d modeling program in the vein of 3D Studio Max and Maya but with a unique interface which is daunting at first glance but very intuitive and easy to use once you get the hang of it .
Many game designers that have worked with commercial programs for years prefer Blender ’s interface and the output is of the same quality as any of those expensive commercial offerings .
Blender is a masterpeice of open source enginuity and really shines in its field .
Available for Linux and Windows .
10 . Inkscape
Inkscape is an open source illustration app that rivals Adobe Illustrator in terms of both functionality and features .
Some of the best freelance vector artists on the net use Inkscape and their work is amazing .
11.Xara LX
Xara is another vector illustration program that some would say is even better than Inkscape .
For most people , either will do but the hardcore vector artists have made their choice over either Inkscape or Xara .
If you ’re looking for an open source vector graphics program , you should try both to see which fits your needs better .
12.Scribus
Yet another illustration oriented application focusing on page layout .
Many people swear by this app and for good reason .
Its slough of features such as CMYK color make this a valid alternative for anyone , not only people who ca n’t afford Acrobat Pro .
Games
13 . Alien Arena 2007
AA2k7 is a first person deathmatch shooter based off the Quake 2 derivative CRX engine .
CRX is an advanced engine rivaling the Q3 and UT2.5 engines .
It is set in a Sci -Fi world of Martians and Humans battling it out for control of the galaxy .
AA2k7 features some of the fastest , most brutal deathmatch action ever created .
It sports a large community of battle - hungry fraggers ready to take you down anytime .
Tournaments and clan matches happen fairly often ( Martian Mayhem Tournament is every Sunday at 6 PM EDT ) but more clans are wanted .
This community uses mumble for their in - game voice chat solution .
This game is available for both Linux and Windows .
14 . Nexuiz
Nexuiz is another deathmatch brawl but it stems from the Darkplaces engine , a Quake 1 derivative engine that features many of the same eye candy as more advanced engines .
The developers have done a good job making the Q1 engine look so good and the game play so well .
Gameplay is reminiscent of Quake 2 and the weapon selection is decent .
The Nex community is also very skilled and very active .
15 . Warsow
Warsow is a Quake 2 derivative but feels more like Quake 3 .
It sports cell shaded graphics , trick jumping , and lots of steady action on the servers .
Gameplay is deathmatch speed and features nice weapons balance .
This game is a member of the Esports Reality Gaming League and has received lots of attention from serious gamers .
Most of the players are based in Europe and for Americans , it can be rather challenging to find suitable servers sometimes .
16. Neverball
Neverball is an open source Super Monkey Ball clone that will keep your attention for weeks .
It takes a steady hand to maneuver your ball through the various levels and once you get to the harder levels , you ’ll be gritting your teeth and sweating with suspense .
There are some insanely difficult levels for Neverball called Mehdi ’s levels that I cant even begin to get through but there are some raging fanatics out there that do speed runs through them !
Neverball is pure fun and should accompany anyone ’s game collection .
17 . Neverputt
Neverball ’s companion game , that concentrates on that oldest of family traditions , mini golf .
It is simply a mini golf game set in the Neverball engine with some very fun and very challenging holes .
This one is a great one for Dad if he ’s a golfer and likewise should be a part of anyone ’s gaming collection .
18 . Unreal Tournament 2004
That ’s right folks , Linux DOES have commercial game support !
UT2k4 is one of the largest multiplayer games in existence and for good reason .
Its fast deathmatch is classic and it sports lots of other very fun game modes .
I wo n’t go into much detail about this one since it is such a big game and obviously well known .
You can pick this sucker up on Amazon for less than $ 15 and comes with a Linux binary installer .
19 . Quake 3 Arena
Another quality commercial game available for Linux that everyone knows .
Q3A is arguably the best deathmatch game ever created .
It set the standard for future deathmatch games and remains one of the most popular FPS games on the Internet .
Whether it be an online game with a bunch of strangers , a clan party with your best buds , or arch rivals in a competition , Q3A is a timeless classic that will be played for years to come .
You can pick this up for $ 10 if you look hard enough .
20 . Cedega
Cedega is a fairly controversial application in the Linux community .
It ’s based off the open source Wine but charges a $ 5 monthly fee .
While some think this is unfair to the Wine developers , Cedega contributes alot of code to their product and its not just a frontend .
This is known to run many Windows games including Counterstrike , World of Warcraft , and Madden 07 along with hundreds of other games that I wont list here .
Lots of gamers do n’t realize that they have this option or are reluctant to pay the price but I assure you its worth it .
For hardcore gamers , this is a great tool to have as it plays those Windows games better than Windows does much of the time because it does n’t quite have support for some of the fancier things that DirectX can do so you get better framerates as a result .
I know this is only 20 apps and there are many more out there just waiting to work for you .
Share your favorite Linux / OSS applications !

OPEC : No need to pump more oil despite record prices Reuters
Published : Sunday June 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This By Simon Webb DUBAI ( Reuters ) - OPEC members saw no need on Sunday to pump more oil in response to last week 's double - digit surge in oil prices to over $ 139 a barrel that top exporter Saudi Arabia described as unjustified .
More pain was coming for consuming economies hurting from record fuel costs as prices were likely to climb further , officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) said .
Oil soared more than $ 16 a barrel - over 13 percent - in a two - day rally on Thursday and Friday on weakness in the U.S. dollar and rising tension between Israel and Iran .
" I think there is enough oil in the market , " Shokri Ghanem , head of OPEC member Libya 's National Oil Corporation , told Reuters in a telephone interview .
Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is the only OPEC member with capacity to boost output quickly and significantly .
But Saudi Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi and his Pakistani counterpart met on Sunday and agreed that the price rise was unjustified and unrelated to market fundamentals , the official Saudi Press Agency reported .
Consuming governments have put pressure on OPEC , supplier of more than a third of the world 's oil , to boost output to ease the effect of high oil prices on their economies .
Germany 's government voiced its concern on Sunday about the impact of oil 's rally .
" The increase of the oil prices is becoming a real threat to the worldwide economy , " Germany 's Economy Minister Michael Glos told Reuters .
$ 150 OIL ?
OPEC blames factors beyond its control , including speculation and international political tension , for the price rises .
Those factors could take prices even higher soon , said Iran 's OPEC representative Muhammad Ali Khatibi .
" I forecast that by the end of summer the price of oil will reach $ 150 a barrel , " Mohammad Ali Khatibi was quoted as saying by Iran 's state broadcaster .
Iran is OPEC 's second largest oil producer and the deepening dispute with the West over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions has contributed to oil 's rally .
Israel 's deputy prime minister said in remarks published last week that an attack on Iran 's nuclear sites looked " unavoidable , " although a senior Israeli defence official said on Sunday the remarks did not reflect state policy .
Investors have bought oil on concern that an escalation in the conflict could disrupt Iran 's exports .
But only a real threat to supply would stir OPEC to meet before its next scheduled gathering on September 9 , an insider said on Sunday .
Nobody within OPEC was calling for a meeting before September , Libya 's Ghanem said .
Rising oil prices have defied swelling OPEC supplies to physical markets .
Iran said on Sunday it would export over 2.5 million bpd in June as shipments recovered from a 200,000 bpd lull in demand from refiners during April and May .
Iran has large volumes of crude sitting in tankers offshore waiting for buyers .
Saudi Arabia has boosted output 300,000 bpd to pump 9.45 million bpd in June , and Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi said last month the kingdom was meeting all demand for its crude .
Iraq expects its exports to hit a five - year high in June .
Still , concern over long - term supplies and declining output from producers outside OPEC have also lifted the oil price .
Ghanem said on Sunday that oil was getting more difficult and costly to produce and that global supplies were nearing their peak .
" The easy , cheap oil is over , " he said .
" Peak oil is looming . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A covert nuclear reactor destroyed last year in Syria would have been capable of producing plutonium and probably was " not intended for peaceful purposes , " the White House said Thursday .
Israeli soldiers in the Golan Heights look toward Syria on September 7 , 2007 , a day after an Israeli airstrike .
But senior intelligence officials later said they had only low confidence that the facility was meant to build nuclear weapons .
A senior U.S. official said the reactor was weeks or months away from being functional when it was bombed by Israel in September .
" This thing was good to go , so we had to assume they were ready to throw the switch , " said a senior U.S. intelligence officer who , along with another senior intelligence officer and a senior White House official , briefed reporters about the site Thursday afternoon .
A White House statement said North Korea may have assisted Syria 's nuclear activities .
" We have long been seriously concerned about North Korea 's nuclear weapons program and its proliferation activities , " the statement said .
" North Korea 's clandestine nuclear cooperation with Syria is a dangerous manifestation of those activities . "
At the media briefing , one of the intelligence officials said information collected by the United States suggests North Korean " nuclear entities " met with high - level Syrian officials as early as 1997 .
In 2005 , the investigators learned that Syria and North Korea were working together on a project in a remote part of the Dayr az Zawr region of eastern Syria , the official said .
A working reactor would make Syria the first Arab nation with nuclear capability and would potentially put nuclear weapons in the hands of a regime that the United States accuses of committing human rights abuses and supporting international terror groups .
During the briefing , the intelligence officials said they had " high confidence " that North Korea had aided Syria with its nuclear program .
But they said they have only low confidence about concluding that it was meant for developing weapons .
That 's in part because the site had no reprocessing facility , needed for making bombs .
The nation 's most senior intelligence officials spent much of Thursday briefing key lawmakers on the September bombing by Israeli warplanes .
The officials showed a narrated video with still photographs and animated images they said indicate similarities between the Syrian facility and North Korean nuclear facilities .

" The reactor would have been capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons , was not configured to produce electricity and was ill - suited for research , " CIA Director Michael Hayden said in a message , obtained by CNN , that he sent to employees Thursday .
In the message , Hayden said intelligence officers learned last spring that the building was a nuclear reactor built using North Korean technology .
He said the CIA had suspected that the countries were cooperating on nuclear technology as early as 2001 .
Outside nuclear experts -- none of whom had immediately reviewed the administration video Thursday -- have said that none of the fuel needed to run a nuclear reactor was present on the site .
Asked why David Albright , a former weapons inspector , and other experts have said Syria was not close to getting the reactor functional , a U.S. official said that such comments are coming from people who are " only half - read - in on " the intelligence .
Syria 's ambassador to the United States criticized the Bush administration claims , saying Syria never worked with North Korea on a nuclear program .
" I hope the truth will be revealed to everyone , " Imad Moustapha told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" This will be a major embarrassment to the U.S. administration for the second time ; they lied about the Iraqi [ weapons of mass destruction ] , and they are trying to do it again . "
Pyongyang has resisted pressure to reveal who has received North Korean nuclear know - how .
On Capitol Hill , the briefings raised questions about how the news would affect ongoing six - party talks in which the United States and other world powers are trying to get North Korea to give up its nuclear program in return for the loosening of sanctions .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said the briefing had come eight months too late .
And he warned that the briefing would complicate the talks with North Korea , saying it " would be much harder to go through Congress and get [ any ] agreements approved . "
Watch Hoekstra lash out »
Rep . Howard Berman , the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , issued a statement calling the reported details about the site " disturbing . "
But he said they provide no reason to suspend talks with North Korea .
" Rather , the information that has been released to the public demonstrates the importance of insisting on a verifiable enforcement mechanism to ensure that North Korea honors its commitments to stop spreading the means to create nuclear weapons and to end its nuclear program permanently , " he said .
Officials said they delayed releasing details of the September 6 Israeli air strike for fear that doing so would provoke Syria to retaliate against Israel , leading to major warfare in the region .
In their briefing with reporters , the senior officials said that Israel had consulted the United States before launching the strike that took out the facility but stressed that U.S. officials did not " green light " the action .

I see nothing wrong with the first reason ; scientists and analysts have used heuristic curves to fit to empirical data for years and a simple expression provides a convenient shorthand for describing the shape of a data set .
In the case of the Hubbert peak , we get the familiar S - function for cumulative production , and a bell - shaped curve for yearly production -- both characteristics that describe the Hubbert peak quite nicely to first - order .
As for point # 2 , we usually see hand - wavy arguments that point to an exponential growth that causes the peak oil curve to rapidly increase and then levels off as a negative feedback term in the equation takes over .
What I consider circular reasoning with respect to Hubbert Linearization supports the idea that a physical process must drive this effect -- perhaps something similar to the constrained growth arguments popularized by Verhulst :
U(t ) = 1 / ( 1/U 0 + 1 / Ae Bt )
dU/dt = U(
U
0
-U)
dG/dt ~ -t*G
D( x ) = x * ( 1 - exp ( - k/ x ) )
d D( x ) / dx = c * ( 1 - exp ( - k / x ) * ( 1+k/x ) )
x
x
As for as other criticisms , I suppose one could question the actual relevance of a power - law growth as a driving function .
In fact the formulation described here supports other growth laws , including monotonically increasing exponential growth .
and it starts to get really interesting now
We have much greater uncertainties in the stochastic variables in the oil discovery problem , ranging from the uncertainty in the spread of search volumes to the spread in the amount of people / corporations involved in the search itself .

k=L 0
p( L ) =exp (- L/L 0 ) /L 0

It models a discovery profile .
The search rates are dispersed via an exponential PDF
The searched volume is dispersed via an exponential PDF
The growth rate follows a positive exponential .

Unfortunately , I have never seen a derivation of this idea to oil production , at least to my liking .
Most proofs have simply asserted that the relationship fits our intuition and then the equation gets solved with the resulting sigmoid curve ( here or here ) : I have problems with these kinds of assertions for a number of reasons .
First of all , the general form of the resulting expression above can result from all sorts of fundamental principles besides the non-linear differential equation that Verhulst first theorized .
For one , Fermi -Dirac statistics show the exact same S - curve relation as described by the U(t ) formula above , yet no respectable physicist would ever derive FD by using thelogistics - growth formula .
Most physicists would simply look at the relationship and see a coincidental mathematical identity that does n't help their understanding one iota .
Secondly , one can play the same kind of identity games with the Normal ( gaussian ) curve , which also gets used occasionally to describe the production peak .
In the case of the gaussian , we can generate a similar non-linear differential equationwhich also " describes " the curve .
But this similarly says nothing about how the gaussian comes about ( the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers ) , instead it only shows how a mathematical identity arises from its parameterized curvature .
This becomes a tautology , driven more by circular reasoning than anything else .
The last point of the logistic having implicit practical value has the historical force of momentum .
This may seem blasphemous , but just because Hubbert first used this formulation years ago , does n't make itcorrect .
He may have used the formula because of its convenience and mathematical properties more than anything else .
I have either tried to contradict the use of the Logistic or searched for a fundamental derivation for some time now , but since everyone has shown some degree of satisfaction with the logistic , I have n't had much success until now ... The breakthrough I have come across uses the Dispersive Discovery model as motivation .
This model does n't predict production but I figure that since production arises from the original discovery profile according to the Shock Model , this should at least generate a first - principles understanding .
In its general form , keeping search growth constant , the dispersive part of the discovery model produces a cumulative function that looks like this :
The instantaneous curve generated by the derivative looks likeAdding a growth term forand we can get a family of curves for the derivative : I generated this set of curves simply by applying growth terms of various powers , such as quadratic , cubic , etc , to replace .
No bones about it , I could have just as easily applied a positive exponential growth term here , and the characteristic peaked curve would result , with the strength of the peak directly related to the acceleration of the exponential growth .
I noted that in an earlier post Overall , the curves have some similarity to the Logistic sigmoid curve and its derivative , traditionally used to model the Hubbert peak .
Yet it does n't match the sigmoid because the equations obviously do n't match -- not surprising since my model differs in its details from the Logistic heuristics .
However , , I can add another level of dispersion to my model and see what happens to the result .
I originally intended for the dispersion to only apply to the variable search rates occurring over different geographic areas of the world .
But I hinted that we could extend it to other stochastic variables :
So I originally started with a spread in search rates given as an uncertainty in the searched volume swept , and locked down the total volume as the constant .
Look at the following graph , which show several parts of the integration , and you can see that the uncertainties only reflect in the growth rates and not in the sub-volumes , which shows up as a clamped - asymptote below the cumulative asymptote : I figured that adding uncertainty to this term would make the result more messy than I would like to see at this expository level .
But in retrospect , I should have taken the extra step as it does give a very surprising result .
That extra step involves a simple integration of the constantterm as a stochastic variable over a damped exponential probability density function ( PDF ) given by .
This adds stochastic uncertainty to the total volume searched , or more precisely , uncertainty to the fixed sub-volumes searched , that when aggregated provide the total volume .
The following math derivation I extended from the original dispersive discovery equation explained in my TOD post " Finding Needles in a Haystack " ( read this post if you need motivation for the general derivation ) .
The first set of equations derives the original dispersive discovery which includes uncertainty in the search depth , while the second set of equations adds dispersion in the volume while building from the previous derivation .
In the next to last relation , the addition of the second dispersion term turns into a trivial analytical integration from L=0 to L=infinity .
The result becomes the simple relation in the last line .
Depending on the type of search growth , we come up with various kinds of cumulative discovery curves .
Note that the exponential term from the original dispersive discovery function disappears .
This occurs because of dimensional analysis : the dispersed rate stochastic variable in the denominator has an exponential PDF and the dispersed volume in the numerator has an exponential PDF ; these essentially cancel each other after each gets integrated over the stochastic range .
In any case , the simple relationship that this gives , , results in what looks exactly like the logistic sigmoid function
That essentially describes the complete derivation of a discovery logistic curve in terms of exponential growth and dispersed parameters .
By adding an additional stochastic element to the Dispersive Discovery model , the logistic has now transformed from a cheap heuristic into a model result .
The fact that it builds on the first - principles of the Dispersive Discovery model gives us a deeper understanding of its origins .
So whenever we see the logistic sigmoid used in a fit of the Hubbert curve we know that several preconditions must exist :
This finding now precludes other meaningless explanations for the Logistic curve 's origin , including birth - death models , predator - prey models , and other ad - hoc carrying capacity derivations that other fields of scientific study have traditionally incorporated into their temporal dynamics theory .
None of that matters , as the Logistic -- in terms of oil discovery -- simply models the stochastic effects of randomly searching an uncertain volume given an exponentially increasing average search rate .
As an aside , you have to remember that Verhulst did not have the benefit of modern probability theory and the use of stochastic processes in the early 1800's , and came up with a very deterministic view of his subject matter .
As a matter of fact , the theory and application of stochastic processes only became popularized to Western audiences in the mid 20century ( with classical English books on the subject by Feller and Doob appearing in the 1950's ) and for someone like Hubbert to make the connection would in retrospect have seemed very prescient on his part .
In the end , intuitive understanding plays an important role in setting up the initial premise , and the math has served as a formal verification of my understanding .
You have to shoot holes in the probability theory to counter the argument , which any good debunking needs to do .
As a very intriguing corollary to this finding , the fact that we can use a Logistic to model discovery means that weuse only a Logistic to model production .
I have no qualms with this turn of events as production comes about as a result of applying the Oil Shock model to discoveries , and this essentially shifts the discovery curve to the right in the timeline while maintaining most of its basic shape .
In spite of such a surprising model reduction to the sigmoid , we can continue to use the Dispersive Discovery in its more general form to understand a variety of parametric growth models , which means that we should remember that the Logistic manifests itself from a specific instantiation of dispersive discovery .
But this specific derivation might just close the book on why the Logistic works at all .
It also supports the unification between the Shock Model and the Logistic Model that Khebab has investigated last year A different question to ask :
Does the exponential - growth double dispersive discovery curve ( the " logistic " ) work better than the power - law variation ?
Interesting that the power law discovery curve does not linearize in the manner of Hubbert Linearization .
Instead it generates the following quasi-linearization , whereis the power in the power - law curve : Note that the hyperbolic factor ( leadingterm ) creates a spike near the U=0 origin , quite in keeping with many of the empirical HL observations of oil production .
I do n't think anyone has effectively explained the hyperbolic divergence typically observed .
Although not intended as a fit to the data , the following figure shows how power discovery modulates the linear curve to potentially provide a more realistic fit to the data .
It also reinforces my conjecture that these mathematical identities add very little intuitive value to the derivation of the models -- they simply represent tautological equivalences to the fundamental equations .
As another corollary , given the result : we can verify another type of Hubbert Linearization .
Consider that the parameter x describes a constant growth situation .
If we can plot cumulative discovered volume ( ) against cumulative discoveries or depth ( ) , we should confirm the creaming curve heuristic .
In other words , the factor L should remain invariant allowing us to linear regress a good estimate of ultimate volume : It looks like this might arguably fit some curves better than previously shown
The revolution will not be televised , it will be downloaded an update at a time
Back in the crazy days before the current generation of gaming consoles , the console you bought at retail was the console you had for the life of the hardware .
My SNES acts exactly the same now as it did when it was first released , and outside of the addition of Xbox Live , the first Xbox system remained largely unchanged throughout the hardware 's life cycle .
Those days are long over , and now which version of Sony 's PlayStation 3 that you bought is only one part of the equation : welcome to the firmware wars .
The PS3's Protean design
No console system has changed so dramatically in the time since its launch as the PlayStation 3 .
We rather notoriously gave the 60 GB model a six when it was first released , and we stand by that rating — the system just felt undercooked .
What player of high - definition media can't display content in 720 p ?
Also , the lack of background downloading felt like a drag when we tried to use the online store .
And the games were mostly terrible ; there was n't anything that looked as good as the titles on the then - mature Xbox 360 , much less any evidence that the PS3 was as powerful as Sony had promised .
Remember , this was the system that had been hyped from here to eternity , so it was easy to feel let down by Sony 's anemic launch offerings .
The PS3 never became hard to find , the price cuts began sooner than expected , and the system has been trailing both the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii almost every month since it has been released .
It may sound a bit dire when you sum it up like that , but something has been happening with the PlayStation 3 since launch .
The firmware has received update after update .
The Blu-ray capability has become much stronger , and it may in fact be the most affordable and fully - featured high definition disc player on the market .
The price has come down to a much more palatable $ 400 for the 40 GB model , and the game selection continues to improve , with strong multiplatform support and a wide selection of exclusive games .
Finally , the Sixaxis has been discontinued , and in its place now sits the Dual Shock 3 : a controller with both motion - sensing capabilities and rumble .
Sony has done an amazing job of rallying behind its flagship system , and where there used to be arrogance there is a now a more realistic sense of what needs to be done , as well as a more open approach to dealing with the press and bloggers alike .
Sony launched its own blog to speak directly to the consumers , for instance , and both the PlayStation blog in the US and ThreeSpeech in the UK do a great job of providing news ; both sites also have many developers and publishers interacting directly with the comments .
Even the commercials for the system have gotten better .
This approach seems to be saying one thing to console gamers like us , who were unimpressed with the system at launch : " We 're different now .
We understand what went wrong .
Come home to the PlayStation you know . "
So today , in light of all that has changed since the system 's launch , we 're going to re-review the PlayStation 3 by taking a look at the system you 'll get if you buy one today , not the system that launched in November of 2006 .
Trust us , it 's no longer a six .
Blu-ray player and media functions
The first thing that was wrong with the launch version of the PS3 was that its Blu-ray support was n't exactly the asset that it is today .
The original unit 's lack of 720 p support was criminal , and the selection of Blu-ray titles was weak .
No one wanted to buy content for a format that might die , and if they did , the majority of people with high - def displays most likely ran at 720 p as the standard resolution .
In May of 2007 , Sony launched the 1.80 firmware update , and the game was changed : 720 p support was finally added , as was the ability to upscale existing DVDs .
DLNA support also came to the system , so that you could stream your content from your home network .

Even as Sony was rolling out these firmware updates , the Blu-ray standard itself was evolving .
Different profiles for the standard asked different things of the hardware , meaning that many players would n't be able to take advantage of the latest features of some discs .
Taking a look at each Blu-ray profile , you can imagine that early adopters of the format are n't happy with the situation :
1.0 is the launch profile , and secondary audio and video decoders
are optional , as is local storage and network connectivity .
The
majority of standalone players fit into this category .

The majority of standalone players fit into this category .
1.1

need a secondary audio and video decoder to handle picture - in - picture ,
as well as at least 256MB of local storage for content .
is a newer profile , and to take advantage of these discs , players need a secondary audio and video decoder to handle picture - in - picture , as well as at least 256MB of local storage for content .
2.0
is the very latest profile , requiring the two secondary decoders , 1GB
of local storage for updates and content , and an Internet connection .
Sony has already launched the software update that allows the PS3 to play discs that use the 2.0 profile , called " BD Live , " and at the moment the PS3 is one of the few players that will be able to play these discs .
What does BD Live get you ?
Picture in picture , online features like trivia games , and other goodies like downloadable ring tones .
The price of standalone players that are fully compliant with the 2.0 spec will most likely be above the $ 400 asking price of the PS3 .
Furthermore , buying Sony 's console instead of a standalone player also gives you an added insurance policy : with its media processing muscle , hard drive , and Ethernet port , the PS3 is one of the only completely future - proof Blu-ray players on the market .
No matter how the spec changes , the PS3 will be able to play it .
Sony's is also the only console to be completely Divx certified , unlike the limited support the format enjoys on the 360 .
" The recent Xbox update does not support full DivX playback ; Microsoft has added support for MPEG - 4 , which is not the same thing as full DivX Certification , " Bruce Lidl , PR manager for DivX Inc. , told Ars Technica .
" In practical terms , it is true that some DivX files will play back on the Xbox , because DivX is in part based on the MPEG - 4 standard .
But many early versions of DivX video will not play back on the console , and the device has not been tested to guarantee an acceptable level of quality and full support for DivX video at the proper resolution . "
In contrast , the PlayStation 3 is fully certified to work with DivX in all its incarnations , a large selling point for people with Divx content already on their network .
The Blu-ray and DivX situation has left Sony with the upper hand over Microsoft in the race to turn consoles into networked home media players .
In short , Sony 's gaming system is one of the most robust and affordable pieces of home theater hardware on the market : it 's the best Blu-ray player , it has a relatively low price , it 's fully Divx compatible , and it allows video streaming from your network .
Furthermore , regular DVDs look amazing after being upscaled , and the system now takes advantage of all your high - end audio equipment .
If you take away the gaming features completely , the hardware is still worth more than $ 400 for home theater enthusiasts ; in a surreal twist , you could argue that Blu-ray is the Trojan horse bringing PS3 gaming to the masses , not the other way around .
Story of Rumble
When the PlayStation 3 was released , it launched with the Sixaxis controller .
This was something of a departure for Sony in that it had no rumble , and its motion - sensing technology seemed to have taken some cues from the Nintendo Wii .
Without rumble , the controller was light , and the triggers had a much larger range of motion than the Dual Shock 2 .
Some loved it , some hated it , but it was certainly an interesting choice .
" I believe that the Sixaxis controller offers game designers and developers far more opportunity for future innovation than rumble ever did .
Now , rumble I think was the last generation feature ; it 's not the next - generation feature .
I think motion sensitivity is , " Phil Harrison famously told GameDaily back in February 2007 .
The truth is that Sony was locked in litigation with the Immersion Corporation , and rather than capitulate and license the rumble technology , Sony decided to use its power to try to make rumble look passé .
The ploy did n't work .
While the drama may have been quickly forgotten , it took much doing to bring the Dual Shock 3 to life
" I really miss the rumble feature , and I already said to Mr. Kutaragi that I want the rumble feature back , " Hideo Kojima said , and many gamers agreed with him .
Sony ended up settling with Immersion , and almost immediately the tune changed .
Sony could n't wait to work with the company .
In a later interview , Phil Harrison played politics to try to downplay Sony 's old stance about rumble .
" As to previous statements that I made ; we were in a lawsuit — what do you expect me to say ?
We were in a lawsuit .
We were in litigation .
Of course I have to defend our view .
And actually , I still truly believe that having the Sixaxis controller the way it is is the best way to control games .
And I think that we 're looking forward to working with Immersion going forward , and who knows where that is leading us . "
In April of this year Sony finally released the Dual Shock 3 , complete with rumble , and then killed the Sixaxis completely .
The Dual Shock 3 is going to be the controller for Sony moving forward , and many games already support the rumble feature .
The story of the Dual Shock 3 is one of the most drastic turnarounds seen in the gaming industry .
Holding a Dual Shock 3 in my hand , I can't help but wonder how many gamers who have n't yet bought a PlayStation 3 will even remember this story .
For the majority of the system 's life , the Dual Shock 3 will be the controller everyone knows , and it's a very good controller .
Strong battery life , rumble , wireless ... it's what the system should have shipped with from the beginning .
The Dual Shock is one of the most iconic designs in the history of gaming , and it 's great to have it back , rumble included .
The Dual Shock 3 is yet another way that the system has improved since launch .
Rumble is now back , and the PlayStation 3 has the stock controller it always deserved .
Clinton camp looking for Obama money
The Obama campaign has stepped up the pressure on its donors to help Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) retire her campaign debt , but the Clinton campaign wants even more action , according to donors on both sides .
Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) are appearing together at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington Thursday night at a meeting of her biggest givers so she can introduce him and encourage them to fund his general election campaign .

Her campaign chairman and chief money man , Terry McAuliffe , will also speak .
Obama will deliver remarks , and then they plan to open the floor to questions , according to organizers .
People who have talked with key Clinton donors say the donors want Obama to show a specific plan for helping her retire her campaign debt .
These donors are holding back on donations to his campaign until they get that assurance , according to the sources .
In addition , Clinton ’s superdelegates want her accorded the courtesy of a roll call vote at the August convention in Denver , although that issue may not come up at the Mayflower meeting , the sources said .
Obama ’s national finance chair , Penny Pritzker , e-mailed top supporters yesterday with a follow - up to a Wednesday conference call , and urged them to start collecting checks .
“ Barack has asked each of us to collect five or six checks to help Sen.
Clinton repay the people who provided goods and services to her campaign .
He made this request in the spirit of party unity , ” she wrote .
“ We recognize that this has been a long and , at times , hotly contested campaign .
But in the same way Sen.
Clinton has asked her supporters to move beyond the primary campaign , Barack has asked us to help in this effort to defray her debt .
As he said on the call , ‘ We are all in this together . ’ ”
Attached is a Clinton campaign form with the familiar Hillary logo : “ Yes !
I would like to make a contribution to Hillary Clinton for President for the 2008 Primary Election Debt Retirement .
( Maximum contribution is $ 2,300 per individual and $ 4,600 per couple for the entire 2008 primary . ) ”
So will the checks start pouring in ?
An Obama aide said : “ People are definitely open to it and participating . ”
An excerpt from the Pritzker e-mail :
As those of you who were on the call yesterday heard , Barack has asked each of us to collect five or six checks to help Sen.
Clinton repay the people who provided goods and services to her campaign .
He made this request in the spirit of party unity .
Sen .
Clinton has promised to do everything she can to help us beat John McCain .
On Thursday she and Barack are meeting with her biggest fundraisers to ask them to join us in our efforts .
On Friday , Barack and Sen. Clinton are making their first public appearance together in Unity , New Hampshire .
Already several Clinton supporters are raising money for Barack .
We recognize that this has been a long and , at times , hotly contested campaign .
But in the same way Sen.
Clinton has asked her supporters to move beyond the primary campaign , Barack has asked us to help in this effort to defray her debt .
As he said on the call , “ we are all in this together . ” …
As Barack made clear on the call , this is important to our effort to bring about the change our country needs .
Every time he has asked us to help , we have delivered for him .
I am confident we will do the same this time .
Thanks ,
Penny

The Bushes and Hitler 's Appeasement The irony of George W. Bush going before the Knesset and mocking the late Sen. William Borah for expressing surprise at Adolf Hitler ’s 1939 invasion of Poland is that Bush ’s own family played a much bigger role assisting the Nazis .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly If Borah , an isolationist Republican from Idaho , sounded naïve saying “ Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided , ” then what should be said about Bush ’s grandfather and other members of his family providing banking and industrial assistance to the Nazis as they built their war machine in the 1930s ?
The archival evidence is now clear that Prescott Bush , the president ’s grandfather , was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from and collaborated with key financial backers of Nazi Germany .
That business relationship continued after Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and even after Germany declared war on the United States following Japan ’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 .
It stopped only when the U.S. government seized assets of Bush - connected companies in late 1942 under the “ Trading with the Enemy Act . ”
So , perhaps instead of holding up Sen .
Borah to ridicule , Bush might have acknowledged in his May 15 speech that his forebears also were blind to the dangers of Hitler .
Bush might have noted that his family ’s wealth , which fueled his own political rise , was partly derived from Nazi collaboration and possibly from slave labor provided by Auschwitz and other concentration camps .
A more honest speech before the Knesset – on the 60th anniversary of Israel ’s founding – might have contained an apology to the Jewish people from a leading son of the Bush family for letting its greed contribute to Nazi power and to the horrors of the Holocaust .
Instead , there was just the jab at Sen. Borah , who died in 1940 .
President Bush apparently saw no reason to remind the world of a dark chapter from the family history .
After all , those ugly facts mostly disappeared from public consciousness soon after World War II .
Protected by layers of well - connected friends , Prescott Bush brushed aside the Nazi scandal and won a U.S. Senate seat from Connecticut , which enabled him to start laying the foundation for the family ’s political dynasty .
In recent years , however , the archival records from the pre-war era have been assembled , drawing from the Harriman family papers at the Library of Congress , documents at the National Archives , and records from war - crimes trials after Germany ’s surrender .
Managers for the Powerful
One can trace the origins of this story back more than a century to the emergence of Samuel Bush , George W. Bush ’s great - grandfather , as a key manager for a set of powerful American business families , including the Rockefellers and the Harrimans .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush Family Chronicles : The Patriarchs . ” ]
That chapter took an important turn in 1919 when investment banker George Herbert Walker teamed up with Averell Harriman , scion to a railroad fortune , to found a new investment banking firm , W.A. Harriman Company .
The Harriman firm was backed by the Rockefellers ’ National City Bank and the Morgan family ’s Guaranty Trust .
The English - educated Walker assisted in assembling the Harriman family ’s overseas business investments .
In 1921 , Walker ’s favorite daughter , Dorothy , married Samuel Bush ’s son Prescott , a Yale graduate and a member of the school ’s exclusive Skull and Bones society .
Handsome and athletic , admired for his golf and tennis skills , Prescott Bush was a young man with the easy grace of someone born into the comfortable yet competitive world of upper - crust contacts .
Three years later , Dorothy gave birth to George Herbert Walker Bush in Milton , Massachusetts .
Lifted by the financial boom of the 1920s , Prescott and Dorothy Bush were on the rise .
By 1926 , George Herbert Walker had brought his son - in - law in on a piece of the Harriman action , hiring him as a vice president in the Harriman banking firm .
By the mid-Thirties , Prescott Bush had become a managing partner at the merged firm of Brown Brothers Harriman .
The archival records also show that Brown Brothers Harriman served as the U.S. financial service arm for German industrialist Fritz Thyssen , an early funder of the Nazi Party .
Thyssen , an admirer of Adolf Hitler since the 1920s , joined the Nazi Party in 1931 when it was still a fringe organization .
He helped bail the struggling party out with financial help , even providing its headquarters building in Munich .
Meanwhile , Averell Harriman had launched the Hamburg - Amerika line of steamships to facilitate the bank ’s dealings with Germany , and made Prescott Bush a director .
The ships delivered fuel , steel , coal , gold and money to Germany as Hitler was consolidating his power and building his war machine .
Other evidence shows that Prescott Bush served as the director of the Union Banking Corp. of New York , which represented Thyssen ’s interests in the United States and was owned by a Thyssen - controlled bank in the Netherlands .
As a steel magnate , Thyssen was amassing a fortune as Hitler rearmed Germany .
Documents also linked Bush to Thyssen ’s Consolidated Silesian Steel Company , which was based in mineral - rich Silesia on the German - Polish border and exploited slave labor from Nazi concentration camps , including Auschwitz .
But records at the National Archives do not spell out exactly when Bush ’s connection ended or what he knew about the business details .
In 1941 , Thyssen had a falling out with Hitler and fled to France where he was captured .
Much of Thyssen ’s empire went under the direct control of the Nazis , but even that did not shatter the business ties that existed with Prescott Bush and Harriman ’s bank .
It was n’t until August 1942 that newspaper stories disclosed the secretive ties between Union Banking Corp. and Nazi Germany .
After an investigation , the U.S. government seized the property of the Hamburg - Amerika line and moved against affiliates of the Union Banking Corp .
In November 1942 , the government seized the assets of the Silesian - American Corp .
[ For more details , see an investigative report by the U.K. Guardian , Sept. 25 , 2004 . ]
No Kiss of Death
For most public figures , allegations of trading with the enemy would have been a political kiss of death , but the disclosures barely left a lipstick smudge on Averell Harriman , Prescott Bush and other business associates implicated in the Nazi business dealings .
“ Politically , the significance of these dealings – the great surprise – is that none of it seemed to matter much over the next decade or so , ” wrote Kevin Phillips in American Dynasty .
“ A few questions would be raised , but Democrat Averell Harriman would not be stopped from becoming federal mutual security administrator in 1951 or winning election as governor of New York in 1954 . …
Nor would Republican Prescott Bush ( who was elected senator from Connecticut in 1952 ) and his presidential descendants be hurt in any of their future elections . ”
Indeed , the quick dissipation of the Nazi financial scandal was only a portent of the Bush family ’s future .
Unlike politicians of lower classes , the Bushes seemed to travel in a bubble impervious to accusations of impropriety , since the Eastern Establishment does n’t like to think badly of its own .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
To this day – as President Bush showed by mocking the long - forgotten Sen.
Borah and then wielding the Nazi “ appeasement ” club against Barack Obama and other Democrats – the assumption remains that the bubble will continue to protect the Bush family name .
However , the evidence from dusty archives suggests that the Bush family went way beyond appeasement of Adolf Hitler to aiding and abetting the Nazis .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .

About four out of every five detainees in American detention centers are Sunni Arab , even though Sunni Arabs make up just one - fifth of Iraq ’s population .
All of the foreign fighters listed on the materials found near Sinjar , excluding two from France , also came from countries that are predominantly Sunni .
Over the years , the Syrian border has been the principal entry point into Iraq for foreign insurgents , officials say .
Many had come through Anbar Province , in west - central Iraq .
But with the Sunni tribal revolt against extremist militants that began last year in Anbar , Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and other jihadists concentrated their smuggling efforts on the area north of the Euphrates River along the Syrian border , the officials said .
The officials added that , based on the captured documents and other intelligence , they believe that the Sinjar cell that was raided in September was responsible for the smuggling of foreign fighters along a stretch of the border from Qaim , in Anbar , almost to the border with Turkey , a length of nearly 200 miles .
They said that was why they were confident that the cell was responsible for such a large portion of the incoming foreign fighters .
American military and diplomatic officials who discussed the flow of fighters from Saudi Arabia were careful to draw a distinction between the Saudi government and the charities and individuals who they said encouraged young Saudi men to fight in Iraq .
After United States officials put pressure on Saudi leaders in the summer , the Saudi government took some steps that have begun to curb the flow of fighters , the officials said .
Yet the senior American military officials said they also believed that Saudi citizens provided the majority of financing for Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
“ They do n’t want to see the Shias come to dominate in Iraq , ” one American official said .
The Sinjar materials showed that 291 fighters , or about 39 percent , came from North African nations during the period beginning in August 2006 .
That is far higher than previous military estimates of 10 to 13 percent from North Africa .
The largest foreign fighter hometown was Darnah , Libya , which supplied 50 fighters .
For years American officials included Libya on the list of state sponsors of terrorism .
But last year the United States removed it from that list and re-established full diplomatic relations , citing what Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described as Libya ’s “ continued commitment to its renunciation of terrorism and the excellent cooperation ” it has provided in the antiterrorism fight .

As a critic of the national retail sales tax plan known as the FairTax , I take Neal Boortz 's new book on the FairTax very personally .
The book is titled FairTax : The Truth : Answering the Critics .
It is intended to be a sequel to The FairTax Book , published in 2005 , that offers " eye- opening new insights not covered in the original book . "
Boortz is right .
There are some eye - opening new insights unique to this sequel .
Like the disclosure that you might " owe more in taxes in the first year of a FairTax system than you do today . "
Or the admission that " the FairTax could be even more progressive than our current system . "
Or the confession that the " implementation of the FairTax does n't mean complete annihilation of the IRS . "
Ibid. , 151 .
Or the proposal that " a procedure should be set up in the Treasury Department to collect taxes on Internet and catalog sales , remitting the state and local governments ' share to them . "
As with Boortz 's original work , this book is coauthored by Congressman John Linder ( R - GA ) .
New this time , however , is the addition of " with Rob Woodall " on the front cover and title page .
But although the back cover contains brief bios for Boortz and Linder , there is no information on Woodall , Congressman Linder 's chief of staff .
As I said when I reviewed Boortz 's original book on the FairTax in " There Is No Such Thing As a Fair Tax , " since Boortz has previous writing experience , and his name appears in larger letters on the book 's cover , I will refer to him as the author .
I will be quoting Boortz extensively throughout this review since he believes that " opponents who want to criticize the FairTax often feel compelled to misrepresent its principles — or to lie about it outright — to give themselves something to shout about . " [ 5 ]
No shouting on my part will be required .
The deceptions , half - truths , and lies of the FairTax will speak for themselves .
Keeping 100 Percent of Your Paycheck
Actually , FairTax : The Truth is Boortz 's second attempt at damage control .
As I pointed out in " The Fraudulent Tax , " the paperback edition of The FairTax Book , released in 2006 , contained some notable changes that had to be made to correct false statements in the original hardcover release about everyone receiving 100 percent of their paycheck after the adoption of the FairTax .
It turned out that the portion of the worker 's paycheck formerly withheld and sent to the government as taxes that would be returned to him under a FairTax system that eliminated those taxes , thus allowing the worker to keep 100 percent of his paycheck , was the same portion that producers were going to pocket to help them lower their costs .
One of the main selling points of the FairTax was ( and is ) that prices would fall by roughly the same amount of the new national sales tax to be imposed on all goods and services — thus making everything a wash .
But in order for employers to cut their costs enough to be able to lower prices by an amount necessary to offset the FairTax , employees would have to settle for their current take - home pay , not 100 percent of their paycheck .
Although Boortz did correct many of his " keep 100 percent of your paycheck " statements in the paperback edition of The FairTax Book , I pointed out in " The Fraudulent Tax " that his book still made that claim in two places , the website of Congressman Linder still made the claim , and the website of Americans for Fair Taxation ( the organization responsible for the FairTax idea ) did likewise .
Well , the Americans for Fair Taxation website still makes the claim , Congressman Linder 's website still makes the claim , the publisher 's press release for Boortz 's new FairTax book maintains that " Americans would take home every penny they earn , " and the new book makes the claim twice , including a statement on the back cover that the FairTax will enable you " to keep all the money in your paycheck . "
So which is it ?
After the implementation of the FairTax , do workers get to keep their whole paycheck or do they not ?
Well , that depends on the generosity of their employer .
Boortz devotes a whole chapter to this subject in FairTax : The Truth .
Indeed , Boortz says that " perhaps the biggest FairTax myth concerns the cost of living and the size of your take - home pay . " [ 6 ]
But before examining Boortz 's treatment of that myth , we should first revisit the basics of the FairTax and some problems we would face by adopting it .
The FairTax Plan
The FairTax is a revenue - neutral consumption tax in the form of a national retail sales tax on all new goods and services that is designed to replace most federal taxes : personal income taxes , corporate income taxes , estate taxes , gift taxes , unemployment taxes , alternative minimum taxes , capital gains taxes , Social Security taxes , and Medicare taxes .
Although it seems like the price we would have to pay for the elimination of these taxes is higher prices on all new goods and services because of the imposition of a high sales tax , FairTax proponents claim that the removal of embedded taxes — the tax burdens of businesses that contribute to the overall cost of products — will result in the prices of goods and services falling by enough to offset the amount of the FairTax imposed .
In addition to this dubious conclusion , there are some misconceptions about the FairTax that should be pointed out .
The FairTax does not eliminate all taxes .
It does not eliminate tariffs on imported goods , federal excise taxes on products like gasoline and tobacco , special taxes on things like telephone service and airline tickets , or any state and local sales , gasoline , or hotel taxes .
The FairTax does not lower the overall tax burden .
Since it is revenue neutral , the total amount of taxes the federal government extracts from the citizens of the United States would be the same as it is now .
The FairTax does not eliminate the IRS .
Calling the IRS by another name , and redirecting its mission , is hardly eliminating it .
Just as the income tax would be replaced by the FairTax , so the IRS would be replaced by the " Sales Tax Bureau " in the Treasury Department .
True , there would be no more audits , no more tax forms , no more April 15 , and no more compliance costs for individuals , but there would be an increase in these things for businesses .
The FairTax does not eliminate the Sixteenth Amendment .
To repeal the Sixteenth Amendment would require a constitutional amendment to that effect , as the Twenty - First Amendment repealed the Eighteenth .
Not only is there no guarantee that Congress would propose such an amendment , it would still have to be sent to the states and approved by three - fourths of them .
Even if the prices of goods and services fall after the change to the FairTax system , with the sale of new homes and cars being taxed , as well as services from heart surgeries down to haircuts , the FairTax would result in a tremendous change in American society .
Is it worth expending so much effort on changing the way the federal government collects taxes instead of changing the amount that the federal government collects in taxes ?
This is a question that does n't even have to be answered since the stated rate of the FairTax is too low to achieve revenue neutrality and the amount by which prices would fall under a FairTax system has been grossly exaggerated .
The FairTax Tax Code
FairTax proponents are naïve about what would happen to their system once it was adopted .
What makes them think that Congress would n't turn the FairTax into a monstrosity just as hideous as the current tax code ?
The original tax code was , like the FairTax , short and simple .
However , it did n't take long for Congress to turn it into the lengthy , complex , unjust system that it is today .
What makes FairTax supporters think that Congress wo n't begin to tweak the FairTax as soon as it goes into effect ?
The rate of any of the three components of the FairTax ( the general revenue rate ; the old - age , survivors and disability insurance rate ; and the hospital rate ) could be raised at any time .
The spiraling costs of Social Security and Medicare , as well as the coming depletion of the " surplus " in their trust funds , guarantees that the FairTax rate will certainly have to be raised .
The insolvency of Medicare has been compounded , of course , by one of the greatest expansions of the welfare state since the Great Society , the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 — which Congressman Linder voted for .
The only things currently exempted from the FairTax are tuition and job - related training courses .
The demand to expand this exemption to food will certainly be the first and the loudest that we hear .
And since we know how unpredictable and irrational Congress is , there is no telling what will come next .
Then it will be exemptions on certain goods and services if they are used for certain purposes or purchased by certain types of companies .
The FairTax system includes a monthly payment from the federal government given to all households called a " prebate " that reimburses each household for the national sales tax paid on basic necessities .
The elimination of this prebate for the rich and upper - income taxpayers will be one of the first changes made to the FairTax plan .
A means test will certainly follow .
Since the amount of the prebate is tied to the annually adjusted government poverty level , it will go up every year for everyone .
And we can count on pressure to raise the prebate by a greater amount for certain income groups like seniors on fixed incomes , the poor with low incomes , anyone receiving public assistance , anyone making the minimum wage , or anyone who would have qualified for the earned income credit under the old income tax system .
Additionally , what makes FairTax advocates think that we wo n't end up with both a federal sales tax and a federal income tax ?
Most countries with a VAT also have an income tax .
Adopting the FairTax does n't mean that the income tax could n't be reimposed .
Congress might simply decide to resurrect the income tax because it is not politically expedient to raise the rate of the FairTax .
This could be implemented by lowering the rate of the FairTax , reinstituting the income tax , and then claiming that the combination of the two was revenue neutral .
And even if the Sixteenth Amendment were repealed , there is nothing preventing Congress from implementing some form of an income tax , as the Foundation for Economic Education 's Sheldon Richman has recently explained in great detail .
A Personal Note
I should say here that I have nothing to gain from keeping our current tax system .
FairTax proponents often maintain that anyone who opposes the FairTax system wants to keep the current system because he has some financial interest in doing so .
I have no vested interest in the current tax code .
I do not have a fortune tied up in the perks of the current tax code .
I despise our income tax system .
I do n't like its rates , its brackets , its complexity , it intrusiveness , and its use as a mechanism for wealth confiscation and redistribution .
I agree with every negative thing that any FairTaxer has ever said about the current US tax code .
I have no financial interest in maintaining the current system .
I do not own stock in tax preparation companies .
I am not threatened by tax reform .
Although I have degrees in economics and accounting , I am neither an economist nor a CPA .
And although I occasionally teach financial accounting at a local community college , I fail to see how that predisposes me to want to stay with the current tax system .
I have also been accused by FairTax promoters of rejecting their plan because it is not perfect or does n't eliminate taxes altogether .
Although I believe that taxation is theft , I am not naïve enough to think that taxes will ever be eliminated .
I would gladly support any tax reform plan as long as it substantially lowered tax rates or the total amount of taxes collected .
I am not waiting for the perfect tax reform plan that will never come .
I do not have an " all - or - nothing " attitude when it comes to tax reform .
I am in favor of working Americans keeping as much of their money as possible out of the hands of the federal government and in their pockets .
I am not a critic of the FairTax because it does n't do enough ; I am a critic of the FairTax because it cannot be considered an incremental step toward lower tax rates or lower overall taxes .
It is not even a step in the right direction .
The FairTax is a cure worse than our diseased income tax system .
As for a better proposal , I have given a simple one in " Real Tax Reform " that completely eliminates the personal income tax .
Heck , I would even support a national sales tax plan if it actually resulted in significant reductions in tax rates or taxes collected .
FairTax : Lies
Now we can get back to Boortz 's new book : FairTax : Truth , Answering the Critics .
" If the FairTax has one shortcoming , " says Boortz , " it 's that it 's easy to attack . " [ 7 ]
Boortz makes the attack on the FairTax even easier because of some of the outrageous things he says in the book .
First , the same grandiose claims for the FairTax are made in this sequel as were made in Boortz 's original work :
Interest rates could decline by as much as 24 percent with the FairTax . [ 8 ]
American capital stock would almost double by 2100 . [ 9 ]
The most massive transfer of power from government to the people in the history of our country . [ 10 ]
Companies would rush to our shores to build manufacturing facilities so they too could sell in a global economy with no hidden taxes inflating their prices . [ 11 ]
Revenues to Social Security and Medicare would double , as we double the size of the economy in less than fifteen years . [ 12 ]
Will the FairTax also cure disease and usher in world peace ?
Second , the FairTax turns out to be fairer to some industries than to others .
Boortz claims that " a plan like the FairTax ensures industry neutrality . " [ 13 ]
The FairTax " applies to absolutely all consumer purchases , so no one industry will feel advantaged or disadvantaged . " [ 14 ]
It " should not completely untax one sector , the service sector , while taxing the other . " [ 15 ]
Fairness " means that all commerce is treated equally . " [ 16 ]
Boortz and his coauthors feel so strongly about all this that they 're " going to try to impose a supermajority requirement before Congress can exclude or exempt any good or service from the FairTax . " [ 17 ]
Yet , there are two services that are specifically exempted from the FairTax : education and training .
These are defined in the Fair Tax Act of 2007 ( H.R. 25 ) as " tuition for primary , secondary , or postsecondary level education , and job - related training courses . "
The reasoning behind this is that education is considered to be " investment , not consumption . " [ 18 ]
This brings us to the FairTax 's other exemptions : exports , business purposes , and investment purposes .
Under the FairTax , exports for use or consumption outside the United States are not taxable .
" Business purposes " is defined in the Fair Tax Act of 2007 as " ( 1 ) for resale , ( 2 ) to produce , provide , render , or sell taxable property or services , or ( 3 ) in furtherance of other bona fide business purposes . "
" Investment purposes " is defined as " property purchased exclusively for purposes of appreciation or the production of income but not entailing more than minor personal efforts . "
I guess the " Problem Resolution Office " set up under the FairTax plan will have to define what " bona fide business purposes " actually means .
Third , even though we will be forced to pay the FairTax on all new goods and services , Boortz calls it a voluntary tax ; yet , he gets upset when the government refers to the Social Security tax withheld from our pay as a " contribution " since " contributions are voluntary . " [ 19 ]
Boortz makes the ridiculous claim that " under the FairTax , every citizen becomes a voluntary taxpayer , paying as much as he or she chooses , when he or she chooses , and how he or she chooses to spend . " [ 20 ]
But what if I volunteer not to pay the FairTax , or choose to pay only a one percent rate , or choose to pay the tax next year , or choose to spend my money on new items without paying the FairTax ?
Obviously , this would be impossible since the FairTax is a voluntary tax only in the sense that the income tax is a voluntary tax ( if you do n't earn income you do n't have to pay any income tax ) .
After saying that " contributions are voluntary , " Boortz remarks : " Try telling the IRS that you want to stop volunteering to pay your Social Security tax .
Then please write to let us know how that works out for you . "
Well , try telling the Sales Tax Bureau ( the name for the IRS under the FairTax ) that you want to stop volunteering to pay your FairTax .
Then please write to let us know how that works out for you .
You will be subject to fines and imprisonment either way .
How can any FairTax advocate say with a straight face that paying the FairTax is voluntary ?
Fourth , Boortz laments that we " now work almost to May " to fulfill our tax obligations .
[ 21 ]
In a footnote he mentions that this is the Tax Foundation 's " Tax Freedom Day . "
Yet , since " the FairTax is simply a dollar - for - dollar replacement of our current income - based revenue system with a consumption - based revenue system , " [ 22 ] wo n't people still have to " work almost to May " to cover their taxes ?
The taxes might be paid differently , but they will still be paid .
If the government still gets the same amount of tax money , someone will still be working " almost to May " to pay his taxes .
Indeed , someone might be working almost to June , for Boortz admits that someone might " owe more in taxes in the first year of a FairTax system " than he does today . [ 23 ]
Fifth , Boortz three times makes the claim that the current tax code contains 67,000 pages . [ 24 ]
This is up from the 54,000 pages that is claimed in " An Open Letter to the President , the Congress , and the American people " written a few years ago and posted on the FairTax website .
( The open letter is also printed in its entirety in the new Boortz book . [ 25 ] )
This figure is also higher than the 65,000 pages claimed by Leo Linbeck , the chairman and CEO of Americans for Fair Taxation , in a September 2007 letter to FairTax volunteers . [ 26 ]
The federal tax code is found in Title 26 , " Internal Revenue , " of the US Code of Federal Regulations .
My local university library has a twenty - one volume set of Title 26 of the United States Code Annotated ( West Group , 2002 ) that contains a total of 15,050 pages , and that includes " annotations from Federal and State Courts . "
Now , that is still 15,050 pages too many , but it is certainly not 54,000 or 65,000 or 67,000 pages .
But the 133 - page FairTax bill does n't replace the complete tax code anyway .
It repeals subtitle A ( income tax and self - employment taxes ) , subtitle B ( estate and gift taxes ) , subtitle C ( payroll taxes and withholding of income taxes ) , and subtitle H ( financing of presidential elections ) .
Then it redesignates subtitles D , E , F , G , I , J , and K as B , C , D , E , F , G , and H .
The new subtitle A is the FairTax .
Sixth , Boortz is adamant that the FairTax is revenue neutral : " The FairTax is simply a dollar - for - dollar replacement of our current income - based revenue system with a consumption - based revenue system . " [ 27 ]
The government " would collect the same amount of tax revenue as it does today under our current individual and corporate tax system of income taxes . " [ 28 ]
But if that is true then how does the government have the money to give every household a monthly rebate ( the " prebate " ) for reimbursement of the national sales tax paid on basic necessities ?
The prebate is not included in the federal budget right now , yet Boortz maintains that " the cost of the rebate most certainly is included " when figuring the necessary rate for the FairTax . [ 29 ]
Boortz gives the cost of the prebate as $ 489 billion . [ 30 ]
This means that whatever the federal budget is right now , it is going to have to be increased by $ 489 billion to pay for the prebate .
That 's almost half a trillion dollars .
The FairTax may in fact raise enough money to pay for the prebate , but it is not accurate to call it a revenue - neutral plan when it will take from the taxpayers an additional $ 489 billion .
Seventh , FairTax proponents tell us over and over again that the IRS will be eliminated under the FairTax system .
The back cover of Boortz 's new book repeats this claim .
Yet , buried in a footnote is Boortz 's admission that " implementation of the FairTax does n't mean complete annihilation of the IRS . " [ 31 ]
Boortz wants the IRS to continue collecting income taxes that were due before the adoption of the FairTax since " passage of the FairTax should n't be viewed as an amnesty for tax cheats . " [ 32 ]
We know that will have the IRS until 2011 since the FairTax bill states that " appropriations for any expenses of the Internal Revenue Service … for fiscal years after fiscal year 2011 shall not be authorized . "
But under the FairTax , the IRS will still be with us after 2011 — it will just be called by another name .
Title III of the FairTax bill mandates the setting up of an " Excise Tax Bureau " to administer excise taxes not administered by the BATF , and a " Sales Tax Bureau " to administer the national sales tax implemented by the FairTax .
Eighth , Boortz condemns a progressive tax system as being Marxist , but commends the FairTax for being a progressive tax system .
He claims to be against using the tax code " for wealth confiscation and redistribution . " [ 33 ]
He shows that the rich pay the lion 's share of income taxes . [ 34 ]
He rightly concludes that " hard work and productivity " are taxed under our current system . [ 35 ]
He correctly points out that our " progressive " system comes right out of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto . [ 36 ]
But then Boortz says that the FairTax prebate is " highly progressive , " and that the FairTax " introduces many progressive elements into our fiscal system . " [ 37 ]
He even maintains that " the FairTax could be even more progressive than our current system . " [ 38 ]
He then favorably quotes economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff on just how progressive the FairTax plan really is :
[ M ]y preferred reform is the FairTax , which has three highly progressive elements .
First , thanks to the [ p ] rebate , poor households would pay no sales taxes in net terms .
Second , the reform eliminates our highly regressive FICA tax .
Third , the sales tax will effectively tax wealth as well as wages . [ 39 ]
In light of what Boortz says about Karl Marx and progressive taxes , I guess we can call the FairTax a Marxist plan .
The FairTax Rate
The rate of the FairTax is about 30 percent ( to be more precise , 29.87 % ) .
However , by employing a little FairTax new math , the rate is given by FairTax proponents as 23 percent .
Sometimes the caveat is added that the rate is figured inclusively ( the tax is included in the price of the product ) rather than exclusively ( the tax is added to the price of the product ) .
Obviously , it is much easier to sell a national sales tax if the rate is 23 percent instead of 30 percent .
Boortz devotes almost eight pages of inclusive / exclusive smoke and mirrors in the book to answering the criticism that the FairTax rate is actually 30 percent .
He begins by correctly noting that opponents of the FairTax " have argued that we 're misleading America on the FairTax rate . " [ 40 ]
However , he insists it is the critics of the FairTax that are playing a game . [ 41 ]
We are " playing on the confusion that exists between an inclusive and an exclusive sales tax . " [ 42 ]
This confusion " is exacerbated by the fact that virtually every one of the forty - five states that collect a sales tax computes that sales tax on an exclusive basis . " [ 43 ]
Boortz considers it a " mistake " to calculate the FairTax the same way the forty - five states with a sales tax " calculate their sales tax , by adding the tax to the price of the item at the cash register . " [ 44 ]
He entreats the " folks " at the Mises Institute to " check their math " since the Institute has " published stories citing the 30 percent argument . " [ 45 ]
Gee , I wonder what " stories " that would be ?
Perhaps " The Fair Tax Fraud , " " There Is No Such Thing As a Fair Tax , " and " The Fraudulent Tax " ?
The justification given for the sleight of hand perpetrated by promoters of the FairTax is that since the FairTax is intended to replace the income tax , which is figured inclusively , the FairTax rate should likewise be figured inclusively .
Boortz even implores us to " compare apples to apples . " [ 46 ]
If we want to quote our " precious income tax " inclusively , then we should " do the same for the FairTax . "
" Is n't it logical , " asks Boortz , " not to mention honest , to quote the FairTax on the same basis that the taxes it is designed to replace are quoted ? "
Well , no it 's not .
In fact , it would be illogical and dishonest .
Comparing the rate of an income tax with the rate of a sales tax is like comparing apples and oranges .
About all you can say is that the income tax and the sales tax are both taxes just as apples and oranges are both fruits .
Boortz makes it seem as if one has the option of figuring a tax rate either inclusively or exclusively .
This is nonsense .
Income taxes , like Social Security and Medicare taxes , are figured inclusively because they are figured on the amount of one 's income being taxed .
They would not be figured any other way .
If one were assessed a rate of 15 percent on one 's taxable income , then , where i represents taxable income and t represents the amount of tax due :
. 15 i = t
Although the same result would be obtained if one figured the amount of tax due on the same income with an exclusive rate of 17.65 percent , it would entail this math problem :
. 1765 ( i — t ) = t
. 1765 i - .1765t = t
. 1765 i = t + . 1765t
. 1765 i = 1.1765t
. 15 i = t
It would be a mistake to say that the amount of tax due should be figured inclusively because taxes are included in the dollar amount being taxed .
First , the amount of tax due is based on one 's taxable income , not total income .
The taxes paid come out of one 's total income , and may not include any taxable income .
And second , even if one were taxed on his total income , the money to pay the amount of tax due might not come out of total income at all .
It might come out of a savings account or be paid with a credit card .
Now , if one were assessed a rate of 29.87 percent on the purchase of an item , then , where i represents the item purchased and t represents the amount of tax due :
. 2987 i = t
Although the same result would be obtained if one figured the amount of tax due on the same item with an inclusive of 23 percent , it would entail this math problem :
. 23 ( i + t ) = t
. 23 i + .23t = t
. 23 i = t - .
23t
. 23 i = .77t
. 2987 i = t
Comparing whatever the rate of the FairTax is with the rate of the income tax bracket one is in ( 10 , 15 , 25 , 28 , 33 , and 35 percent ) is ludicrous .
The only way to truly compare the FairTax and the income tax is to figure the percentage of one 's total yearly income paid in taxes ( federal , state , and local ) under each system , ceteris paribus .
The inescapable conclusion is that the 23 percent rate of the FairTax is a ruse to sell the tax .
But it gets worse .
The FairTax artificially broadens the tax base to maintain the fiction that only a 23 percent national sales tax rate will be required to maintain current revenues by requiring governments to pay taxes on goods purchased and salaries paid .
State and local governments will pay taxes to federal government , and the federal government will pay taxes to itself .
This will result in state and local governments having to raise their taxes to cover the taxes they would have to pay to the federal government .
But if the FairTax is revenue neutral , where will the federal government get the extra billions of dollars to pay the FairTax to itself ?
If that , like the prebate , is already factored into the FairTax , then , once again , it is not accurate to call the FairTax a revenue - neutral plan when it will require the taxpayers to fork over billions more than they do now .
Just who is the one playing a game ?
Whether one thinks the FairTax rate is 23 percent or 30 percent , the fact remains that it will cost every American an extra 30 cents on the dollar to purchase a new good or service under the proposed FairTax .
And regardless of whether the rate is 23 or 30 percent , some economists do n't think either of these rates would be high enough to achieve nirvana — that is , revenue neutrality .
In fact , one economist estimated that the rate would have to be as high as 44 percent .
Price Deflation
As mentioned previously , Boortz believes that " perhaps the biggest FairTax myth concerns the cost of living and the size of your take - home pay . "
FairTax proponents generally claim that the removal of embedded taxes will result in the prices of goods and services falling by enough ( about 22 % ) to offset the amount of the FairTax imposed .
There are actually two issues here : the amount of embedded taxes and the amount by which their removal would cause prices to fall .
Advocates of the FairTax are correct that the current price of consumer products includes embedded taxes , but they are mistaken concerning their amount and their effect if removed .
There are just not enough embedded taxes to be removed to offset the FairTax .
Personal income taxes , which account for almost half of all federal revenues , are borne by consumers , not embedded in product costs .
The FairTax would not eliminate federal excise taxes on things like gasoline .
It is mainly corporate income taxes and the employer share of social insurance taxes that are embedded taxes .
On the issue of the amount by which the removal of embedded taxes would cause price deflation , I have already pointed out in " The Fraudulent Tax , " and in great detail , that the " Harvard study " that Boortz refers to in his books talked about the fall of producer prices , not consumer prices .
I also showed that the fall in producer prices was an estimate , as was the effect of this fall on consumer prices .
We know for certain that under the FairTax system retail prices will increase by 30 percent ; however , we do n't know for sure how much they will decrease after the embedded costs of taxes in the prices of goods are removed .
There is also the misconception that prices of all goods and services will fall across the board once these embedded taxes are removed .
In practice , however , wages and prices are fairly rigid .
Even if it were true that prices would fall enough to offset the imposition of a national sales tax , no one knows for sure how long before this would happen .
The result in the meantime would be higher prices for goods and services .
But never fear , for even if prices do n't fall as much as expected , everyone will get a raise in the form of increased take - home pay and a monthly prebate from the government to help pay the sales tax on all the new goods and services they purchase .
Says Boortz : " With the combination of higher take - home pay , lower pretax prices , and the prebate , people will have the money to pay the tax — and they 'll be willing to do it . "
The higher take - home pay under the FairTax would result from the elimination of all withholding taxes .
However , we have a problem .
The portion of the employee 's paycheck formerly withheld and sent to the government as taxes can't be returned to him and used by his employer to cut costs ( and therefore prices , according to FairTaxers ) .
Boortz explains :
What we 're saying here is that in any case where the employees are willing to allow their current tax payments to be retained by and used by their employers to lower the price of production , prices of goods and services can fall — on average — by 22 percent .
Conversely , in any case where products or service prices do n't fall by 22 percent , it would be because workers decide to convert their federal tax burden into personal income — thus experiencing a sometimes substantial increase in their take - home pay .
But if prices do n't fall by 22 percent , then it will not be enough to offset the amount of the FairTax imposed .
Therefore , the FairTax may result in higher prices after all .
Boortz even warns us about these prices : " Reality warns us against promising a universal 22 percent reduction in retail prices . "
Boortz presents us with three possible scenarios .
One , employers reduce their costs by pocketing what used to be withheld from their employees ' paychecks .
Two , employers increase their employees ' paychecks by the amount of taxes previously withheld .
And three , employers increase their employees ' paychecks by what was withheld and an amount equal to the matching payroll taxes that the employers previously paid .
Yet , even though Boortz says a combination of the first two scenarios is " most likely , " he still insists that " the application of the 23 percent embedded FairTax would bring all of our purchasing power back to just about where we are right now . "
The Real Issue
As I have emphasized every time I have written about taxes , the fundamental problem is taxation itself , not the tax code .
Yes , the tax code is too complex , too intrusive , and too long .
Yes , compliance costs are too high .
Yes , the tax code punishes success .
But since the FairTax is a tax reform proposal instead of a tax reduction proposal , it merely changes the way that taxes are collected .
With the federal budget now topping $ 3 trillion , and the national debt fast approaching $ 10 trillion , the need of the hour is clearly to rein in government spending , not change the way the government raises its revenue — or give it more revenue as the FairTax would do .
" The real issue , " as Congressman Ron Paul has so often said , " is total spending by government , not tax reform . "
Taxes should be repealed or reduced , not replaced or reformed .
Advocates of liberty and less government should focus not on fairness but on lowness .
The term fair is extremely subjective .
Just what exactly is " fair " ?
And who is going to decide what is " fair " ?
Boortz himself acknowledges in his new book : " Whether a tax system is ' fair ' is a complicated economic and philosophical question , one that inevitably involves oversimplification and subjective judgment . "
But as he also points out : " low tax rates are good tax policy , " and " lower tax rates are good for the economy . "
Boortz 's focus in FairTax : The Truth is wrong because his whole philosophy on taxation is wrong .
He maintains that " the goal of the FairTax movement is not to strangle the life out of government by depriving it of needed revenue . "
The only problem with this is that the government now says it " needs " over $ 3 trillion a year — at least 90 percent of which cannot be justified by the Constitution .
Boortz has a warped view of what happens when taxpayers keep more of their money : " State governments lost about $ 23 billion in tax collections on Internet sales in 2001 . "
He also argues that government handouts and tax credits are " functionally exactly the same thing " since the government has " less in its coffers than it otherwise would . "
Boortz actually believes that prosperity can be spread by the adoption of a tax plan instead of the absence of a tax plan :
Our vision for tomorrow is an America with a tax system that can be used to spread freedom across the world .
The FairTax is a great hope for the future of the American economy .
Although Boortz and company remarked in the beginning of their book : " We feel confident that we can convert many of our critics with clear explanations of what the FairTax really is — and what it is not , " after carefully reading FairTax : The Truth , this critic remains unconverted .
There is still no such thing as a fair tax .

RFP asks developers to create a game for fun
by Pixeleen Mistral , National Affairs desk
Friday , NASA released an RFP seeking a partner to help create a massively multiplayer online game to help teach science and engineering .
The project has been seen as an exciting opportunity since it was initially announced in 2007 – a promised $ 3 million budget could have something to do that .
The level of interest was such that rumors of over a hundred responses to an RFI issued in January of this year seem credible .
But joy in the metaverse development community was short - lived , after it was clear that NASA ’s MMO development partner is expected to create and maintain the MMO for free – or to use NASA ’s language a “ non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement ( defined as one with no exchange of funds ) ” .
Of course , the development partner will get something from the experience – as the RFP points out , “ In exchange for a collaborator ’s investment to create and manage a NASA - based MMO game for fun and to enhance STEM , NASA will consider negotiating brand placement , limited exclusivity and other opportunities ” .
This would suggest that the ideal development partner will be able to pay employees not with dollars , but with fun .
As one source put it , “ NASA is not putting any money into this project at all .
They will be graciously granting the rights to demand certain conditions be met by whom ever they choose , and yet will be providing no money .
None for development , none for support .
What ever happened to that $ 3 million we read about a year ago ?!? ”
We have to wonder – if there is no money changing hands – does NASA even need an RFP ?
Since this is all about having free fun , perhaps NASA should let anyone participate – the more the merrier !
Highlighting the efforts of some of the country 's best teachers , professors , instructors , coaches and principals , who take their job to another level to help a new generation of Americans .

Featuring everything from argonauts to astronomy , theme hotels and themed hotel rooms have popped up all over the world in recent years in order to accommodate niche groups of travelers with a passion for certain sports , musicians , places and general interests .
Some of these are situated near the world ’s best theme parks and are devoted to creating a fun atmosphere for all ages .
Others are five - star luxury hotels that use subtle decor to hint at the theme that they are trying to project .
And still others are truly out - there niche hotels themed around oddities like physics and even death !
Take a look at seven of the best theme hotels out there .
Guest author Andrew Boyd has a passion for travel , especially cheap holidays somewhere interesting , including theme , castle and art hotels .
Le Meridien Cambridge [ MA , United States ]
This hotel , better known as the [ email protected ] , is a technology and physics themed hotel designed around the major fields of study at the nearby tech school .
Pictures of famous physicists in the bedrooms , bedspreads designed with mathematical equations and robots serving as sculptural art in the lobby are all symbols that lend themselves well to the overall theme of the hotel .
Le Monde Hotel [ Edinburgh , Scotland ]
This hotel is themed around the idea that you can travel around the world without leaving your hotel .
Each of the rooms is decorated to illicit the feeling that you are in a specific city somewhere else in the world .
There are also themed bars to create the sensation that you are a globetrotting party animal .
And , of course , there are theme restaurants with cuisine from the city around which they are based : dine in Paris , drink in Shanghai and then fall asleep in Miami .
Santa Isabel @ Europa Park [ Germany ]

Park is one of the world ’s largest theme parks so it ’s fitting that there are a series of theme hotels associated with the location .
While many people choose to go to the more established theme hotels ( like the ancient Roman hotel called Colosseo ) , the most interesting of the hotels is the new Santa Isabel hotel .
Themed around the concept of a Portuguese monastery , it has all of the amenities of a four star hotel but still hints at the simple historic charm of the homes made by monks .
Hard Days Night Hotel [ Liverpool , England ]
There are millions of people who love The Beatles and a large percentage of them would be thrilled to stay in a hotel devoted entirely to the legendary band .
If you ’re one of those folks then you need to take yourself to this hotel which began development in 2004 and finally opened earlier this year .
If you want to go all out , you should book into one of the two penthouse suites suitably called The Lennon Suite and McCartney Suite , of course .
And if you think John and Yoko are the couple to live up to then you can get married in the wedding chapel at this luxury theme hotel !
Hotel Pelirocco [ Brighton Beach , England ]
This hotel starts off as a theme hotel devoted to rock ‘n roll but it takes things a step further and extends the theme to include all pop subculture .
The nineteen art rooms in the hotel are all based on different aspects of the pop star or rock star ’s way of life .
There ’s an Asbolut vodka room for the rocker who likes to drink .
There ’s a pin-up parlor for the star who loves the ladies .
There ’s a tropical room for the star that needs to get away .
And there ’s a Jamie Reed room named and decorated after the punk rock visionary .
Argonaut Hotel [ CA , United States ]
San Francisco is a city nearly surrounded by water so it ’s no surprise that it has a hotel themed around the maritime history of the place .
Argonaut Hotel is housed within a historic building called the Haslett Warehouse which overlooks the historic ships docked at the city ’s Maritime National Historic Park .
The luxury hotel ( situated in the Fisherman ’s Wharf neighborhood ) has all of the amenities you could possible need from spas to gourmet snacks , but maintains a strong link with the history of the region .
Astronomer ’s Inn [ AZ , United States ]
If the theme that gets you all hot and bothered is to be out and about amidst the stars then you might want to stay in a bed - and - breakfast devoted to the art of astronomy .
These accommodations are situated right next door to an observatory and provide all of the amenities necessary to create the perfect star - gazing situation .
Rooftop telescopes , guided tours of the night sky and a peaceful ambience are all conducive to helping you gain an understanding of the constellations above you .
There are four suites to choose from for enhancing your stay :
The Galaxy Room , The Astronomer ’s Studio , The Egyptian Room and The Garden Room .
No matter which suite you pick , you ’ll have an out - of - this - world hotel stay .
ALBANY  Verizon , Sprint and Time Warner Cable have agreed to purge their servers of Internet bulletin boards and Web sites nationwide that disseminate child pornography .
The move is part of a groundbreaking agreement with the New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , that will be formally announced on Tuesday as a significant step by leading companies to curtail access to child pornography .
Many in the industry have previously resisted similar efforts , saying they could not be responsible for content online , given the decentralized and largely unmonitored nature of the Internet .
The agreements will affect customers not just in New York but throughout the country .
Verizon and Time Warner Cable are two of the nation ’s five largest service providers , with roughly 16 million customers between them .
Negotiations are continuing with other service providers , Mr. Cuomo said .
The companies have agreed to shut down access to newsgroups that traffic in pornographic images of children on one of the oldest outposts of the Internet , known as Usenet .
Usenet began nearly 30 years ago and was one of the earliest ways to swap information online , but as the World Wide Web blossomed , Usenet was largely supplanted by it , becoming a favored back alley for those who traffic in illicit material .

Explanation : Eta Carinae , one of the most massive and unstable stars in the Milky Way Galaxy , has a profound effect on its environment .
Found in the South Pillar region of the Carina Nebula , these fantastic pillars of glowing dust and gas with embedded newborn stars were sculpted by the intense wind and radiation from Eta Carinae and other massive stars .
Glowing brightly in planet Earth 's southern sky , the expansive Eta Carinae Nebula is a mere 10,000 light - years distant .
Still , this remarkable cosmic vista is largely obscured by nebular dust and only revealed here in penetrating infrared light by the Spitzer Space Telescope .
Eta Carinae itself is off the top left of the false - color image , with the bright - tipped dust pillars pointing suggestively toward the massive star 's position .
The Spitzer image spans almost 200 light - years at the distance of Eta Carinae .

Protesters in Ukraine burn Bush in effigy

Several thousand people rallied outside of the U.S. Embassy in the Ukraine , ahead of a visit by President George W. Bush .
One group in the crowd burned an effigy of Bush , shouting for him to leave and not pull the Ukraine into NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
A banner behind the protesters -- many of whom carried the familiar red flag of the former Soviet Union -- read , " Yankee Go Home ! "
Bush was prepared to offer backing to Ukraine 's membership in NATO while on the official visit .
Russia warned NATO last week that further encroachment into its former Soviet neighbors such as Georgia and Ukraine was tantamount to " playing with fire . "
Study : Girls in Sexist Societies Worse at Math
The larger a country 's gender gap , the worse girls perform in math , study says .
May 29 , 2008  --
For decades , researchers and educators have debated why boys tend to perform better than girls in math .
Are men naturally more logical creatures and thus better at scientific endeavors ?
Are girls not encouraged by their families , their friends or society at large to pursue scientific careers ?
Researchers believe they may have found at least one answer : where girls live .
Girls living in countries where there is more gender equality perform better in math , sometimes outpacing boys , than girls who live in countries with more male - dominated societies .
" In societies which are more gender equal , there is a lower gender gap in mathematics , " said Paola Sapienza , an associate finance professor at Northwestern University 's Kellogg School of Management and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Science .
Also , " there is a much higher gender gap in reading .
Girls become much better in reading " in these countries .
Click here to see more detailed information .
To conduct the study , Sapienza , along with Luigi Guiso at the Instituto Universitario Europeo and Ferdinando Monte and Luigi Zingales at the University of Chicago , examined boys ' and girls ' test scores worldwide on the same test , using data from the Programme for International Test Assessment .
The program provided its 2003 test data from more than 276,000 students from 40 countries around the world .
According to that data , girls worldwide scored on average 10.5 points lower than boys ( or 2 percent lower than boys ) in math .
In reading , on average , girls outscored boys by 32.7 points ( or 6.6 percent higher than boys ) .
The United States fell in line with the worldwide average .
In the United States , American girls scored 9.8 points lower than boys in math .
" These are what we called the gender gaps in math and in reading , " Sapienza said .
Generally , there are two explanations for the gender gap in math , according to Sapienza : biological and environmental .
The biological reasoning says that boys are naturally better in math based on research involving spatial tests .
" It 's not very strong evidence because we do n't have strong correlation between spatial abilities and math scores , " she said .
The environmental - based reasoning posits that girls do n't perform as well in math because there are n't enough societal incentives to go into science .
Sapienza and her colleagues then parsed the test data by country ; in certain countries , the gender gap did n't hold up and the team wondered why .
" The gender gap in mathematics disappeared [ in some countries ] .
Basically , boys and girls become similar in terms of statistical evidence , " she said .
" In the same countries where math difference disappeared , the reading gap in girls got better . "
Because the culture in each country was different , the researchers then began to look at the gender equality in each country .
To do this , they took stats from the World Economic Forum 's Gender Gap Index , which measures how women score in access to health and professional resources , and from a World Values Survey , which measures residents ' opinions on topics such as women in the work force , school or politics .
" The interesting thing is these two measures correlate , " Sapienza said .
" It 's reassuring .
They should be measuring pretty much the same thing . "
According to Sapienza , she and her colleagues were somewhat surprised by the findings .
" At some level , we were looking for it , " she said .
" We were surprised at how strong the correlation was . "
The highest performer in math was Iceland , which also has high gender equality index .
Girls in that country outscored boys by more than 14 points .
In Turkey , which scored low in gender gap equality , girls performed the worst : on average , 22.6 fewer points than boys .
Not every country proved the theory , however .
In Indonesia and Thailand , both of which scored low in gender equality , girls outscored boys in math .
Although the study points to at least some environmental influence on girls ' math performance , Sapienza stopped short of saying societies ' gender equality caused the uptick in math performance , an important distinction for a scientist .
" What we established is the correlation .
It 's very hard to claim that the moment we change gender quality the math and reading gaps are going to change , " she said .
As a woman , she said the results made her happy .
" There 's at least a hint this is driven by cultures .
So it may be possibly to modify [ gender gap ] in some societies and that 's good news for everybody , " she said .

It ’s time to define the new era .
Our faith has been shaken .
We ’ve lost confidence in our leaders and in our institutions .
Our beliefs have been tested .
We ’ve discredited the notion that the Internet would change everything ( and the stock market would buy us an exit strategy from the grind ) .
Our expectations have been dashed .
We ’ve abandoned the idea that work should be a 24 - hour - a - day rush and that careers should be a wild adventure .
Yet we ’re still holding on .
advertisement
advertisement
We ’re seduced by the idea that picking up the pieces and simply tweaking the formula will get the party started again .
In spite of our best thinking and most searing experience , our ideas about growth and success are mired in a boom - bust mentality .
Just as LBOs gave way to IPOs , the market is primed for the next engine of wealth creation .
Just as we traded in the pinstripes and monster bonuses of the Wall Street era for T - shirts and a piece of the action during the startup revolution , we ’re waiting to latch on to the new trappings of success .
( I understand the inclination .
I ’ve surfed from one boom to the next for most of my working life — from my early days as a bond trader to my most recent career as a writer tracking the migration of my generation from Wall Street to Silicon Valley . )
There ’s a way out .
Instead of focusing on what ’s next , let ’s get back to what ’s first .
The previous era of business was defined by the question , Where ’s the opportunity ?
I ’m convinced that business success in the future starts with the question , What should I do with my life ?
Yes , that ’s right .
The most obvious and universal question on our plates as human beings is the most urgent and pragmatic approach to sustainable success in our organizations .
People do n’t succeed by migrating to a “ hot ” industry ( one word : dotcom ) or by adopting a particular career - guiding mantra ( remember “ horizontal careers ” ? ) .
They thrive by focusing on the question of who they really are — and connecting that to work that they truly love ( and , in so doing , unleashing a productive and creative power that they never imagined ) .
Companies do n’t grow because they represent a particular sector or adopt the latest management approach .
They win because they engage the hearts and minds of individuals who are dedicated to answering that life question .
This is not a new idea .
But it may be the most powerfully pressing one ever to be disrespected by the corporate world .
There are far too many smart , educated , talented people operating at quarter speed , unsure of their place in the world , contributing far too little to the productive engine of modern civilization .
There are far too many people who look like they have their act together but have yet to make an impact .
You know who you are .
It comes down to a simple gut check :
You either love what you do or you do n’t .
Period .
Those who are lit by that passion are the object of envy among their peers and the subject of intense curiosity .
They are the source of good ideas .
They make the extra effort .
They demonstrate the commitment .
They are the ones who , day by day , will rescue this drifting ship .
And they will be rewarded .
With money , sure , and responsibility , undoubtedly .
But with something even better too : the kind of satisfaction that comes with knowing your place in the world .
We are sitting on a huge potential boom in productivity — if we could just get the square pegs out of the round holes .
Of course , addressing the question , What should I do with my life ?
is n’t just a productivity issue :
It ’s a moral imperative .
It ’s how we hold ourselves accountable to the opportunity we ’re given .
Most of us are blessed with the ultimate privilege :
We get to be true to our individual nature .
Our economy is so vast that we do n’t have to grind it out forever at jobs we hate .
For the most part , we get to choose .
That choice is n’t about a career search so much as an identity quest .
Asking The Question aspires to end the conflict between who you are and what you do .
There is nothing more brave than filtering out the chatter that tells you to be someone you ’re not .
There is nothing more genuine than breaking away from the chorus to learn the sound of your own voice .
Asking
The Question is nothing short of an act of courage :
It requires a level of commitment and clarity that is almost foreign to our working lives .
During the past two years , I have listened to the life stories of more than 900 people who have dared to be honest with themselves .
Of those , I chose 70 to spend considerable time with in order to learn how they did it .
Complete strangers opened their lives and their homes to me .
I slept on their couches .
We went running together .
They cried in my arms .
We traded secrets .
I met their families .
I went to one ’s wedding .
I witnessed many critical turning points .
advertisement
These are ordinary people .
People of all ages , classes , and professions — from a catfish farmer in Mississippi to a toxic - waste inspector in the oil fields of Texas , from a police officer in East Los Angeles to a long - haul trucker in Pennsylvania , from a financier in Hong Kong to a minister at a church on the Oregon coast .
These people do n’t have any resources or character traits that give them an edge in pursuing their dream .
Some have succeeded ; many have not .
Only two have what accountants call “ financial independence . ”
Only two are so smart that they would succeed at anything they chose ( though having more choices makes answering The Question that much harder ) .
Only one , to me , is saintly .
They ’re just people who faced up to it , armed with only their weaknesses , equipped with only their fears .
What I learned from them was far more powerful than what I had expected or assumed .
The first assumption to get busted was the notion that certain jobs are inherently cool and that others are uncool .
That was a big shift for me .
Throughout the 1990s , my basic philosophy was this : Work=Boring , but Work + Speed + Risk=Cool .
Speed and risk transformed the experience into something so stimulating , so exciting , so intense , that we began to believe that those qualities defined “ good work . ”
Now , betrayed by the reality of economic uncertainty and global instability , we ’re casting about for what really matters when it comes to work .
On my journey , I met people in bureaucratic organizations and bland industries who were absolutely committed to their work .
That commitment sustained them through slow stretches and setbacks .
They never watched the clock , never dreaded Mondays , never worried about the years passing by .
They did n’t wonder where they belonged in life .
They were phenomenally productive and confident in their value .
In places unusual and unexpected , they had found their calling , and those callings were as idiosyncratic as each individual .
And this is where the second big insight came in :
Your calling is n’t something you inherently “ know , ” some kind of destiny .
Far from it .
Almost all of the people I interviewed found their calling after great difficulty .
They had made mistakes before getting it right .
For instance , the catfish farmer used to be an investment banker , the truck driver had been an entertainment lawyer , a chef had been an academic , and the police officer was a Harvard MBA .
Everyone discovered latent talents that were n’t in their skill sets at age 25 .
Most of us do n’t get epiphanies .
We only get a whisper — a faint urge .
That ’s it .
That ’s the call .
It ’s up to you to do the work of discovery , to connect it to an answer .
Of course , there ’s never a single right answer .
At some point , it feels right enough that you choose , and the energy formerly spent casting about is now devoted to making your choice fruitful .
This lesson in late , hard - fought discovery is good news .
What it means is that today ’s confused can be tomorrow ’s dedicated .
The current difficult climate serves as a form of reckoning .
The tougher the times , the more clarity you gain about the difference between what really matters and what you only pretend to care about .
The funny thing is that most people have good instincts about where they belong but make poor choices and waste productive years on the wrong work .
Why we do this cuts to the heart of the question , What should I do with my life ?
These wrong turns hinge on a small number of basic assumptions that have ruled our working lives , career choices , and ambitions for the better part of two decades .
I found hardly any consistencies in how the people I interviewed discovered what they love to do — the human soul resists taxonomy — except when it came to four misconceptions ( about money , smarts , place , and attitude ) that have calcified into hobbling fears .
These are stumbling blocks that we need to uproot before we can find our way to where we really belong .

MONEY Does n’t Fund Dreams
Should n’t I make money first — to fund my dream ?
The notion that there ’s an order to your working life is an almost classic assumption :
Pay your dues , and then tend to your dream .
I expected to find numerous examples of the truth of this path .
But I did n’t find any .
Sure , I found tons of rich guys who were now giving a lot away to charity or who had bought an island .
I found plenty of people who had found something meaningful and original to do after making their money .
But that ’s not what I ’m talking about .
I ’m talking about the garden - variety fantasy :
Put your calling in a lockbox , go out and make a ton of money , and then come back to the lockbox to pick up your calling where you left it .
It turns out that having the financial independence to walk away rarely triggers people to do just that .
The reality is , making money is such hard work that it changes you .
It takes twice as long as anyone plans for .
It requires more sacrifices than anyone expects .
You become so emotionally invested in that world — and psychologically adapted to it — that you do n’t really want to ditch it .
I met many people who had left the money behind .
But having “ enough ” did n’t trigger the change .
It had to get personal : Something had to happen such as divorce , the death of a parent , or the recognition that the long hours were hurting one ’s children .
( One man , Don Linn , left investment banking after he came home from a business trip and his two - year - old son did n’t recognize him . )
The ruling assumption is that money is the shortest route to freedom .
Absurdly , that strategy is cast as the “ practical approach . ”
But in truth , the opposite is true .
The shortest route to the good life involves building the confidence that you can live happily within your means ( whatever the means provided by the choices that are truly acceptable to you turn out to be ) .
It ’s scary to imagine living on less .
But embracing your dreams is surprisingly liberating .
Instilled with a sense of purpose , your spending habits naturally reorganize , because you discover that you need less .
This is an extremely threatening conclusion .
It suggests that the vast majority of us are n’t just putting our dreams on ice — we ’re killing them .
Joe Olchefske almost lost his forever .
Joe started out in life with an interest in government .
In the early 1980s , he made what seemed like a minor compromise :
When he graduated from Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government , he went into public finance .
He would n’t work in government , he ’d work with government .
advertisement
Joe went on to run Piper Jaffray in Seattle .
By the mid-1990s , he realized that one little compromise had defined his life .
“ I did n’t want to be a high - priced midwife , ” he said .
“ I wanted to be a mother .
It was never my deal .
It was my clients ’ deal .
They were taking the risk .
They were building hospitals and bridges and freeways , not me .
I envied them for that . ”
One night , riding up the elevator of his apartment building , Joe met newly hired Seattle schools superintendent John Stanford .
Soon after , Stanford offered Olchefske a job as his CFO — and partner in turning the troubled school system around .
Olchefske accepted .
Stanford rallied the city around school reform and earned the nickname Prophet of Hope .
Meanwhile , Olchefske slashed millions from the budget and bloodlessly fired principals , never allowing his passions to interfere with his decisions .
People called him Prophet of Doom .
Then Stanford died suddenly of leukemia .
It was one of the great crises in the city ’s history .
Who could fill this void ?
Certainly not the green - eyeshade CFO .
But Stanford ’s death transformed Olchefske .
It broke him open , and he discovered in himself a new ability to connect with people emotionally , not just rationally .
As the new superintendent , he draws on that gift more than on his private - sector skills .
He puts up with a lot of bureaucrap , but he says that avoiding crap should n’t be the objective in finding the right work .
The right question is , How can I find something that moves my heart , so that the inevitable crap storm is bearable ?
SMARTS Can’t Answer The Question
If the lockbox fantasy is a universal and eternal stumbling block when it comes to answering The Question , the idea that smarts and intensity are the essential building blocks of success and satisfaction is a product of the past decade .
A set of twin misconceptions took root during the celebration of risk and speed that was the 90s startup revolution .
The first is the idea that a smart , motivated individual with a great idea can accomplish anything .
The corollary is that work should be fun , a thrill ride full of constant challenge and change .
Those assumptions are getting people into trouble .
So what if your destiny does n’t stalk you like a lion ?
Can you think your way to the answer ?
That ’s what Lori Gottlieb thought .
She considered her years as a rising television executive in Hollywood to be a big mistake .
She became successful but felt like a fraud .
So she quit and gave herself three years to analyze which profession would engage her brain the most .
She literally attacked the question .
She dug out her diaries from childhood .
She took classes in photography and figure drawing .
She interviewed others who had left Hollywood .
She broke down every job by skill set and laid that over a grid of her innate talents .
She filled out every exercise in What Color Is Your Parachute ?
Eventually , she arrived at the following logic :
Her big brain loved puzzles .
Who solves puzzles ?
Doctors solve health puzzles .
Therefore , become a doctor .
She enrolled in premed classes at Pepperdine .
Her med - school applications were so persuasive that every school wanted her .
And then — can you see where this is headed ?
—
Lori dropped out of Stanford Medical School after only two and a half months .
Why ?
She realized that she did n’t like hanging around sick people all day .
advertisement
The point is , being smarter does n’t make answering The Question easier .
Using the brain to solve this problem usually only leads to answers that make the brain happy and jobs that provide what I call “ brain candy . ”
Intense mental stimulation .
But it ’s just that : candy .
A synthetic substitute for other types of gratification that can be ultimately more rewarding and enduring .
As the cop in East L.A. said of his years in management at Rockwell , “ It was like cheap wood that burns too fast . ”
I struggled with this myself , but not until I had listened to hundreds of others did the pattern make itself shockingly clear .
What am I good at ? is the wrong starting point .
People who attempt to deduce an answer usually end up mistaking intensity for passion .
To the heart , they are vastly different .
Intensity comes across as a pale busyness , while passion is meaningful and fulfilling .
A simple test :
Is your choice something that will stimulate you for a year or something that you can be passionate about for 10 years ?
This test is tougher than it seems on paper .
In the past decade , the work world has become a battleground for the struggle between the boring and the stimulating .
The emphasis on intensity has seeped into our value system .
We still cling to the idea that work should not only be challenging and meaningful — but also invigorating and entertaining .
But really , work should be like life : sometimes fun , sometimes moving , often frustrating , and defined by meaningful events .
Those who have found their place do n’t talk about how exciting and challenging and stimulating their work is .
Their language invokes a different troika : meaningful , significant , fulfilling .
And they rarely ever talk about work without weaving in their personal history .
PLACE Defines You
Every industry has a culture .
And every culture is driven by a value system .
In Hollywood , where praise is given too easily and thus has been devalued , the only honest metric is box - office receipts .
So box - office receipts are all - important .
In Washington , DC , some very powerful politicians are paid middling salaries , so power and money are not equal .
Power is measured by the size of your staff and by how many people you can influence .
In police work , you learn to be suspicious of ordinary people driving cars and walking down the street .
One of the most common mistakes is not recognizing how these value systems will shape you .
People think that they can insulate themselves , that they ’re different .
They ’re not .
The relevant question in looking at a job is not What will I do ?
but Who will I become ?
What belief system will you adopt , and what will take on heightened importance in your life ?
Because once you ’re rooted in a particular system — whether it ’s medicine , New York City , Microsoft , or a startup — it ’s often agonizingly difficult to unravel yourself from its values , practices , and rewards .
Your money is good anywhere , but respect and status are only a local currency .
They get heavily discounted when taken elsewhere .
If you ’re successful at the wrong thing , the mix of praise and opportunity can lock you in forever .
Don Linn , the investment banker who took over the catfish farm in Mississippi , learned this lesson the hard way .
After years as a star at PaineWebber and First Boston , he dropped out when he could no longer bring himself to push deals on his clients that he knew would n’t work .
His life change smacked of foolish originality : 5.5 million catfish on 1,500 water acres .
His first day , he had to clip the wings of a flock of geese .
Covered in goose shit and blood , he wondered what he had gotten himself into .
But he figured it out and grew his business into a $ 16 million operation with five side businesses .
More important , the work reset his moral compass .
In farming , success does n’t come at another farmer ’s expense .
You learn to cooperate , sharing processing plants , feed mills , and pesticide - flying services .
advertisement
Like Don , you ’ll be a lot happier if you are n’t fighting the value system around you .
Find one that enforces a set of beliefs that you can really get behind .
There ’s a powerful transformative effect when you surround yourself with like - minded people .
Peer pressure is a great thing when it helps you accomplish your goals instead of distracting you from them .
Carl Kurlander wrote the movie St. Elmo ’s
Fire when he was 24 .
For years afterward , he lived in Beverly Hills .
He wanted to move back to Pittsburgh , where he grew up , to write books , but he was always stopped by the doubt , Would it really make any difference to write from Pittsburgh instead of from Beverly Hills ?
His books went unwritten .
Last year , when a looming Hollywood writers ’ strike coincided with a job opening in the creative - writing department at Pitt , he finally summoned the courage to move .
He says that being in academia is like “ bathing in altruism . ”
Under its influence , he wrote his first book , a biography of the comic Louie Anderson .
ATTITUDE
Is the Biggest Obstacle
Environment matters , but in the end , when it comes to tackling the question , What should I do with my life ?
it really is all in your head .
The first psychological stumbling block that keeps people from finding themselves is that they feel guilty for simply taking the quest seriously .
They think that it ’s a self - indulgent privilege of the educated upper class .
Working - class people manage to be happy without trying to “ find themselves , ” or so the myth goes .
But I found that just about anybody can find this question important .
It ’s not just for free agents , knowledge workers , and serial entrepreneurs .
I met many working - class people who found this question essential .
They might have fewer choices , but they still care .
Take Bart Handford .
He went from working the graveyard shift at a Kimberley - Clark baby - wipes plant in Arkansas to running the Department of Agriculture ’s rural - development program .
He did n’t do this by just pulling up his bootstraps .
His breakthrough came when his car was hit by a train , and he spent six months in bed exploring The Question .
Probably the most debilitating obstacle to taking on The Question is the fear that making a choice is a one - way ride , that starting down a path means closing a door forever .
“ Keeping your doors open ” is a trap .
It ’s an excuse to stay uninvolved .
I call the people who have the hardest time closing doors Phi Beta Slackers .
They hop between esteemed grad schools , fat corporate gigs , and prestigious fellowships , looking as if they have their act together but still feeling like observers , feeling as if they have n’t come close to living up to their potential .
advertisement
Leela de Souza almost got lost in that trap .
At age 15 , Leela knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up : a dancer .
She pursued that dream , supplementing her meager dancer ’s pay with work as a runway model .
But she soon began to feel that she had left her intellect behind .
So , in her early twenties , with several good years left on her legs , she took the SATs and applied to college .
She paid for a $ 100,000 education at the University of Chicago with the money that she had earned from modeling and during the next seven years made a series of seemingly smart decisions : a year in Spain , Harvard Business School , McKinsey & Co. , a White House Fellowship , high - tech PR .
But she never got any closer to making a real choice .
Like most Phi Beta Slackers , she was cursed with tremendous ability and infinite choices .
Figuring out what to do with her life was constantly on her mind .
But then she figured something else out :
Her need to look brilliant was what was keeping her from truly answering The Question .
When she let go of that , she was able to shift gears from asking “ What do I do next ? ” to making strides toward answering “ To what can I devote my life ? ” Asking “ What Should I Do With My Life ? ” is the modern , secular version of the great timeless questions about our identity .
Asking The Question aspires to end the conflict between who you are and what you do .
Answering The Question is the way to protect yourself from being lathed into someone you ’re not .
What is freedom for if not the chance to define for yourself who you are ?
I have spent the better part of the past two years in the company of people who have dared to confront where they belong .
They did n’t always find an ultimate answer , but taking the question seriously helped get them closer .
We are all writing the story of our own life .
It ’s not a story of conquest .
It ’s a story of discovery .
Through trial and error , we learn what gifts we have to offer the world and are pushed to greater recognition about what we really need .
The Big Bold Leap turns out to be only the first step .

Of the 900 people who I talked to , only one has had the same employer for his entire adult life .
His name is Russell Carpenter , he ’s 35 , and he ’s an aerospace engineer at NASA Goddard .
We can all learn from him .
Russell began working at NASA during college .
In exchange for his summers , they paid for his tuition and , later , financed his PhD. Russell is a GS - 14 , stuck to government pay scales .
The money is okay , but it ’s never the reason to stay .
He ’s building a guidance system for the newest type of satellite .
The halls and offices at NASA are quiet .
These engineers are content with slowly pushing toward a solution .
Which I took as Extractable Lesson number one : time frame .
At NASA , Russell has found an intermediate time frame where he can accomplish the high - minded objectives that his division is charged with , but he ’s not under absurd pressure to do it all in 90 days .
Aerospace engineers are obsessed with redundancy and backup systems .
Russell knows that metals give , that gears slip , and that motors overheat , and he plans for that in his designs .
Not everything has to go right in order for it to work .
And that way of thinking shows up in every aspect of his life , including how he achieves his ambitions .
Which I took as Extractable Lesson number two :
His backup plans do not lead to different destinations , such as “ If I do n’t get into business school , I ’ll be a schoolteacher . ”
His backup plans lead to the same destination , and if he has to arrive late by a back road , that ’s fine .
Later , Russell and I went to a baseball game , which clued me in to Extractable Lesson number three : Russell does n’t let himself get burned out .
He does n’t think it ’s a big deal that he ’s only had one employer .
His method is his secret , but it ’s no secret .
“ So what do you do ? ”
For five years , Marcela Widrig had a dream job that compensated her well , let her live in Barcelona , and paid for her frequent travel throughout Southern Europe .
She sold modems for a big modem manufacturer .
Modems were her means to her ends : money , travel , human connection .
When her company moved her to San Francisco , she suffered culture shock .
The Internet was destroying everything that she loved about sales .
The new ethos was speed .
Get the deal done in a day !
Do n’t even fly — email makes it so easy !
The human contact was gone .

The worst part was constantly being asked The Inevitable Cocktail - Party Question : “ What do you do ? ” Marcela had been away long enough to have forgotten about this disgusting American custom .
She found it degrading and reductive and mercenary .
I too used to think that The Inevitable Cocktail - Party Question was a scourge on our society .
But I ’m starting to see that it is really about freedom to choose .
A status system has evolved that values being unique and true even more than it values being financially successful .
In other words , if you do n’t like The Inevitable Cocktail - Party Question , maybe it ’s partly because you do n’t like your answer .
Marcela no longer liked her answer .
She endured migraines and insomnia .
After flying all the way to Hong Kong for a meeting that did n’t even last one hour , she vowed , “ I can not sell one more modem . ”
But she did n’t quit for two more years .
On her vacations , she flew to Switzerland to train in a school for deep - tissue massage .
It was her way to move toward genuine human contact .
The day she returned from one of her Switzerland trips , the modem company went under , and she was forced into her new life .
It took her about a year to drop the business - suit persona and truly embrace her new profession .
The Inevitable Cocktail - Party Question no longer bothers her .
“ I do body work , ” she says .
“ I love what I do , and I think that comes across . ”

1 .
On a clear spring afternoon in Harare in mid-May , South Africa ’s president , Thabo Mbeki , paid a call on Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe ’s beleaguered dictator , six weeks after Zimbabwe ’s tumultuous elections on March 29 in which opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed a clear victory over Mugabe .
Mbeki had been largely silent as Zimbabwe descended into chaos .
In mid-April , while Mugabe ’s handpicked Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) refused to release the final vote count , and Mugabe ’s War Veterans marched through the streets in an intimidating display of force , Mbeki had stood hand in hand with Mugabe outside the presidential residence in Harare and denied that the country was in “ crisis . ”
In recent days , however , as evidence grew of widespread beatings and killings of supporters of Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , Mbeki had found himself under attack in the press and at odds with members of his own party leadership .
Jacob Zuma , the chairman of the African National Congress and Mbeki ’s likely successor to the presidency of South Africa , had criticized the delayed vote count and said that an April raid on MDC headquarters made the country look like “ a police state . ”
The Johannesburg newspaper Business Day revealed that Mbeki had several years earlier ignored a report by two South African judges describing widespread cheating by Mugabe ’s ruling party , the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) , in the 2002 parliamentary election .
Now , with the electoral commission ’s official results showing that Tsvangirai had defeated Mugabe by 47.9 percent to 42.3 percent — necessitating a runoff election —
Mbeki faced mounting pressure to support a free and fair second round .
And yet , when Mbeki stepped off the plane on May 9 , it appeared to be business as usual — smiles , embraces , and hand - in - hand stroll across the tarmac .
At their State House meeting , according to those close to the proceedings , Mbeki gently prodded Mugabe to declare an early date for the runoff .
Then he suggested , diplomatically , that Mugabe should find a way to end the violence .
It did n’t matter who had instigated it , Mbeki said .
Mugabe controlled the police and the army , and they could stop it .
Mugabe told Mbeki that the situation was under control , and that Zimbabwe ’s own laws would deal with it .
The tone of the meeting was “ chilly , ” I was told by one close observer ; but Mbeki made no demands , and left without receiving any commitments .
Since then , Mbeki has kept his distance from Mugabe .
“ It appears that he ’s washed his hands of the whole thing , ” the source said .
Mbeki ’s inaction is hardly surprising .
Since Mugabe initiated his catastrophic “ land grab ” in January 2000 , turning over four thousand white - owned farms to putative veterans of Zimbabwe ’s independence war and to cronies , the South African president has failed to address forthrightly both Zimbabwe ’s subsequent economic collapse and Mugabe ’s many human rights abuses .
Clinging to an ineffectual policy of “ quiet diplomacy , ” Mbeki stood by as Mugabe accelerated his violent land reform program .
He then said and did little as the dictator unleashed thugs to intimidate voters and stuffed …
Barack Obama 's declaration that Israel 's security is " sacrosanct " and " non-negotiable " and that the bond between it and the US is " unbreakable " is hardly surprising - given that his audience was the powerful Aipac lobbying organisation .
Nor was his insistence that Iran threatens both countries - and the peace and stability of the Middle East .
Arabs may take some small comfort from his pledge that Palestine - where George Bush did nothing but damage - will be a priority from the first days of his presidency ( not left as an afterthought until the end ) .
But there is no other break with present US policy .
Obama defines Hamas , now controlling the Gaza Strip , simply as a terrorist organisation with no place at the negotiating table : that allows no space for pragmatic engagement that some Europeans and even Israelis want to help it evolve .
He buys into the badly faltering Annapolis formula : isolate Hamas , ( presumably maintaining the Gaza siege ) showcase the West Bank and ask Israel to take " appropriate " steps but only if they are " consistent with its security " - that crucial ( and likely crippling ) qualification .
Interestingly , there is a reminder that he opposed the Palestinian elections that brought Hamas to power in 2006 , implying disapproval of the post - Iraq " freedom agenda " that the neocons dreamed up and ditched when it produced , or threatened to produce , the " wrong " results .
Obama 's commitment to Israel - its existence " just and necessary " - was reinforced by a sympathetic passage on the Holocaust .
His understanding of the Zionist idea - " that there is always a homeland at the centre of our story " - was cleverly linked to his own complex sense of belonging .
" The Palestinians need a state that is contiguous and cohesive , and that allows them to prosper , " he says .
But there was no emotional connection with their plight .
Obama will strike a chord with many - Americans , Europeans and others - with his complaint that after Iraq , America is more isolated in the Middle East - a massive understatement .
But Arabs desperate for change will wince at his concern that one effect of this has been to jeopardise Israel 's safety .
The Democratic candidate manages to sound both hawkish and flexible : justifying Israel 's preemptive attack on an alleged nuclear site in Syria - but also , unlike Bush , supporting talks with the Damascus regime .
Iran , predictably , is the other big issue : a regime led by a Holocaust - denying president that supports " violent extremists " and is pursuing a nuclear capability .
" I have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking .
But as president of the United States , I would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate Iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing - if , and only if - it can advance the interests of the United States . "
But there was a positive signal too : Obama talked of taking over the lead from Europe , offering Iran " meaningful incentives " - but keeping that threat of military action on the table .
Less " satanic " from a Tehran perspective .
But no pushover .
Perhaps his most achievable commitment is on Iraq - sensible , cool , with a justified sideswipe at the American president who created the mess : " We will get out as carefully as we were careless getting in .
We will finally pressure Iraq 's leaders to take meaningful responsibility for their own future . "
Sounds like a man who is looking thoughtfully to the future of the Middle East but is not going to make any fundamental changes .
A new type of solar energy collector concentrates the sun into a beam that could melt steel .
Researchers say the device could revolutionize global energy production .
The prototype is a 12 - foot - wide mirrored dish was made from a lightweight frame of thin , inexpensive aluminum tubing and strips of mirror .
It concentrates sunlight by a factor of 1,000 to produce steam .
" This is actually the most efficient solar collector in existence , " said Doug Wood , an inventor based in Washington state who patented key parts of the dish 's design — the rights to which he has signed over to a team of students at MIT .
To test the prototype this week , MIT mechanical engineering Spencer Ahrens put a plank of wood in the beam an generated an almost instant puff of smoke .
The thing does more than burn wood , of course .
At the end of a 12 - foot aluminum tube rising from the center of the dish is a black - painted coil of tubing that has water running through it .
When the dish is pointing directly at the sun , the water in the coil flashes immediately into steam .
Ahrens and his teammates have started a company , RawSolar , to hopefully mass produce the dishes .
They could be set up in huge arrays to provide steam for industrial processing , or for heating or cooling buildings , as well as to hook up to steam turbines and generate electricity , according to an MIT statement .
Once in mass production , such arrays should pay for themselves within two years or so with the energy they produce , the students figure .
Wood , the inventor , said the students built the dish and improved on his design .
" They really have simplified this and made it user - friendly , so anybody can build it , " he said .
Wood said small dishes work best because it requires much less support structure and costs less for a given amount of collection area .
" I 've looked for years at a variety of solar approaches , and this is the cheapest I 've seen , " said MIT Sloan School of Management lecturer David Pelly , in whose class the project first took shape last fall .
" And the key thing in scaling it globally is that all of the materials are inexpensive and accessible anywhere in the world . "
Tibet Dispute Merkel Defies China , Says She Would Meet Dalai Lama Again

That 's what happened to Bear Stearns according to Andy Kessler speaking at Telecosm .
Andy 's a former hedge fund manager so he knows this kind of stuff and a writer so he says what he knows in an entertaining way .
Bear Stearns died because the pigs ate the sausage .
His talk was titled " Who killed Bear Stearns ? "
Andy went back to the founding of the NYSE under the famous buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan .
For most of the time since then its members have enjoyed a lucrative monopoly in trading US stocks .
A license to trade there and even on other exchanges like the NASDAQ was a license to make money .
At first and for most of Exchange history , commissions were set by cartel .
Plenty of profit there .
Whoops – competition came to rates .
That hurt but there was still plenty of margin left between the bid and ask price to make an indecent living .
Whoops – people who used to have to rely on the newspaper for a daily look at prices could now see prices online in real time ; spreads shrank .
Then we went from trading in fractions to trading in pennies ; the spread was gone .
But it was still an exclusive club with plenty of ways to make money .
Whoops – the rise of almost direct trading by day traders .
How 's a guy or gal to make a living ?
Well , there was handling IPOs .
Commissions on those somehow managed to be uncompetitive all the way through the Internet bubble .
Pop – no more bubble .
Technology and transparency and competition killed the trading spread .
The ingenious solution was to invent something too complex to be transparent – collateralized mortgage obligations and derivatives based on tranches of pools of mortgages were exactly that .
Who knew what the damned things were worth ; at the moment they were worth whatever the market would pay .
So the investment banks – all of them – made a lot of money selling this stuff to the customers .
At this point Andy showed a slide of sausage being made – something , as you know , that you do n't want to see .
The sausage is all the mortgage - backed securities .
Everything might have been fine for the investment banks if some of them had n't started believing their own marketing pitch that this sausage was good for you .
Why should we just serve this fine sausage to our customers ?
they asked and began to gorge themselves on it .
Chief among the gorgers was Bear Stearns .
Along came the day when the stuff that could n't be valued began to get a little rancid and had to be marked to market and could n't be disgorged .
Bear Stearns got a fatal tummy ache .
Other banks would have also succumbed to mortgage poisoning had the Fed not stepped in .
JP Morgan had not been nearly as tempted to eat the sausage – they sold plenty of it , though – so they were in shape to mop up Bear Stearns .
Now , thanks to Andy Kessler , you know what happened to Bear Stearns .
@cornpopsicle : I was eying that same list and trying to pull it together .
Even knowing the song list , there are so many Nico Nico references in there .
So many videos to watch to fully understand all the references .

Tuition - free MIT an exploration of some ideas by Philip Greenspun At Left :
Three MIT undergrads and the wardrobe they were able to purchase after paying their term bill .
Suppose you got a brochure from United Airlines listing the fare from Boston to San Francisco as $ 1 million .
However , the brochure stated that " because of our commitment at United Airlines to ensuring that every American gets the transportation that is his birthright , we offer financial aid . "
The brochure comes with forms in which you list every scrap of money that you have .
You are instructed to send this into United Airlines along with a certified copy of your tax returns so that they can evaluate your need .
A few days later , United Airlines writes back : " Great news .
We have evaluated your financial situation and have determined that if we take more than $ 1,000 out of you , you 'll be reduced to the homeless shelter .
So we 're awarding you $ 999,000 in financial aid and you only have to give us $ 1,000 to fly from Boston to San Francisco .
Does this make you applaud the philanthropy of United Airlines ?
Or do you just say " those bastards colluded with the other airlines to set an outrageous fare .
Then they are behaving like a classical profit - maximizing monopoly by engaging in price discrimination , i.e. , charging each customer the maximum amount that he can afford to pay . "
[ If United were following all of the university traditions , then they would have " overlap meetings " with the other airlines to make sure that Delta did not mistakenly offer you $ 999,500 in financial aid and cloud your decision about which airline to fly because of monetary considerations .
The U.S. Justice Department 's antitrust division and a federal judge 's ruling put an end to this tradition in 1992 , however .
In theory .
In fact , we 're still colluding with other schools .
We just do n't sit down at a table with them anymore .
As long as every school is using the same algorithm to determine financial need , no brilliant student will be offered a substantially better deal by any cartel member .
Did you ever wonder why top universities are at such pains all the time to reassure you that they only award financial aid based on need ?
Well , they are n't talking to you .
They are signaling to competitors they are n't cheating on the cartel by offering a kid with double 800 SAT scores a break .
Here 's some evidence :
" Are there any merit - based financial aid awards at Harvard - Radcliffe ?
No , we admit students based on their strengths and talents , but all Harvard - administered aid is based only on financial need . "
( http://adm-is.fas.harvard.edu/Finfaq.htm; January 9 , 1998 )
No , we admit students based on their strengths and talents , but all Harvard - administered aid is based only on financial need . "
( http://adm-is.fas.harvard.edu/Finfaq.htm; January 9 , 1998 ) " Yale College does not offer academic or athletic scholarships or any other type of special scholarship not based on demonstrated need . "
( http://www.yale.edu/admit/financing.html; January 9 , 1998 )
" We are proud of our commitment to need - blind admissions and need - based financial aid . "
( http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/f/finaid/;
January 9 , 1998 )
" All Princeton aid is awarded after a determination of need .
We do not give merit aid based on your academic , extracurricular , or athletic accomplishments . "
( http://www.princeton.edu/pr/admissions/aid_QandA.html; January 9 , 1998 )
There is some tuition price at which it becomes impossible for a university to avoid the appearance of greed .
Note that in many Far Eastern traditions , you cannot be respected as a teacher or a doctor if you charge money for your services .
Can we be respected if we charge $ 25,000 / year ?
$ 50,000 / year ?
It is corrupting us
Perhaps we used to believe this .
And perhaps some of us still believe it consciously .
But subconsciously , the truth seems to be that students are seen as our primary cash cow .
When MIT had to pay $ 1.85 million to children unwittingly subjected to a radiation experiment in the 1940s and 1950s , VP for Research and Dean for Graduate Education J. David Litster said " I look on it as the tuition of 20 students " ( The Tech , January 7 , 1998 , http://the-tech.mit.edu/V117/N65/bfernald.65n.html).
Why should we care ?
" It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
Come , be a man !
Drown thyself ?
Drown cats and blind puppies .
I have professed me thy friend , and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness ; I could never better stead thee than now .
Put money in thy purse . "
-- Iago , Othello , Act I , Scene I
Better students ?
If you had a child with nerd tendencies who was admitted to both Harvard and MIT , where would you send him ?
Honestly .
It is going to cost you $ 150,000 and you'd be a fool not to ask yourself whether Harvard or MIT graduates make more money in the long run .
At which school is he more likely to meet children of the aristocracy , people with family wealth ( e.g. , Bill Gates ) who are certain to rise to positions of influence ?
What kind of a university can we have if all of our students were either rejected from Ivy League colleges or were too impractical to realize that Harvard , Yale , and Princeton provide better value for the staggering price ?
Better society ?
If you graduated from MIT with $ 100,000 in debt and a love for engineering , would you go to work designing anti-lock brakes for $ 50,000 / year ?
Or would you go to medical school so that you could join a profession where the average income is over $ 150,000 / year ?
My top students in Course 6 are all telling me that they do n't want to be engineers .
They are heading for professional school .
We will live in a society where the best educated engineers are not designing anti-lock brakes .
They are either managing comparatively poorly educated people who are designing anti-lock brakes , stitching up wounds in people who were injured by faulty anti-lock brakes , or defending companies that got sued for their anti-lock brake systems that did n't work .
You do n't find too many law school graduates who are n't practicing law or too many medical school graduates are are n't treating patients or doing medical research .
Yet so many MIT - educated engineers and scientists have left their fields .
More money ?!?
Every time we collect a dollar from a student , it seems to go right to our bottom line .
What we do n't consider is that each extra dollar collected from students makes it more difficult to collect from donors .
If we were charging $ 1 million / student , would any rich person give us money ?
Do rich people make donations to United Airlines ?
Or do they assume that , since United is charging as much as the market will bear , they probably do n't need the money as much as other charities .
I 'm not the kind of rich person that universities court for donations , but I did recently give away my minivan .
A number of charities with full - time salaried bureaucracies and sources of revenue were put forward .
I ended up giving the van instead to a husband - and - wife team running a no- kill animal shelter , mostly with their personal funds .
I thought they needed it more .
As we raise tuition prices , it will become increasingly expensive to educate donors as to why we need their money too .
Why do I care ?
[ Actually , there probably is but I give it away free to anyone who cares to grab http://www.photo.net/wtr/dead-trees/;and
I can't teach it at MIT because we do n't have relational database servers available for student use :-( ]
Even if we can be sure that our education is worth $ 100,000 or more , should we charge as much as we can get ?
Should MIT operate by the same rules as , say , Microsoft ?
Despite our high tuition rates , there are still more applications than places here at MIT , so why not maximize profit ?
We do n't have to go too far down this road before we must face the fact that MIT is a collection of people who are , though just as greedy as the owners / employees of Microsoft , not nearly as smart ( since MIT is not as financially successful as Microsoft ) .
We have to at least avoid the appearance of greed and profit maximization or people will think that we were too stupid / incompetent / lazy to get jobs at more successful institutions .
If we can't milk students , where do we get money ?
MIT undergrads , however , are mostly going into fields where the government and a handful of large corporations are the primary employers .
The government needs to hire thousands of relatively brilliant people at relatively low wages ( compared to the professions ) to design weapons , build bridges , clean up the environment , etc .
The Fortune 500 for whatever reason has decided to pay their CEOs 50 - 500 times what an engineer might make .
Yet they still need well - trained intelligent engineers to make new products work and root out Year 2000 bugs .
It can't be that tough to drive up to General Motors in a Toyota Sienna and say " If you give us the big bucks , we 'll steal the smart people away from Harvard and B - school and send you some engineers who can make your cars as reliable as this one . "
We can also find crotchety old nerds who made $ millions in high - tech companies and who are disgusted at being surrounded by MBAs and consultants .
Is n't it more compelling to ask for money to mold a generation of brilliant engineers and scientists than for a new building for the Media Lab or Sloan School ?
Yet we have had little trouble getting the money for such structures .
Could we become leaner ?
Certainly a tuition - free MIT immediately becomes $ millions / year leaner .
We would n't need to have a financial aid office .
We would not need to offer student loans and therefore would not need to administer those loans or hire people to collect money from deadbeat students / parents .
We would not need people to write brochures and Web pages describing financial aid policies or student loan offerings .
We would not need to pay people to argue about whether those policies were fair .
We would not need to pay lawyers to make sure we did n't get sued again by the Feds .
Note : I 'm not talking about grad school
What am I actually doing ?
I have decided to stop personally participating in the system of extracting money from MIT kids and their families .
On Thursday , March 12 , 1998 , I guest - lectured an MIT class ( on designing database - backed Web services ) .
I calculated that the students were paying about $ 80 in tuition / lecture - hour .
I withdrew a stack of $ 100 bills from my BankBoston account and I handed one out to each undergraduate in the course .
I then proceeded to give my talk , telling the students that I was happy to teach them but I was not going to take their money .
Anxious to get the MIT community to read this Web page and take practical steps toward becoming tuition - free , I sent some e-mail to the student newspaper ( the Tech ) .
Right after I sent that off , I thought to myself " maybe I can get my dog Alex into the New York Times two months in a row " and sent some e-mail about the give - back to Bill Dedman , the Times reporter who ran a photo of Alex back in February to illustrate a story about some of my research .
The staff at the student newspaper never answered my e-mail or showed up and the New York Times called my house at the last minute to say that they had to pull their journalists off to cover the breaking " asteroid is going to destroy Earth in 2028 " story .
But word of the event leaked out and a variety of reporters showed up or called for the story , including Jon Marcus from Associated Press , Richard Chacon from the Boston Globe , and crews from two local TV stations ( Channels 4 and 5 ) .
My friend Jin watched me on Channel 5 and said that I looked like " a homeless psycho " .
The next day , the story was one of two on the front page of the Boston Herald .
Newspapers from the London Times to Chosun Ilbo ( Korea ) picked it up .
CNN ran the video from the local Boston stations .
It was on NPR Morning Edition and talk radio stations around the country .
The BBC called me for a radio interview that they broadcast in Europe .
Here 's what one of my readers sent me :
" Getting the media involved is a terrific idea , but not without its hiccups .
Every hour between newscasts on my local radio station a doddering Paul Harvey spews a blurb about MIT professor Phil Greenspan ( sic ) who * has * to pay his students $ 100 to get them to attend class ... and only four showed up .
Sigh . "
If the press did n't present my ideas exactly as I would have liked or the facts quite as they were , all the publicity at least encouraged some folks to come to this Web page .
What can one person accomplish ?
Was it worth it ?
Obviously being interviewed in all of these newspapers and radio shows has taken some time and enraged various MIT bigshots who can squash me like a bug .
But I knew it was worth it when one faculty member , a genuinely nice guy , came to me and told me that I was mistaken : MIT was very generous with students and the cartel financial aid policies substantially assisted poor families .
Anyone who wanted to attend MIT would be able to do so without undue financial duress .
It turned out that his own secretary had in fact dropped out of MIT around the time of the Justice Department prosecution of MIT .
She and her family decided that they could n't afford for her to graduate .
She had worked for this faculty member for five years and was not shy about telling her story to anyone who asked .
He had never asked .
What can 10,000 people accomplish ?
The need for education is growing even faster than the world 's population .
If we are such great technologists , can we not come up with ways to distribute much of our knowledge to interested people worldwide ?
We could do the obvious things , e.g. , putting Internet connections and cameras in our classrooms so that lectures are available on the Web as streaming video .
Schools like Stanford have been doing this ( with analog video ) for decades with mixed success .
We will need fundamentally improved computer programs that facilitate interactions among students and teachers so that ( 1 ) it is easier for instructors to put course materials on - line , ( 2 ) students physically on campus have a richer experience , ( 3 ) students who are off campus can look over the shoulders of those on campus , and ( 4 ) students who are off campus can have their own community and interaction .
If we are the great programmers that we claim to be , it ought to be possible to do this so that the cost to MIT is minimal and so that there is no loss of focus among the people physically on campus .
What about the people off campus ?
Can the average person really learn without structure and externally imposed deadlines ?
Perhaps not .
But that does n't mean we at MIT should add " handholding those who are n't on campus " to our plate .
If we engineer our collaboration systems properly , it should be possible for third parties to organize traditional or Web- centric classes using MIT lectures and course materials .
We can even let them use our servers for private collaboration among their students and teachers .
The marginal cost to us will be small ( I have been doing stuff like this personally since 1995 : http://www.photo.net/philg/services.html).
Anyway , that 's my ideal world : a high school girl in Vietnam with a cable modem attending all the MIT classes that she wants .
I 've been taking some small personal steps in this direction .
I 've been doing research on the best ways to build community - style Web sites , of which a site for a class is one example .
I 've been doing research on ways to manage Web services so that multiple community maintainers can share one computer and RDBMS installation .
I 've figured out how to do all of this with practically zero budget for administration and support .
Currently my software is in use for 6.001 , MIT 's introductory computer science course .
We 'll see how it goes ...

One number which would be relevant to the analysis , but which is not well publicized by either of the obscenely wealthy Universities I 've been associated with is the ratio Alumni donations / Tuition income .
I 've often wondered whether the alumni donations could pay the administrators while the tuition income could pay the migrant lecturers and keep the buildings standing and the libraries filled .
If so , and if the administrators could simply be persuaded to leave -- but I think that 's the hard part .

I do not know that I agree with your basis premise , but I apppaud your guts and commitment .
It is very ususual in our to society to see : 1 ) Someone who actually puts his convictions into action ;
2 ) Someone who personally pays to put his position into action ;
3 ) Someone who is willing to go against such a powerful institution ;
4 ) Someone with a stack of hundreds .

I had five years at Oxford University in England -- and neither tuition nor maintenance cost me a penny ( both under - and post - grad degrees ) .
This is all about to change , as the UK goes down the pay your own way route .
What a mistake !
However , I would have to say , that very broadly , the American students I met , at both stages , ( and there were a lot ) were much , much , more highly motivated and focused than we were .
Academics I know who have taught on both sides of the Atlantic confirm this .
I am afraid that I think that this does have something to do with the financial commitments that US university education demands .
( This is especially so in the humanities , where in the US they are a passport to graduate schools ) .
I applaud your gesture , however .

I love the analogy to United Airlines .
Still , I too wonder if students will value their educations as much and work as hard if they are not paying .
I also wonder if MIT could become still more unresponsive to student needs / desires if no tuition was involved .
Perhaps one solution to the former would be to charge a tuition based upon your record / grades so far .
Or alternatively , just pay students that get good grades !
-- Bob Givan , March 13 , 1998
I applaud your gesture and sentiments sincerely .
However ....
We have a society ( in America ) in which the basic building blocks of a fruitful life are not available equitably in any sense of the word .
To wit as long as there are problems in areas such as : 1 ) housing from the obvious ( the homeless ) to the anonymous people living in substandard public housing .
2 ) no universal health care .
3 ) horrible public schools ( and I 'm talking about the physical structures and " food " even more than the teaching ) for our children .
4 ) the unbelievable subsidies given to the most polluting of our transportation alternatives - automobiles and airplanes - at the expense of public transportation .
I find it hard to get too worked up over the notion however valid it may be of universal access for brilliant children to MIT .
Nonetheless , thanks for your thoughts , actions , and for providing this forum for reply .

I should respond to Bob Givan , if only because we were office mates at MIT and he was kind enough to help me solve many a thorny math problem ...
I think Bob 's point that a research school like MIT is in danger of becoming completely unresponsive to undergrads is a good one .
I 'm personally dismayed that , even right now when we 're charging undergrads $ 100,000 / pop , I have a better chance of getting run over in Harvard Square by a Boeing 747 than I do of getting MIT to pay for the development of facilities for or a class in databases , Web - supported collaboration , or anything of the other things that I do .
I guess this is all wrapped up in the " no credit for an academic career will be given for anything other than a paper in a journal " philosophy of modern universities .
I do n't want to fight or argue against that right now , but at least we should stop making the undergrads pay for our little club .

It is all well and good for one to get up on a soapbox and point out the failings of the world , but it is another thing entirely to take a productive physical action to correct those failings .
However once you step down from that soapbox and make that first physical action , you can not stop .
There must be more actions to follow .
These actions need to attract those that feel the same way and in turn cause them to act positively .
This is the way all great change occurs .
I am a prospective MS Chemical Engineer who when choosing college picked it for the price .
I would have liked to attend Princeton , or MIT , or Georgia Tech , but since my parents are farmers / teachers I choose to go to Tennessee Technological University .
I got a good education in the basics of Chemical Engineering .
Any deficiencies I might have are directly my own fault , and therefore I say was it better to bankrupt my parents to get an education that was for the most part only in name better ?
I have decided the answer is no .
I would like to say that in the end it all comes down to you as an individual .
Remember you are your own best teacher , whatever you might be learning .
If you do n't beleive me then spend some time looking at all those self - taught scientific greats and you might just change your mind .
-- Sam Morton , March 13 , 1998
Phil 's giving $ 100 bills to his students should be viewed independently from the notion of making MIT tuition free .
Phil has selected a group of students that he feels will contribute something valuable to society ( the ones interested in his lecture on ) making database - backed web sites , and he 's choosing to subsidize their education directly .
Similarly , if companies or the government feel that a better engineer offers better value , they 're better off subsidizing that engineer directly , perhaps before school through scholarships or better - yet after graduation through higher salaries ( which can support borrowing to pay for tuition ) and which will attract more students to engineering .
This also has the effect of giving students the choice to attend the university that they believe offers them the best engineering degree for the money .
While engineering salaries might not equal that for an orthopedic surgeon or McKinsey partner , they 're overall not that bad .
Why they 're not higher is an interesting question .
As an aside , note that the government does make tuition free for engineering students at some universities : the Naval Academy , the Air Force Academy , West Point , the US Coast Guard academy .
Also , for a free engineering education , students can go to Cooper Union in New York City .
-- Richard Lethin , March 15 , 1998
Richard , you 're a genius and a good friend ( and a thoughtful old - style computer scientist ) , but you 've missed my point .
I did n't give the kids back their money because I wanted to subsidize them ; I gave them back their money because I can longer accept the idea that they and their families are subsidizing me .
I did n't want to personally profit from a system that I 've claimed is unjust ( and that the federal government claimed was unlawful ) .
Not only do I think it is unjust , but , though at one time it might have been very profitable , I think it is no longer in our institution 's best interest .
One thing that I should really add to my article is a stronger argument against using economic reasoning .
In my opinion , MIT should not operate by the same rules as , say , Microsoft .
Just because the market will bear our prices does n't mean that we should constantly strive to maximize profit .
If we go down that road then we must inevitably face the fact that MIT is a collection of people who are , though just as greedy as the owners / employees of Microsoft , not nearly as smart ( since MIT is not as financially successful as Microsoft ) .
We have to at least avoid the appearance of greed and profit maximization or people will just think that we were too stupid / incompetent / lazy to get jobs at more successful institutions .
-- Philip Greenspun , March 15 , 1998
I truly think that MIT could save a lot of money if they did not have to support a huge administrative body that does very little !
-- luigi vacca , March 16 , 1998
I would like to echo the comments of the gentleman that commented about the free educations in Britain and the apthy of the students there .
If students do n't pay something they wo n't repect the chance they are getting .
However , as a person who experienced ( like Phil ) , the doubling of tuition when I was in school , and who now has kids only 10 years away from college , I think that students ( parents ) ought to pay , just not so much .
Colleges should be more lean and mean , funds should be sought from more alternate sources , and students ought to pay $ 5000 a year .
That 's it .
Bravo to Phil and his public stand on the issue .
To swipe a phrase from the folks at be.com , " Resistance is not futile ! "
Keep up the good work .
-- Robert Dodson , March 16 , 1998
As a graduate of Carnegie - Mellon ( sort of a down - market MIT ;-) who did not pay any tuition ( Dad was faculty ) I can endorse this idea whole - heartedly .
In addition I can add some thoughs on the economic equation here : 1 ) the cost of attending college would not be zero even if the tuition were zero - the cost of living is still non-zero , and supporting oneself while attending college full time is not without difficulty .
In addition there 's the ' oppurtunity cost ' of lost earnings during the time one attends college .
Presumably the pay back in earning power will more than compensate for this , but it is a risk .
2 ) I think that universities would benefit from this as well by removing the incentives for ' grade inflation ' .
Its tough to flunk out someone who 's contributing 100 K to your top line ;-) .
3 ) the instinct to not value anything thats free is a well known phenomena , btw .
for instance chess clubs will often charge for introductory lessons that they would happily provide for free because it helps attendance and insures that the instructor is n't wasting their time .
I think that making the grading more rigorous would help to limit that problem by making a high GPA more meaningful , and thus making the resulting degree more valuable .
-- Lee Schumacher , March 16 , 1998
Robert mentions $ 5000 / year in his message two slots up .
It is funny because that 's almost exactly the figure that I calculated as the cost of educating a college student if classroom space and Ph.D. lecturers were purchased at market rates ( $ 30 sq. ft. for downtown office space and $ 2000 / course for a Ph.D. ; sorry about the low price for the instructor but that actually is the market rate right now ( I know because I have a bunch of friends who are teaching classes for this price ) ) .
If you think it sobering that office space costs more than Ph.D. instructors , then you need to read http://photo.net/philg/careers.html :-)
Lee raises a good point in the above message .
The opportunity cost of not working is quite high here in the U.S. Perhaps European students linger in school and appear to take it less seriously than Americans not because of the free tuition but because there are n't any jobs for youth in Europe .
Lee 's point # 2 about the difficulty of flunking a student who is paying the rent is a good one .
I was having an argument about MIT 's policies of race discrimination in admissions with a friend of mine who works in the MIT administration .
She was defending MIT 's policies as noble , despite the high dropout rate of those admitted to fill quotas .
I asked her how hard she thought MIT would work to fill race quotas if we had to refund the tuition dollars of those who dropped out .
She did n't like the idea too much ...
-- Philip Greenspun , March 16 , 1998
As someone who attended CMU , who has seen friends flunk out , and who left voluntarily myself , I have to say that its administration has no problem flunking out someone who contributes directly to the bottom line .
From what I gather they have a pitiful endowment & low alumni contributions * so tuition actually winds up paying significantly for undergrad courses .
( * MIT students joke about hating the place .
A not - insignificant number of CMU students really do . )
I applaud Phil 's actions .
If nothing else , a tuitionless school would remove a significant barrier to success :
The stress of knowing you 're bankrupting your parents , making good performance all the more necessary .
I know it was so for me .
I bet it was for a lot of the people who killed themselves
-- Chris Hanson , March 18 , 1998
I also applaud Phil 's actions .
It is refreshing to see someone taking action on his beliefs .
I 'm sure it was refreshing for those students too .
I do have mixed feelings about free tuition though .
If all the students who would attend a tuition - less MIT were like Phil then there 's no doubt that it would work .
That 's not likely to be the case though .
I , like Phil , spend a great deal of time thinking of ways to improve things , wondering why something / someone does n't work / think this way or that way , etc .
My response is usually " wel ... not everyone is like me . "
I think that applies here .
Never the less , I agree about the excessive cost , but I also agree about lazy students .
Lets face it .
money drives things in America .
Its unfortunate , but its true so until that changes , we have to work within that framework .
Someone mentioned something about the value of " free . "
This is my main concern ... I would love to see an increase in the percieved value of something that is free .
To this end , I also applaud Phil 's other efforts to benefit the web community throughout this site .
Well done !
-- Justin Loeber , March 19 , 1998
A recurring trend here has been the mention that making a school tuition free will result in lazy unmotivated students .
It does n't seem that this would necessarily be the case for the following reason :
Say a school has a certain capacity of undergraduates it can run through it 's system in each year .
Eliminating tuition dramatically increases the acceptance rate vs offers extended which would result in too many students .
To maintain the numbers at the previous levels one would obviously then have to make fewer offers to more carefully picked people .
Theoretically the school then ends up with undergrads who are less likely to be ' lazy ' to begin with and can always be kicked out if they develop ' lazy ' habits .
Now the problem with this model is that schools are often not terribly good at discerning people who would be exemplary students from those who would be mediocre .
This model seems to show that the emphasis would be placed even more strongly on the schools opinion of current and prospective students .
So , which tradeoff is better ?
fairness in regards to wealth ?
Or a slightly increased error of merit based selection ?
( Along with a vastly increased sense of paranoia , extreme competition , etc. )
Everything in life is a tradeoff .
Our quest should be to find the sweet spots ..
Like 2 f - stops down ..
Oh well , it wo n't affect me personally again for some time as I think I 'm done with the academic world for now ..
-- George Pang , March 20 , 1998
I have long considered tuition and financial aid grants a mechanism for price discrimination .
I would prefer a system where family finances are completely isolated from the process .
Schools should compete fiercly for the very best students .
Candidates with doulble 800 SAT scores should be offered low - cost educations , no matter what their family financial situation .
That way , presumambly , society will direct resources to those who can best benefit , and contribute , from the investment .
There is also the problem of early and secondary public education .
We do not have a system that offers anything even close to equal opportunity ( as opposed to Equal Employment Opportunity attempts of equal outcome ) .
-- Robert Budding , March 20 , 1998
Having graduated from a private university considered world class in the engineering specialty I chose , and having followed employeement for 9 years at one of the largest and most successful corporations in the world with 8 years of successful self self employment , I long ago concluded that while engineering fundamentals are essential building blocks to one 's capabilities , the individual 's desire and intelligence will ultimately govern performance in the real world regardless of educational pedigree .
A quality education is much less dependent on the effort that the university puts forth than that of the student .
A university education should be a means to an end , not the end itself .
When competing against or collaborating with other professionals I could give a shit less which university siphoned off their money .
What I do care about is how are they capable of performing .
In my experience this does not necessarily correlate with the reputation of the university from which they graduated .
The answer then , it would seem to me is take the full ride at OU or wherever and forget all the hand wringing over whether your son or daughter is being cheated out of the educational benefits of the most expensive degrees money can buy .
-- G Deen , March 20 , 1998
I 'm the product ( or soon to be one , anyway ) of a Canadian schooling .
Now , while we like to think we do a lot of things better than you yanks ;)
I can sy for certain that our post - secondary education system ( publicly subsidized ) is prob .
as good as many of the schools in the States .
Yes , I include Ivy League / private schools in that statement .
I agree with the basic tenet - it is unfair for the student ( and his / her family ) to take the brunt of the educational cost when that education has uncompensated externalities to society .
I think most will agree that an MIT education is not only beneficial to the student who gets it , but to society .
The only challenge is in assessing what is basically an economic ( read : ethereal ) number .
Another comment , about distance education .
I 'm all for it .
The U of Alberta , while good , simply cannot afford the quality of instruction that some other places can .
I think the future of undergraduate education will move to regional systems with " superclasses " taught by extremely good professors , with the costs for the technology and instruction borne by several institutions .
This has the effect of spreading the costs and the benefits out to many more people .
However , what do you think about a " critical mass " theory , such as Porter's ?
He believes that a geography - based mass of talent afforded an industry ( whether it be the Detroit automotive sector , Silicon Valley , MIT , or Hollywood ) , has a greater positive effect than disparate groups of people .
Will the girl in Vietnam with the cable modem get a " true " MIT education , or is the culture of campus ( hacks , suicide , hot n' humid Mass weather , high stress , late nights ) also important ?
-- Chris Neuman , March 27 , 1998
The question that I am trying to answer as an entering freshman is what will my rewards be for such a monetary investment ?
As Philip pointed out , with tuition rates propelling at a ever - increasing rate it would appear foolish to pursue a career in art ( my passion ) , while the true return on my parents investment would be the wrangling of an M.B.A..
Unfortuately , I am seeing students select majors that will not satisfy themselves passionately , but financially .
-- Jason George , April 7 , 1998
As is common in Europe , higher education is free in the Czech Republic as well ( for Czech students , that is - foreigners must pay a great deal , and I 'll add that the government here is now trying to introduce tuition for all students ) .
I think the system of free higher education is wonderful , and wish I 'd been able to take advantage of something like this ( I am an American ) .
One thing to look out for , however , is students " lingering on " in school for as many as ie 8 years before getting a BA , or dropping out needlessly .
Of course , this happens everywhere - but it makes the system more inefficient & should be especially discouraged in an environment where the student is not paying his or her own way .
If I were Boss of All Universities Everywhere , I 'd consider the advantages of making just the standard 4 ( or however many for your field ) years free , and those who do n't finish in the standard period of time would pay for each additional semester ( year , whatever :)
Thanks for a wonderful site .
PS
It * is* hot and humid in Vietnam ! :)
-- Nora Mikes , April 9 , 1998
I would like to comment on a few subjects : 1 ) the perceived value of something free .
I will just take an example that I think speaks for itself ( at least for any computer geek ;- ) ) .
Which of the two do you think bears the most value : Linux or Windows ?
Which of the two is free ?
2 ) Free / Cheap education in Europe and in Canada .
I took engineering in France at INSA .
This a public university which means that tuition fees are very low .
I will have to agree with the person from the UK , not all students were highly motivated .
However most manage to get their degree in a place where failing a student means less costs ( not less profit ) .
So now I have a degree , and I have a job with above - average wages .
What that means is that in turn I pay more tax to subsidize universities .
To me this is fair .
The key I think is that education should be a right ( not based on your / your parents financial situation ) , not an obligation in order to get a decent life .
3 ) A good part of the education I got from my University was related to the environment ( extra scholar life ) .
The university looks ugly ( old early 60's building falling apart , lack of money (? ) ) , but the social life was so predominent that I learned much much more than just engineering .
There are over 80 student - run organizations running at cost for a community of 3000 students ( imagine paying 10 $ / year to see 3 movies a week in a theater ) .
I challenge any university with 100K $ fees to have such a dynamic and productive student life .
In fact I had the oportunity to spend my final year in Canada ( at Ottawa U ) , and even though the tuition fees are low , the cost of living for a student is a lot higher .
The result was that yes students were more " academically " motivated , BUT apart for the minorities groups , I have not seen much student organizations nor any will for them .
I think it comes from the fact that most student worry about how they are going to pay for next semester more than how to take advantage of their situation .
My opinion is that University is not just about a degree , but it is an environment that should be enabling and provide opportunities for people to experiment and get involved at a community level .
I believe that this is better achieved if you relieve students from the stress of finding a place to live and something to eat ( and pay the tuitions ) .
-- Patrick Bihan - Faou , April 11 , 1998
After digesting all the interesting comments , I am beginning to see the following points clearly : 1 ) A student of the nth class can pay to attend a school of class n or get a full ride at a school of class n+1 .
This seems fair .
The main problem which occurs : there are many more students than schools , so that there is a subset of students attending a 1st - class school like MIT who would actually qualify to attend a 0th class school except none exists ; thus MIT unlike the 2nd - class , 3rd - class etc , schools faces no competition from above and can collude with the schools of its own class to charge full price .
( The 2nd - class schools can't get away with colluding because they face competition from above ; also there are too many of them . )
The obvious solution is to create a small 0th - class school ( maybe small enough that one of the many billionaires in this country could endow it once and for all with a few hundred million dollars so that it could be free ; the alumni of such a school would no doubt be much richer and more generous than , say , Harvard grads . )
This problem affects the top few percent .
A different problem affects the few percent of nth - class students who are actually given a free ride to a school of class n- 1 -- it is difficult for the student to resist this temptation but the dangers of accepting it are great .
2 ) But the broader problem is that the cost is too high for the great majority of 1st - class students who properly belong at MIT and are gouged unconscionably .
Everyone seems to recognize that the positive social externalities of giving a 1st - class education to 1st - class students merit some subsidization ; the two issues that arise are how high the overall level of subsidization should be and how the subsidies should be distributed .
3 ) It seems clear that simply redistributing the current subsidy wo n't help because only a small percentage of students could afford to pay significantly more than they are currently being charged , at the cost of even uglier price discrimination than currently exists .
Somehow the aggregate burden on the undergrad students must be reduced .
The government subsidizes loans nicely , but direct funneling of tax dollars to the top schools for tuition has severe political and economic drawbacks .
On the other hand , where else can such a large amount of money come from ?
4 ) We need a " free lunch " .
Fortunately , free lunches * do* exist when markets are inefficient .
And boy , is this market inefficient !
As many people have pointed out in earlier comments , costs at the top schools are insanely high , and the reason is simply that they * can * be , because there is no economic competition as there would be if MIT and Harvard were private companies subject to antitrust laws and shareholder pressure .
The people who run the universities do n't feel threatened when the bottom line suffers -- the effect of runaway costs is well - muffled by the structure of the university .
The component that is actually affected in the end is the endowment , which does n't grow nearly as fast as it should have , but that has an indiscernible impact on the ordinary functioning of the university .
5 ) So the answer is to do what many American companies successfully did in the 80's and 90's -- improve performance by tying executive compensation more directly to the bottom line .
Universities do n't have stock options , but why not create endowment options ?
The president of the school and other important administrators should have base salaries that are quite a bit smaller and bonuses tied strictly to growth in the university 's endowment -- they can achieve this by cutting costs , pressuring alumni , or whatever .
Naturally this will give them an incentive to keep tuition high , but there is no additional blood to be squeezed from that stone , and the overall improvement in the school 's finances from cost- cutting , improved fundraising , etc. , will take pressure off the undergrads and in the long run lead to tuition reductions .

What Mr. Greenspun has done is admirable .
It is admirable because he has taken a stance when he could have remained seated while making more money .
I myself chose to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology because my parents were already paying for an Ivy - League education and I did not want to make them pay for two .
I believe that I got an excellent education at Georgia Tech .
That is something that the rest of the world admires about the United States , if you want to learn , you can .
The resources are there .
One of the projects I was involved with at Georgia Tech was all about that , at least to me .
It was about giving students and professors more access to resources and better learning and teaching environments .
It was about making the lectures available after they had ocurred , so that a student might be able to " experience " the lecture again from their dorm room or home .
It was about making all aspects of the material and the way it was portrayed available for someone to access easily .
Please look at : http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/c2000/index.html
I do n't see why we can't use these same tools to provide education to anyone who wants it .
And I mean anyone anywhere .
I myself had to move from South America to attend university here , because those resources were only available here .
I would have liked to have the option of getting the education I got from Colombia .
Bill Gates wants to put a PC on every desk in the world , well we can use that for our advantage .
These PCs will most likely have modems and therefore their users have access to any resources that we , the technocratic upper class , provide .
Lets take advantage of this .
It is the right thing to do .
-- Yonatan Feldman , April 24 , 1998
Someone made the brilliant observation that the government does in fact pay to educate engineers via the US Navel Academy , Air Force Academy , etc .
Its sad that I have to point this out , but , IT IS COMPLETELY POINTLESS TO BECOME AN ENGINEER IF ALL YOU ARE EVER GOING TO DO IS FIND BETTER WAYS TO KILL PEOPLE .
I 'm sure the US governemnt would love for smart people like me and the other 10,000 MIT students to find new ways of killing all those enemies we do n't have , but the thought is morally repugnant to me and every other engineering student with a conscience , something money can't buy .
Not yet anyway .

I 'm graduating this spring from highschool , and will soon be heading for college .
Many college students are in the boat that their parents are paying for a lot of the college education , and they are getting scholarships , and loans to pay for the rest .
I am in a different boat .
I am actually spending my own money to go to college .
My parents are n't going to help me in any other way than free room and board if I pick a college close enough to live at home .
I was accepted at Penn State Main Campus .
But when I looked at that and the state college ( I'm in PA ) up the road from me , I saw that Penn State paid the most attention to their grad students .
The state college does n't have a graduate program for computer science , so the professors pay more attention to undergrad students .
Penn State did n't care whether I went there or not , but the state college really wanted me to go .
Penn State will leave me having to pay off large college loans , forcing me to take a high paying job to pay the loans off , the state college will leave me debt free at the end of 4 years , able to do what I want , whether that is go to grad school , or take a job as a part time waiter and spend my evenings and weekends creating the best computer games and application software in the world , then giving it away for free .
In the end I chose the state college .
The quality of courses looked to be on par between the two schools .
All Penn State would have offered me is a big name diploma and lots of bills .
If I need / want the big name diploma I can go to grad school later .

I do n't live in the USA , but may I suggest that the whole problem you have with " the system " is even more deep seated than you are imagining .
In reality , a University education is not really worth a damn .
The system exists because ... a )
Employers like to see the certificate b)
It keeps the government unemployment figures down c ) Historical reasons .
People learn more in 6 months of real work and real life than they do in 4 years of University .
I 've learnt 500 times more than I ever did at Uni just through personal research in my spare time .
I 've learnt another 500 times more doing the practical things my job requires .
What I learnt at Uni is quite frankly useless - even if I could remember what it was - which I can't .
The real answer is to reduce Uni courses from 3 or 4 years down to only one year .
Make it much more affordable , the corporate grants would go 3 times further , kids would get out and earn money sooner and waste less time in Uni .
-- anonymous anonymous , May 18 , 1998
I applaud Phil 's ideas , and I sincerely doubt that any students would value their educations less because Chrysler paid for it instead of Mom .
I certainly would n't have .
When I applied to universities seven years ago , I faced a situation directly impacted by the phenomenal costs of tuition at MIT .
I was accepted to MIT for undergrad admissions , but because my " ability to pay " ( the amount , after loans , that I 'm expected to have out - of - pocket ) was set at about $ 2000 a year , I was n't able to go .
$ 2000 a year may seem like a steal to most undergrads ( or their parents ) , but my mother was not interested in paying any of my tuition , for reasons I wo n't go into here .
Suffice it to say that I had no choice , and no funds .
I was also using the proceeds from my $ 5/ hr after - school job to pay my portion of the rent , for similar reasons , so there was no way in hell that I would have been able to save up the $ 8 - 10 K necessary by the time I left for MIT .
As far as scholarships were concerned , I was out of luck .
I had a 1440 SAT score and a genuine desire to learn , but my high school grades were awful because of my constant boredom with the feeble education my San Diego public school provided .
I 'm male and part of an ethnic group that is assumed to be wealthy , so no help there .
In short , I received about $ 500 in potential aid , far short of what I needed .
I ended up going to a local community college for two years while working part time jobs to scrape out a living , then abandoning the whole process to take a full - time job as a Web programmer .
I 'm currently using the sad salary this produces to pay for my wedding , but I hope to save enough money to transfer to a UC school by fall of 1999 .
Note that this is about the same time I would have received a Physics Ph.D. had I gone to MIT .
I was hoping to develop a quantum theory of gravity ( hardly a money - making venture ) by this time , perhaps ushering in a revolution in technology the same way electronics and quantum mechanics have .
Who knows ?
Perhaps I still will .
-- Chris Radcliff , June 5 , 1998
There is nothing wrong with making lots of money , but I was ( once ) under the impression that knowledge , learning and research for it's own sake was worthwile and that places of higher education where the place for this to happen .
If " higher " education is about only higher money then I think that we are all worse off .
-- Philip Stebbins , June 15 , 1998
Dear Phil , in you essay " Why I 'm not a writer " you made the following remark in conjunction with a bitter - sweet life story of James Wilcox : " There are people who are good at doing things .
There are people who are good at kissing ass and taking credit .
These bundles of skills seem to be at odds so that one rarely finds them in the same person .
In most areas of human endeavor , if you want to become famous or just put food on the table and are forced to choose between the skill bundles , it is much better to pick ass - kissing and credit - taking . "
If you combine this remark with the Darwinian theory you 'll see why our society is the way it is , probably as long as your remark remains relevant we are doomed to be a species where ass - kissers and credit - takers dominate .

wonderful essay and photographs .... there should be more use of the net for this ....
-- alan d. Smith , June 25 , 1998
To all those who talk about the money / motivation correlation , I say " not so fast ! " .
While there might be a great motivation the results from spending a great deal of money , Phil is arguing that it 's motivating people to do things that are not necessarily as socially productive if they had n't accumulated a massive debt in the process .
Secondly , schools are treating their students more like customers and less like the pupils that they really are .
As a results , at Stanford ( to name names ) , the policy is very flexible in permitting students to " buy " an A by dropping a class the day of the final and then re-taking it with out any penalty on one 's transcript .
If you can " afford " to take extra classes , you can raise your GPA by dropping classes that are below your target GPA .
In private high schools , teachers are told by students that since the students pay the tuition , the teacher 's job depends on making the students " happy . "
Here 's a radical proposal for sticking with the idea of tuition - free schools and keeping students motivated : give degrees to the students that exhibit the motivation and the competence to deserve the degree , and give no degree to those who do n't deserve it .
In it 's present position , MIT ( and other universities ) are compelled to give degrees , even when they have not been earned academically because they have been earned [ sic ] financially .
-- Michael Tiemann , July 14 , 1998
I have read some comments where people link the motivation of the students to the tuition they pay .
I have a hard time believing in that .
I studied international trade at the Sorbonne in Paris for 5 years .
The highest tuition I paid was around $ 500.00 for the last year .
So , money was not a concern .
However , when you enter , it is made clear to you that , at the end of the first 2 years , only 50 % of the students make it to the next year , the number raises to 75 % after that .
If you fail , you can take the exam one more time the next year .
After that , you have to change school , the Sorbonne will not accept you ( this was the case for the " Economics " section between 1989 and 1993 , it might have changed ) .
Students were pushed to succeed if the ever wanted to graduate and have a chance to enter Ph.D. programs or Masters programs , which judge you only on your academic results .
Motivation comes from the sanction of your personal work , not from your wealth .
From what I 've heard from American friends , it seems easier to move on from one year to the next in American universities ( for undergraduates anyway ) .
The difference seems more to be in " how much university you can afford " rather than how good you are ( this is a caricature for the sake of my argumentation , do not flame me : I am not saying American students are lazy , French students are hard workers .
I am a living proof of the opposite ... )
With that said , I believe , like Phil , in an " non-money selective " educational system .
Yet , I am faced with problematic questions when I try to envisage alternatives .
Free or quasi - free schools have one drawback : they have to be financed mainly by public funds i.e. taxpayers , even if their own kids never go to the university .
Basically , every year , French taxpayers do exactly what Phil did in his class : they give $ 100.00 to each French student .
However , as opposed to Phil , they do n't have the opportunity to choose to do it .
I will never be thankful enough to the millions of French taxpayers who provided grants for me and my fellow students .
So , on one hand , I agree with Phil that the tuitions requested by the American Ivy League schools are prohibitive .
On the other hand , what is a fair alternative ?
Is it fair to make everybody contribute to something from which they will potentially never get any return ?
No country can seriously rely on philanthropic funding of its school system .
Some isolate case would prove me wrong , but I know I am globally right .
I would also be disturbed to see large companies completely fund universities .
It would imply that they have some kind of tacit right to also inculcate their corporate culture to students .
Universities are supposed to be a placed of free speech and creative thinking , not necessarily turned toward marketable results .
Corporate financing goes against that , in my opinion .
What will happen to " non-productive " topics , such as art , philosophy , or history ?
Is any corporation going to see the point of unselfishly funding these sections ?
You tell me .
So far , for me , a socialized school system is the only viable alternative to a private educational system , whether it becomes a virtual university , as Phil prescribes , or not .
They both have their pluses and minuses .
I still like the socialized system better .
One because I have the honesty to admit I used it to my advantage ; two , because every students are equal and given an opportunity to be judge on their intrinsic value rather than their family wealth , but , still , it is not a perfect system .
I would be interested to see someone , especially our host Phil Greenspun , sharing his / her opinion on that matter .
-- Stephane --, July 17 , 1998
So much to say , where to start ?
I applaud your putting your beliefs into action in this way .
I do n't agree with everything you are saying , but it is refreshing to see someone ' put their money where their mouth is ' .
I agree with what you and most of the people here have said about rising administrative costs relative to instructor costs .
I think this is inevitable in any large not - for - profit endeavor - as soon as your organization grows large enough to require full - time administrators , these administrators will seize control and start building empires .
Just look at what has happened to the health care industry since the creation of the Medicare / Medicaid programs .
I also agree that it is high time for industry to start subsidizing education , but on a strictly voluntary basis .
Let industry support those educational facilities that provide the most value to industry , this should create some healthy competition .
Unfortunately from where I sit ( just finishing a gig at a major pharmaceutical mfg ) it looks like most of the big companies with big bucks are also run by beancounters ( professional managers ) who see things differently to them an MBA is worth at least twice as much as an MS .
I disagree with the main plank of your plan ( free tuition ) , but before I go into that let me give a little personal background .
I graduated from high school in 1975 with about a C+ average .
I applied to the local state university ( UMKC ) and was accepted , but never registered and never attended any college or university , instead I was lucky enough to get a job at one of the many companies that started up and failed in the early days of the micro ' revolution ' .
A couple more startup / failures and I was on my way to a glorious career in the IS field .
Why did n't I go to college ?
It was n't for lack of ability .
I 'm a pretty smart person ( when I was about 19 years old an MIT Prof. told me this so it must be true ) ; my poor grades mostly reflected my lack of motivation and overall boredom with school .
At the time I told myself that money was the big factor .
True , many people support themselves and pay their own way to college .
I would n't even have had to support myself .
My parents would have supported me ; they just could n't afford to pay for me to go to college ( and probably continue to get Cs ) .
At the time I saw college as an extension of high school and I wasnt really motivated enough to flip hamburgers at night and try to stay awake in class all day .
Given my background one might think that I would be a supporter of free college tuition .
I 'm not .
And although I do n't believe in government subsidized education at any level , this is n't the primary reason I oppose ' free ' college education .
At one time , the average person had six years of schooling , the ' educated ' person had a couple more .
I once worked for a man who went to Harvard after ten years of public school .
No , he did n't skip any grades , ten years was all that was offered at the time and place where he grew up .
When I was a kid , the big advertising push on television was to finish high school .
We all grew up knowing that if you wanted to get any kind of decent job ( i.e. , not digging ditches ) you had to have a high school diploma .
Today we are close to a situation where the average person entering the workforce has at least two years of college , and to be considered ' educated ' you must have at least a master 's degree .
Is the person with sixteen years of education today ( typical BA / BS ) really twice as educated as the person with eight years of schooling ( six years grammar school , two years of University ) two hundred years ago ?
I do n't think so .
True , there are many things one has to learn today that they could n't even imagine then , but I think there are probably almost as many things which were an essential part of daily life then which are only of interest to anthropology / history students today .
So , if the BA / BS of today does n't mean the same thing it did one hundred years ago , what effect will free undergraduate tuition have on the situation ?
President Clinton wants to make sure that every one who wants one can get a college education .
When this is accomplished how will the truly motivated people distinguish themselves ?
They will have to get even more education .
An MS / MA will become as common as a BS / BA is today , and the Ph.D. will become as common as an MS / MA is now .
Bottom line :
How long can society afford to support people while they get an education ?
Sixteen years ?
Twenty years ?
Thirty years ?
Is more free education the solution or is it the problem ?
I agree that the system is broken .
I dont think that free tuition is the answer .
Thank you for providing this opportunity to express myself .
-- Les Lovesee , July 17 , 1998
I 'm going to respond to Stephane 's thoughtful comments above regarding the French system and a socialized system of education .
Stephane : do n't lose sight of the fact that I 'm not proposing tuition - free education for all Americans at all schools .
I 've nothing against this idea but I have n't really thought about it .
As an employee and graduate of MIT , I 'm merely proposing that we ( MIT ) would be better off as an institution if did n't demand tuition payments .
As I note in my article , MIT is in a unique position to get corporate funds because very few of our students are studying the " non-productive " topics you mention ( " art , philosophy , and history " ) .
So we do n't have to try to educate some crass business executive about the long - term value of studying Milton and Donne .
As far as Stephane 's comment about universities being places for creative thinking not necessarily turned toward marketable results , let me repeat that it is tough to expect students to live this way if we 're reaming them out of $ 150,000 .
Most people do n't have the luxury of merely spending $ 150,000 ; those few lucky enough to get their hands on that kind of money end up thinking instead about how to INVEST it .
So the university education becomes an investment on which the student must strive to earn a return .
This disheartens me .
Much as I love to see some of the MIT kids I 've trained earning $ 175 / hour building Web / db applications ( they are now worth more to industry than the average CS professor ! ) , I 'd really rather see them pursuing truth and beauty .
-- Philip Greenspun , July 18 , 1998
I 'm posting this anonymously as some of my comments directly relate to the university which I currently attend .
I must first say that I am opposed to corporate funding ( at least directly ) for univeristies as this will almost certainly control the direction and programs offered at the university .
While it may work for a very specialised university ( such as MIT ) it would not work for a more generalised university ( such as the one I attend ) .
If a corporation were to fund such a univeristy they would surely only wish to provide funds for programs that they felt would directly benefit their company ( such as computer science or engineering for example ) .
This would create the situation where programs deemed less useful by the corp would not receive funding ( such as many of the arts programs ) which would result in these programs being underfunded ( even more so ) and thus being removed .
I would much rather see a higher system of taxation placed on corporations making large ammounts of money , with the funds going to the universities , based on student population .
This money would then go towards providing better quality programs as well as lower tuition fees .
As far as not apreciating what is free , I feel that this is somewhat true but is untrue in other ways .
Because we must pay for our tuition many students feel they cannot study what they truly want to do but instead study what they feel will give them a job after graduation .
Look at the number of comerce or compuer science students as an example .
One student I know told me that he was taking comerce because he wanted to make money when he graduates .
He was failing badly and went on academic probation .
When he returned to school he transfered into theater and is now much happier .
By making tuition free ( or much cheaper ) you would result in encouraging more students to follow what they truly feel motivated to do .
If competition for spots in the next year / semester was also increased then this would still encourage students .
Students would also be unable to resent this increased competition because they would know that they were n't paying for their school and so competition had to be high .
I think that one of the major problems is that we live in a society in which money is considered to be the most valuable thing .
If you have more money you must be a better and happier person ( not always the case though ) .
So you have to study something that can let you make lots of money .
In addition to this , employers place an over - high value on a degree .
Unfortunatley , anyone with the money seems to be able to get a degree so the degree is really worthless .
The degree says nothing about how you performed in school and so a C student and an A student are considered equal in the employers eyes ( as all they see is the degree ) .
I would like to see a system in which tuition is cheap or free , competitiion for spots is high , and where the degree actually means something .
Personally , I find that even though I pay for my tuition ( through loans ) that my motivation is still low .
Why ?
Because I am more motivated by learning and if I 'm taking a class that does n't make me think or explore new ideas then I do n't feel motivated by it .
I do n't care about my marks either , I care about what I got out of the class .
Funding needs to be increased in order to provide greater quality teaching .
As a final example of the current system , I study in a small department .
In my second year I was feeling un-motivated by one of my classes because I felt that I was n't getting much out of the class so I did n't go to it as often and I did n't do the work .
But , the prof knew that I wanted to go on studying in that department .
Because of the very small size of the department ( 4 profs , 8 students in my main 3rd year course ) he could n't fail me .
He had every right to do so as I had n't completed the work but since I wanted to go on he had to give me the minimum mark required to continue .
This situation is n't that uncommon and only cheats students and professors .
The prof in question was also very young and that was his 2nd year of teaching .
He grew increasingly disillusioned over the term as he saw how the system was cheating him and the students .
Thanks for letting me get all of this out !
Great page !
Keep up the fight !

Three cheers for Phil .
The fact is , private college education , particularly as it is practiced by the grand ivy pooh bahs and their brethren is a gigantic exercise in income redistribution .
That which the folks who write federal and state tax policy have not been able to do , the nice people cited in Phil 's POV have accomplished .
It 's astounding to think that tax payers who squak so intensely about paying taxes and the intrusiveness of various government agencies comply so willingly with the nearly identifcal ministrations of the bean counters at the great institutions of private learning ?
Here 's the slammer .
Take a look sometime at the size of the endowment at places like Harvard ( which is the most egregious ) .
What is all that money for ?
Then look at the amount of money that is paid out .
It 's generally about the same as the yield on a treasury certificate which is considerably less than the internal rate of return on their well managed portfolio .
The fact is , the entire student body could attend for free just based on investment portfolio performance over the last ten years .
Does that mean tuition should be free ?
No .
Does that mean there should be a more rational view of educational pricing ?
I think Phil has advanced an argument in favor of that .
Will anything change ?
Eventually I think it will for two reasons :
1 ) The next economic downturn .
2 ) The internet which will marginalize bricks and mortar in the hallowed halls of academia just as it has in banking and any other dozen segments of the economy you care to name .

When I was fired as a university administrator for trying to catch an embezzler , I decided that I was n't able to survive on instinct , so I needed some intellectual strategies .
Using my education ( BS MIT VIII ' 50 , MA PhD Columbia ) I invented a science of human behavior .
It is on the web at http://surf.to/2000.
I think that a tuition - free MIT is irrelevant because it will just reduce the spiritual power ( or " mana " ) of MIT in a world that bases status on money .
The internet will lead us into a world Norbert Wiener described where the only ones who will be allowed to work will be those who can do something better than a robot or computer .
This will create an elite " working class " and a " liesure class " that will be supplied with whatever satisfies their needs as long as they keep themselves occupied and quiet .
Tuition will be , like selling food and shelter , an obsolete concept .
-- Karl Eklund , August 18 , 1998
Does MIT offer something that , for example , UMASS does n't offer for undergrade engineering ?
In 1976 I asked just that question , and decided the answer was " no " .
The course offerings were identical .
Over the years , I 've worked for Purdue ( a state school ) , Harvard , and UPenn , and have concluded that I was right .
UMass should have the edge with size .
On the other hand , WPI ( private engineering school in Worcester ) offered pass / fail courses , independent study and required projects .
WPI was n't ( and is n't ) cheap , but IMHO , was worth it .
Despite excellence , WPI had to constantly fight to retain accredidation .
Some departments ( EE in particular ) found ways to teach by the old rules .
The status quo can be an ugly Goliath , even to an institution sized David .
It goes without saying that the web - student must be self - motivated .
Self - motivation may be helped if there is a carrot at the end of the tunnel .
( for some , maybe not ) .
Traditional exams are very poor at testing ability and skill .
That means the accredidation problem continues .
It 's worse for anything new than for the status quo , since anything new must prove that it is superior to the status quo , whereas the status quo must only prove that it is the status quo .

I come from a Third World country and can't help but get excited from your comment about hoping some day a high school girl in Vietnam can attend all the MIT classes she wants through the NET .
The idea in my opinion is about as radical as Karl Marx 's ideas and would generate similar monumental changes in our century .
Historically , " have " nations have been able to dominate and overcome " have nots " and continue to do so because of more advanced technology i.e. gun powder , superior metallurgy etc .
I have to thank people of conscience like yourself who can see class inequities and have resisted being swallowed up in a highly competitive society where the measure of your worth is the amount of dollars you can extract .
I pray that you and other pioneers of the NET will be successful in your noble quest and that mankind in the next century will be the better for it .
-- Jack Congson , December 11 , 1998
A free MIT .
Very interesting .
I 'll bet if tuition were free the caliber of the student body would improve dramatically .
A replacement for the lost tuition income could come from a semester of the third undergraduate year devoted to inventing .
The university would patent the inventions , license them to business and share the income with the student .
I will also bet the patent income will over time exceed the lost tuition .
-- Chris Doner , December 21 , 1998
Phil 's article struck a nerve .
I went to Harvard as a freshman ( on one of the few merit scholarships available in 1982 ) but dropped out after a year when the scholarship ended .
I was n't eligible for financial aid because my mother , who had made poverty - level wages the year before , maintained a savings account ( she works in an industry where year - long unemployment was fairly common , so she set aside savings for lean years ) .
It turned out that the financial aid algorithms required exhausting all savings before a student becomes eligible for any significant aid .
I knew people at Harvard who were getting more financial aid than I was offered whose families had yachts and vacation homes .
Apparently these do n't count against financial aid the way a savings account does .
All the private schools used the same algorithm for aid calculation .
I dropped out , worked for a year and ended up at UCSC , from which I eventually graduated ( paying most of my own way with some help from family ) .
Now that I 'm making good money , I send UCSC donations every year , earmarked for student scholarships and library books ( no alumni wine - tasting parties ) .
Harvard still sends me financial aid pleas , which go into the recycler .
I was rude to them on the telephone because they kept pestering me for money , and told them why I would n't contribute ; finally they got the message and stopped calling .
I hope Phil 's vision of college courses on the web comes to pass .
It would also solve the continuing education problem , for adults who want to take advanced college courses but can't afford the time or tuition to enroll in a graduate degree program .
-- Akkana Peck , December 31 , 1998
The idea of free universities in the USA is enticing , since our economy is presumably doing so well .
The one free - university I know about is one I visited frequently last summer : Universidad Central ( UCV ) in Caracas , Venezuela .
While I met many wonderfully idealistic and thoughtful students , the physical infrastructure and faculty of UCV have serious problems , in part due to a grave lack of money for salaries and maintenence that is related to the economic disaster of the country .
Though it is plausible that the nations corporations will eventually pick up the slack , as has been proposed in an article in Business Venezuela , one of the nation 's premiere business magazines , I shudder at the thought of making corporations that involved , since they have only one major reason for educating anyone : to develop a large supply of effective workers for their industries who posses technical skills .
They are not likely to value the liberal , humanistic education that universities have traditionally stood for .
I think it dangerous to let the private sector 's money contaminate the interests of higher education in our country more than it has already .
-- Mike McVey , January 4 , 1999
While I agree almost completely with Phil 's opinions on tuition , the chief reason I am stepping up to speak is to applaud his ability to create this display of both intellegence and concern from the mass of stupidity that abounds on the internet .
I have just discovered this web site and am amazed at the quality of content .
It makes the " Favorites " on my browser appropriate .
Thank you Phil for the forum and thank you participants for your comments .

The return on investment for an engineer attending MIT or any other expensive school is poor .
While starting salaries may look reasonable ( $ 40 K - $ 50 K ) , the salary compression is such that salaries after 15 years are barely over $ 70 K in the corporate world .
Simple financial calculations ( NPV ) will show that is is not a good way to invest $ 150,000 , especially at a cost of 10 - 11 % interest .
As Phil says , this leads to many engineers leaving their profession for more lucrative fields .
As an alternative , most large corporations will pay today for your undergraduate and graduate education .
The typical requirement is that you earn a C or B in a class to get reimbursed .
( The downside is that you must do this while working and most universties look down on working engineers , especially at the graduate level .
Most professors prefer full - time foreign indentured grad students who fawn at their feet and work endess hours on the professors pet projects .
Add to this the fact that many engineering professors are picked from this internal group so that many engineering courses lack any relevance to the real world .
For this reason , at least in information / computer systems , college degrees have little correlation with rates . )
A better investment for a high school student interested in a good practice as a engineer is to get an associates degree from the local community college ( where course are usually taught by Phds in small classes as opposed to non-english speaking grad students teaching 5000 student classes ) .
At the same time the student should get a basic certification such as Microsoft or Cisco .
At this point , he / she should apply for a job as an engineering aide at a large corporation and immediately enroll for BSc to complete his / her education at company expense .
Additional industry certifications such as Cisco's CCIE will lead to salaries in the $ 125K - $ 150 K arena after the engineer leaves the corporate fold and consults or works for a small startup firm .
Total investment on part of the student is probably several thousand dollars as opposed to several hundred thousand .. - Jamie Ross MIT '79
-- Jamie Ross , February 1 , 1999
here are a few random points ; 1 ) the discussion concerning the motivational level of paying students versus " free ride " students is interesting , but I do n't think you can come to a conclusion without looking at external factors .
one is the effect of the inherently hostile university environment ; I suspect that the " free riders " , particularly those on scholarships , have gotten used to good treatment by the various schools up to college .
the pay - as - you - go crowd , not having been accorded any respect during middle and high school , may be better prepared emotionally for the slings and arrows of outrageous academia .
another factor is the end result of those hard years ; for Europeans in particular , I have read that post - graduate success has more to do with socio-economic status than academic performance , so why kill yourself studying ?
2 ) I find it increasingly ironic that , as the American economy becomes faster - paced and more competitive , that 17 - year - olds are expected to have their future mapped out , and have the self - discipline and motivation to pursue that future with all guns blazing ( metaphors mixed while - u - wait ! ) .
3 ) the Utopians would like everything to be merit - based , while the Free - Marketeers would like competition to provide efficiency .
both mean well , and both will be disappointed .
the problem is a complex one related to scale .
if less expensive schools provided the same education , and employers had the ability to accurately gauge future value of prospective employees , then the wise college freshman would choose the cheaper school .
real life does n't work that way .
large organizations have a management structure ( thus implementing the Peter Principle ) and usually a dedicated Human Resources department ( a set of folks for whom lobotomies would be redundant ) .
both groups of people are often willing to pay a dollar premium for the prestige degree .
also , work assignments and advancement opportunities are more likely available to the best pedigree .
so , there are incentives in the U.S. for students to pay the massive premium charged by MIT .
and if they 're willing to pay , any university _will_ charge it .
universities are about money , after all .
no matter what is done , I am not sure that there is a solution to this problem , unless you find a way to address the external issues .
its sort of a symptom of greater societal ills .
there are trainloads of related rants which partly feed into this issue , but I 'll sign off for now .
for the prestige
-- Wilfred of Ivanhoe , February 11 , 1999
As I read Philip 's argument , it struck me how much his vision of a tuition free school matched the reality at Cooper Union .
I know that the reference is redundant , since it 's been previously mentioned , but the Cooper is really unique .
The school is n't perfect , but it does n't force students to waste time and effort running some sort of financial gauntlet before granting them an affordable education .
Oh , by the way , Cooper also offers free education in the fields of art and architecture .
It 's not just an engineering school .
-- Frank Wortner , March 18 , 1999
Back in the 1950s and 60s , many Americans did get a free education thanks to the GI bill , and there were even more tuition - free schools than there are today .
Student loans were unheard of .
Back then , the view was that society is investing in you to do something important that will benefit everybody .
Today , the view is that since you are the main beneficiary of your education , why should n't you pay for it ?
When we send that message to students , I do n't think we can blame them for pursuing high pay over fulfillment and public service .
It 's hard for me to say what parents should pay since mine were asked and able to pay very little , but burdening 21 year olds with thousands of dollars in debt does n't seem like the best start MIT could give to young careers .
I think the real question is who pays for education and what does that payment represent ?
Is it the older generation investing in the younger generation , or is each generation on its own ?
Is it the whole society making the investment in its future , or does it just work one family at a time ?
Whose interests is MIT supposed to be serving and how are they best served ?
-- Delete Me , March 27 , 1999
your responses inspired me to take a look at our academia over the last two centuries .
two hundred years ago we were an agrarian economy .
University was for the well born and based on the English model .
one hundred years ago we were an industrial economy .
University was for the well born and based on the German model ( as it is today ) .
fifty years ago we were a scientific economy .
in response to the communist challenge we became more egalitarian .
University was for everyone .
today we are an information economy .
in response to the communist collapse we reverted to earlier times .
University was for the well born ( and its now necessary hirelings ) .
in a class system the price of admission / tuition is necessarily high .
if the upper echelons of government / academia / corporations form this class , what can we expect in the future ?
more consolidation , more monopoly , less free distribution of information , less change .
the Web is new and upstart , it will be the first to feel the pinch .
you 'll still be able to distribute flyers on the street corners as you did before but - you 'll see more server based solutions ( no more just looking at View Source to see how it 's done ) , a more snazzy and expensive ( in time and money , talent and knowledge ) look to discourage entry , and more proprietary solutions discouraging mass communication ( till these are erased by consolidation ) .
reading this over , i find it inexorably and depressingly negative .
still , there 's always the possiblility of a " beau geste " , a beautiful gesture , even if it does n't inspire others to slack their fees .
and also , what the hell , i might be wrong .
-- david sugarman , April 10 , 1999
I think it 's noteworthy to mention that what 's being proposed here is not free education .
It is education being paid for by the companies that will benefit from that education a few years down the road .
I can see that students could be less motivated if it 's something they do n't have to pay for but the trick there is to admit students that want to learn and want to succeed and to get rid of the students that obviously have no interest in it .
I find , in my life , that the biggest obstruction to me pursuing my ideas is money .
If we can remove that obstruction and attract students with great ideas from all financial backgrounds we can put out better quality graduates which in turn gives the educational institution a better name and attracts more investors .

I beleive your ideas are excellent .
I am about to become an undergraduate at NJIT where I will be studying computer technology .
I 've been told by several people that I should look into MIT , that I could get loans and grants since I 've been in the military for four years .
I 've thought about it but came to the decision that I would much rather not get into the debt ( whether I qualify or not is a different story ) .
I also know a few other people that would love to attend MIT , and that are highly qualified to attend , but just can not afford it .
I 'm sure that society would benifit by affording the finacially average the ability to attend MIT .
I do n't know that the price / education ratio is worth it at present .
Much undergraduate learning is done on your own , or in groups of peers working on projects .
I wonder if $ 100,000 + for guided study is worth it ?
I 've taught myself web database programming in the past few years while I 've been in the military .
I 'm not an expert in the field , and I 'm sure I could learn a lot from an experienced programmer , but I do n't feel I would be willing to pay $ 100,000 + for this experience .
I wish you the best of luck in your cause , and would be willing to help in any way I can .
Thank You .

I just wondered how come tuition can cost $ 100,000 a year and yet there are no RDBMS servers .
Surely machines cost very little and ( some ) RDBMS cost nothing .
In Britain ( where I live ) some universities have started thinking about charging tuition .
At the moment all fees are paid by the govt from tax .
The charge they 're thinking of is about $ 1500 a year and half the country is outraged .
Some bright spark in the National Union of Students calculated the actual cost of some popular courses and got together a poster campaign with the strapline " is your degree worth # 20,000 to you ? "
Of course we were supposed to say ' hell no , down with tuition fees ' .
I thought ' if it 's not worth that to you should it be worth it to me as a taxpayer ? '
I have n't read to the end of the article yet so i do n't know if Phil has an idea for a sustainable fee - free MIT , but extremely wealthy lecturers handing back the fees is a great anarchic strike .
In Britain some lecturers do n't earn $ 20,000 a year .
But that 's in arts / humanities .

Excellent argument .
Allow me to relate my current situation ; I think it will serve as a useful corollary to the above .
I am an MIT freshman who is currently faced with a rather disturbing dilemma .
I have the opportunity of taking a research position at the Media Lab , which would provide me a fairly large degree of freedom as well as combining two areas of computer science which I have a great deal of interest in .
Competing with this offer is a position at a commercial software company , offering somewhat less desirable circumstances from an intellectual perspective .
Based simply on the merits of the work involved , I would most likely decide on the Media Lab .
The commercial software company , however , has offered me a full five times the maximum salary the Media Lab is allowed to pay me , not including overtime and other material benefits .
( The Media Lab is only allowed to pay undergrads for 40 hours / week of work .
As anyone in computer science knows , this is a ridiculously light workload for a developer ) .
Unfortunately , I have a bill for $ 16000 arriving this Fall , followed by another in the Spring .
...
I am certain I 'm not the only undergraduate faced with such a difficult decision .
In fact , I 'm certain I 'm not the only undergraduate who would choose the research position were they not faced with an enormous amount of debt .
MIT is built on people Just Like Me in that respect .
In fact , that 's at least part of the reason why they wanted us in the first place .
If research grants are indeed such a large portion of MIT 's income , then perhaps encouraging more undergrads to do research at MIT would be somewhat beneficial to The Institvte financially , to say nothing of its reputation as an intellectual institution .
Will I stay at MIT for the remainder of my undergrad career ?
Probably .
Will I be as beneficial to MIT as I could be were I not burdened with the prospect of a debt larger than the lifetime incomes of 75 % of the world 's population ?
Probably not .

Ok , I 've been writing a term - long paper about Tuition at MIT for 17.241 [ Introduction to the American Political Process ] .
I 've analyzed where the costs of tuition go , the fact that tuition alone could only pay 14 % of mit 's operating costs , trends in tuition increase , the Ivy Overlap cartel , the process by which tuition is decided at mit , and a host of other issues .
The administrators I 've talked to firmly believe ( or , have sufficiently deluded themselves ) that the process of Overlap -- the standardization of financial aid given to each student -- was in the correct interests of the students .
The fact that finaid is need - blind means that especially desirable students do n't get obscene amounts of cash ... cash that could better be used to help truly needy students .
Also , your discussion has n't mentioned the amount of financial aid that an average mit student gets ; only 10 % - 20 % pay the full cost of tuition out of pocket .
For the thesis of my final paper , I 'm arguing that , if mit were so inclined , they could offer tuition - free education to their undergraduate students .
And then I 'm arguing why this will never happen .
Other potentially disasterous side - effects include : decrease in student influence over the adminstration ( not that they have much of that to begin with ) , a drastic increase in the number of applicants , and the effect of " people that wo n't ever leave mit " ( which could be restricted by only making the first four years free ) .

How about : cut tuition in half .
Pass along tuition costs to the end - user which , in a sense , is not the student but the corporation that ultimately hires her upon graduation .
Ie. , make MIT a headhunter .
MIT and other top schools could collude in a positive way ( instead of on tuition and financial aid ) -- charging commissions to employers .
Students still can work for whomever they choose upon graduation , but they pay half tuition in exchange for agreeing to " register " their jobs , allowing MIT to charge its commission .
There would be a number of loopholes to close , but do - able , I think .
For example , any student caught violating the terms of the agreement would immediately be presented for a bill of the entire four - year cost of schooling .
Any company making an end -run on the process would be suspended from hiring MIT grads -- any future hires would be immediately subjected to the present - student - will - full - bill treatment .
Let 's say MIT charges a commission over the first 3 years -- 12 % , 10 % , 8 % .
So Joe works for Sun for 3 years out of college -- earns $ 200 K in toto .
MIT gets reimbursed $ 60,000 .
You get the drift .
Companies already pay huge headhunter fees .
Why not tap into that ?
They write off those expenses anyway .
And it scales financial aid not exclusively to how much your parents had , but to how much you make down the road .

Firstly let me state I 'm not here to get anyone to pity me .
I am currently living in Denmark , and have been here 6 months and am here becuase my father was offered a tenured position at a university here .
I have moved ( not traveled as most people think , I am a modern day nomad , I move to survive , do n't have time to enjoy the sights , just time to try and fit into the new system , which has never happened to this day , once an alien , always an alien ) from one country to another since a child ( 3 years in England , 6 years in Singapore , 1 year in the U.S.A , 6 months in Denmark list goes on . )
I am now " stuck " in Denmark , where it will take me at least 10 years to complete a undergrad Computer Science degree ( it 's very hard to explain , but simply put the Danish system is very open to non Danish / EU citizens ) .
The resources available here are also very limited ( and bloody expensive , income tax ranges from 45 - 60 % , all goods and services have a tax on them ranging from 25%- 250 % , computer goods for example cost 150% - 250 % more than what one would pay in U.S.A , I can't even afford to buy a cycle , let alone a new computer to replace my older system ) .
All this said , I plan to go to the U.S.A. and study , the resources are available there , there is a very large and healthy computer / geek community in which I would feel at home with .
There are many more reasons as to why I chose the U.S.A. , but there is one main problem in studying in the U.S.A , the costs .
I am considered an international student , which means I must pay a LOT more money than U.S. citizens .
I would love to go and study at M.I.T .
My father had a reseach position at M.I.T. and I got a chance to go around and get a feel for the environment and I would love to be part of it .
I have however not put M.I.T. on my the list of possible universities I might attend , one reason being that I wo n't pass their entrance requirements ( I am no straight A , Albert Einstein ) , and second I would never be able to afford the costs .
I have 2 universities in mind at current , both in MA , one being public , one being privte , I am going to with - hold their names .
I am more inclined on attending the private univeristy , as it seems to have better resources and a better computer science department .
My cost calculations for a 5 year undergrad Computer Science course are in total close to US $ 200,000 .
They do n't charge as much as say Harvard or M.I.T. would , but that is still a LOT of money .
The only way I will be able to attend this university is if I obtain a loan from a U.S. , WITH a U.S. citizen co-signer , how I will find a U.S. Citizec co-signer , I have no clue .
That is just one of the problems I am going to face , it will leave me in debt for the next 20 - 25 years of my life , I have many other things to worry about , getting past my father , who shows no interest in my future or future goals and will not help with anything , getting a student visa and proving I have the money to support myself for the 5 years in the U.S. and there are many more problems .
I am 20 years old , and I have big plans on what I want to do .
I have a GREAT deal of interest in computers and computer technology , I can't even begin to explain how important it all is to me , my life depends on it , it 's the only thing I 'm good at , and actually enjoy .
What I really want to say is that I very much admire what you ( Philip Greenspun ) are doing , I must admit it seems like and impossible task , but I wish you the best with it , and I would like to add , that if I ever have the facility to help you out , I will do so to whatever extent I can , that is if , I ever make it .
Truthfully , it does n't seem like I will , I will probably stuck in Denmark for the rest of my life delivering newspapers for 6 - 8 hours a day ( my current job , the only job I can get here , because I am non Danish / EU ) .
I would like to end this message by saying thank you to you Mr. Greenspun , even though your goal does not benefit me directly in any way , the general gist of your goal is to help people like me , and for that , I thank you .
SeVeN P.S.
Please pardon any grammar / spelling mistakes , it 's 5:30 AM in the morning , I am tired , and I do n't have time to check my message , as I have to leave for my paper rounds now .

It 's amazing that an institution like MIT and other Ivy League universities charge an individual 1/4 million dollars for an education .
While at the same time declare that they feel they are contributing because they ' offer ' affordable schooling .
For those who have never had to prostrate themselves in front of university administration ; let me tell you ; its demeaning .
They request information about you , your parents ( so they too can feel shamed ) , any other family members whom may be with - in a call or two .
They dont give the money ; they only drive home the fact that you cant afford their schooling .
After they have had their way with you then they decide what you can and can not afford .
This in itself is a higher education .
It teaches you , those who do not drive new cars or wear expensive jewelry , are only welcome if the administration allows it .
It sends out a clear and strong message :
You are welcome shown you can afford it .
I did all this for $ 1700.00 Canadian .
I dont think I could image what $ 250,000.00 US would feel like .
Keep up the good work .
You may not change the American education institute , but you could make a significant impact on the Canadian educational system .

Philip , I 've been thinking about your argument since I first saw the news of your gesture last year ( okay , I started thinking about it after I stopped cursing myself for not attending your lecture :) .
My concern with replacing tuition dollars with commercial or otherwise private dollars is that it may promote an even more intense level of careerism and less breadth and exploration among our undergraduates .
Interacting with undergraduates in various engineering programs at MIT , I 've already been dismayed at the generally increasing career focus of freshmen and sophomores .
Some may consider it increased market saavy , but I think it 's sad to find students who never explore or consider fields other than the one they come in believing holds the best monetary return .
There are still lots of neat people who come to MIT , but I think many have noticed the shift in the outlook of many within our incoming class .
Even worse could be the impact on electives in the humanities .
I 'd hate to see Playwrighting ( which , by the way , taught me more about understanding and working with people than any other class at MIT ) replaced with Business English and Communciations .
What chance does MIT really have of resisting commercial forces ?
MIT already tends to follow the current vogues of the commercial world in several areas , rather than setting the pace .
In graduate work , you can already see the not - so - subtle differences between grant - funded and commercial contract research .
I guess the earlier question should be whether private funders would try to change MIT curriculum or not .
I think it 's likely , it 's natural to want some control over your investment , even when investing in an engineer - factory like MIT .
Given the popularity of the field , would n't the first reasonable thing to do be to hire some management consultants to review the undergraduate curricula ?
What might the findings be and what might the companies ask MIT to do in return for their dollars ?
I 'm exaggerating and oversimplying to illustrate a point , but I think it 's an important consideration in making a place like MIT tuition - free .
I chose materials science after starting in computer science because I found it more difficult , frustrating , and anti-intuitive , hence interesting and challenging , for me at the time ( you ca n't pay for that kind of masochism ) ... I would never have done that with a capitalistic career bent , especially since CS / EE salaries look like medical doctor salaries to us poor groveling physical scientists .
Not that our curricula are perfect , but I think the pressure to turn out " the kind of engineers that industry wants " is already large and corrupting enough as it stands .
In any case , I 'd be interested in any further discussion of whether people believe the influences I describe would really occur and whether they could be thwarted in the tuition - free MIT nirvana that Philip proposes .

Peter Norvig recently wrote a great piece on How to Write a Spelling Corrector .
Since Norvig used Python , Shiro decided to write a version in Gauche Scheme .
In the following I 'll present a solution in PLT Scheme .
But first let 's look at string manipulations .
Scheme offers the usual operations on strings : string concatenation ( string - append ) , referencing a character in a string ( string - ref ) , extracting a substring ( substring ) and converting characters to strings ( string ) .
Compared to other languages code for string manipulations tend to become verbose , unless one " cheats " and uses some sort of utility such as format .
[ The advantage of this verboseness is that Scheme compilers can generate efficient code . ]
As an example consider this expression from Norvig 's spelling corrector :
Here word [ 0:i ] is the substring from index 0 ( inclusive ) to index i ( exclusive ) .
The c is a character , and word [ i :] is the substring from index i to the end .
The concatenation operator + converts automatically the character c to a string before the strings are concatenated .
A literal translation to Scheme reads as follows : Ouch !
A utility is clearly needed .
Below follows my shot at one such utility , namely , concat .
It allows us to write the expression as : A string followed by two numbers is a substring , so word 0 i is short for ( substring word 0 i ) .
An underscore is allowed instead of a number either to indicate the beginning or the end .
Thus word i _ is short for ( substring word i ( string - length word ) ) .
Finally a character is automatically converted to a string , so c is short for ( string c ) .
Not used in the example , but useful in general : A string followed by a single number , like word i , is short for ( string - ref word i ) .
The code for concat is found at the bottom of this post .
There are two parts of the spelling corrector .
The first part reads in correctly spelled words from a corpus , and counts the number of occurences of each word .
The second part uses the training data to check whether a given word is known , or if it is incorrectly spelled to find the intended word .
We can split a string in words with the help of regexp - split .
Taking advantage of the fact that PLT Scheme 's regular expression functions work both on strings as well as directly on input ports , we can call regexp - split directly on the port .
Now we 'll count how many times each word is seen .
We 'll use a hash table to hold words and counts .
Let 's read in the data from the small corpus , and at the same time define word - count that returns the count of a word , and known ?
that checks whether a word was seen in the training set .
When a word is incorrectly spelled , we want to suggest a " similar " word known to be correctly spelled .
Given a word w , the set of words with edit distance 1 consists of the words , we can generate from w by either deleting one character , or transposing to character , or altering one character , or inserting one character .
Deleting the character with index i from a word is easy with the help of concat :
If n is the length of w , then the set of strings generated by deleting a single character is given by :
Here ( : i n ) makes i run through the numbers 0 , 1 , ... n - 1 . For each i the string ( concat word 0 i word (+ i 1 ) _ ) is calculated , and all strings are collected in a set .
All words with edit distance 1 is given by : Given a word w , the set of words with edit distance 2 is the set generated by 2 deletions , transponations , alterations , or insertions .
Luckily we have done the hard work in edits1 .
There is just one catch .
The set is awfully large , so instead , we 'll concentrate on correctly spelled ( known ) words with a edit distance of two :
If we have more than one suggestion for an incorrectly spelled word , we want to find the most common of them - that is the one with the largest word count in the training set .
Python 's max has a nice feature , where given a list of xs , it finds the x that maximizes f( x ) , for a function f .
Here is a Scheme version :
To correct a word , we first check whether it is known .
We try to find a known word with edit distance 1 .
If unsuccessful we try to find one with edit distance 2 .
Let 's try it :
Were it not for the concat macro , the function edits1 would have been clumsy .
I am not sure concat is the answer .
Thanks to macros , one can at least experiment with language extensions in Scheme .
Remember to read Norvig 's piece , where he explains the math behind . [ Hmm .
Should I turn it into a math exercise for my class ? ] :

Angry protesters , riot police , mass demonstrations , arrests for disorderly conduct – it has n't exactly been smooth sailing for the Olympic - torch relay .
If people are looking for another reason to be pissed at China , how about this :
By the time this pyro parade is over , it will have produced about 11 million pounds of carbon emissions .
The torch is visiting 23 cities during a global sweep that includes stops in London , Paris , San Francisco , Bangkok , Islamabad and Almaty among others .
The Beijing Olympics Organizing Committee says the journey will cover more than 85,000 miles .
So when the torch is n't being marched through city streets and / or extinguished by protesters threatened by fire extinguisher -
armed protesters , how is it getting around ?
You guessed it , by plane – an Air China A330 custom painted with the Olympic logo and color scheme .
The A330 burns 5.4 gallons of fuel per mile .
That translates into 462,400 gallons for the entire trip .
With Earthlab estimating that every gallon of jet fuel burned produces 23.88 pounds of CO2 , the Olympic Torch Relay is adding about 11 million pounds of carbon to the atmosphere .
That 's 5,500 tons .
We did some digging around to put that number in perspective , and here 's what we came up with : A round trip flight between New York and Los Angeles produces 2.4 tons of C02 , driving 12,000 miles in a 2006 Ford Explorer , 7.83 tons .
The British Virgin Islands emit 84,000 tons of C02 per year , the European Union 3.1 billion , and the United States 6 billion .
A 250 - guest wedding , assuming that 125 attendees spend the night at a high - end hotel , will produce 9 tons of C02 .
London has a plan to ensure that the 2012 torch relay ends up carbon neutral , so we figured that Beijing must have one too , right ?
Sally Lu , the frazzled Olympic media relations rep that we reached in Beijing , says that if there is a plan to neutralize the torch - carrying jet 's carbon emissions , she has n't heard about it .
But she thinks there is one .
Probably .
Actually , she 's not really sure .

Are the pro-Obama forces seriously trying to get their troops outraged over this latest ad from Hillary Clinton ?
Just because it contains a ten - second sequence of presidential crises ( Depression , Pearl Harbor , gas crisis , Katrina , etc. ) and flashes a half - second clip of Osama bin Laden as part of it ?
Spare me .
Are Democratic political ads no longer even allowed to mention the fact that the next president is going to have to deal with the war on terror ?
However , there is something odd about this ad .
“ You need to be ready for anything , ” the narrator intones portentiously — before suddenly shifting to a chirpy voice : “ Especially now , with two wars , oil prices skyrocketing ” blah blah blah .
Am I just imaginging this ?
Or does the narrator really use that tonal change that you most often hear about halfway through trailers for romantic comedies , when the filmmakers want to make it clear that , no worries , everything actually turns out OK in the end ?
This is , of course , exactly the point they ’re trying to get across in this ad ( vote for Hillary and everything will be fine ) , but it still seemed a little jarring .
After a long , grueling primary season , Senator Hillary Clinton called for party unity and vowed to support Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee .
In an inspirational speech to supporters in Washington D.C. , Clinton called on her supporters to rally behind Obama :

The way to continue our fight now , to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy , our passion , our strength , and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next President of the United States .
[ applause ]
Today , as I suspend my campaign , I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run .
I endorse him and throw my full support behind him .
And I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me .
I have served in the Senate with him for four years , I have been in this campaign with him for sixteen months .
I have stood on the stage and gone toe - to - toe with him in twenty - two debates .
I ’ve had a front row seat to his candidacy and I have seen his strength and determination , his grace and his grit .
In his own life , Barack Obama has lived the American Dream .
As a community organizer and State Senate and as a United States Senator , he has dedicated himself to insuring the dream is realized and in this campaign , he has inspired so many to become involved in the democratic process , and invested in our common future .
Now when I started this race , I intended to win back the White House and make sure we have a President who puts our country back on the path to peace , prosperity and progress .
And that ’s exactly what we ’re going to do by insuring that Barack Obama walks through the doors of the Oval Office on January 20 , 2009 .
This was the speech that she needed to give .
Senator Clinton showed class , courageousness , determination and a unshakable commitment to the causes she and the Democratic party believe in -- yes , there were bumps in the road over the last 16 months , but she never gave up and we commend her for sticking to her guns .

US : Nearly 400 immigrant workers arrested in slaughterhouse raid
By Bill Van Auken
14 May 2008
In one of the largest ever government dragnets against immigrant workers , federal agents swooped down upon a meatpacking plant in northeastern Iowa Monday , rounding up nearly 400 workers .
Heavily armed squads of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents , backed by state and local police , stormed Agriprocessors Inc. in Postville , Iowa , the largest kosher slaughterhouse in the world , while two government helicopters hovered overhead .
In all , 16 local , state and federal agencies were involved in the raids , which had been prepared for months .
Most of those arrested were from either Mexico or Guatemala , while some others were immigrants from Israel and Ukraine .
The bulk of them were charged with Social Security fraud for using false numbers — a supposedly criminal offense that results in their forfeiting the contributions deducted from their paychecks — or with the civil offense of lacking proper immigration status .
After being interrogated and handcuffed at the plant , the workers were taken away in Homeland Security buses with covered windows .
Over 300 male employees were taken to a makeshift detention camp at the National Cattle Congress fairgrounds in nearby Waterloo , Iowa , where armed guards were posted at the gates .
Meanwhile , 76 women were crowded into the Hardin County Jail .
Violeta Aleman , a worker at the plant and a US citizen since 2003 , told the Cedar Rapids Gazette that the armed agents herded the workers into the cafeteria and ordered them to form two lines , “ one for US citizens and one for legal residents , ” while the undocumented immigrants were told to remain seated .
To be released , workers had to present proof of their legal status , forcing Aleman to call her husband to come to the slaughterhouse with her passport .
The Gazette reported : “ On her way out of the plant , she said , she walked past a group of detainees , many of whom she knew .
Some asked her to make a phone call for them , others asked her to take their belongings and cell phones home with her .
‘ They were looking at me , ’ she said , her voice breaking , ‘ There was nothing I could do . ’ ”
Because of the large number of detained immigrants involved , judges and court personnel are being brought in to conduct summary legal proceedings in the fairgrounds .
The local press reported that the first of these hearings took place Tuesday , with ten workers , shackled at the waist and ankles , herded single file into a ballroom to face a judge .
The raid was the biggest ever conducted in Iowa and may be the largest single - facility arrest ever carried out by US immigration authorities .
It was launched in the midst of a nationwide crackdown on immigrant workers that has created a reign of terror in many towns and cities across the country .
On Tuesday the plant reopened , despite having had fully one third of its work force hauled away in shackles .
It was unclear , however , whether the large numbers of ICE agents assembled in Iowa would strike again .
The search warrants released by federal officials provided for the arrest of 697 individuals .
Federal authorities announced that 56 of those detained Monday were subsequently granted supervised release , most of them to make arrangements for the care of their children , who in many cases are US citizens .
One of the most brutal effects of these raids is to divide families , some of which have resided in the US for many years .
ICE was clearly attempting to avoid the criticism that has been generated by similar workplace raids after children have been left abandoned in local schools or their homes when their parents were jailed .
Rumors flew through immigrant communities in the surrounding area that the immigration enforcers were preparing to raid other plants or even pull people from their homes .
ICE issued statements denying that it intends to conduct any “ random arrests , ” but made no comment on whether further workplace raids were planned .
Nonetheless , hundreds of immigrants turned up at local churches , including St. Bridget ’s Catholic Church , just five blocks from the Postville slaughterhouse , seeking aid and advice .
Many filled out legal forms granting power of attorney to assure that their children would be cared for in the event that they too are detained .
“ The people right now are hearing and seeing the helicopters , ” Sister Mary McCauley , a Roman Catholic nun at St. Bridget ’s , told the Associated Press .
“ They are just panic - stricken and very frightened and some of them are coming to the church as a safe haven . ”
Family members of the arrested slaughterhouse workers had come to the church in tears , she added .
At Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Waterloo , some 500 immigrants gathered on Monday night to seek advice from lawyers on what to do if arrested .
Local stores were empty as immigrants stayed away .
There were reports that many families were staying in their homes and keeping their children out of school for fear of being picked up .
Iowa ’s Democratic Governor Chet Culver issued a statement supporting the raid .
“ I believe it is important that we crack down on illegal immigration , ” he said .
“ Illegal means illegal . ”
While Culver minimized the role played by the state in the operation , Iowa state troopers were used to secure the plant , while their squad cars were used — one in front and one in back of each Homeland Security bus — to escort the immigrant workers to detention facilities .
Suspicion that the state may have played a larger role in helping prepare the raid was raised by a report from the local school district that it had received a state subpoena issued last month seeking the records of Postville middle and high school students , and in particular the names of children who had worked part - time at two local apartment buildings owned by the Agriprocessors CEO , Sholom Rubashkin .
Postville ’s Mayor Robert Penrod was less supportive of the ICE action , warning that if Agriprocessors — the largest employer in Iowa ’s Allamakee County — shut down , the city would turn into “ a ghost town . ”
“ There ’s people who hate the Hispanics , and there ’s people who do n’t like the Jews and would like to run them out of town , ” he said , but he added that the majority of the town ’s residents understood the plant ’s importance for the local economy .
Hundreds of people turned out Monday night at the gates of the Cattle Congress , where the bulk of the immigrant workers are detained .
“ We are with you , ” and “ We are all equal , ” they chanted .
Some waved signs reading “ Honk for human rights . ”
Barely half a dozen anti-immigrant protesters squared off with the large crowd , shouting , “ Send them back . ”
The crowd answered , “ We have a right to be here too . ”
One of those joining the protest was Beth Berger , 23 , of Waterloo .
She told the Cedar Rapids Gazette that her boyfriend , Carlos , had stayed away from work for fear of being arrested .
The two are expecting a baby in four months .
“ I probably ca n’t do much , but I am here to support them , ” she told the newspaper .
“ They act like they ’re animals .
They ’re not animals .
They ’re just like everybody else . ”
The United Food and Commercial Workers , which had been attempting to unionize workers at the plant , revealed Monday that it had advised US immigration authorities that there was an ongoing labor dispute at the plant and a pending investigation into workplace abuses that would be disrupted by any immigration raid .
The meatpacking plant was reportedly paying some of its employees sub-minimum wages and employing under - age workers off the books .
“ With these labor disputes in progress , we urge you to suspend any potentially existing enforcement efforts and refuse to be involved in this labor dispute in accordance with the internal guidance , ‘ Questioning Persons During Labor Disputes , ’ ” UFCW Vice President Mark Lauritsen wrote ICE on May 2 . US and Iowa Labor Department officials confirmed that there were ongoing investigations into exploitive practices at the slaughterhouse .
Clearly , the union ’s warning did nothing to dissuade ICE from conducting the raid , and may have even accelerated it .
Rubashkin , Agriprocessors ’ CEO , is a major contributor to the Republican Party .
Citing Federal Election Commission records , the DesMoines Register reported that Rubashkin has made $ 23,750 in federal campaign contributions to Republican candidates and committees since 2000 .
While ICE has dramatically increased its workplace raids since the agency was folded into the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003 , few employers have been charged with any offense for hiring undocumented workers .
In December 2006 , nearly 1,300 workers were rounded up at six Swift & Co. meatpacking plants , for example , but no Swift executive was ever prosecuted .
In fiscal 2007 , while 4,900 undocumented workers were arrested , just 92 company owners or corporate officials were charged .
The number of workers detained has increased 45 - fold since 2001 .
The number of employers prosecuted has fallen dramatically , however , from 182 in 1999 to less than half that number last year .
The net impact of the immigration crackdown is to terrorize a substantial section of the US workforce , creating more favorable conditions for their unfettered exploitation and thereby furthering the profit interests of the US ruling elite .
The detentions in Iowa follow a wave of raids across the country .
On May 2 , ICE agents descended on 11 “ El Balazo ” restaurants in California ’s Bay Area , arresting 63 undocumented workers .
The raids came just a day after thousands of immigrant advocates had marched in the city demanding an end to such punitive measures .
The previous week , ICE agents had turned up at elementary schools in Oakland , California , a provocative action that sparked heated protests .
In other raids over the past month , ICE detained :
* Over 100 workers at Pilgrim ’s Pride poultry plants in Texas , Arkansas , Florida , Tennessee and West Virginia .
* 24 construction workers employed at a project in the Little Rock , Arkansas airport .
* 28 landscaping workers in El Paso , Texas .
* 55 Mexican restaurant workers and the restaurants ’ owners in New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and West Virginia .
Meanwhile , 114 employees of a Los Angeles high - tech company filed a lawsuit against ICE on April 25 charging that they were illegally detained and harassed by immigration agents during a raid last February .
ICE raided the plant of Micro Solutions Enterprises , which produces remanufactured imaging supplies , arresting 138 employees , virtually all of whom were subsequently released and are presently fighting deportation orders .
Those suing ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are US citizens and legal residents , who charge that their constitutional rights were violated by being subjected to a “ group detention ” during the factory raid .
“ During the raid , Micro Solutions was sealed off and effectively locked down by armed ICE agents , ” said Peter Schey , the attorney representing the workers .
“ These armed government agents issued orders directing everyone in the building where to go , where to stand , and where to line up .
Those detained were not permitted to use their cell phones .
This mass detention of US citizens and lawful residents took place without a warrant or probable cause to believe every worker had violated the law and was therefore subject to temporary detention . ”
In carrying out its punitive policy against undocumented immigrants , the US government is introducing into the American workplace the type of measures that are generally associated with a police - military dictatorship .
Legal action has been dropped against a 15 - year - old who faced prosecution for branding Scientology a " cult " .
The teenager held up a sign which read , " Scientology is not a religion , it is a dangerous cult " , in May outside its headquarters in the City of London .
City of London Police said it had received complaints and warned the teenager to get rid of the sign as it breached the Public Order Act .
Human rights campaigners vowed to take action against the police .
Lawyers for the human rights group Liberty represented the teenager in his legal battle .
James
Welch from the organisation said : " The police may have ended their inquiries into this tawdry incident but rest assured that Liberty 's inquiry will continue .
" Democracy is all about clashing ideas and the police should protect peaceful protest , not stifle it . "
' No offence '
The teenager 's mother said the move was " a victory for free speech " .
She said : " We 're all incredibly proud of him .
" We advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said ' No , it 's my opinion and I have a right to express it ' . "
A Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) spokesman said : " In consultation with the City of London Police , we were asked whether the sign was abusive or insulting .
" Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness ( as opposed to criticism ) , neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression . "
A spokeswoman for the City of London Police said : " The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be ' threatening , abusive or insulting ' .
" The force 's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice . "
YANGON , Jun 14 , 2008 ( Xinhua via COMTEX News Network ) --
Myanmar will build cyclone shelters in 500 villages in the cyclone - affected regions to resist natural disasters in the future , local weekly journal reported Saturday .
The project , estimated to be cost about at least 15 million U.S. dollars , will be implemented by the cooperation of the Myanmar Engineers ' Society ( MES ) and the Geological Science Society ( GSS ) , the Voice quoted the GSS as saying .
The design is being drawn by MES and a sample cyclone shelter will be constructed at a village in Ayeyawaddy division , it said .
Meanwhile , with the assistance of experts from the Tokyo University of Japan and with the combination of technical knowhow applied in most cyclone - hit Bangladesh , Pakistan and India , and that of Myanmar 's local regions , a first - ever cyclone - resistant model village will be constructed in the country , according to the earlier report of the Yangon Times journal .
The 40 - house model village will comprise storm shelter , water distribution system using natural gravity , solar - energy power supply system and cyclone - resistant apartments , it said .
Deadly tropical cyclone Nargis , which occurred over the Bay of Bengal , hit five divisions and states -- Ayeyawaddy , Yangon , Bago , Mon and Kayin on last May 2 and 3 , of which Ayeyawaddy and Yangon inflicted the heaviest casualties and massive infrastructural damage .
Villages in some townships such as Ngaputaw , Laputta , Bogalay , Dedaye , Phyapon , Mawlamyinegyun and Haigyigyun in Ayeyawaddy delta and Kungyangon , Kawmu and Kyauktan in Yangon division were almost totally destroyed and some even erased .
The storm has killed 77,738 people and left 55,917 missing and 19,359 injured according to the official released death toll .

In a surprising move Britain ’s prime minister Gordon Brown has changed position in negotiating a cluster bomb ban .
The negotiators are now advised to accept a ban including the Helicopter ammunitions M73 and M85 .
The only open questions left seems to be about the timeline of scrapping the bombs .
Gordon Brown advised the abolition of the most dangerous cluster ammunition in Britain ’s arsenal immediately .
As pointed out yesterday , this opens questions about possible prosecution for British soldiers who fight along military still using the bombs , thus putting pressure on the US to stop using them in joint operations .
This is good news indeed !

Over the last few weeks my photo collection application has been struggling seriously with its performance .
The Tomcat server would sometimes crash , which is n't so serious , as my monitoring script would restart it at most 30 minutes later .
What 's worse is that often it would get stuck and also make Apache freeze , and this would kill the entire site ( including this blog ) , and the monitor script does n't detect that .
Or , load on the server would soar into the double digits , and just stay there , basically making the server unusable until I did a manual restart .
The robots
So , of course I started digging into the problem to see what might be causing this .
And pretty quickly I found that Yahoo's Slurp robot was hammering tmphoto with more requests than it was able to handle .
At the same time msnbot and Googlebot were also pretty active , though not as bad as Slurp .
My stats made it abundantly clear that most of the traffic in the application was from robots .
I checked the logs quickly now , and I find that out of 2.3 million requests , 93.8 % were from robots .
Of the total , 23 % were from Slurp .
However , Slurp tends to bunch its requests together , so at times of peak Slurp traffic a much higher proportion of the traffic would be Slurp .
I figured the easiest way to solve this would be to make the robots go a little easier on the site , and added " crawl - delay " statements for Slurp and msnbot to my robots .
txt file , telling the robots to wait 45 seconds between requests .
I could see both robots picking up the new robots .
txt , and while they might have slowed down a bit over the days that followed , they did n't really slow down much .
So I wrote to the Yahoo team complaining about their robot , and asking them to do something .
Contrary to expectation , they wrote back the same day , asking me to set the " crawl - delay " to slow down the robot .
Wonderful .
So no help there .
From what I read on the web other people are finding much the same .
A closer look at my access log also revealed gems like this one :
74.6.22.172 - - [ 22/Jun/2008:04:41:38 -0400 ]
" GET /tmphoto/photo.jsp?id=t61298 HTTP/1.0 " 200 4314 " -" " Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Yahoo !

Slurp ; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp) "
What you 're seeing here is four consecutive lines lifted straight out of the log .
Ignore the second line , as that 's not what we 're interested in .
The other three show Apache receiving three requests for the same page from the same IP within a span of four seconds .
I think what 's happening is that when Slurp does n't get a response quickly enough , it tries again .
This is not exactly sympathetic behaviour .
Imagine , for a moment , what might make it take a while to get a response from a server .
Well , it might be load on the server , right ?
So what happens when you ask again ?
Well , you increase the load further , do n't you ?
So basically , when my server first started struggling , Slurp would hammer it even more , thus making it even more overloaded .
Reasonable behaviour would be to make a note that this URL is not responding quickly right now , and put it back in the queue to be tried again later , rather than trying again right away .
This is much more efficient for the robot ( it 's likely to be slow on the next try as well , so the robot is likely to get through more pages if it changes to a different URL ) , and much friendlier to other people 's web sites .
URL design
Passing boat , Løvøysund , Norway
There was one thing about this application that had been worrying me for a long time , which was the way I 'd implemented filtering and context - tracking .
Initially , people had found it confusing that if , for example , you went to the list of beer photos and clicked on a photo , the next / previous buttons on the photo page would not necessarily take you to a beer photo .
Instead , they would just go to the next / previous photo chronologically , regardless of whether that was also a beer photo .
This was because I 'd done a naive implementation where every page was completely stateless , and so the next / previous buttons would not know where you came from , and would always behave the same .
To get around this , I made some pages pass in an extra request parameter saying where you 'd come from , if you came from a person , a place , or a category .
This way the previous / next buttons would move within the list you 'd come from .
Similarly , in lists like the list of beer photos you can use the filters on the right - hand side to select only beer photos from a specific place , event , or with a specific person in them , etc .
The ID of the filtering topic is also passed as a request parameter back to the same page , telling it which topic to filter by .
This all worked fine , but unfortunately it increased the number of URLs in my web application quite a lot .
Without this feature there is basically one URL per parameterless page ( such as the start page , lists of places / events / etc ) and one URL per topic ( that is , one per event , person , etc ) .
With 82 categories , 157 events , 324 places , 195 persons , and 8521 photos this comes to 9279 URLs plus the static pages .
Not so bad .
But the list stepping parameters and the filtering parameters changes this , because now there is one URL per combination .
Photos can be filtered by categories , events , places , and persons , so we get 8521 * ( 82 + 157 + 324 + 195 + 1 ) = 6,467,439 URLs there .
Lists of photos by categories , events , places , and persons can be filtered by the same topics , so we get roughly ( 82 + 157 + 324 + 195 ) 2 = 574,564 URLs there .
That gives us a rough estimate of 7 million URLs .
And while normal people will never try out more than a tiny fraction of those combinations there 's nothing to tell the robots not to do it , and so of course they 'll just keep crawling and crawling the site endlessly .
So I sat down to do a quick rewrite and within an hour or two I had changed the code to store the filters in the user 's server - side session and not pass them as request parameters .
This also had the nice side - effect of simplifying the code quite a lot , as I no longer had to remember to keep propagating these request parameters in every link .
( There were actually a few bugs here , which are now gone . )
The downside is that most likely people will find the filters on in places where they do n't expect it ( because of caching , or because they do n't pass through a page which removes the filters from their session ) , but as few people use this anyway , and it 's just one click to turn them off , that should n't be much of an issue .
Of course , I also had to add code to handle the old URLs , which I did by adding Java code at the very top of the pages to check for filtering request parameters .
If any are found , the code updates the session , then sends a permanent forward to the URL without filtering .
Thus , old URLs will continue to work , and the search engines are told not to keep these URLs in their indexes , but instead to replace them with the filterless URL .
The redirect code is the first that executes on the page , so for these requests the server hardly does any work , and barely produces any output at all , thus dramatically reducing the server load from these requests .

So , I deployed , and waited to see the results .
After some hours it became clear that while the site would no longer go into a death - spiral immediately after being started , it was still struggling , and would still wind up barely crawling along once every two hours or so , and then never come back to health without a restart .
This was disappointing , to put it mildly .
It was at this point I started doing what I should have done immediately : do some more precise analysis to see what the impact of the filtering URLs actually was .
Some quick log analysis revealed that , actually , pages with filtering URLs was only about 55 % of the traffic .
So I 'd reduced the load by about half , but no more , and apparently this was not enough .
From this I learned two things :
Consider the design of your URLs with search engines in mind , and avoid designs that cause an explosion of possible web - visible URLs .
Do n't make optimizations without estimating the effect of your optimization first !
You often find that the optimization has much less effect than you thought , making it a waste of effort ( and , often , a needless source of bugs ) .
In this case , the optimization had other benefits , so I wo n't be going back to the old design , but my site was still near - unusable .
So then what ?
Well , this blog entry is now more than long enough as it is , and the solution I eventually found takes us into very different territory , so I 'll save that story for the next entry .

On February 16 , 1992 , Applicant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas .
He showed that he had important and compelling evidence of his innocence and argued that because of his innocence it would violate the United States Constitution to execute him .
... Collins v. Herrera , 754 F.2d 1029 ( 5th Cir. 1992 ) .
The Fifth Circuit held that , based upon Supreme Court precedent , innocence did not provide a basis for federal habeas corpus relief .
In 1993 , the court ruled in Herrera vs. Collins , 506 U.S. 390 ( 1993 ) that a prisoner cannot simply argue in federal court that new evidence points to his innocence .
He first must prove that his trial contained procedural errors ( the technicalities that may free the guilty but also protect the innocent ) .
In this case , Leonel Herrera had been convicted of shooting two police officers .
Ten years later , he submitted affidavits from witnesses who said that his now - dead brother had been the killer ( one witness was his brother 's son , who says he saw the murders ) .
Without considering the statements , the court told Herrera to sit down and shut up .
" Federal habeas courts do not sit to correct errors of fact but to ensure the individuals are not imprisoned in violation of the Constitution , " it said .
In other words , being falsely imprisoned is not a violation of your rights .
Herrera was executed four months after the ruling .
Last Words from Death Row documents court events and press coverage , and calls into question the landmark decisions that sent her brother to his death .
In the book , Ms. Herrera recounts the tribulations she and her family suffered as they worked to free Leonel Herrera from his fate .
In his last words , Leonel Herrera said : " I am innocent , innocent , innocent .
I am an innocent man , and something very wrong is taking place tonight . "
If all the court proceedings , including the Supreme Court 's decision prior to Leo 's execution represent the visible tip of the death penalty iceberg , Last Words from Death Row exposes the enormous human tragedy that resides below the surface .
Her questions drive a powerful wedge between the legal process in capital cases and the truth .
Why do the guilty go unpunished ?
When is innocence not enough to free a convicted man ?
Does Truth not prevail in the American Justice system ?
Who pays ?
Who is next ?
Last Words from Death Row will be available through Nightengale Press ( http://www.nightengalepress.com), through online retailers and better bookstores in April .

ONE OF America 's foremost foreign affairs reporters , Seymour Hersh , has claimed America is running a covert operation into Iran , funded by $ US400 million ( $ A414 million ) siphoned from other programs , with authorisation from Democratic congressional leaders .
According to Hersh , a journalist with the New Yorker magazine , Congress agreed to a request from President George Bush late last year to pay for a significant escalation of covert operations against Iran .
He said these included activities by the the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Special Operations Command , and involve support of the minority Ahwazi Arab and Baluchi groups and other dissident organisations .
They also included gathering intelligence about Iran 's suspected nuclear - weapons program .
Hersh said covert operations were not new but had been stepped up dramatically in recent months , causing disquiet in Congress .
The Guardian is reporting a five - fold increase in the number of low fuel warnings made by pilots of Continental Airlines ' flights arriving from Europe into Newark .
According to the paper , the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) has released a report saying that Continental pilots made 96 " minimum fuel declarations " last year .
A statement by New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez , one of senators who received the report , says that in some cases flights approached Newark so close to empty that they received priority landing clearance , effectively allowing them to jump the line to avoid running out of fuel .
To make sense of the DOT report , which can be found in its entirety found here ( . pdf ) , you need to understand the difference between a minimum fuel declaration and an emergency fuel declaration .
In the latter , a pilot is so worried about his fuel level that he requests a priority landing slot .
A minimum fuel declaration , on the other hand , means that there is n't a problem yet , but one could develop if the flight experiences any unforeseen delays .
The FAA requires that an aircraft have enough fuel to travel 45 minutes beyond its scheduled arrival airport .
Of 20 Continental flights randomly sampled , the FAA found all of them in compliance with this rule – on average they had 64 minutes of fuel remaining .
The DOT report offers several possible reasons for the increase in fuel declaration incidents .
One is Continental Airlines ' desire to save fuel .
Several employee bulletins dug up by the FAA show that Continental management was concerned by the number of fuel stops pilots were making on international flights into Newark , at one point going so far as to connect the costs of unnecessary refueling with profit sharing and pension funding .
The FAA also questions the practice of flying Boeing 757s on longer overseas routes .
Traditionally the 757 is used on domestic medium - haul routes , but in recent years has been pushed into international service .
The 757 has been a cornerstone of Continental 's international expansion – the airline uses the planes to funnel traffic from medium sized
European cities like Belfast , Cologne , and Hamburg into its big hub at
Newark .
But on some of these European routes , the 757 , with a range of 3,900 nautical miles , cuts it a little close .
Barcelona is 3,398 nautical miles from Newark .
Throw weather and holding patterns into the mix , and you 're not leaving much room for error .
Perhaps not coincidentally , Barcelona - Newark is one of the routes where the FAA found that pilots most often made fuel declarations .
Continental insists that it does n't cut corners when it comes to aircraft safety .
The airline says its planes are always loaded up with ample fuel prior to takeoff and that pilots are free to make refueling stops whenever necessary .
The report is troubling , perhaps even more so for those who remember Avianca flight 52 , which crashed while landing at Kennedy Airport in 1990 after running out of fuel .

The thing I have been noticing is that people with AccuRev perceive " branches " differently , more as a natural feature of a source tree .
I sincerely believe that is a result of the visualization provided by the stream and versions browsers .
They arm people with a clear cognitive model , whereas the old folder and file approach can only effectively visualize branches as folders , just like everything else .
The result is that AccuRev users can both depict and describe a complex branching structure much more easily , and users of traditional systems generate crazy graphs which do more to obscure the branches than illuminate them .
I was having a discussion about AccuRev and branching today at the office .
We are still transitioning some projects over to it , so there is some development using SourceSafe and some using AccuRev .
The effort required to maintain even a minimal isolation with two branches is hugely largely than the same task in AccuRev .
In the midst of this discussion a thread about complex branch management and traditional SCM systems was brought to my attention .
Just look at the images on the Microsoft Branching and Merging Primer .
The graphs themselves become steadily more difficult to understand as you move from simple branches down to code- promotion and component branching .
Meanwhile , a project I am managing right now , in AccuRev , is actively using both code- promotion and component ( sub - project branching ) .
We have the classic Product_Rel -> Product_QA->
Product_Int streams which allow us to ensure development is stable before moving issues to QA .
The QA department can verify the changes function before moving them to Rel .
The release build is then an aggregation of all of the features which really work together .
Additionally , we have three streams below Product_Int for sub-projects .
First , is a stream for merges from a product developmed in VSS .
We promote changes from it in cohesive groups , but only as time permits .
If this stream gets out of sync with its parent , we take note of overlaps and resolve them in the merge source stream without destabilizing the Product_Int stream .
This permitted us to merge little bits at a time over a period of four weeks .
We also have a stream devoted to refactoring a specific subsystem .
It too is able to take advantage of overlap notification to stay in sync with its parent .
Finally , we have a time - locked stream which we use to service an internally released tool .
This structure , though technically more complex than those depicted above , is far simpler for us to maintain and use ; even for people who do not eat , sleep and breathe SCM .
Why ?
After some thought this is what I wrote to the person who pointed out the primer :

In theory an Internet based software business is n’t tied to any particular geographical location and can be run from a laptop anywhere there is an Internet connection .
So why not travel the world , financed by your business ?
Trygve & Karen Inda are doing just that .
They kindly agreed to write this guest post discussing the practicalities of running a nomadic software company .
The freedom to wander aimlessly around the planet , visiting whichever countries you want , is something many people dream about .
We have actually achieved it through our microISV .
For the past six years , we have been living and working in numerous countries , with nothing more than our Mac laptops , backpacks , assorted cables and adaptors and an insatiable thirst for adventure .
We were thirty years old , with no kids and no debt , working steady jobs in Reno , Nevada , and had a small microISV on the side .
It was a “ nights and weekends ” business that earned us dining out money , or even covered the rent in a good month .
After September 11th , my husband Trygve ’s day - job slowly went away , giving him more time to devote to our microISV .
By March 2002 , when we first released EarthDesk , the microISV had become his full - time job .
The response to EarthDesk was phenomenal and we soon realized that we could move overseas , bringing our microISV with us .
Within several months , we had sold the bulk of our possessions , moved out of our apartment in Reno and purchased one - way tickets to Tbilisi , Republic of Georgia .
The experiment begins
For six months , we tried to manage our software business while teaching English and doing odd jobs for NGOs , newspapers and radio stations .
We had brought with us two Mac laptops ( a PowerBook G4 and an iBook G3 ) , which were both maxed out as far as hard drive and memory were concerned , an extra battery for the G4 , an external keyboard , a digital camera , and various cables and worldwide plug adaptors .
We had also brought a CD case full of original software discs .
Tbilisi home office
In the end , the multiple infrastructure problems that plague the Republic of Georgia ( mostly a serious lack of electricity ) proved too much for us to bear .
We escaped to Germany , carrying 170 pounds of stuff , including our two laptops , a UPS we had purchased in Tbilisi and a Persian carpet we had bargained for while on Christmas holiday in Dubai .
After a few weeks recovering in Germany , we spent a few months in Prague , Czech Republic .
When the cold weather arrived , we flew south and spent eight months travelling around the Indian Ocean , South East Asia and Oceania .
Shortly thereafter , we landed a software development contract in Dubai and relocated there , but regularly escape to Prague during the blistering summer months .
We currently own a flat in central Prague and have considered buying a flat in Dubai .
Kampala , Uganda
By keeping a small base in one or two countries , we can have a “ home ” , a decent place to work and a life , while still taking long trips with the backpacks .
Running the business from an apartment in the developed world is fairly straightforward .
What ’s challenging is running the business from a backpack while spending several months on the road .
The essentials
Everyone wants to sit on a beach and work only four hours a day , but the reality is a little different .
If you are actually running your business , you ’ll spend as much time working on the beach as you would in a cubicle .
It ’s certainly possible to work only an hour a day for a few weeks , but to develop and grow your business , you will need to spend time actually working , rather than sightseeing .
It ’s not a permanent holiday , but rather an opportunity for frequent changes of scenery .
As a practical matter , you can only travel with what you can carry and a good backpack with detachable day - pack is the only serious option .
Since you are carrying a few thousand dollars worth of equipment , security becomes an issue , especially in poorly developed parts of the world .
We generally stay in the least expensive hotels we can find that have adequate security and cleanliness , while occasionally splurging on something nicer to maintain our sanity .
It is very important to budget properly for long trips .
For some people this may be as much as $ 200 / day , and for others it may be only $ 50 / day , but managing expenditures is even more important when on the road .
Of course you ’ll soon realize that for the same money spent during 4 days in London , you could spend weeks in South East Asia or poorer parts of the Middle East .
On journeys of a month or more , we generally bring two up - to - date Mac laptops ( currently 15 ″ and 17 ″ MacBook Pros ) , worldwide plug adaptors , software CDs , two iPods ( one for backing up data ) , a digital camera and two unlocked 4 - band GSM mobile phones .
For longer - term backup we burn a data DVD about once per month and post it home .
Essential software includes Excel , Entourage , Filemaker Pro , Skype , iChat and , of course , the Apple Xcode Developer Tools .
Speed Download saved us in Tbilisi because of its ability to resume downloads after our dial - up internet connection dropped the line , which it did every four minutes !
Surprisingly , the best Internet we have found in the developing world was in Phnom Penh .
WiFi can often be found at big hotels , but it is more common to connect via Ethernet in a cafe , where a basic knowledge of Windows networking will allow you to configure your laptop to match the existing settings of the cafe ’s PC .
In the least developed countries , modems are still the norm .
Kigali , Rwanda
One important consideration , especially in countries where censorship is common , is that many places require you to use their SMTP server for outgoing mail .
This may not work with your domain as a return address .
To get around this , it ’s useful to have a VPN , such as witopia.net , and an SMTP server at your domain .
Visas , taxes and other nasty stuff
If you have a western passport , visas usually only become an issue when you want to stay somewhere more than three months .
Often , it is possible to do a “ visa run , ” in which you briefly leave the country and immediately return for another three months .
Many countries make it easy to set up a local company , which can allow you to obtain longer - term residency visas , but there is a lot of paperwork involved with this .
Staying more than six months as a “ tourist ” anywhere can be a problem as you ’ll almost certainly have to deal with immigration issues .
Hong Kong
Although Dubai has straightforward immigration procedures and is a fabulous place to spend winters , the UAE Government blocks more websites than just about any other country on Earth .
Even Skype is blocked because the local telecommunications company does n’t want any competition .
Unless you are able to find a way around the blocks ( wink , wink ) , running any kind of internet business from Dubai will be fraught with difficulty .
Even if you are living in a tax haven , if you are a US Citizen , you can never fully avoid US taxes , although you can take advantage of the Foreign Exclusion .
Local taxes are n’t really an issue if you ’re just a “ tourist ” spending a few weeks in a country , but they can become an issue for long - term stays .
If you are planning to stay somewhere for more than a couple months , and “ settle ” , you ’ll need to research tax ramifications .
Sana , Yemen
Since we left the US , our taxes have become much more complicated .
Fortunately , we found an American tax attorney to handle our annual filings .
He lives abroad and therefore understands the Foreign Exclusion and other tax laws regarding expats .
For our microISV , payment is handled online by two providers ( always have a backup ! ) , and ends up in a company account in America .
We use a payroll service to pay our salaries into personal accounts , which we can access by ATM .
We also have established a managed office in Nevada to act as our company headquarters and handle mail , voicemail and legal services .
We have no regrets about having left the US for our big adventure .
We have truly lived our dream of being able to travel indefinitely , but sometimes it is wearying not knowing which country we will be living in just a few months into the future .
Our ultimate goal is to own two properties on two continents so that we can travel between them with just a laptop .

Not all body fat is bad .
Your body may store “ good ” fat and “ bad ” fat , similar to good and bad cholesterol .
The finding could explain why liposuction has few health benefits .
Researchers know that not all body fat is equal .
The worst kind is excess fat on the internal organs , which causes a pot belly and is known as visceral fat .
People with this are more likely to suffer from heart disease and insulin resistance , which leads to type 2 diabetes , than those who put on fat under their skin on their hips and thighs .
But it was assumed that …
Reddit has decided to open source their entire code base , allowing developers to see how exactly the social news site works .
With the move , Reddit is encouraging developers to submit their own code and extensions for improving the site .
Of course , they are also potentially opening up the site to serious gaming , since developers will be able to dissect precisely how Reddit 's algorithms determine what is popular and makes it to the homepage .
Steve Huffman , co-founder of Reddit , thinks this transparency is something users deserve , and is a strong competitive move against leading social news site Digg .
" Digg has struggled to stay transparent with their users , " he said .
" Social news in general has hid behind algorithms , which has caused some consternation amongst users .
Users do n't get why things are n't showing up on the front page . "
Of course , he is referring to the fact that Digg 's algorithms are completely secretive , often creating frustration amongst users when stories with a lot of Diggs and comments are left off of the homepage , but seemingly less important stories find their way to the front .
Much like Facebook 's fbOpen , the idea of going open source is n't so much as to encourage developers to build their own Reddit clones .
In fact , Reddit is using the same licensing structure as Facebook - CPAL ( Common Public Attribution License ) – which stipulates that anyone who uses the Reddit code needs to make their changes available to everyone , as well as acknowledge they are using it .
Reddit 's new site for developers – code.reddit.com – should be live at 6 am PT .
At that point , the race is on to see who can figure out the algorithm first , and it will be interesting to watch and see how heavily people try to game the site once it becomes public knowledge .
It should be noted that when the company launched its new re-design a couple weeks ago , within minutes the most popular story on the site was one about how badly it sucked , urging Reddit to bring back the old version .
We ’ve been talking about Web 2.0 for so long now it ’s already passé to argue about what it means and what it does n’t .
But one thing ’s for sure , there ’s a lot of data out there on the web these days .
And as web designers , we ’re designing a lot of data - driven sites .
Article Continues Below
There are plenty of options out there for data visualization , too .
Google ’s recently - announced Charts API is a great example , but there are a number of tools and services for creating charts and graphs as images and for making interactive visualizations with Flash .
There are also great standards - based techniques , such as Eric Meyer ’s CSS bar graphs which transform good clean semantic table markup into charts .
All of these options are extremely useful when your data is front and center , when all you ’re after is a chart .
But what if we want to include data visualization as an integral part of the site , not just an isolated figure or an interactive chart ?
When we ’re designing interfaces for browsing data - driven sites , it ’s valuable to be able to create navigation elements that are also visualization tools .
We can keep the user informed as they explore , so they can make better decisions about what they ’re looking at and what they ’re clicking on .
We could build that type of navigation with Flash , or generate static images every time the data changes , but that can be a big tradeoff in terms of accessibility and maintainability .
Even with standards - based markup , there are tradeoffs .
If we just want to display the data , we can get the most semantic richness and accessibility hooks with a table .
But when what we ’re really building is navigation , tables are an awkward and often clumsy tool for the job .
What we need is something in between — markup that ’s appropriate for navigation , but with some extra hooks for semantics and structure .
I ’m going to cover three basic techniques for incorporating some simple data visualization into standards - based navigation patterns .
All of them start with the building block of HTML navigation : an unordered list of links .
We ’re going to tweak the markup a bit and add in some data points and a few hooks for styling , but in each case , the basic pattern is the same familiar one .
Since we do n’t have the pure data semantics of a table to rely on , we ’ll use semantic class names in the tradition of microformats to preserve as much of the data ’s structure in our markup as possible .
And since we ’re using HTML and CSS , we can use em - based measurements throughout to make sure the charts adapt as the user scales the text size .
Horizontal bar charts #section2
This simple technique just adds bars to a list of items behind the text ( check out the finished example for an idea of what we ’re shooting for ) .
It works for lists of any length .
Longer lists benefit from being sorted by count since the relative values of the bars are easier to read when they are sequential .
In this example , we ’re going to display the count for each item in the list , but you can leave that out if the value is less important on its own and you ’re just showing the relative values for comparison .
Let ’s start with a basic unordered list of links .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< ul class=" chartlist " > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/apples/ "
>Apples</a> </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/bananas/ " > » Bananas </ a> </li > < li > < a href = " http://www.example.com/fruits/cherries/ " >
» Cherries </a> </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/dates/ "
>Dates</a> </li > </ul >
The first thing to do is add the values for each item in the list .
I ’ll wrap them in their own span outside the links so we can style them separately .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< ul class=" chartlist " > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/apples/ "
>Apples</a> < span class= " count " >420</span > </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/bananas/ " > » Bananas </a> < span class= " count " >280</span > </li > < li > < a href = " http://www.example.com/fruits/cherries/ " >
» Cherries </a> < span class= " count " >200</ span > </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/dates/ "
>
Dates</a> < span class= " count " >100</ span > </li > </ul >
In order to create the bars , we need to style the list items as block elements so they take up the full width , and set them to use relative positioning so we can position the bars relative to each item .
Since the main purpose of this list is navigation , I ’ll set display : block on the link elements so the click target fills up the full width of the list as well .
. chartlist li { position : relative ; display : block ; }
I ’ll also add in some styles to offset the counts to the right of the list for easy scanning .
I ’ll use absolute positioning instead of a float so the links and the chart bars can all overlap in the full width of the chart without running into each other .
. chartlist .count { display : block ; position : absolute ; top : 0 ; right : 0 ; margin : 0 0.3em ; text - align : right ; color : # 999 ; font - weight : bold ; font - size : 0.875em ; }
Since we used absolute positioning for the counts , I ’ll add some padding to the links to make sure there is room for the numbers to fit next to the link text without overlapping .
I ’ll also need to add a couple of styles to the links to make sure they always appear above the bars we ’re going to position below them .
I ’ll set their position to relative so they will accept a z - index value , and then set their z - index to something above zero so they ’ll stay at the top of the chart .
. chartlist li a { display : block ; padding : 0.4em 4.5 em 0.4em 0.5 em ; position : relative ; z-index : 2 ; }
Before I style the bars , I need to add an element to the markup for each item to store the information that the bars will convey .
In this case we want to show the relative value of each item in the list compared to the total count for the whole list .
So the information we ’ll be communicating with the bars will be a percentage calculated from those two values .
I ’ll add an element to the markup and give it an appropriate class so we can pick it up in the styles .
I ’ll use a class of index to represent the ratios represented by the chart bars .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< ul class=" chartlist " > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/apples/ "
>Apples</a> < span class= " count " >420</span > < span class= " index " >( 42 % ) </ span > </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/bananas/ " > » Bananas </a> < span class= " count " >280</span > < span class= " index " >( 28 % ) </ span > </li > < li > < a href = " http://www.example.com/fruits/cherries/ " >
» Cherries </a> < span class= " count " >200</ span > < span class = " index " >( 20 % ) </ span > </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/fruits/dates/ "
>
Dates</a> < span class= " count " >100</ span > < span class = " index " >
( 10 % ) </ span > </li > </ul >
A note about the data#section3
In this example chart , we ’re showing each item as a percentage of the whole ( like a pie chart ) , but you can use the same technique to show percentages relative to the highest value in the list — so there is always at least one 100 % bar and everything else is a percentage of that maximum value .
You can also calculate the percentages relative to a baseline value that you set at a fixed percentage ( say , 50 % ) , and all the other percentages will be higher or lower based on their deviation from the baseline ; performance data for new computer chips and similar products is often displayed in this way .
The math to accomplish this is outside the scope of this article , but the point is that you can use the same markup and style techniques to chart different types of data .
Just be sure to use clear titles and descriptions for your charts so the values themselves make sense in context .
In these examples , I ’m using made - up data , but there are a variety of ways to calculate the percentages on a real site .
You can calculate them on the backend and display them in a template ( I ’m a big fan of the Django framework ’s widthratio template tag , which makes calculating ratios between two variables very easy ) .
You can also use JavaScript to extract the percentage value from the markup and apply it as a width style to the bars .
For the purposes of these examples , I ’m assuming that all the necessary math is already done , so I ’ll use hand - coded inline styles to represent the widths of the bars as percentages .

Finishing up the bar chart#section4
The final step for this chart is to add the styling for the bars .
I ’m going to hide the actual percentage ( using the text - indent trick from Mike Rundle ’s trusty image replacement technique ) since the precise value is n’t as important as the relative scale and the bar will do nicely on its own .
If you need to show the percentage , you can choose to display the percentage within the bar or use separate elements for the bar and the percentage .
I ’ll set the height of the bars to 100 % , and since we ’ll be setting the actual width later , I ’ll set a default width of 0 so the bars wo n’t show up at all if we do n’t give them an explicit value .
I ’ve chosen a light blue for the bar backgrounds , so the link text will be readable when it overlaps the bar , but the bars will still be easily visible .
. chartlist .index { display : block ; position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; height : 100 % ; background : # B8E4F5 ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; overflow : hidden ; }
I ’ll add in some hover styles for the chart rows and some borders and padding for readability , and we ’ve got ourselve a chart ( see the finished example ) .
One thing to note is how it looks with styles turned off .
Because we made sure to put the percentages in the markup , the information we ’re conveying with a fancy chart is still accessible when that presentation degrades .
Timeline charts#section5
Once you ’ve established the basic recipe of good old semantic navigation with a sprinkling of data and some CSS to turn the data into a chart , there are lots of variations you can apply to different types of data .
One easy trick is to turn the chart on its side to make a timeline ( see the second chart in the finished example ) .
I ’ll start out with markup that ’s very similar to the first chart .
In this case , it ’s a list of days , with a value for each day .
Since I have limited space in the horizontal format to show labels for each bar , I ’m just going to show the day of the month in the label and use a header above the list to indicate the month .
Since this is meant to be navigation , and the chart will convey the relative values ( which is what we ’re after ) , it ’s okay that we ’re not showing all the information here .
As an extra convenience , I ’ll add a title to the links with the full date and the count for that day , so that detail will show up in a tooltip for each bar .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< ul class = " timeline " > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/2007/dec/1/ " » title= " December 1 , 2007 : 40 " > < span class = " label " >1</ span > < span class= " count " >( 40 ) </ span > </ a> </li > < li > < a href= " http://www.example.com/2007/dec/2/ " » title= " December 2 , 2007 : 100 " > < span class = " label " >2</ span > < span class= " count " >( 100 ) </ span > </ a> </li > </ul >
Repeat as necessary .
In this example , I ’ve created a 30 - day chart with a bar for each day , but you could make the chart any length and size you need .
If you ’re making a chart with fewer bars , you can make them larger and make room for longer labels underneath .
In order to make sure the labels fit in the space underneath the bars , I ’m going to size the entire chart using ems so it will flex up and down with the text size .
To make things simpler , I ’ll go ahead and set the text size I want to use for the labels on the main . timeline element , so I can size everything relative to that .
I ’ll set the height of the whole chart to 10 ems , which leaves 8 ems for the bars and 2 ems for the labels with a little padding .
. timeline { font - size : 0.75em ; height : 10em ; } .timeline li { height : 8em ; }
As before , I ’ll set the list items to use relative positioning , since I ’ll be using absolute positioning to pin the bars to the bottom of each one .
( If I did n’t use absolute positioning relative to each list item , the bars would just dangle from the top , which is n’t quite the look we ’re going for . )
I ’ll float the list items to the left so the bars will line up next to each other horizontally .
I ’ll set the width of each bar to 1.5 em and the height to 8 em to give us enough room for the two - digit labels below , and put just a little padding on either side to separate the bars from each other .
I ’m using ems for all these dimensions so the bars and the labels will scale up together when the text size changes .
. timeline li { height : 8 em ; position : relative ; float : left ; width : 1.5 em ; margin : 0 0.1em ; }
Since I want the entire area of the bar and label to be clickable , I ’ll set the links to display : block and height : 100 % so they fill the available space we ’ve created for the list items .
. timeline li a { display : block ; height : 100 % ; }
I want the labels to display below the bars , but since I want both the bars and the labels to be clickable , I ’ve placed them both inside the a tag .
In order to move the labels out of the way , I ’ll use absolute positioning with a negative bottom value .
Since the bars have a height of 8 em and the chart is 10 em I ’ll move the labels down from the bottom of the bars by - 2 em .
I ’ll give them a line - height of 2 em as well , so no matter what the text size , they ’ll have plenty of room right in the middle of that vertical space .
We ’ll pin them to the left side of the bars and set them to take up the full width with the text aligned in the center .
. timeline li .label { display : block ; position : absolute ; bottom : - 2 em ; line - height : 2em ; left : 0 ; width : 100 % ; text - align : center ; }
Since we ’re not going to be displaying the counts in this chart , I ’ll just use the count element to display the bar , using the same combination of text - indent and overflow to hide the text .
I ’ll give the bars a solid background and position them from the bottom left of the list item .
Reversing what we did for the horizontal bar chart , I ’ll set the width of the bars to 100 % and the height to zero .
. timeline li a .count { display : block ; position : absolute ; bottom : 0 ; left : 0 ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; overflow : hidden ; width : 100 % ; height : 0 ; background : # AAA ; }
For this chart , I do n’t want the each bar to represent a percentage of the total for the whole chart , since there are so many items and the bars would all be tiny .
Instead , I want the day with the highest count to be the tallest bar , so I ’ll set the height on that to 100 % and calculate the heights of all the percentages of that highest day ’s count .
You can see results ( with fake data but real math ) in the finished example .
I ’ve also added a hover style to highlight the bar , label , and background area so it ’s clear which item is about to be clicked on .
Now that we ’ve tipped our chart on its side to make a timeline , we can shrink it down to make a sparkline — a handy way to show a snippet of data inline with text ( see the finished example ) .
You can see from the example that we ’ll basically just be shrinking the timeline chart .
With bars instead of lines , it wo n’t be a true sparkline , but it fits the spirit of packing a lot of information in a simple , word - sized chart .
The starting markup is a little different this time .
Since we ’re creating multiple charts , we ’ll still start with an unordered list , but each list item will contain a full chart .
Since sparklines are meant as an unobtrusive way to display information inline with text , we can try to reflect that even in the unstyled markup by using inline elements for each of the data points .
What we ’re shooting for is something that reads reasonably clearly even without the CSS applied .
Take a look at this example with the styles removed to get a better idea .
I ’ll start with a span as the container for the chart , and use another span with a class of index as the container for each bar .
Each number in the series is wrapped in its own span with the count class .
This is what we ’ll use to style the bar .
Since I ’ll be hiding all the text within the inner span.
count tag anyway , I ’ve gone ahead and added commas between each one and parentheses around the whole set to make the unstyled content a little clearer .
< span class= " sparkline " > < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >( 60 , </ span ></ span > < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 220 , </ span ></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 140 , </ span ></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
80 , </ span ></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
110 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
90 , </ span ></ span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
180 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 140 , </ span ></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 120 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
160 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 175 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 225 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " > 175 , </ span></span> < span class = " index " >< span class= " count " >
125 )</span></span> </ span>
I ’ll float the whole chart to the left to set it next to the text .
Using a float here is a bit of a cheat , since sparklines are supposed to be able to appear directly inline with text .
But until we get more consistent support for the inline - block display property ( which is the effect we really want ) , a simple float will have to do .
Since we want the chart to be the same size as the text , I ’ll give it a height of 1em , and a little margin on either side to give it some breathing room .
. sparkline { float : left ; height : 1em ; margin : 0 0.5em ; }
Since the .index elements are the bar containers this time around , we ’ll set position : relative on them , and float them to the left .
I ’ll make the bars 2 px in width , since 1 px is a little too small to really register .
We want them to take up the full height of the chart , just like in the timeline , so we ’ll set the height to 100 % .
. sparkline .index { position : relative ; float : left ; width : 2 px ; height : 1em ; }
For the bars themselves , we ’ll follow almost exactly the same pattern as we did for the timeline , and apply the text - hiding trick .
. sparkline .index .count { display : block ; position : absolute ; bottom : 0 ; left : 0 ; width : 100 % ; height : 0 ; background : # AAA ; overflow : hidden ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; }
I ’ll also add some basic styles and padding to the unordered list containing our sparkline set .
You can see the results in the finished sparklines example .
Do n’t underestimate the Force#section7
You can see all the charts together in the final example .
Try adjusting the text size and see how the charts adapt with the rest of the page , or check out the unstyled example to see how the markup degrades for machine readers or environments without full CSS support .
Obviously , these charts are simple , and these techniques are n’t the best option in every situation .
When you need semantically rich markup — when you have a large set of data or a lot of categories to compare , nothing beats a table .
For fancy visualizations like scatterplots and 3D pie charts , you might choose some kind of server - side tool to generate images .
For extra interactivity and animation , Flash is probably the way to go .
It ’s certainly not a universal framework for data display , but it does add a lot of context to what would otherwise be blind navigation .
And you can start to see how these techniques could be the building blocks for more complex implementations .
So , when you want to build some ambient visualizations that are integrated with the structure of a data - driven site , remember : you can go a long way with accessible , standards - based markup and some simple CSS .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
When Jeremy Burton arrived as CEO at private - equity - owned Serena Software last year , he found a respectable but boring 25 - year - old firm still profitably churning out mainframe - oriented products .
But he also discovered some underplayed non-mainframe products as well as new technologies in R&D that could be killer in a mashup Web 2.0 world .
Of course the company 's owners at Silver Lake , wanted him to find ways to make the place grow .
So he turned R&D loose to develop the new products , and then turned to Facebook to change Serena .
" The challenge was taking a mainframe culture into the 21st century , " says the 40 - year - old Burton , a veteran of Oracle and Veritas who speaks with the lilting tones of his Newcastle , England hometown .
" We 've got to be relevant to the future .
So we instituted Facebook Friday . "
" I told all the employees it 's OK on a Friday for everybody to goof off and spend an hour or two on Facebook , " he explains to me at lunch in New York .
" I said ' Go nuts !
I dare you to participate , and I bet you 'll find out something new about somebody in the company that you never knew before . "
He learned that the R&D chief who'd showed him the mashup ideas - ways to combine small pieces of software to get a new , powerful combination - was especially fond of War and Peace .
But of course that was n't the main thing he was aiming to accomplish .
" The subversive message was ' Guys - the world is a different place and if we 're going to stay relevant we 're going to have to wake up , ' " Burton says .
The updated products - mostly little software tools to automate elementary but essential internal corporate processes - started to emerge last year and do well with customers .
Among them are products for bringing in new employees , for helping a company 's general counsel document that employees have read a code - of - conduct statement , and for tracking defects in software code in a data center .
The company 's revenues are about $ 250 million and only about one third of that is mainframe - related .
But Burton is eager to take the company another step away from its roots .
" I stood up nine months ago and said ' Folks , we 're going to build a software - as - a - service business . '
But many of them kind of just grinned and did n't really believe it . "
In the software - as - a - service model , now burgeoning across the software industry , customers do n't acquire software and host it on their own servers but rather rent it , generally on a per-employee - per - month basis , from a service provider that hosts the software on its own remote servers .
For Burton , the shift is an even more urgent reason to get his employees exposed to Facebook , which while basically intended as consumer rather than enterprise software is a classic example of software delivered as a service .
Explains Burton : " In Facebook , they can see what the people who are in the next generation of workers are already using .
Every single software company has to go through this software - as - a - service transition .
But it 's not only how you build your software .
It 's how your people think .
The people issue is much harder .
Facebook gets people thinking along a new axis . "
Now 800 of the company 's 900 employees have Facebook accounts , and many use it actively .
" It 's been a game - changer for us , " Burton says , " to go from an insular culture that does n't communicate much to a more collaborative culture . "
Some employees still resist , like a few in France , for example , who worry about risks to their personal privacy .
Burton says Facebook offers concrete benefits for him as a CEO .
For one thing , it has allowed employees to get to know him personally more quickly than they would have otherwise - something that younger employees in particular , he says , expect to do .
In addition , he says , " the status updates for people in Facebook give me a window into the company . "
He takes out his Blackberry , calls up the Facebook application there , and starts reading status updates for various employees .
" Winding down and heading to the weekend , " writes the Germany country boss .
Comments Burton : " It 's 10 p.m . there so I know he 's working hard . "
The guy who won the award for top telesales rep in the first quarter " is listening to the Roots . "
The head of all company sales writes that he " is heading home from Europe . "
His profile photo shows him holding up a beer stein .
Another way Serena uses Facebook is for its quarterly " Serena Gives Back " days , when all employees are expected to take a day for some sort of philanthropic or public service activity .
Last quarter the theme was " green , " and the event was announced and promoted on Facebook .
Employees were encouraged to discuss there how they would participate , and to post photos .
" I think we gain rather than lose productivity this way , " says CEO Burton .
" We have a theme , but I leave it up to them to choose what to do . "
After detailing all the ways he is convinced that Facebook is helping him change Serena 's culture and make the company more modern and efficient , Burton contentedly ends our conversation by saying " ... and it 's free ! "
For me , Serena 's tale is just another example of what I call The Facebook Effect , which is the title of a book I 'm starting to work on for Simon & Schuster .

Details of an entirely new kind of electronic device , which could make chips smaller and far more efficient , have been outlined by scientists .
The new components , described by scientists at Hewlett - Packard , are known as " memristors " .
The devices were proposed 40 years ago but have only recently been fabricated , the team wrote in the journal Nature .
They have already been used to build novel transistors - tiny switches that are the building blocks of all chips .
" Now we have this type of device we have a broader palette with which to paint our circuits , " Professor Stan Williams , one of the team , told the BBC last year .
Total recall Memristors were first proposed in 1971 by Professor Leon Chua , a scientist at the University of California , Berkeley .
They are the " fourth " basic building block of circuits , after capacitors , resistors and inductors .
Getting more from Moore 's Law Future computing " I never thought I 'd live long enough to see this happen , " Professor Chua told the Associated Press .
" I 'm thrilled because it 's almost like vindication .
Something I did is not just in my imagination , it 's fundamental . "
The memristors are so called because they have the ability to " remember " the amount of charge that has flowed through them after the power has been switched off .
This could allow researchers to build new kinds of computer memory that would would not require powering up .
Today , most PCs use dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) which loses data when the power is turned off .
But a computer built with memristors could allow PCs that start up instantly , laptops that retain sessions after the battery dies , or mobile phones that can last for weeks without needing a charge .
" If you turn on your computer it will come up instantly where it was when you turned it off , " Professor Williams told Reuters .
" That is a very interesting potential application , and one that is very realistic . "
' Industry anathema ' Professor Williams and his team have already shown that by putting two memristors together - a configuration called a crossbar latch - it could do the job of a transistor .
The team has built hybrid circuits using memristors and transistors " A crossbar latch has the type of functionality you want from a transistor but it 's working with very different physics , " he explained .
Intriguingly , these devices can also be made much smaller than a conventional transistor .
" And as they get smaller they get better , " he said .
As a result , the new devices could play a key part in the future of the electronics industry , as it relentlessly pursues Moore 's Law .
This industry axiom , first stated by Gordon Moore , co-founder of chip - maker Intel , states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
However , according to some , it may be some time before the device is widely used .
" Even to consider an alternative to the transistor is anathema to many device engineers , and the memristor concept will have a steep slope to climb towards acceptance , " wrote Drs James Tour and Tao Heare of Rice University , Houston , in an accompanying article in Nature .
They said that some in the electronics industry would only accept the use of memristors " after the demonstration of a well - functioning , large - scale array of these densely packed devices " .
" When that happens , the race towards smaller devices will proceed at full steam . "

What are these ?
Revelations about the president ’s tax returns will give ammunition to his challenger .
But they are unlikely to change the campaign
IMO , one of the major propaganda goals of the Bush administration ( with much help from the rest of the political / media establishment ) has been to convince the public that patriotism = unconditional support for authority figures .
Thus , double standards are considered ok simply because it is implied that powerful people should not be held accountable .
Secrecy and obstruction of justice are ok simply because it is implied that powerful officials are acting in good faith despite the lack of evidence to support such a conclusion .
Citizens who object to policies that are illegal and anti-Constitutional are often considered out of line simply because they have the gall to challenge the actions of powerful officials .
The first widely available wireless LAN technology , 802.11 b , has been available since 1999 , yet it 's surprising how many companies still do n't take appropriate wireless security measures , both on LANs and Wide Area Networks , those inside their walls and those used elsewhere .
Today , businesses are seeing a real uptake in mobile devices that adds a whole new set of security concerns .
" A lot of organizations still have not done the basics , " says Allan Carey , a senor research vice president at the Institute for Applied Network Security , an organization for practicing information security professionals .
Yet the basics of wireless security are not difficult to accomplish , says Eric Maiwald , senior analyst at Burton Group , a research and advisory firm .
There are proven , widely deployed security standards for the two main forms of protection in wireless networks , which are authentication and encryption .
Although the first generation of mobile devices often paid scant attention to security issues —
Research in Motion 's BlackBerry being the notable exception — the new crop of Web - friendly devices such as the Apple , iPhone , Palm , Inc. 's Treo and devices based on Microsoft 's Windows Mobile 6 are increasingly designed with enterprise - class wireless security in mind .
Case in point :
The first Apple iPhone lacked basic security standards such as VPN , strong passwords , security manageability , encryption and remote - kill capabilities .
But as business adoption has grown , Apple has added VPN support and has promised to plug other security gaps , with the possible exception of strong passwords , in June 2008 with a software update .
Each generation of Windows Mobile and Palm Treo devices have likewise improved security features .
For example , the forthcoming Version 6.1 Windows Mobile software will let administrators encrypt data stored on memory cards in Windows Mobile devices , as well as control which applications may be installed .
Last year , Palm introduced an option based on military requests that uses Bluetooth card readers to swipe second - factor authentication cards , in addition to requiring a password to be entered on the Treos , before the handhelds can be used .
Some organizations in highly security - aware industries have gone beyond wireless security basics , Carey notes .
Chief among these are health care organizations , which are bound by HIPAA 's stringent data privacy requirements , and universities , which have a large , mobile workforce and a student base working in multiple locations .
These organizations were havens for hackers in the early days of wireless networking and so have learned their lessons the hard way , Carey says .
The issue , then , is not technology availability but how businesses prioritize and think of security for their wireless networks and mobile devices .
There are still plenty of companies that have not yet formulated a security strategy for wireless networks and mobile devices .
The Basics for Protection
Wireless users face one key threat : having their data , passwords , and so on intercepted during transmission .
The venues for such interception can vary , such as from a Wi -Fi eavesdropper or through a rogue access point .
Similarly , mobile users face the similar threat : having their devices ' data exposed to someone who hacks into them if lost or stolen .
In both cases , encryption of data ( both at rest and during transmission ) and authentication of user access ( to data , devices and networks ) are the key security methods .
These techniques should be coupled with commonsense security techniques for any network or computer , such as requiring strong passwords , imposing user access control policies , and segregating traffic through techniques such as VPNs and virtual LANs .
The trick is ensuring that these methods are applied throughout the network and the devices using them , so any individual breach has limited impact .
Any wireless network should authenticate users via an encrypted " handshake , " ' which means using the WPA protocol or the newer , slightly more secure version called WPA2 .
Both are based on the 802.11i standard , but WPA was based on a draft version , while WPA2 was based on the final version .
WPA and WPA2 also come in two flavors : personal and enterprise .
The personal version uses a pre-shared key ( PSK ) , meaning all users are given the same credentials .
The enterprise version uses an 802.1 x server to create unique credentials for each user , making it more secure , since if one credential is discovered , the others are still secure .
But the enterprise version does require more work for IT , notes Paul Kocher , president of the consultancy Cryptography Research .
" It 's not a great solution for a large company with lots of users , " he says .
That 's why WPA should be only the first line of defense in a wireless network .
The next line of defense should be the use of virtual LANs , to segregate traffic and users from each other .
This is the same principle as using subnets in a wired network .
By confining users to specific VLANs , you can use access control policies to monitor wireless activity and determine role - based access , Kocher says , even if an unauthorized person gets past the WPA authentication step .
IT should also ensure that wireless users follow the same security approaches as in any remote connection , Maiwald says , including ' using SSL or other forms of encryption for email and server access , as well as VPNs to create secure connection tunnels .
This last recommendation is particularly critical when users access the corporate system from public wireless hot spots , adds ' Carey , because their access points tend to not use SSL in the connections to the user 's ' laptops .
If you 're using 3G networks — such as the cellular carriers ' EVDO and HSDPA networks — you can relax a little on security , says Maiwald .
These networks handle authentication and encryption , so issues such as WPA authentication and SSL encryption for email are essentially handled for you .
But as such networks gain in popularity — and new ones such as WiMax and the 700MHz spectrum are deployed — you can expect hackers to start looking for ways in , so it makes sense to apply a consistent security strategy to all connection channels , even if the means to achieve it may vary based on the specific channel , Maiwald says .
Dealing with handhelds
Mobile devices should use the same standards as laptops , . and they should also support data encryption — so that if a device is lost or stolen , it 's data can't be easily accessed , Kocher says .
This also applies to removable media and laptops . '
Other requirements include strong passwords ( not four - digit PINs such as on the iPhone ) that can be managed centrally by IT .
Strong passwords are particularly important for mobile devices because they can more easily be lost or stolen , and because they tend to use less capable security approaches due to their limited processing power , they are easier to crack , he adds .
For laptops ( and home PCs used for work ) , Kocher recommends whole - disk encryption so there 's no question as to what had been encrypted if there is a breach .
It does n't matter whether the encryption is built into the operating system , such as with Windows Vista 's BitLocker , or comes from a third party , such as the commercial PGP or open - source TrueCrypt .
The problem is that most mobile devices do n't support these various security approaches ( encryption , strong passwords , VPNs and more ) , or at least not all of them .
The BlackBerry does , which is one reason it is so popular in the enterprise , says Jon Allen , information security office at Baylor University in Waco , Texas .
Apple 's promises for the iPhone 2.0 software indicate it may come close , " but the jury 's still out , " ' Maiwald says .
Windows Mobile 6 offers most of these capabilities when managed from Windows Exchange Server 2007 , and vendors such as Bluefire Security Technologies in Baltimore , Md. , Motorola ' Good Technology Group and Sybase , Inc. offer an array of tools to add to many Windows Mobile and Palm devices .
It 's also important to consider potential security holes when evaluating specialty mobile devices , — such as wireless meter readers , airport baggage claim scanners , package scanners and retail kiosks —
Maiwald warns .
At Baylor University , Allen saw this issue surface in its point - of - sale terminals , which " had n't anticipated wireless " in their original security designs , he says .
When the university added wireless connectivity , " we had to button that down , " he says .
Set security policy standards , and make the devices comply
Whatever security options are available for various devices , one approach to protect your enterprise data is to mandate that any PCs and handhelds allowed to connect to an organization 's network and other systems must support a specified set of security methods , such as VPN , WPA2 , remote kill and on - disk encryption .
This puts the burden on users and vendors to comply and allows IT to come up with security policies centered around its data protection needs , not on specific technology implementations , Allen advises . '
For example , Allen decided that personal information had to be protected wherever it resided .
That meant students could no longer access registration information , even those who worked in the registrar 's office .
To protect such data that is stored on laptops , such as student grades , Allen ' has also begun requiring all 800 faculty laptops to use PGP ' encryption .
He also requires VPN usage so any personal information is shielded when transmitted .
The Duke University Medical Center in Durham , N.C. , took a similar approach in February 2008 , after previously being more lenient with its 3,200 staffers , says Gary Harrison , IT application manager for mobile computing .
" If a device wo n't support the [ Sybase ] Afaria mobile management tool 's security requirements , then sorry , you can't connect , " he says .
Alternatively , staff can use BlackBerrys , since that device has its own security mechanism , " he says .
The medical centered lowered the boom for two reasons : increased laptop and handheld use increased the risk of HIPAA violations , and more and more devices support the necessary security standards , so it 's now possible to enforce them .
Southeastern Polytechnic State University in Marrietta , Ga. , also has imposed standards on what devices can access the campus 's wireless network .
It requires everyone to have EAP - TTLS , a tunneled form of the TLS ( Transport Layer Security ) authentication protocol that exchanges the public and private keys in the tunnel so they can not be snooped .
Apple 's Macintosh devices supports the protocol out of the box , and many PCs that use Intel 's wireless drivers do as well , says CIO Bill Gruzka .
Other PC and laptop users must install the open source SecureW2 software to gain this capability .
But the iPhone does n't support EAP - TTLS , even though it is based on Mac OS X , and given its popularity among the roughly 5,000 students and faculty — it 's the main handheld in use at campus — Gruzka could n't enforce this standard on mobile devices .
But he relies on other policies , not just EAP - TTLS , to secure data access on campus .
For instance , one critical policy is the use of virtual LANs to segregate both traffic and data access based on roles , Gruzka says .
Another is to keep data stored on network drives rather than on users ' computers , which resolves the issue of — inconsistent encryption capabilities of Macs , Windows , PCs and handhelds , which inhibited him from enforcing a consistent encryption policy .
He also uses an SSL - based VPN from Juniper Networks that enforces password policies , looks up ActiveDirectory - stored user privileges and wipes out session data on users ' computers .
The VPN requires no client software ( it uses Java and ActiveX controls instead to manage the client through the browser ) , so the university can manage everything consistently without worrying about user actions .
Block intruders before they connectrogue access points .
The Meru access points " know " each other and can thus identify rogues , Gruzka says , and when they detect one , they use the second radio to send a data pulse that essentially obscures the rogues ' spoofed SSID so users can't see it and connect to it .
All of this happens in a fraction of a second .
At Southeastern Polytechnic , Gruzka noticed that hackers would spoof the access points '

It 's easy to put such an access point in a potted plant or bring one into a lobby , he notes .
And because PCs and laptops can be set to operate in ad hoc mode — making one computer a virtual access point — almost anyone with a PC can be a rogue .

Using wireless sniffers to conduct periodic sweeps is one approach , as is using interconnected access points that can detect rogues .
Despite these threats , the good news is that there are proven techniques to protect your wireless and mobile environments .
The bad news is that many organizations have n't done so yet .

Developing a marketing plan is nothing more than setting goals and making a to - do list that will get you there .
If you do n’t have experience in this field , a marketing plan example can show you how you can get started to start creating your own strategy .
The process of planning something is time - consuming and exhaustive , but it is an absolute necessity if you want to be successful .
So how do we reconcile our need to succeed with our propensity for procrastination ?
In addition to the marketing plan example , the right marketing strategy template will a long way to simplify the process .
But before you get started , you have re-frame how you look at planning .
We hate planning because we remember the endless meetings , hours of research that does n’t seem to get you closer to an answer and documents the size of War and Peace .
But it does n’t have to be that way .
It ’s really not much different than planning a party .
You ’re basically creating a plan for inviting more people you love to give you money and then tell other people why they should give you their money too .
Sounds like a party to me .
How about you ?
That ’s why I ’ve been working to develop really simple , one - page marketing strategy template that can be used to develop marketing plans .
I ’d like to share two different ones with you .
They ’re designed to get you thinking and planning and making money , not writing lengthy documents .
Marketing Plan Example
One-page Marketing Plan # 1
The first marketing plan template is one that I ’ve loosely adapted from learnings from the original marketing guru , Philip Kotler .
( Even he does n’t believe in hundred - page plans ) .
It ’s a simple single sheet of paper that outlines the basic marketing components or categories like your Mission / Objectives , Target Market , Offering , Pricing , Distribution , Communication — you know , those 4 Ps we love so much in marketing .
But the good news is that that ’s really all there is to it .
You can find something roughly along these lines in an old “ Marketing Management ” book that Kotler wrote over 20 years ago , but I think the principles are still valid .
You can use this format as a place to put your big thoughts so that you can focus on what the strategies are .
I am making the template available as a Word document — both a blank template and a mocked - up marketing plan sample , which you can use as a guide for how to fill out the template .
Download blank template # 1 ( .docx format )
Download mocked - up sample plan # 1 ( .docx format )
One-page Marketing Plan #
2
The second one - page plan format I use is a combination of the Kotler plan and the Guerrilla Marketing process as advocated by Michael McLaughlin .
This one ’s not much different from the Kotler plan , but it ’s less academic and more focused on emotional triggers that will get your ideal customer to choose you .
I am also making this template available as Microsoft Word documents for you to download use to guide your marketing planning .
Download the blank template # 2 ( .docx format )
Download a mocked - up sample plan # 2 ( .docx format )
So , there you have the plans I ’ve been using — and my hat tip goes to both of the masters for giving me a starting point to create these one - page marketing plan templates .
Now , I ’d love to hear from you .
What do you think of these one - page marketing plans ?
What do you use as a marketing plan , and why ?
In what ways would you change or improve the templates I ’ve offered ?
Come on , share your ideas .

Denver has traditionally looked up to Seattle the way a sixth - grader stares in awe at the cool high school neighbor from down the street .
Unlike rock star cities like New York or London , Seattle is roughly similar in size and status to Denver , but has still managed to reach a level of hipness that Mile High City urbanites could look up to .
Denver ’s progressive cultural and political leaders took note of Seattle ’s downtown vibe , music scene , coffee shops , liberal leanings and kick - ass walkability and thought it something that our city could reasonably aspire .
So Denver did things .
We turned our crumbling downtown into a center for nightlife and provided subsidies to build neighborhoods on former industrial zones .
We re-inhabited formerly abandoned commercial strips with unique restaurants and groceries .
We grew a thriving arts district , remolded old theatres into music venues and sprouted coffee shops .
And then we voted to pass the nation ’s largest single public transportation initiative in the form of FastTracks , and began building a light rail system to connect the region and reign in sprawl .
After all , light rail and monorail is something many in Seattle have been trying to get built for decades .
And we were very pleased when we heard that one of Seattle ’s alternative newsweeklies , The Stranger , was sending a reporter all the way to our city to look at our light rail .
Finally , we were running with the cool crowd !
We were really excited last November when we began to read feature article written by Erica C. Barnett on how Denver could actually serve as a model for Seattle .
OMFG !
Then we got to this paragraph :
“ Denver is one of those cities hardly anyone would regard as cutting edge .
The women still wear tube tops ( or , if they 're older , floral sweatshirts ) ; the men still favor large wire - frame glasses last seen in these parts around 1992 .
Still , the seven counties in and surrounding Denver have done something truly remarkable :
They 've managed to reach consensus on a package of rail and road improvements that are actually getting people out of their cars and onto trains and buses . ”
That ’s when we realized the true premise of the article :
How is it that these lame - asses in “ Denver , Colorado – of all places , ” can get light rail built while Seattle still quarrels over trains ?
“ Denver 's not a paradise , of course .
It 's a sprawling , ugly mess of a city , with suburbs stretching out from the freeways as far as the eye can see .
There are parking garages everywhere , with more proposed as part of the transit expansion plan .
The " transit - oriented development " at Englewood had a distinctly suburban feel — identical taupe stucco and brick apartments perched on top of liquor stores , nail salons , and chain restaurants , and right around the corner was a massive , ugly Wal - Mart / Petco retail complex . ”
The underlying hope of the article titled " Wake Up Call " was to shame Seattle residents into seeing how stupid they ’re being by showing that even the backward rubes in disgusting Denver have managed to find a date to the big light rail prom .
Seattle was right , we realized .
How could we ever think we were cool !
No wonder all of our musicians , artists , writers and actors always leave us the second they get a scrap of fame .
Our city ran back home to its room , slammed the door and took a good long , hard look in the municipal mirror .
It was n’t pretty : freeways , big - box stores , TGI Fridays .
Highlands - fucking - Ranch !
For months , Denver stopped going out to underground warehouse concerts and art openings .
The Ogden , Bluebird , Oriental and Bug theaters sat empty .
Our mayor , John Hickenlooper – named one of the top US mayors by “ Rise of the Creative Class ” author Richard Florida – tried to console the city with wacky photo - ops with Denver Poet Laureate Chris Ransick .
But it was to no avail .
We let the Metro Area sprawl out in Aurora and Broomfield .
We started shopping at Wal - Mart again , ignoring our cool independent record and book stores like Twist and Shout and the Tattered Cover .
What does it matter anyway ?
We ’re never going to break out of our third - tier city status .
Denver might as well get all fat and stupid like Dallas / Fort Worth and go back to building parking lots .
But then , a few days ago , we read this letter in The Stranger ’s “ I Anonymous ” section written by a former Denverite to the city of Seattle :
“ I moved from Denver to be with you six years ago because you had an awesome bus system , you had oceans and mountains , you had perfect temperatures ( if not enough sun ) , you had a nightlife , you were liberal , and you had plans — BIG plans .
You told me about your light rail , and then your monorail .
You told me about your urban revitalization , about your progressive agenda , about your trails and waterways .
Six years have passed , and all I 'm left with is my dick in my hand and a vitamin D deficiency .
The light rail is years late , miles short , directionally challenged , and millions over budget .
The monorail is dead ; the SLUT is a joke .
I 'm priced out of your urban core , your liberal leadership is limper than Nickels and Chopp 's dicks , your nightlife is being suffocated , and your trails are closed from lack of funding .
So fuck you , Seattle , and good - bye .
I 'm headed back to Denver , where light rail is already built under budget and under time .
I wo n't let the viaduct fall on me on my way out . ”
We knew instantly that Anonymous was correct .
Denver is pretty damn great and getting greater .
Seattle is the one that ’s gotten lazy , so comfortable in its own cool category that its political leaders have taken to bickering over funding like a mid -level inde rock band .
We re-read Barnett ’s article and realized it was n’t trashing us as hard as we thought .
Denver does n’t need to compare itself to other cities to know it 's cool .
We just passed laws that will finally allow art galleries to serve beer and wine at openings .
For the second time , the Congress for New Urbanism is holding it ’s annual urban planning conference in Denver next year because our city has so many examples of smart development .
And then there ’s that little thing some people are throwing here this August called the Democratic National Convention .
So we welcome home Anonymous , along with all of our other cultural expatriates who left our fair streets for towns with cooler reputations .
We ’ve got bigger things to aspire to now .
Like how we can become like San Francisco .

An exclusive interview with CPN ( Maoist ) leader Prachanda by MRZine ( reposted by Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal with permission ) .
By Mary Des Chene and Stephen Mikesell
It is 14th Jeth , 2065 , [ Tuesday May 27 , 2008 ] in Nepal , the day before the constituent assembly is to convene and declare Nepal a full republic .
The king remains in his palace .
The form of the new government , who will lead it , whether the old parliamentary parties will join in a Maoist - led government or , as they have indicated so far , will boycott and try to isolate it -- these and other basic questions remain to be resolved .
The following is an early morning interview with CPN ( Maoist ) leader Prachanda , before he embarked on a last intensive round of negotiations to try to bring the parliamentary parties into a coalition government under Maoist leadership .
Kathmandu , May 27 , 2008 .
You may become Nepal 's new head of state within a few days , but the parliamentary parties are putting up a lot of blockades .
Yesterday your party put forth a 9 - point proposal to address the current political impasse .
What are the main barriers to formation of a CPN ( Maoist ) - led government at this point ?
What are the challenges and what are the proposals you 've made to the parliamentary parties ?
Intensive debate , discussion and struggle is going on , on the question of formation of the government , and mainly on the questions of the head of the state and the head of the government .
These questions raise so many ideological and political issues , involving the class interests of the parties .
Yesterday we had a very serious discussion .
The parliamentary parties , mainly the Nepali Congress and the CPN ( UML ) , want to have their own person be the head of state .
They want to check , they want to block our party from forming the government and filling the position of head of state .
Therefore intensive struggle is going on right now .
As we discuss these issues with the leaders of the other parties , it seems to me that intensive and serious class struggle is going on , on the level of ideology and political line .
Because we have the status of the largest party through the constituent assembly election , the initiative is in our hands , but nevertheless intensive struggle continues .
I think that by tomorrow we 'll not be able to have consensus about the questions of the head of state and the formation of the government .
Therefore right now we are thinking that we 'll make an agreement only for the declaration of the republican system .
And on that there will be consensus -- there should be consensus .
Your party has a clear mandate from the election to form the next government .
The transitional government of the past two years has functioned on the basis of political consensus governed by the Seven Party Alliance accords and other formal agreements .
From election day onward you 've stressed the CPN ( Maoist ) commitment to continue with coalition government under those accords .
The major parliamentary parties have set a number of conditions for participating in a Maoist - led coalition government , several of which you 've stated directly contravene signed accords .
At this point , if a coalition government under your party 's leadership cannot be formed , what will be the main reasons ?
I think that before the elections the parliamentary parties , especially the largest parliamentary party , the Nepali Congress , never expected that we would become the largest party through the election .
Therefore they made so many agreements and compromises with our party , like those concerning the questions of a two - thirds majority and a simple majority [ to change the government ] .
At that time they were in the leadership .
Therefore they thought that a two - thirds majority requirement for changing the government would be just fine .
But later on , when they saw that the Maoists had become the largest party and were going to lead the government and be head of the state , then they changed their position .
Now they hold that a simple majority should be the means to change the government .
Previously , up until the election , they did n't expect that they would lose through the election , and they thought that they could easily disintegrate our organisational structure and exert control over the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] cadres and so on .
But now , after the election , they think that it is going to be a very serious question .
Therefore now they are making a proposal that our arms should be destroyed , and the PLA cadres should be disbanded or they should join vocational training or something like that .
They 're trying to raise those kinds of ridiculous things .
This is against the peace agreement .
This is against the spirit of the interim constitution .
The major parliamentary party , the Nepali Congress , has changed their positions after the election and are showing themselves to be against peace .
It is going to be proved -- I think within some days , maybe within one or two weeks -- it will be crystal clear that the major political parliamentary parties are against peace , against any kind of change , against forming a coalition government under the leadership of the Maoists .
They are against the people 's mandate , you know .
It will be clear .
If they will not move ahead in keeping with the spirit of the interim constitution , if they will not follow the peace agreement we have already made and all the other agreements and accords , ultimately it seems to me that it is a question of class outlook .
The opposing classes are struggling in a very new contest .
And one thing that is quite clear is that the proletariat and our revolutionary party have taken the initiative in our own hands .
They [ Nepali Congress and UML ] are the losers .
Right now , in this battle , in this electoral battle , they are the losers and we are the winners .
Therefore a big debate and discussion and struggle is going on .
If they were successful in disbanding your army , how would that affect the possibility of creating the republic ?
It would be very difficult .
But I think they have already agreed to implement the republican system from the first meeting of the constituent assembly .
Right .
But if your army was not there , then what force would you have against the king [ who ] remains in the background ?
We will not disband our army .
How could we agree to disband our army or destroy our arms ?
It has been formally agreed that both the armies should be integrated and a new national army should be established and organised .
And we have never agreed to go with DDR , you know , this DDR formula [ Disarmament , Demobilisation , Reintegration ] .
What we said is that , here in Nepal it is quite necessary that both armies should be integrated to form a new army .
It is the essence of our agreement .
Now , when they see that the Maoists have won the election , they want to change the previous agreement .
Therefore at the moment we do not want to focus our discussion with the parliamentary parties on the questions of integration and so on .
We want to focus our discussions on the questions of implementation of the republic and the republican system .
It is quite clear , and the masses know it very well , the masses are clear that the first sitting of the constituent assembly will implement the republican system and even all the parliamentary parties have already agreed to go with the republican system .
In this phase of the struggle , we Maoists want to focus our whole effort to implement that previous agreement .
I think that they cannot reject or retreat from the previous agreement on the question of the republic .
If they hesitate to implement this republican system tomorrow then ...
It is going to happen you know .
This is the historical turning point against the feudal system .
If they will hesitate , I think that they will be crossed by the masses .
The masses will not tolerate them .
Because they have already lost through the election .
If they hesitate to implement the republican system , then they will lose yet more , you see .
Tomorrow .
on the day when the constituent assembly sits to declare the republic , the Kathmandu District Administration has declared restrictions on marches , rallies and assembling on the streets surrounding the convention centre , the palace and other places in the capital .
But many marches and cultural programs have already been announced , and the people seem sure to come out , whether to ensure that their will is carried out or just to celebrate .
How are you viewing that move to restrict the people 's movement ?
We have already decided to hold rallies all over the country .
There will be mass rallies in all seventy - five district headquarters .
And here in Kathmandu there will also be a victory rally , a republican rally .
It will be a great day for us , for the people of this country .
But they will not go to encircle the palace , or go near the Birendra International Convention Centre hall where the first meeting of the constituent assembly is going to be held .
But they will be in the streets , near Singhadarbar [ the usual parliamentary venue ] and in other places .
They 'll be chanting slogans in favor of the republic and so on .
But there will not be -- we are trying our best not to be in a confrontation tomorrow .
It would not be good , it would not be proper to have any kinds of confrontation tomorrow .
We want to show the masses who are in favor of the republican line .
There will be a festive atmosphere .
It will be like a people 's festival , a republican festival .
It will be very big , and a great thing for our people .
But some reactionary people , mainly those who are loyal to the monarchy , they are trying to carry out some sorts of sabotage and some sorts of terrorist activities .
Yesterday they exploded some small socket bombs near the convention center hall , and in the houses of civil society figures .
But I do n't think they will be able to create some big sabotage or anything .
If you have to form a sole government without the cooperation of the other parties are you ready to do that ?
Yes .
If they are not ready , and if they want it so , then we 'll form our own government without their cooperation .
They may think that within three months or a hundred days -- there 's the saying that 100 days is the honeymoon -- that after the honeymoon they can encircle us and dismantle our government .
They think like that .
But we believe that once we are in the government we 'll take so many decisions , important decisions , in favour of the masses of the people and in favor of our nation , and that those kinds of decisions will allow us to have a broader mass base and broader organisation and will ultimately help us to move ahead .
You 've used the term " economic revolution " and said that after forming the government the task is economic revolution .
Tell us a bit about your first steps ; the economy is in very bad shape .
Yes , I think that economic development and sustainable peace have a very compact relation .
Without having development it is very difficult to have a sustainable peace .
And here in our country there are huge natural resources : for example , we have a huge hydro potential , tourism can be a big industry in this country , this beautiful country .
There are so many things we can do .
For the time being what we are seeing is that we should have to follow a mixed economic system .
I also want to qualify that it is not exactly a mixed economic system ; we are trying to develop some new approaches in our transitional economic policy .
We have not completed the democratic revolution , you know .
We are in the process of the completion of the democratic revolution .
But after 10 years of peoples war we have achieved some political and some socioeconomic change , which is already in process .
Because that revolution is in the transitional phase we are trying to develop some new tactics and new policy according to the overall economic situation and national situation of the first decades of the 21st century .
Therefore we shall have to follow a transitional economic policy .
Not exactly the economic policy of the New Democracy , not exactly the economic policy of the bourgeois system , but something in - between .
We are saying that this is a transitional economic policy , and we want to decide our own priority by ourselves .
And we want to encourage the national capitalist , or ``national bourgeois ' ' as we say , we want to encourage them to invest and to generate employment , and to invest in the industrial sector , which will create some new possibilities .
And through them we want to attract the foreign investment , but according to our decision , according to our priority .
Until now , all the decisions have been taken not by the Nepali people and the Nepali government , but by the foreigners and international institutions , like the World Bank .
But this time we want to change that pattern .
We want to decide our own priorities , we want to encourage our national bourgeois to have a conducive atmosphere for investment and generation of employment , and through them we want to attract the foreign investors according to our decision , according to our priority .
In the rural area and in the hydro sector we want to have small hydro projects , medium - level hydro projects , and big hydro projects .
Not just the large ones .
One problem is that you are being handed over a practically bankrupt state , one heavily in debt , and that wo n't leave you much leeway , at least if you work in the old terms , so how are you going to address that ?
I think it is a challenge , and we are taking it as a positive challenge .
The first question is to mobilise the millions of the masses to rebuild this country .
Until and unless we mobilise the masses , nothing can be done .
We will transparently divulge everything to the mass of the people : this is the situation here in the country , the world government and world state has led this country to this bankruptcy .
Now , if everyone of this country , every citizen of this country will not make a commitment to go ahead to build the country themselves , it will be very difficult for us sustain and undertake development .
Therefore our first priority will be to educate the masses of people about the real situation of the government and all these things that have happened in the past .
The second point is that we will try our best to mobilise the national bourgeois , the national capitalists .
There are so many people who can contribute .
If we draw up a scientific plan , an economic plan , according to our situation , we can mobilise those industrialists and those national capitalists or national bourgeois to invest in a more productive way .
And I also think that , because we are in between China and India , both of which have very fast growing economies , we can benefit from their growing economies .
I myself have tried my best to have serious discussions with China 's Communist Party and China 's government .
How can they help to rebuild this country ?
How much will they be able to contribute , and how far can they mobilise their peoples to invest here in our country ?
And we were also talking with the Indian parties and Indian government officials : how can they contribute to our efforts in rebuilding this country ?
So I think that from both these countries , according to our plan and according to our priorities , we can mobilise positive economic input .
This is something challenging , we know it , but this is something beneficial for this country .
What about the role of the youth of this country in all of these plans ?
The thousands who are migrant labourers outside the country , now the thousands and thousands who are unemployed here , and the Young Communist League , your own youth organisation ?
Yes , we are working on drawing up a plan to mobilise the youth in rebuilding this country .
Our YCL has already been mobilised : thousands and thousands of youth were mobilised before the election in a political mobilisation .
Now we are going to mobilise them in the constructive work , in economic development .
And we are also trying to make a connection with all the people working outside the country .
Non-resident Nepalis are there , and the organisation of non-resident Nepalis ; those people can contribute more in rebuilding this country , and we want to invite them to invest here in Nepal .
We have already developed a plan for how we can mobilise thousands of peoples who are outside the country , who are doing business elsewhere .
Some of them have done a very good job , they have earned substantial amounts of money , they can invest here , and we can contact them .
And also I think that we can bring back youth who are in Arab countries and all over the world , if we have a plan for building this country .
I have already discussed some hydro power , medium - level hydro projects .
And if there will be five , six or seven of such kinds of project all over the country , we can mobilise thousands and thousands of youth in that kind of project .
And when they see that there are jobs in our own country , they will come back and we can mobilise that kind of youth .
And what about bringing young people back into agriculture , which is the base of the economy here ?
Yes , we have already agreed to carry out scientific land reform .
Here in Nepal there is a different situation in the Tarai [ lowland plains ] , in mountainous areas and in the hilly regions .
We have to make a complete plan of land reform for the hilly region , for the Himalayan region and for the Tarai .
But the main focus of this scientific land reform will be the Tarai because the bulk of the agricultural land is there .
There should be land ceilings and the land of absentee landlords should be redistributed among the peasants .
But our main focus will be commercialising the farming .
Without commercialised farming we can't develop agriculture .
And we want to establish agro - based industries .
We can't mobilise the youth in the agricultural sector with only the traditional ways of farming .
We have to create something new by creating jobs in agro - based industry .
And that will ultimately commercialise the overall farming , and it will be a revolutionary step to raise the living standards of the people .

We cover many wondrous things on Gizmag but few fall into this category for elegance and technological excellence and sheer beauty .
Project GreenJet is the modern day equivalent of the jet aircraft on the water and builds on the automated functionality of Erik Sifrer ’s highly - acclaimed 36 metre SY120 concept only on a grander 57 metre scale .
Going several steps further than the breathtaking , already - in - the - water 88 m Maltese Falcon , Green Jet uses automated systems controlling non-conventional sails to offer a glimpse of the future of sail – faster , more efficient , less labour intensive with minimal environmental impact .
The vision is a superyacht sailed by one man with a touchscreen .
Gizmag investigates the potential for automated sailing in this feature article .
Mankind 's history is intertwined with sailing .
The Egyptians are the earliest recorded sailors ( 3500 BC ) though evidence exists of Japanese sailors being shipwrecked in South America in the same period .
Since then , each new understanding of the science of sailing has brought with it an important enabling technology for civilization itself .
Over 5500 years , sailors and boatbuilders have learned better ways to balance the forces of the wind against the sails to safely carry know - how and trade over ever - increasing distances .
The science of sailing may seem simple , yet it is not .
At its simplest , a group of sailors control the direction and speed of their boat by changing the rigging and rudder and hull to create and manage an interface between the forces of the wind and water .
Over five millennia , mankind has devised better hulls , masts , sails , rigs , rudders , to better manage those forces .
Mastery of the skill of sailing requires vast experience in varying wind and sea conditions , understanding of the characteristics of the vessel you are sailing and implementing the optimum setting to achieve the desired result .
Mastery is rare , and even the masters of today often get it wrong despite the array of technological decision - making aids at their disposal .
Mankind owes much for the speed of its development to those who mastered sailing and ventured into the unknowns of the sea – those who got there and back contributed disproportionately to the spread of new ideas on the planet for five thousand years .
Now with the internet permeating every corner of the globe , and knowledge readily shareable across all boundaries , we are about to see new thinking brought to one of man ’s oldest pursuits , and the prospect is very tantalizing in what it might offer .
Seafaring ’s incomplete history
Since the dawn of history this seemingly simple , yet incredibly complex thing known as sailing has afforded mankind greater mobility and capacity for fishing , trade , warfare and an exchange of ideas via human capital travel .
There is enough unsubstantiated evidence around to suggest that many nations developed superb seamanship thousands of years ago , with the possibility that Japanese visited Ecuador ( 3500 BC ) , the Phoenicians sailed the Atlantic ( 1100 BC ) , Greeks visited America ( 400BC ) and that Roman merchants traded with America ( 200 BC ) .
You wo n’t find it in a history book , but knowledge discovery has long since outstripped the history book ’s ability to keep up .
The world ’s first global trade mission ( and circumnavigation )
The most compelling evidence yet that history has n’t fully unearthed a fraction of human maritime history is Gavin Menzies 1421 book .
Menzies modern day ( the book was only published in 2002 ) forensic work has brought to light the story of the world ’s first globally - aimed trade mission , using the vast resources of the Ming Dynasty and world - leading Chinese Naval Technology and seamanship .
Chinese Muslim Admiral Zheng
He ’s most famous voyage of 1421 saw him command 28,000 sailors across a fleet of 320 ships , comprised mainly of large six - masted ships but including 62 NINE - masted treasure ships with four decks , 150 metre length and capable of carrying 500 passengers .
In 1420 , China ’s navy was easily the largest in the world , with 400 large war junks stationed at Nanking , 1,350 warships , river and canal patrol boats stationed elsewhere , 3,000 merchant vessels that could be converted into fighting ships if needed , 400 huge grain transports , and 250 “ treasure ships , ” heavily - armed , bulk overseas treasure carriers that brought back riches from far flung missions of trade and diplomacy .
Admiral Zheng
He ’s most prodigious discovery fleet of 1421 was as self - sufficient as the current U.S. Navy in every respect with a well - thought out representation of every conceivable need – from on - board desalination facilities , a dispersed set of well - trained single - purpose personel including doctors , scientific explorers , trade merchants , warriors , sailors , entertainers and courtesans , who sailed with the fleet to staff the on - board brothels .
The Chinese Navy was not just extremely organized and large – boat against boat , it ’s massive technological advantage gave it a range of state - of - the - art armaments that would have decimated any European fleet of the time .
Chinese Firepower
It must be remembered that the Chinese invented gunpowder and had learned to use it to great effect for military purposes over many centuries .
Whilst the West was fumbling with slow - loading inaccurate cannons , the Chinese fleet was armed with an array of cannon from small to fearsome , PLUS rockets which could be fired with a high degree of accuracy to set alight enemy sails , rendering them immobile while the cannons were accurately aimed .
Many people have cast doubts about the designs of the largely flat - bottomed Chinese boats and their ability to safely sail on the open seas , yet compelling evidence exists that the fleet sailed to all corners of the world and landed an unbelievable treasure trove at Nanking across several years as the fleet returned from its voyages of discovery .
The Admiral , legend has it , on several occasions filled the harbour of key overseas ports , with the fleet anchored all the way to the horizon , in order to intimidate those who were not seen as compliant enough .
These displays of overwhelming military force must surely ranks amongst history ’s most spectacular moments .
The biggest wooden boats in history
Just how big the largest of Zheng
He ’s sailing ships were , is a matter of debate .
Until a recent archeological find , these large warships had only ever been described , and were not captured in paintings .
There has been much postulation on the size of the biggest ships , with some believing there were mega - treasure ships as long as 600 feet , while others pointing out a wooden boat of such size was a physical impossibility .
Had such boats existed in 1421 , they would have been more than twice the size of anything that existed in Europe at the time , and bigger than any known wooden boat in history , to this present day .
Then came a chance finding in 1962 , within sight of the Ming naval shipyards in Nanking .
Peasants unearthed a rudder - post some 36.2 feet long and 1.25 feet in diameter believed to be from one of the giant ships .
Using these measurements , naval architects estimate that the rudder attached to the post was nearly half its length in height and breadth , or 452 square feet of wood .
The ship to which such a rudder belonged , following the rules of thumb for Chinese ship construction , would be at least 400 feet long .
One rudder does not a treasure ship make , but when archeologists excavating the same Ming naval shipyards in 2004 found another two rudder - posts the same size , we get a tantalizing hint of what could have existed at the time - a navy of gigantic ships that outweighed , out - gunned and out - classed anything afloat in 1420 and was arguably as dominant as the U.S Fleet is today .
As we often find when researching a story for Gizmag these days , “ there ’s so much more to find out about this ” .
Clearly we have seen some magnificent sailing ships throughout history that are not yet fully documented , much less understood .
The rise and fall and rise of sailpower
Human exploitation of the wind has known many forms , and sailpower has been one humanity ’s key enabling technologies from about 5500 years ago , until it became temporarily irrelevant 100 years ago – the importance of reliable delivery for the world ’s growing trade meant that the more reliable power of diesel engines now carries nearly all of the world ’s trade .
Now , because the world has suddenly realized that it is choking on its own excrement , the impeccable environmental credentials of sailpower has it very much back in vogue .
Sailpower is free and leaves no noxious residues , as opposed to most diesel - powered ships which consume an obscene amount of resources and excesses .
Shipping ’s willingness to dump its prodigious waste into what has always seemed an endless supply of wilderness contributes a disproportionately large percentage of the world ’s toxic emmisions .
The time is fast approaching when the global public will cry out against the environmental atrocities of the shipping industry .
In exactly the same way that the rest of industry has had to begin adapting its consumption habits and act responsibly within its urban and industrial environment , seafarers will also need to act far more responsibly than they have until now .
The environmental atrocities of the maritime industry
Consider these figures for a moment , which we sourced from DK Technologies .
In round numbers the worlds 90,000 vessel shipping fleet burns 370 million tons of fuel per year , which in turn emit 20 million tons of SOx per year , many times that of the world ’s 750 million cars .
Shipping is still the most deregulated industry in the world .
Roughly one third of the world ’s cargo fleet is registered under open registries .
Many of the countries that operate these registries do not or are unable to ensure compliance with even the basic standards defined by the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) and the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) .
Shipping companies register their ships in countries where they do not reside to take advantage of low registration fees and taxes , as well as low labor , environmental and security standards .
This low - standard competition keeps costs down by externalizing them , but is doing the world an enormous disservice in the face of global warming .
Beginning in 1990 the Sulphur in diesel fuel for cars has been steadily and drastically reduced from 5000 PPM to 50 PPM now with a further reduction to 10 PPM from 2009 .
In the same period the shipping industry has n’t done much at all , and remains by far the biggest transport polluter in the world with nothing planned to dramatically change things .
While we strongly believe it ’s just a matter of time before the world ’s public brings the shipping industry to account , what are the alternatives to diesel ?
Whilst the potential to reduce emissions from the existing diesel might slow things , sail power offers the most potential to dramatically reduce the maritime industry ’s environmental footprint .
Given its magnitude , swapping from diesel to sail power has the potential to wrestle back the initiative in making our environment sustainable for our children .
Advanced sailing technologies are only beginning to be explored but the future of intelligent sailing systems controlled by a joystick with efficient use of energy sourced entirely from the elements is already taking shape .
Take a browse through the world ’s most advanced builder of high tech , low - touch motor and sail yachts Wally , and you ’ll see elegance and function and advanced design .
Likewise new thinking is creeping in to every form of sailing endeavour , such as the Wot Rocket currently undergoing testing for an attempt on the world speed record for sailboats .
The Wot Rocket - supercavitation
The project is being funded by Wotif internet travel site founder Graeme Wood and is the brainchild of former - world 18 ft sailing champion Sean Langman .
The Wot Rocket is part sailing craft and part sailing plane and it is as unconventional a sailing boat as you ’ll ever see .
It also looks to be capable of knocking off the current world sailing speed record , which has been the exclusive property of French sailboarders such as Finian Maynard and more recently Antoine Albeau in recent times .
The current world speed sailing record is 49.09 knots ( 90.9 kilometres per hour ) while Langham is hoping to exceed 50 knots with the 40 - ft canoe style hull .
It ’s all controlled with two tiny foils and a nine metre rigid sail , with an aerofoil leading to the aerodynamic pod for the crew who wear wetsuits and oxygen masks .
The pilot controls the direction and the power of the wing , and the co-pilot runs the foils .
As the boat gathers speed , parts fall off to reduce drag .
The aim is to induce supercavitation at low speeds , allowing Wot Rocket to fly in a gas bubble created by the outward deflection of water by a specially shaped nose cone and the expansion of gases from its fin and foil design .
By keeping water from contacting the surface of the body of Wot Rocket , this will significantly reduce drag and allow extremely high speeds .
High tech offers higher speeds
One of the areas where we have seen massive development in sailing technology in recent times is in the areas of maxiyachts and long distance speed attempt sailing boats .
Both areas have leveraged sponsorship and media profile to provide the necessary development funds .
Take a look at the incredible Orange II , which continues to set distance records and the remarkable performance of canting - keel supermaxi Alfa Romeo in its debut year .

With new thinking of this ilk beginning to influence the directions of sail , and a genie - like array of new sensors , processing - power and advanced motors and batteries at our disposal , it ’s worth thinking about what might be possible .
Sailing in the year 2025
One of the most thought - provoking concepts we ’ve ever witnessed on Gizmag is BRP ’s Invitation Sailing Concept .
It ’s what happens when you apply new thinking to old ways .
Firstly , Bombardier Recreational Products ( BRP ) is a spin - out from the Bombardier Industrial conglomerate that makes planes and trains and it was created as an entity to develop and make recreational products and its mission statement is quite clear - ' to bring you the most exciting and innovative recreational experience possible . '
It has already pioneered several major recreational markets such as the snowmobile and Personal Water Craft and owns the lion ’s share in both global markets , and occasionally , its concepts , such as the monowheel Embrio concept , are conceptually breathtaking and a good bet for future production a decade or two from now .
Back in 2001 , the design team at BRP was asked to visualise the sailboat of the year in 2025 .
Given the resources of the think tank of idea - driven company specialising in designing and manufacturing recreational products of almost every conceivable ilk ( snowmobiles , jet skis , speedboats , inboard and outboard marine motors , go - karts , motorcycle and aircraft engines , high tech clothing , helmets , all terrain vehicles ad infinitum ) , they produced a remarkable concept .
Bearing in mind that 2025 was more than two decades away , many new technologies would be expected to become available for the ' Invitation ' by then .
The brief BRP statement on the Invitation 's feature set reads in part : ' Interface would be with artificial intelligence providing behaviours that would adapt to the users ' personality and skill . '
BRP also envisions the operation of the ' Invitation ' will be ' similar to riding a horse , ' in that ' subtle ( changes to ) body language ' will control the boat 's direction , steering and attitude ' more than operations related to conventional boating . '
Artificial intelligence will progress significantly over the next two decades so BRP envisions a sailboat which sails in the same way a fighter aircraft flies - the pilot 's fly - by - wire controls tell the plane what to do , and the massive computing power takes over and does the rest .
By 2025 , given that Moore 's Law has become a self - fulfilling prophecy which no company is prepared to transgress , we can confidently expect this sailboat will have far more computing power available than anything currently in the sky , even if it has a NASA badge on it .
Not only will it be powerful , it will be incredibly cheap because the microprocessor will by then be offering a cost - performance we can scarcely imagine right now .
Similarly , the sail adjustments to capture the wind which are today done with strength and balance on a small sailing boat or wind - surfer will be done electronically by then , with gyroscopic balance .
Given the rate of progress of fuel - cell design and mass manufacture , and that most of the world 's automobiles will be electrically - or fuel - cell powered by 2025 , the power supply for the advanced electric motors which trim and adjust the sails will again be cheap , with high power - density and abundant power .
The ' Invitation ' was also conceived to have ' behaviors that would adapt to the users ' personality and skill ' , indicating that the skill levels will auto adjust , much the same way a computer game has skills levels , with the machine able to sense the capabilities of the rider in the same way that a good riding school horse compensates for the learner and stretches its legs for the intermediate rider .
Responsiveness and sensitivity to the balance of the rider are just a few of the characteristsics we can expect here .
In all it looks like the future of sailing might actually be available to everyone , as the intelligent sailboard will adapt an interpret sailor behaviours to enable the learner to forgo the long and painful learning process .
It 's sure to be a bugbear for all those who spent long hours learning their sailing craft , but it will make sailing available to everyone – perhaps not in its purest form , but pretty close and without several decades of tuition .
What else is known about the Invitation concept can be found here .
And at the bleeding edge of this automated design , imagine the Formula One sailing races , with perhaps a weight and dimensions limit and the need to use the wind for motive power .
What types of cleverness could be brought to bear on such craft , and how different would they be to the Wot Rocket ?
And with the availability of a new array of maritime control mechanisms and electrically powered retractable motors , large transport and cruise ships can and should be cost - efficient and environmentally friendly .
Wind is free .
We know it works .
Surely we should employ it immediately so we can minimize the damage we are doing to our marine environment .
The promise of Kite Sails
Indeed , with modern technology , it may indeed be possible to extract the energy from far more wind than we thought was out there .
One fascinating area of development with enormous potential is in the area of high - tech kite sails that generate even propulsion power than conventional sails .
The Kite For Sail project in Hawaii that utilizes kite - sail technology to harness higher atmospheric winds than afforded to conventional sail configurations .
They initially fitted a kite - system to a Hobie Catamaran test boat , and developed many prototypes culminating in the current F24 Corsair trimaran .
The 18 - meter kite system provides the power most of the time , but the trimaran ’s engine is still used in light winds and to manoeuvre the vessel into launch and docking position .
A recent trial saw the vessel achieve between 7 to 10 knot boat speed without the use of the engine in 4 to 8 foot wind swell and winds of between 15 and 20 knots with four crew aboard and trolling two lines .
Quite clearly such a system could be retrofitted to and significantly supplement the propulsion systems of all kinds of cargo vessels and in the process generate economic benefit , reduce reliance on fossil fuels and reduce emissions in a sector that has become one of the world ’s biggest polluters .
In Europe , Hamburg - based SkySails has already begun testing its towing kite propulsion system with a view to integrating it to regular shipping operations .
The 132 m long Multi Purpose Heavy Lift Carrier MS " Beluga SkySails " sailed from Bremen to Venezuela in January equipped with 160m2 SkySails supporting the main engine .
The sails can supply around five tons of tractive force at low wind .
SkySails expects the system to reduce fuel costs by between 10 and 35 % , depending on the prevailing wind conditions , with temporary cuts of 50 % achievable in optimal wind conditions .
The first results are to be expected in the next few months .
The impact of International Trade
International trade relied on sailpower until a century ago and 5400 years of development faltered when environmentally responsible steam and not - so - environmentally sustainable oil were used to generate the 100 % reliable motive forces that commerce required , and sail has had precious little development funding since .
For the last century , much of the focus in developing more efficient international transport for travel and trade has focused on the aeroplane .
One hundred years ago , both sailboats and aeroplanes were largely constructed from canvas and wood , control was enabled by ropes and cables and then … aircraft rapidly evolved into composite , high tech , computer - controlled projectiles and sailing ships languished far behind , starved of funding to keep pace with the change .
Sailing became a high cost leisure activity while jet aircraft served the bleeding edge delivery of almost every non-digital commercial activity .
The maritime industry still carries almost all international trade – 90 percent of goods by volume that are traded across a border are moved by sea .
In 2004 , UNCTAD estimated global freight costs at US$ 380 billion – a surprisingly small 5.4 percent of the total value of global imports .
Perhaps it is time to raise those prices and do things in an environmentally responsible manner .
“ If you want to see how far we have n’t come in the marine industry , take a look at the aeronautical industry of 100 years ago and now , ” says Sifrer .
“ In the beginning , aircraft had canvas wings strengthened by wooden profiles and were connected by wires , then they added another wing and another !
After WWI , industry and aero technology was progressing a century per decade using new materials and construction .
Technology solved problems and enabled regular quantum leaps of performance and reliability .
“ Aerospace became the place where new technology was first applied – pilot information systems , computer - controlled everything , pressurised cabins , wonderous new powerplants .
From wings made of canvas , wire and wood and engines barely able to lift the plane off the ground , aircraft now have one - piece carbon wings packed with computers and jet engines flying on the edge of the earth ’s atmosphere at double the speed of the sound . ”
“ Yacht design , by comparison , has progressed very little .
With a few exceptions , the industry has stagnated .
Why ?
Because of conservative thinking of leading groups , different restricted offshore rules and lack of good marketing of new ideas .
“ That was the reason we decided to create a really new yacht design concept !
To push the boundaries .
Everything started with my master ’s degree in which I was trying to search for the new future guidelines of yacht design and construction , especially in sail boats and try to find the vision of nautical trends and movement . ”
The SY120 and why it is special
The object of Sifrer ’s degree became a 36 m futurist carbon super yacht , which he named the SY 120 , a completely new design concept and solutions for basic sailboat elements .
The research for the project took him four years and the degree project earned him both educational and industry acclaim in yacht magazines world wide .
What set the SY120 apart from everything before it , was its wholistic approach to sailing and the use of automated adjustments .
From Wikipedia ’s excellent resource on the physics of sailing : “ The energy that drives a sailboat is harnessed by manipulating the relative movement of wind and water speed : if there is no difference in movement , such as on a calm day or when the wind and water current are moving in the same direction , there is no energy to be extracted and the sailboat will not be able to do anything but drift .
Where there is a difference in motion , then there is energy to be extracted at the interface , and the sailboat does this by placing the sail (s ) in the air and the hull (s ) in the water .
Sails are airfoils that work by using an airflow set up by the wind and the motion of the boat .
The combination of the two is the apparent wind , which is the relative velocity of the wind relative to the boat 's motion .
The sails generate lift using the air that flows around them .
The air flowing at the sail surface is not the true wind . [ 3 ]
The sail alone is not sufficient to drive the boat in any desired direction , as a sail by itself would only push a boat in the same direction as the wind .
Sailboats overcome this by having another physical object below the water line .
These include , a keel , centerboard , or some other form of underwater foil or even the hull itself ( as in catamarans without centreboard or in a traditional proa ) .
Thus , the physical portion of the boat which is below water can be regarded as functioning as a " second sail " .
Having two surfaces against the wind and water enables the sailor to travel in almost any direction and to generate an additional source of lift from the water .
The under - water area of SY 120 is composed of two keels with inner volume and high density ballast .
The keels are attached at angle of 30 degrees to the sides of the transversal hull structure .
One keel has two blades with two pipes inside , attached with inner volume at the bottom and connected with a pump to the other side .
The pump pushes ballast from one volume to another through one of the pipes , according to the angle of lean .
Computers control the amount of ballast in the volumes .
The SY 120 rigging is an aero sail , stretched and rotated between two masts , attached to the side edges of the deck .
The aero sail is composed of a fixed front edge with the sail sliding verticality and towards the boom , where it is rolled .
The sail is trimmed ( rolled ) with a shaft , located in the boom , with the furling system attached perpendicularly to the shaft .
Such a sail enables simple , single - handed steering of a sailboat with the help of custom computer systems .
Sailing boats require a lot of human effort to adjust their settings because weather and wind conditions change so frequently that they consume all of the resources available to sail one properly .
Sailing a big boat requires a rugby team of well - trained sailors .
“ You need 20 athletes to set the sails on a 30 metre sail boat , ” says Sifrer , “ using dozens of ropes , pulleys , winches , trackers and different types of deck gear . ”
Automation and robotic technologies have been evolving rapidly over the last few decades , and are about to replace the aforementioned rugby team , and the time - honoured traditions which transported people and cargoes safely for the last 600 years are about to come under challenge from a new generation of sailing ship , and Sifrer is at the forefront of thinking on where it ’s going .
Designer Erik Sifrer believes sailing technology has progressed very little in the last 250 years , pointing out that a conventional sail boat uses sails only 2 % of the time and he believes that by automating and continuously changing the settings of the sails , it can continually optimize the energy it captures from the wind and tide .
His design concept for Project Green Jet is to make better and more efficient use of the forces of nature .
How to tap the energy of the wind more efficiently
“ Wind offers an endless supply of clean energy , so the question is primarily , how can we tap this energy resource more efficiently , and what could the new rig look like in the future ?
So I started where my last project finished , with a model of the SY 120 , then extended and improved it , made it more spectacular and we have just presented it to the public at Dubai International Boat Show 2008under sponsorship of Mides Engineering and Mides - design . "
“ The Green Jet Project is an evolution of the SY120 concept .
We wish to continue presenting new technologies and designs and a new vision of what a sail yacht can be and Green Jet is the next step in putting those thoughts in the water . ”
There ’s little doubt that the astonishingly beautiful Maltese Falcon is the current torch holder of this concept of automated , intelligent sailing , but Sifrer ’s concepts go well beyond the Maltese Falcon ’s capabilities in automating the trimming of the sails .
“ I incorporated the word “ jet ” in the title of the boat specifically because it is a jet whist setting up and trimming the sails , meaning it is both fast and easy , ” Sifrer says , who aims to utilize computerized automated systems and touch screen interfaces so that one person can do the job of a team of sailors .
Hydraulic motors will pull the sail to its 55 metre height ( top of the rig is 62 m ) in around 30 to 40 seconds and each sail can rotate through 160 degrees on a pivot point to best catch the wind .
Navigation is touch - screen and simple , though the system that sails the boat is far from that , not to mention monitoring an array of weather information systems .
So how close is this concept to reality ?
It appears to us to be much closer than most concepts this far out of the square .
The basic calculations for Green Jet have already done by Marin and interior design will be finished in Art Line Interior Design from Netherlands .
“ The concept is completely new and of course it needs to be put into the wind tunnel for testing and tank testing and later applied to scale model , but as we know , nowadays everything is possible ! , ” says Sifrer .
Sifrer is seeking backers so he can get ships in the water and further his science .
His web site can be found here .
He can be contacted here .
“ We are in marketing phase which includes searching for potential investors .
That kind of vessel could be built by German , Italian , New Zealand or Netherlands shipyards and we ’re seeking interest so we can explain what ’s possible .
Because we are developing new systems the cost of Green Jet will probably exceed 70 million euro and it will take from 3 - 6 years .
From there it gets easier as we understand how things will work to their optimum .
“ We are very young team with what I believe is a great vision , ” who gained a lot of experience working for Seaway creating tooling and design for Bavaria , Jeanneau , Grand Soleil , Shipman carbon yachts ...
Sailing is the art of controlling a sailing vessel .
It would seem that at some point in the next decade or so , we ’ll see a vast sailing ship under the control of just one person .
Perhaps one day even as reliable as a car , it ’s onboard systems having long since mastered the incredibly complex art of sailing and with full knowledge of approaching weather and sea conditions .

If you do n’t get it , this might help explain the joke .
BioWare’s
Yesterday ’s scourging of EA ’s clumsy falsehoods led us back to the old discussion about software piracy being “ theft ” .
I think the closest analogy of piracy is the one Bruce offered in the comments :
It ’s like sneaking into a movie .
Sure , it ’s not “ hurting ” anyone – nobody becomes poorer by virtue of your viewing of the movie – and you are not depriving anyone else of the product .
( We must assume the theater is infinite in size and all the seats offer the same view for this analogy to work . )
But most people recognize that sneaking in is still wrong .
In the case we ’re dealing with , so many people are sneaking in the fire exit that there is a certain herd comfort to the act .
After all , “ everyone else is doing it and we ’re not hurting anyone . ”
The sense of scandal is gone .
To combat this , the theater owner first began hassling everyone as they came into the theater to make sure they had tickets .
This was a mild annoyance , but had no impact on people coming in through the fire exit .
When that plan failed , they began frisking customers as they came in .
This was very annoying and insulting , and many people would n’t stand for it .
Some people have quit going to the movies outright .
Some people buy tickets , run outside , and come in the back way along with all of the leeches to avoid the invasion of their privacy .
Some people sneak in and claim they will pay for a ticket on the way out if they liked the movie .
Some of them even mean it and occasionally do so .
Some people sneak in , but rarely stay to the end .
They usually leave halfway through , often to sneak into some other movie .
They enjoy the thrill of jumping the fence and getting in more than they enjoy movies .
If the movie was free , they would n’t bother seeing it at all .
Some of the people sneaking in do so because they are broke and ca n’t afford to buy a ticket .
( Some of these would very probably find a way to pay for a ticket if they found they could no longer use the fire door . )
Since realizing the great influx of people into the theater through the fire door , the theater managers have gone nuts .
Now they have a new policy every week .
Strip searches .
Restrictions on what you can wear .
Restrictions on where you can sit .
You can no longer buy a ticket for a friend .
Usually you have to pay for a ticket before you can find out what they ’re going to do to you before they let you in , and you ca n’t get a refund if you refuse .
They try to boot out people who do n’t have tickets , but those people people loop right around and come back inside , like mice .
Sometimes they accidentally boot out a paying customer .
Some of those people just sneak back in , but some storm off and vow never to set foot in the theater again .
Now , we know that the number of people sneaking in is greater than the number who buy tickets , but beyond that we have no way of knowing what things would look like if everyone was honest .
The portion of the audience that came in the back door is – depending on who you ask – somewhere between 50 % and 90 % .
But we do n’t know how many people sneaking in actually bought a ticket , we do n’t know how many people would buy a ticket if they had to , and we do n’t know how many people are refusing to go to the theaters at all because of the hassle at the entrance .
The only number we do know for sure is how many tickets are sold , and it ’s not possible to derive any of the other values from that number .
People try , but it ’s all guesswork .
The theater owners act like everyone who comes in the back is a leech .
Making matters worse is the fact that theater owners wo n’t share notes with each other , so they have no way of telling if any of their absurd policies is having any impact on the problem .
I ’ve spent a lot of time hammering away at the companies that have implemented these ruinous and insidious copy prevention measures .
Perhaps I ’ve made it seem like I ’m on the side of the pirates .
Just to make it clear that I ’m not sailing under the jolly roger :
In my own view , piracy is wrong .
It ’s wrong even when the people making and selling the game are senseless , self - destructive fools .
It ’s wrong even if the game sucks .
It ’s wrong if you ’re broke .
It ’s wrong even if “ you were n’t going to buy it anyway . ”
It ’s wrong and I do n’t do it , ever .
It is not my intention to preach at pirates and get them to change their habits .
I ’m not anyone ’s mum , and it ’s not my place to tell people how to act .
I actually think that having lots of people repent of piracy right now would be horrible .
The managers would conclude their monstrous policies were working , and we ’d get a double helping of the same , forever after , in every game they put out .
I do n’t delete comments from people who talk about pirating a game , because I value frank ( yet polite ) honesty in this discussion .
I do n’t encourage people to give money to EA or 2 k Games because those companies do n’t deserve even the modest measure of help I might be able to give them .
I wo n’t give them my money , so I ’m not about to suggest other people give them theirs .
Everyone has to work out for themselves how they want to behave in all this .
I ’ve had my say on what I think the solution is .
Which brings me to the only weapon I have at my disposal : I vote with my dollars every chance I get .
I ’ve forsworn BioShock , Mass Effect , Spore , and other big - name titles because of the contempt they show for honest people .
I buy stuff from Stardock , even if the game is n’t really my cup of tea .
To wit :
My interest in Sins of a Solar Empire was minuscule compared to any of the games I mentioned above , and it cost more .
( $ 60 Collector ’s Edition .
Ow . )
Stardock got me to pay more for a game I wanted less , and all they had to do was treat me like a customer instead of an enemy .
Yes , this is a long sermon , once again directed to the choir .
If I knew how to reach the ones responsible , I would do so .
Yes , that 's Mini - Me Verne Troyer in a sex tape shot with his former live - in girlfriend at the couple 's apartment .
A third party has snatched up the tape and although no deal has been made , we hear dealer Kevin Blatt , who brokered the deal for Paris ' video , is entertaining a $ 100 k offer from SugarDVD to distribute the nastiness .
We would have thought the tape was worth at least ONE BILLION DOLLARS .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Arctic and Antarctica are poles apart when it comes to the effects of human - fueled climate change , scientists said on Friday : in the north , it is melting sea ice , but in the south , it powers winds that chill things down .
This undated handout image released to Reuters shows an Antarctica ice edge , the line between open water and sea ice , May 2 , 2008 .
REUTERS / British Antarctic Survey / Handout
The North and South poles are both subject to solar radiation and rising levels of climate - warming greenhouse gases , the researchers said in a telephone briefing .
But Antarctica is also affected by an ozone hole hovering high above it during the austral summer .
“ All the evidence points toward human - made effects playing a major role in the changes that we see at both poles and evidence that contradicts this is very hard to find , ” said Jennifer Francis , an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
An examination of many previous studies about polar climate , to be published May 6 in the journal Eos , “ further depletes the arsenal of those who insist that human - caused climate change is nothing to worry about , ” Francis said in a telephone briefing .
In the Arctic , Francis and co-authors of the research said , warming spurred by human - generated carbon dioxide emissions has combined with natural climate variations to create a “ perfect Arctic storm ” that caused a dramatic disappearance of sea ice last year , a trend likely to continue .
‘ NEW STATE ’
“ Natural climate variability and global warming were actually working together and they ’ve sent the Arctic into a new state for the climate that has much less sea ice , ” said James Overland , an oceanographer at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
“ There ’s very little chance for the climate to return to the conditions of 20 years ago . ”
In Antarctica , the ozone hole adds a new factor to an already complicated set of weather patterns , according to Gareth Marshall of the British Antarctic Survey .
The changes in air pressure that go along with depleted stratospheric ozone are responsible for an increase in the westerly winds that whip around the Southern Ocean , at latitudes a bit north of most of Antarctica .
These winds isolate much of the southern continent from some of the impact of global warming , Marshall said .
The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula , which reaches northward toward South America .
There , the effects of warming have been dramatic , he said , because the winds that protect the rest of Antarctica do not insulate the peninsula .
The stratospheric ozone hole , caused by the ozone - depleting release of chemicals found in refrigerants and hair sprays , is likely to fully recover by 2070 as less of these chemicals are in use , as a result of international agreements .
The ozone layer shields Earth from harmful solar radiation , but its recovery is likely to open the way for warming in central Antarctica , the scientists said .
Two different lives - same looming crisis .
Damien Core , 20 , is a student from Kent , studying biology .
Lisa Rice , 22 , works for a technology company in Yorkshire and has done since leaving school .
Damien plays in an indie band , drinks at the student union and has a steady girlfriend .
Lisa is single , likes to go clubbing and spends her Saturdays in Leeds , shopping with mates .
Last month both faced the same problem : they 'd been bouncing their increasing debts from one zero per cent credit card offer to the next .
In April , the credit crunch hit home .
No zero per cent offers came through the door .
Suddenly , each had to start paying interest on debts that had been growing for years .
With their income spent on rent , bills and food , neither had spare money to meet the credit card companies ' demands .
Damien and Lisa are far from alone .
According to a YouGov survey commissioned by the charity Rainer and published in May , 90 per cent of the 4,000 young people polled were in debt by the age of 21 .
Almost half of the 18 - to 24 - year - olds have owed more than £ 2,000 and one in five have owed more than £ 10,000 .
One in five young people said they were left with less than £ 50 per month after bills and debt repayments .
One in ten were left with nothing .
Some use loan sharks to fund pub crawls and new clothes .
Although student loans formed a significant part of higher debt levels , credit cards , store cards and catalogues were widely used .
Unlike their parents , this generation has been borrowing heavily for the past five or six years simply to finance everyday expenses .
While tabloid headlines scream about the effect the credit crunch is having on mortgage owners , many of these young people find themselves blacklisted before their lives have really begun .
" There used to be a sort of social stigma attached to being heavily in debt , " explains David Chater , head of policy for Rainer .
" In the past five years I 've seen that stigma vanish .
Young people are sold the idea of borrowing so heavily these days - on TV , online , on the high street and even by their mates - that they think nothing of it .
In part , student loans are to blame .
Students themselves think : ' I owe so much , what does another grand matter ? '
Even those who are not in higher education know someone who is , so they see the £ 2,000 they owe as nothing compared to their mate or cousin . "
Linda Jack , youth adviser and head of the Financial Services Authority 's working group on young adults , reinforces this : " I 've worked with youth for over 20 years and I 've seen young people 's attitudes change more and more into passive consumerism - I want it , I want it now and I can get it now .
" The link between effort and reward has disturbingly been lost for a lot of young people .
Trying to get through to them that if you put the effort in and save , you have that sense of achievement , as opposed to paying more for it in the long run by putting it on your credit card because you wanted it now . . .
There is a cultural issue here : we have changed culturally in terms of expectations . "
Rainer , which works with socially excluded young people such as those who are dependent on benefits , are homeless or are otherwise struggling to get by , warns that the hardest - hit are , inevitably , the poorest .
Two - thirds of the young people it works with are in debt - rising to 83 per cent among those living in supported hostels .
" I suppose you 'd call this the sub - prime market , " Chater says .
" They would n't have been able to borrow such large sums a few years ago , but now you have stores and loans with cripplingly high interest rates which are prepared to lend money with no credit checks or proof of employment .
Often we find kids who 've had to borrow from their mum or dad to cover loan payments , then having huge rows within their family over these supposedly friendly loans .
When you think that it 's family conflict that causes most teenage homelessness , this is literally driving young people on to the streets . "
And yet the inability to recognise the downside of borrowing is n't restricted to any single social class .
" With this age group it 's almost as if a white mist descends when you start talking to them about things like APR , " says Neil Almond at the youth charity Kikass .
" I 've even talked to kids who think that the higher the APR , the better the deal .
This is the most internet - savvy , clued - in generation when it comes to online , but none of them have online bank accounts .
It 's as if there 's a missing part of their profile where money and debt is concerned .
These are smart kids .
They know that they do n't know , and they literally do n't want to know . "
The New Statesman conducted a straw poll of 18 - to 24 - year - olds to test Almond 's thesis and found it depressingly accurate .
" I despair at how much attention my dad pays to these things , because it 's very dull to me , " grumbles Phil Teach , a 24 - year - old from London .
" He keeps saying you should take your money out of here , or watch out for that .
I 'm like ' OK , Dad , can you sort it for me ? '
It 's a hassle when you have n't got time . "
" The thing is , if I lived on the money that I got from my job , I would n't even be able to go out , " explains Jim Davis from Carlisle .
" I 'm 22 years old and I should be having fun .
If someone wants to lend me money to do that , why should n't I ? "
Sense of entitlement
The research company Synovate surveyed 18 - to 24 - year - olds ' attitudes to debt and money at the end of 2007 and found a generation used to easily available credit , with a live - for - the - moment attitude and the belief that money is to be spent for pleasure .
" The majority of 18 - 24s spend automatically and frequently , fuelled by a sense of entitlement to their standard of living , " explains Becky Connell , who conducted the research .
" The problem is that social and peer group pressure makes it harder for young people to curb spending .
As well as the cheap credit and glossy lifestyles marketed to them by a celebrity - dominated culture , there is the feeling of being ' left out ' if you miss even one night out .
So something as simple as socialising is driven by compulsion as well as enthusiasm . "
Disturbingly , Connell describes a conversation between a group of twentysomethings in Leeds who were considering taking out loans to pay for plastic surgery .
One 24 - year - old had borrowed to fund his wife 's " boob job " and another was considering liposuction , while Amanda , 23 , told the startled interviewer : " You can get plastic surgery on credit ; you can pay monthly for it now .
With Transform you can get liposuction for £ 60 a month .
When I saw that I was like , ' Ooohh ' . "
" You have so many kids who want to look like Jordan and Peter or Posh and Becks , " warns Jasmine Birtles , author of The Money Book : Control Your Money , Control Your Life .
" They take store cards to buy the clothes they see in magazines , they spend on sunbeds and cosmetic surgery and they 're constantly opening up new credit cards to pay off the old ones .
There 's simply no sense of the debt that 's gradually being accrued .
It 's as if this is just free money . "
And there is little sense of the future offering any great threat : " There was a recent survey that suggested young people are n't saving for a pension because they 're relying on buying a property and hoping that the value of the property will rise , " explains Andrew Oxlade , editor of the financial web - site www.thisismoney.co.uk.
" Inflation paid off their parents ' mortgages , but we are in a low - inflation environment .
Not only do we have bigger debts , we also have this economic kick in the teeth that you have to pay off every bean yourself . "
With unemployment rising for the third month in a row in April and Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England , warning that the full effects of banks ' credit problems have yet to reach the consumer , this may prove to be the first recession that hits the young - a group that usually survives tough times because its salaries are as low as its expenditure .
Birtles has already encountered students who are considering declaring themselves bankrupt the moment they graduate .
" That can mean they will be unable to get a mortgage or even a current account years later , " she warns .
" The only kids from this generation who have absolutely nothing to worry about are those with very rich parents who do n't mind paying off everything their children owe .
For the others , I shudder to think how they 're going to cope over the next 12 months .
The banks are tightening things because they 've lent money to the wrong people , so they 're going to face very hard times indeed . "
According to Chater : “ There are already 1.5 million 18 - to 24 - year - olds in poverty in England and Wales .
Initiatives such as the working tax credits have helped families and children but , by design , have had little impact on this age group .
Fuel poverty measures have understandably targeted older people but rising fuel prices also appear to be having a significant impact on young adults living independently for the first time .
This group falls between policy agendas : too old for initiatives targeting under - 18s and unaffected by those for parents . ”
Ignored by the government , seduced with cheap credit into taking on debt , and facing the same price inflation as higher - earning late - twentysomethings and thirtysomethings , an entire generation of Britons runs the real risk that bad debts could write it off – young , gifted and broke .

Limbaugh " dreams " of violence on par with that in Chicago in 1968 .
It simply was not enough for neocon radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh to call for Republicans to vote for Hillary , supposedly as a hedge against Barack Obama .
Now he is calling for riots in Denver during the DNC .
ABC News in Denver reports :
Talk show host Rush Limbaugh is sparking controversy again after he made comments calling for riots in Denver during the Democratic National Convention this summer .
He said the riots would ensure a Democrat is not elected as president , and his listeners have a responsibility to make sure it happens .
“ Riots in Denver , the Democrat Convention would see to it that we do n’t elect Democrats , ” Limbaugh said during Wednesday ’s radio broadcast .
He then went on to say that ’s the best thing that could happen to the country .
In normal , non-Bushzarro times , Limbaugh would be arrested for inciting terrorism .
But instead we live in times horrifically misshapen by a neocon reality — a reality of mass murder , torture of children , and the wholesale trashing of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
After sane listeners — and I am not sure how regular listeners of Limbaugh ’s show would be considered sane — called and complained about his comments , Limbaugh said : “ I am not inspiring or inciting riots , I am dreaming of riots in Denver . ”
It would seem Mr. Limbaugh has shared notes with “ Re- create 68 , ” the COINTELPRO group that has vowed to make the convention in Denver more raucous and bloody than the Democratic Convention in Chicago , circa 1968 .
According to the Rocky Mountain News , the intel op masquerading as a grassroots activist group “ is expecting up to 50,000 protesters from across the country [ and ] plans to march from Civic Center to the Pepsi Center , where the convention will be held , on Aug. 24 , even though a parade route or a security zone has n’t been announced . ”
Is it possible Limbaugh will be with them ?
Rush Limbaugh needs to be arrested as a threat to the peace .
I ’m not holding my breath , however , as neocons seem to have a get out jail free card and rabble - rousers such as Limbaugh and Savage are free to call for the most outrageous things , including violence and mass arrest of dissidents for the crime of exercising their rights under the First Amendment , now almost completely dead in the water .

Neurologically impaired mice improve after receiving human stem cells
Scientists report a dramatic success in what may be the first documented rescue of a congenital brain disorder by transplantation of human neural stem cells .
The research , published by Cell Press in the June issue of the journal Cell Stem Cell , may lead the way to new strategies for treating certain hereditary and perinatal neurological disorders .
Nerve cell projections are ensheathed by a fatty substance called myelin that is produced by oligodendrocytes , a type non-nerve cell in the brain and spinal cord .
Myelin enhances the speed and coordination of the electrical signals by which nerve cells communicate with one another .
When myelin is missing or damaged , electrical signals are not properly transmitted .
Previous studies have explored the potential utility of cell transplantation for restoring absent or lost myelination to diseased nerve fibers .
Much of this research has made use of the ‘ shiverer mouse ’ animal model which lacks normal myelin and typically dies within months of birth .
Yet to date , no transplantation of human neural stem cells or of their derivatives , called glial progenitor cells , have ever altered the condition or fate of recipient animals .
Dr. Steve Goldman and colleagues from the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center , along with collaborators at Cornell , UCLA and Baylor , built on this earlier work by devising a more robust method for the acquisition and purification of human fetal glial progenitor cells .
In addition , they developed a new cell delivery strategy , based on multiple injection sites , to encourage widespread and dense donor cell engraftment throughout the central nervous system of recipient mice .
The researchers transplanted human glial stem cells into neonatal shiverer mice that also had a genetically deficient immune system .
Immunodeficient mice were used to minimize the rejection of the transplanted cells .
The researchers found that the new transplant procedure resulted in infiltration of human glial progenitor cells throughout the brain and spinal cord .
The engrafted mice exhibited robust , efficient and functional myelination .
Most notably , many of the mice displayed progressive , neurological improvement and a fraction of the mice were actually rescued by the procedure .
“ The neurological recovery and survival of the mice receiving transplants was in sharp contrast to the fate of their untreated controls , which uniformly died by five months , ” explains Dr. Goldman .
Upon histological examination well over a year after the procedure , the white matter of the surviving mice had been essentially re-myelinated by human cells .
“ To our knowledge , these data represent the first outright rescue of a congenital hypomyelinating disorder by means of stem or progenitor cell transplantation , ” offers Dr. Goldman .
“ Although much work needs to be done to maximize the number of individuals that respond to transplantation , I think that these findings hold great promise for the potential of stem cell - based treatment in a wide range of hereditary and ischemic myelin disorders in both children and adults . ”

Show me the Monet ...
Impressionist 's water lilies go for record £ 40 m
The most important ( and the largest ) of Monet 's Waterlilies ever sold made an astonishing £ 40.1 million at Christies in London last night - a record price for the artist and , in the art market 's main currency of dollars , a record for any Impressionist picture .
Art 's miracle in 2008 of climbing ever higher into the sky while the real economy crumbles on the ground saw no fewer than 11 bidders join in the Monet scramble last night .
" Twelve million pounds to start it ! " cried Christopher Burge , the auctioneer and chairman of Christie 's America who had been specially flown in from New York to sell this 1919 Waterlilies and 15 other pictures and sculptures owned by diesel billionaire J. Irwin Miller of Columbus , Indiana .
Going once : A packed Christies sale room looks on as telephone bidders vie for the painting
Mr Burge was greeted by an unprecedented long round of applause when he clambered onto the rostrum - the cheers of 1,000 art owners at his mastery of his task .
He did not disappoint .
At racing speed he galloped the bids so fast that arms were waving at him .
Some of the desperate super - rich waited for calm before entering late .
" £ 26 million new bidder ! " cried Mr Burge when we were already far above the Monet record .
" £ 27 million , new bidder ! "
But at £ 30 million we were down to the run-in with three buyers in it , two giving bids by phone to Christie 's experts and a seated lady in the front row with mobile phone to ear .
Smiling broadly and confidently throughout , she came through to win - Tania Pos , director of Arts and Management International , one of the world 's leading art advisers .
An Impressionist specialist , London - based but with a group of mainly financial clients in Canada , the United States , the UK and the Channel Islands , she appeared fresh and ready for several bids more after her two opponents slowed and finally conceded .
As she sipped champagne later at a St James 's restaurant she was coy about her client but revealed , surprisingly , that the Monet might stay in Britain .
Buyer 's market : Lord Lindley chats with billionaire retailer Sir Phillip Green
" It 's not clear at all where it 's going , " she said .
" I do n't think my client has made up his mind . "
With several options open , this painting which will cost a fortune to insure in a private home might , on a lucky outcome , stay in London and end up on loan to Tate Britain or the National Gallery .
The price trounced its estimate of between £ 18 million and £ 24 million , the highest figure ever placed on a Monet .
But Christie 's whole £ 144 million auction - the highest ever in Europe - made nonsense of estimates .
Record breaker : Christies workers place the painting in the sale room yesterday
Ten of the opening 16 lots soared over expectation , notably works by Matisse , Bonnard , Signac and Toulouse - Lautrec owned by the late Simon Sainsbury at his beautiful Georgian Sussex home at Woolbeding .
A Degas ballet picture of the first rank , Danseuses la Barre , which set an artist record at £ 13.5 million .
Bond Street and Cork Street dealers were bemused by the prices , unable to get in as the super - rich battled to get their money out of Wall Street and the FTSE and park it in Monet .
Americans bought 36 per cent of the sale , even at $ 2 to the £ 1 .
This late 1919 Waterlilies was painted in his garden at Giverny 60 miles northwest of Paris when Monet in great age was half - blind and unable to see redyellows because of a cataract in his left eye .
The masterpiece was sold by the famed Norton Simon for a mere £ 133,300 at Sotheby 's New York on 5 May 1971 .
Its value has risen exactly 300 times since .
GREER , S.C. ( AP )  BMW will spend $ 750 million to expand its South Carolina production plant and create 500 jobs , the company said Monday .
The German automaker will add 1.2 million square feet of production space , and has already started expanding the paint shop at the plant in western South Carolina , said Frank - Peter Arndt , a BMW board member for global production .
Mr. Arndt said BMW would add a new generation of its X3 sport utility vehicles to the site , making the plant the exclusive source for the X3 and X5 sport utilities , as well as the X6 sports coupe introduced this year at the Detroit auto show .
The news comes two weeks after BMW said it planned to cut 5,000 jobs in Germany and 600 elsewhere , or 7.5 percent of its work force over two years .

In the above video , produced by NRO TV , Daniel Pipes gives us two choices — either launch a “ unilateral strike ” ( a neutral term for mass murder ) or join the neocons “ in being very serious with the Iranians and making clear to them we will attack if they do n’t stop ” developing a nuclear energy program .
Pipes , who believes Muslims are “ brown - skinned peoples cooking strange foods and not exactly maintaining Germanic standards of hygiene , ” of course prefers the former over the latter , as neocons are determined to flatten Muslim and Arab countries , destroy their culture as they are destroying it in Iraq , and pitch millions of people into a pre-civilized condition , or at least one minus the amenities of modern life .
Daniel Pipes realizes the Iranians will not stop developing nuclear energy and they have the right to do so under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Pipes and the neocons also realize Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear power plant , built by the Russian , will begin operating this autumn .
“ Under the agreement with Russia , Iran is to return spent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor as a safeguard to banish fears that Iran might misuse the rods to build nuclear weapons , ” reports IRNA .
“ IAEA is the monitoring mechanism for everything we do in Iran in the area of nuclear power plant .
The entire project is under IAEA control , ” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .
The neocons do not trust the IAEA and , besides , the idea is not to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear energy but rather providing a pretext to bomb the daylights out of the country , same as the neocons - in - waiting bombed Iraq during and after the so - called Gulf War .
Prior to Bush Senior ’s invasion , Iraq was the most advanced country in the Arab world , now it is on par with sub-Saharan Africa .
It is all part of the neocon plan , developed in partnership with the Israelis , to fragment and balkanize the Middle East , as sketched out by Lieutenant - Colonel Ralph Peters ( see his map , published in the Armed Forces Journal , June 2006 ) .
Obama ’s AIPAC speech earlier this week with commentary by George Galloway .
Finally , Pipes said the neocons will attack Iran in the remaining ten weeks of Bush ’s term if Barack Obama is elected .
Pipes seems to think Obama is an Iran appeaser , never mind he has demonstrated hostility toward the country , most notably while addressing AIPAC .
“ Sen. Barack Obama said Friday the use of military force should not be taken off the table when dealing with Iran , which he called ‘ a threat to all of us , ' ” the Chicago Tribune reported on March 3 , 2007 .
“ Obama said global leaders must do whatever it takes to stop Iran from enriching uranium and acquiring nuclear weapons … .
While Obama would n’t rule out force , he said the United States should engage in ‘ aggressive diplomacy combined with tough sanctions ’ to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat . ”
Earlier this week , again going before AIPAC , Obama said there was no greater threat to Israel than Iran .
He also accused Iran of supporting “ violent extremists ” and pursuing a “ nuclear capability that could spark a dangerous arms race , ” according to the Jerusalem Post ( see video ) .
“ The danger from Iran is grave and real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat , ” he declared , the AFP reported .
“ The Iranian regime supports violent extremes .
And challenges across the region .
It pursues a nuclear capability that could spark a dangerous arms race . ”
Obviously , for neocons such as Daniel Pipes , this is not enough .
Besides , they want to do it their way .

Leave it to the corporate media to COMPLETELY ignore Dennis Kucinich 's Articles of Impeachment against George Bush this Sunday .
Sure , I do n't think Kucinich will get the support of most of Congress ( with the exception of Robert Wexler ) , but is n't it even worth discussing ?
The Seminal
I disagree with Ian 's post this morning on impeachment , and specifically the first reason against going through with it :
When the House of Representatives voted to send Dennis Kucinich 's Articles of Impeachment against George W. Bush to the Judiciary Committee yesterday , it was understood that the vote in reality killed the bill .
And it is understandable why the House will not actually take up the Articles no matter how legitimate the case against Bush may be .
First , they do not want to distract from the presidential election and redefine the debate when it already favors the Democrats .
Second , if successful , then Cheney is President .
If you impeached both Bush and Cheney and made Pelosi President , then it would look like a powergrab by the Democrats .
However , having the Judiciary Committee hold the hearings might at least document the criminality of the Bush Administration in a coherent manner .
I 'm actually pretty convinced impeaching George Bush is a great electoral strategy for the Democrats .
There are two basic reasons Democratic leadership puts forward against impeaching George Bush and / or Dick Cheney .
Speaker Pelosi 's public reasoning is that she would rather focus on other issues more important to average Americans :
" The question of impeachment is something that would divide the country , " Pelosi said this morning during a wide - ranging discussion in the ornate Speaker 's office .
Her top priorities are ending the war in Iraq , expanding health care , creating jobs and preserving the environment .
" I know what our success can be on those issues .
I do n't know what our success can be on impeaching the president . "
The implicit reason is that Bush has been a huge electoral aid for Democrats .
Largely running against Bush , they were able to capture both houses of Congress in 2006 and they hope to repeat the feat with the White House in 2008 - not to mention pick up a great many House and Senate seats in the process .
Eliminating Bush , or doing anything that could cause citizens to rally around him , would take out that advantage .
She 's wrong .
Never mind my belief that holding those in power accountable is just about the most important issue there is .
Impeaching President Bush will actually help Democrats accomplish their electoral goals .
It 's no secret that the Democrat 's top strategy to win the White House this year is to label John McCain as 4 more years of Bush .
Outside groups like MoveOn.org are going all out with their Bush - McCain challenge , spending millions on organizing and ads .
Barack Obama himself is touting how often McCain votes with Bush .
( 95 % of the time last year ! )
This is the attack , and it looks like it 's starting to stick .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi security forces have detained a man suspected of being the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq after a captured associate led them to him sleeping in a house in the northern city of Mosul , Iraqi officials said on Friday .
An undated file photo released by the U.S. military of Abu Ayyub al - Masri , alias Sheikh Abu Hamza al - Muhajir , in Baghdad June 15 , 2006 .
REUTERS / U.S. Army / Handout
The U.S. military in Baghdad said it was checking the reports that Abu Ayyab al - Masri , an Egyptian also known as Abu Hamza al - Muhajir , had been detained .
If confirmed , the arrest would be another blow for Sunni Islamist al Qaeda in Iraq , which has reeled under a wave of U.S. military operations in the past year and been forced to regroup in northern Iraq .
An Interior Ministry spokesman said an associate of Masri detained in an earlier operation took security forces late on Wednesday to where the al Qaeda leader was hiding .
After being detained , Masri confessed to being the al Qaeda in Iraq leader , he said , adding that his identity still had to be confirmed .
Other Iraqi security officials said the suspect was in American custody for identification .
Al Qaeda in Iraq was headed by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al - Zarqawi until he was killed in a U.S. air strike in June 2006 .
His successor , Masri , was Zarqawi ’s close associate , and has a U.S. bounty of $ 5 million on his head .
Duraid Kashmula , the governor of Nineveh province , of which Mosul is the capital , also said the detained man had confessed to being Masri .
“ When police entered the house , they found him asleep , ” Kashmula said , adding the suspect was alone .
“ These is no doubt that the person arrested is Masri .
The operation was very quick and easy .
There were no clashes . ”
U.S. officials blame al Qaeda in Iraq for most big bombings in the country , including an attack on a revered Shi’ite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that sparked a wave of sectarian carnage that nearly tipped Iraq into all - out civil war .
But a build - up of U.S. troops last year allowed the military to focus a series of offensives against the group .
The emergence of Sunni Arab tribal security units also helped to provide intelligence on al Qaeda activities .
URBAN STRONGHOLD
The result was that al Qaeda has largely been pushed out of Baghdad and its former stronghold in the western Anbar province to areas in northern Iraq , such as Mosul .
American generals say Mosul is al Qaeda in Iraq ’s last remaining urban stronghold in the country .
But U.S. commanders warn that the group , while significantly weakened , can still carry out large - scale attacks .
Iraq ’s Interior Ministry said last May that Masri had been killed , but soon afterwards al Qaeda released an audio tape purportedly from him .
And in an hour - long audio tape issued last month also said to be from him , Masri called for renewed attacks on American troops and lashed out at U.S. President George Bush .
He urged militants from the Sunni Islamist group to “ celebrate ” the recent announcement that the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq had passed 4,000 .
“ We must celebrate this event in our special way , and make the defeated Bush join us in this celebration , ” he said .
He called on al Qaeda fighters to provide “ a head of an American as a present to the trickster Bush ” in a month - long campaign that he called the “ Attack of Righteousness ” .
Al Qaeda in Iraq shares a name and ideology if not organizational ties with Osama bin Laden ’s network , which was blamed for the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States .
The U.S. military says al Qaeda in Iraq is largely foreign led but that its foot soldiers are mainly Iraqis .

West 's mom died suddenly after plastic surgery , the Rage wrote a story about how kids feel about their parents having " work done . "
The consensus among plastic surgeons was that parents should be honest with their kids about procedures and not hide the fact that they are getting physical overhauls .
Now there 's a book called " My Beautiful Mommy " written by plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Salzhauer .
It 's aimed at helping confused kids understand why Mommy got a new nose and higher cheekbones and a smaller butt and a bigger chest and ...
Already , the book is being skewered and it looks pretty horrific from the cover .
( It would have been a smart choice for a child psychologist to write this book , actually . )
But really , after talking to many doctors , it would appear that there is a need for such a book .
Set aside your preaching about how parents send out the wrong message when they get Botox and nose jobs .
The reality is that plastic surgery figures continue to mushroom -- in the past ten years , the overall number of cosmetic procedures has jumped 457 % .
Maybe the next book should be titled : " Mommy Spent My College Money on Lipo . "

Standing in a field of organic tomatoes , farmer Pete Belluomini says the ground - cracking drought and unrelenting insects make it difficult enough to make a living on the land .
Farmer Steve Belluomini says thieves recently stole more than 900 gallons of diesel , costing him $ 4,000 .
But they are the least of his concern these days as a new menace haunts farmers in Bakersfield , California : diesel thieves .
Sgt. Walt Reed of the Kern County Sheriff 's Department and a member of California 's Rural Crimes Task Force said that more than $ 300,000 worth of diesel fuel was stolen in Kern County in the past three months .
" It 's an epidemic , gigantic problem , " Reed said .
" In Kern County alone , we 're getting reports of five to seven diesel thefts from farms a week .
It 's happening in other parts of the San Joaquin Valley , too . "
The crooks work around the clock , searching during the daytime for irrigation pumps run by diesel engines and supply tanks filled with diesel or gasoline , police and farmers say .
They return at night , with their headlights off , to steal hundreds of gallons of fuel at a time .
What are the thieves doing with the stolen diesel ?
Reed suspects that they 're selling the fuel to truckers who 've been hit hard by skyrocketing prices .
With the national average of regular unleaded gasoline at a record high of about $ 4.00 a gallon and more than $ 4.75 per gallon for diesel , according to AAA , Reed says it makes it even harder for them resist the temptation of cheap fuel .
" It 's going to cost him $ 500 to fill up , and he can fill up [ on stolen diesel ] for $ 200 , " Reed said .
" What 's he going to do ? "
Belluomini 's operation outside the farming town of Arvin , California , got hit hard recently ; he estimates that thieves took more than 900 gallons of fuel from several sites , valued at more than $ 4,000 .
Squatting next to one of the siphoned pumps , Belluomini , 47 , showed CNN a rectangle - shaped metal box below the diesel engine that stores about 250 gallons of diesel , black gold to thieves .
The veteran farmer estimates that they siphoned the diesel straight into barrels in the back of a van or pickup and drove away , vanishing into the darkness of unlit country roads .
" Like any good thief , you just do n't see them , and that 's probably part of the frustration , " Belluomini said .
" It 's like , ' If I could just catch that guy , boy , what would I do ! ' "
Locks do n't work , according to Belluomini .
He says the tenacious thieves use bolt cutters or even torches to get to their loot .
Cash - strapped farmers , struggling to make ends meet , can't afford to pay security guards to stand watch over pumps and tanks .
Belluomini says he and other farmers are forced to barely fill their pumps , leaving little diesel to steal .
But that cuts into the bottom line , as laborers must make extra trips just to keep refueling .
Thieves caught on camera stealing fuel »
Consumers could ultimately pay the price if the diesel thefts continue and put farmers out of business .
Though it has n't had a direct effect , Belluomini says it 's possible that if the supply shrinks , produce prices could increase .
The wave of diesel thefts is n't isolated to the the San Joaquin Valley .
Other counties are dealing with their share of the ripoffs , and reports of fuel theft are pouring in from all over the country .
A thief recently hit vans at a U - Haul lot in Ohio .
In Detroit , Michigan , auto body shop owner Dale Fortin is repairing a new problem that 's recently surfaced : replacing gas tanks punctured by thieves .
" It 's crazy ; the world is crazy , " Fortin told CNN affiliate WDIV .
" They will take [ a cordless drill ] and drill a hole in h[ the gas tank ] .
They either put a pan under there or stick a hose in there .
They sit on the side with a can and dump the fuel out . "
Replacing a punctured gas tank could cost anywhere from $ 300 to $ 500 on passenger cars .
" Not only do you lose your fuel , now you have to repair your gas tank , " Reed said .
Although gas is also being stolen in Kern County , Reed says , the main target right now is diesel on farms .
The diesel heists just add to the misery of weary San Joaquin Valley farmers , including Belluomini , who have been hit by metal thieves who mined their farms for the copper in the irrigation systems .
" The problem ... some farmers are facing is , they could n't turn on their [ irrigation ] pumps last summer because of the copper theft , " Reed explained .
" This summer , they can't turn on their pumps because they stole the diesel .
What 's next ?
Are they going to steal the pumps ? "
Reed says most of the metal and diesel thieves are drug addicts who rip off anything they can to turn it around for fast cash to buy more narcotics , especially methamphetamine .
Most of the metal is bought by scrap yards .
Soft - spoken Pete Belluomini , who is the former president of the Kern County Farm Bureau , is angry and wants people to understand the challenges of modern - day farming .
" I have enough to worry about .
' Is it going to be hot [ or ] cold ?
Is the wind going to blow ? ' " Belluomini said .
" Now you have to start worrying about , ' Is everything locked , bottled up and capped off ? '
" All we 're trying to do is provide a good product to the consumer and make a living . "

BitTorrent would be able to identify the bad chunks in the disk image I had downloaded from Apple , so I replaced the placeholder file that Azureus had created with a corrupt SDK disk image , and then reimported the torrent file .
Sure enough it checked the file and declared it 99.7 % complete .
A few minutes later I had a valid disk image and installed the SDK .

A few seconds of grainy newsreel , a handful of fragile press cuttings , a street name , a grave .
Such is the meagre legacy of Matthias Sindelar - one of the world 's greatest soccer players , the Pelé of the interwar years , a sporting genius who not only took the game into the modern era , but snubbed Hitler en route .
Many believe that the Austrian centre - forward 's contempt for the Nazis cost him his life .
But has Austria snubbed Sindelar ?
In a small country not overflowing with world - class sports heroes or , for that matter , high - profile anti-fascist martyrs , the absence of Sindelar from Austria 's official past and present is strange .
No statues , no stadium name , no posters .
No football academy bears his name ; there has been no big biopic , no exhibition , no plaques , no new investigation into his suspicious death .
A recent poll in Austria confirmed Sindelar as the nation 's all - time greatest sports star , yet soccer fans in the country for Euro 2008 will struggle to find any sign of him .
It 's an omission that even some Austrians , long used to institutionalised strangeness , find baffling .
" It is an amazing lack - a puzzle , but also a real shame , " says the Austrian soccer historian Dr Erich Krenslehner .
" For a great star like Sindelar , not to have a memorial of some sort is very unusual , a mystery . "
So why is a nation so adept at the chocolate - box glorification of Mozart , Strauss and Haydn reluctant to embrace the memory of its finest sportsman ?
A bronze football tops the marble slab over Sindelar 's grave at Vienna 's Zentralfriedhof cemetery .
His gentle face , cast in bronze - high forehead , hair receding , the metal bright green with verdigris - stares out from the headstone above the dates 1903 - 1939 .
He is in vintage kit - floppy collar , lace - up neck .
On the green metal face , seven decades of rain have left dark streaks from the hairline down to the neck that look like ghostly post - match sweat .
There are no flowers .
Austria , Euro 2008 co-hosts , start this year 's competition ranked 88th in the world , yet for the best part of a decade - and just about within living memory - Austria was , with England , the most feared side in world soccer , and it could boast the world 's leading player .
Matthias Sindelar was an almost freakishly talented footballer who waltzed around opponents with ease .
Above all , he possessed what the pundits called " wit " ; he was , said one , a man who played soccer " as a grandmaster played chess " .
The sports writers christened Sindelar " der Papierne " - " the paper man " who fluttered around the pitch .
To the ethnic Czech , Hungarian and Polish factory workers and the cafe - society dilettantes and bourgeoisie , many of them Jewish , who flocked to see him play for his club , FK Austria Wien , however , he was their " Sindi " .
And Sindi , quite simply , was playing soccer like no one else in the world .
Sindelar was " new " Viennese .
His parents were Catholics from Moravia , now in the Czech Republic .
He spoke in the slurred Viennese dialect , and grew up in the drab , poor suburb of Favoriten , a bastion of the left .
" In his speech , in his manner , he was an ordinary Viennese person , " recalls Franz Schwarz , son of the 1920s and 1930s Austrian team president and now , in his nineties , one of the few people alive to have met Sindelar .
" But he was something very special in his talent , really exceptional . "
Starting in spring 1931 with a 5 - 0 demolition of Scotland , at the time one of Europe 's most revered teams , the red-and - whites would be unbeaten for the next 19 internationals , pushing 11 goals past Germany 's goalkeeper in just two matches , with none conceded .
All of Europe 's top teams were toppled .
In December 1932 the side , now dubbed the Wunderteam , was ready to take on the world 's most potent force : England .
A crowd of 60,000 packed Stamford Bridge to see the Austrians play England , while an even bigger throng crammed into Vienna 's Heldenplatz for a radio commentary .
The Wunderteam nearly pulled it off , running circles around England - but lost , just , 4 - 3 .
The British press hailed the newcomers : " English team lucky to win " , was the Manchester Guardian 's verdict .
" There could not be the slightest doubt that as a team [ Austria ] were the superiors . "
" It was victory and no more , " said the Times .
" And it was by no means easily earned . "
The Führer 's plan
By the summer of 1934 Austria had won or drawn 28 out of 31 games and Sindelar 's fame had spread even to the soccer - phobic United States .
Sindi had begun to earn big money , endorsing sharp suits and luxury cars , gambling and womanising much of the cash away .
The Wunderteam seemed unstoppable - but this was 1930s Mitteleuropa .
The Nazi ideologues liked international soccer .
It was mass - propaganda - friendly , and there was the prospect of inevitable victory upon victory : a collective triumph of the national athletic will .
Nazi Germany 's soccer team found victory far from inevitable : they were , at best , middle - rankers .
But the Führer 's pudgy sports advisers had a plan .
One of the first actions of the new National Socialist government in Austria , set up after the March 1938 Anschluss , was to disband the country 's professional football association , one of the oldest in the world .
Jewish sports clubs and soccer teams were outlawed and their grounds seized , Jewish players barred , Jewish club officials sacked .
Many fled abroad .
Others , fatally , stayed put .
Austria was to become Ostmark , a province of the Reich .
Its soccer team would itself be annexed , players " invited " to join the German side ; the team name " Austria " would go .
Many players and officials acquiesced to the takeover and some were even enthusiastic , active supporters .
Sindelar , it seems , was not .
FK Austria
Wien shed many of its directors , players and officials , sacked for being , or suspected of being , Jewish .
Among them was the veteran club president Dr Michl Schwarz .
Those who survived the purges were instructed not to speak to sacked colleagues .
Sindelar refused .
" The new club president has forbidden us to talk to you , " he told the highly respected Schwarz shortly before the deposed president fled abroad , " but I will always speak to you , Herr Doktor . "
A clash with the New Order was on the cards .
On 3 April 1938 , just weeks after the Nazis annexed Austria , the Wunderteam took to the field for the last time - against Germany .
The Nazi sports authorities billed the match , at Vienna 's Prater Stadium , as a " reunification " derby , a 90 - minute celebration of Germanic brotherhood .
It proved to be one of the most extraordinary soccer matches ever played .
Nazi propagandists ordained that the showpiece clash was to end as a low - scoring draw .
For his part , Sindelar , it is said , demanded that his team be allowed to wear their traditional strip , not a new " non-national " kit , and that they be known for this , their last match , as " Austria " .
The Nazis agreed .
Shadows and secrets
The Wunderteam spent the first half of the match sullenly trying not to score .
Up front , Sindelar and his team - mate Karl Sesta acted dumb , allowing the Germans to dictate play .
The play - acting continued into the second half .
But then , at around 70 minutes , something snapped .
Sindi flicked a rebound from the German goalkeeper into the bottom right - hand corner of the net .
The crowd erupted .
Nazi functionaries looked on in disbelief as , minutes later , Sesta slammed the ball into the German goal from 45 yards .
2 - 0 . At full - time , the Prater Stadium crowd went wild , shouting : " Österreich , Österreich ! " while , one account goes , Sindi ran up to the box containing Nazi dignitaries and club officials and waltzed around , alone , grinning .
Ten months later he was dead .
Sindelar 's last year was bizarre .
Even as Vienna lurched towards open thuggery and the " legal " seizure of property from Jewish citizens began , Sindelar apparently maintained close - and public - friendships with Jews .
Several times he was " requested " , reportedly at the very highest level , to join the German ( and thoroughly Nazi ) national sports training organisation .
Again he refused .
Was he suicidally principled , or just taking yet another losing punt - this time on the New Order fading fast ?
It would have been easy for Sindelar to take a job abroad , and he had influential friends in English soccer , but his next move was an unpredictable twist .
In summer 1938 Sindi , the " chess grandmaster of soccer " , even in his mid-thirties one of the most bankable players in the world , bought a scruffy street - corner cafe in lowly Favoriten and turned his back on soccer .
The cafe 's previous owner , a Jewish acquaintance of Sindelar 's called Leopold Drill , was being turfed out by the Nazis - one of the many " legalised " thefts taking place throughout the city .
The star , it is said , stepped in with a cash offer for the business that was far more generous than the pittance offered by local party bureaucrats .
The deal done , Sindi slicked back his hair and quietly served beer and coffee to his old mates .
The Gestapo kept the cafe under surveillance , noting that its new owner was friendly with all customers , Jews included .
About half the clientele had been Jewish , the Gestapo estimated .
Sindelar was known to be " not sympathetic " to the party , it was reported .
And then , on 23 January 1939 , a friend , worried that he had not seen Sindelar for some time , forced his way into his flat on Annagasse in the city centre .
He found the star in bed , dead .
Lying beside him was his latest lover .
Unconscious , she lived a few hours longer .
Sindelar was 35 .
The police investigation concluded that the couple had died from carbon monoxide poisoning .
A chimney flue was found to be blocked , and poor maintenance blamed .
Few believed the official version .
More than 20,000 people turned out for Sindi 's funeral .
In some ways it was Vienna 's first , and last , rally against the Nazis .
In other respects , however , it was no more than a fare well to a local hero .
That ambiguity , a Viennese trait then and now , is at the heart of the Sindelar story .
The British film classic
The Third Man , filmed in part amid the bomb sites of the Austrian capital nearly a decade after the player 's death , captured the mood and manners of the city : shadows , secrets and whispers .
The whispering endures .
The few facts surrounding Sindelar are entwined with rumours still circulating in Vienna .
Take the police report on his death : lost in the war , says the Austrian national archive .
No , there for the reading but hard to find , maintain some historians .
Or Sindelar 's cafe : bought by the star at a fair price to help out its fleeing Jewish owner , say some .
No , " stolen " by an opportunist Sindelar for a fraction of its true value , say others .
Or the player 's death : clearly murder , many believe .
No , it was suicide , a few argue , an act of despair at the fate of Austria - a theory popular among the left - leaning coffee - house literati who idolised him .
Or a gangland hit , linked to the star 's supposedly huge gambling debts .
Or murder at the hands of his lover , who then poisoned herself .
Or a Gestapo killing to prevent Sindelar embarrassing the Reich by fleeing abroad .
Or , yes , just an accident .
About Sindelar himself , Vienna 's rumour mills have been working overtime .
" He was really Jewish , not Catholic , you know , but kept it secret , " went one whisper this past week .
" Actually he was a Nazi , but maybe only 1 per cent of him .
He could see the way things were going , " was another .
The building that was once Sindelar 's cafe was quietly demolished a couple of years ago .
" They did not want it there as a reminder of him , " said one fan , declining to elaborate on who " they " might be .
" It was old , it had to go , development , " shrugged another .
The few seconds of newsreel footage of Matthias Sindelar the football player are all that remains beyond doubt - a glimpse of a delicate , intuitive player with a kind face .
And a face , for whatever reason , is just about all that survives of the Paper Man .

➨ Read the jacuzzi manual
Before cleaning a hot tub , the first thing we advise you to do is read the manufacturer 's manual carefully .
There are many models of hot tubs , each with its own specific components and cleaning procedures .
So if you do n't really know the characteristics of your Jacuzzi , check the manual and follow the stipulated recommendations .
If for any reason you cannot find the manual for your Jacuzzi , you can easily find it on the internet !

➨ Unplug before cleaning
A basic advice to clean a jacuzzi or any object , household appliance , among others , is to disconnect the appliance from the electrical network before proceeding with hygiene and sanitation .
In the case of a bathtub of these characteristics , it is possible that if you do not disconnect the power supply from the motor , it will start to run without enough water , causing damage to the pump motor .
If this were the case , the costs to replace this part would be excessive since these damages are not covered by the warranty .
➨ Purge the Jacuzzi pipes
Under the Jacuzzi , hidden , runs a network of pipes that allow the proper functioning of the bathtub .
These pipes are full of stagnant water after each bath , a situation that can generate the growth and proliferation of different types of fungi and bacteria .
In addition , it is common for scale build - up .
To avoid this , there are specific descalers for pipes on the market for whirlpool bathtubs which remove and eliminate scale and calcium deposits .

This can create excessive bubbles in the hot tub fill .
➨ How to clean the filter of a Jacuzzi ?
The filter cartridge is very easy to clean .
To keep it in perfect hygienic conditions , it is best to follow a routine cleaning practice .
The filter in hot tubs removes body fat and debris from the hot tub water so a dirty filter will reduce the filter 's ability to function properly .
Before removing the filter cartridge for cleaning , make sure the pump is off .
Once removed , wash it with plenty of pressure water and then let it soak with a specific filter cleaning product in case it is very dirty .
After rinsing it with water to remove any traces of the product , you should proceed to reassemble it as it was before removing it .
It can be very useful to take a picture of the position of the product to place it again after cleaning !
It is recommended that cleaning of this item be done once a month .
However , check the cleaning instructions from the manufacturer of your hot tub .
In the event that the Jacuzzi is used for the first time or it has been inactive for a long period of time , you will need to clean the filters every two days during the first weeks of operation .
After several cleanings of the filters , it will be necessary to replace them so that due to wear , they do not damage the pumps .
