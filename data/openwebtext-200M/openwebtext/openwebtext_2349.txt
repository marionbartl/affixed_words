For fourteen weeks in the winter and spring of 1956 - 57 , I came into millions of American homes , stood in a supposedly soundproof booth , and answered difficult questions .
I was considered well spoken , well educated , handsome — the very image of a young man that parents would like their son to be .
I was also thought to be the ideal teacher , which is to say patient , thoughtful , trustworthy , caring .
In addition , I was making a small fortune .
And then — well , this is what happened :
I do n’t remember the dinner clearly , except that at some point in the early fall of 1956 I was talking with a man named Albert Freedman , who knew a friend of mine .
Freedman was about my age , suave and well dressed — certainly no bohemian , like most of my friends .
He asked me what I thought of “ Tic Tac Dough . ”
I did n’t have a television set in those days , but I knew that Al Freedman was in the TV business .
And I ’d certainly heard about the game shows , where people could win a lot of money .
Al told me that contestants on “ The $ 64,000 Question ” could win that amount and on some shows they could win even more .
“ Your father ’s a professor at Columbia ? ” he asked , and , when I nodded , he asked if I was , too .
I told him that I was an instructor of English — a long way from being a professor .
I was not comfortable talking about myself , especially when he asked me how much an instructor of English made .
When I told him , he just looked at me .
Later , I asked my friend to tell me more about Freedman , and she said that he was a producer for Jack Barry and Dan Enright , who created shows like “ Tic Tac Dough . ”
Freedman called me a few days later .
When I learned what he wanted , I telephoned Gerry — Geraldine Bernstein , the young woman I had been dating and whom I married six months later .
I told her that Al had persuaded me to take a test and that , depending on how I did , they might want me for a new show called “ Twenty - One , ” which was structured like blackjack .
“ The winner gets quite a bit , ” I said .
“ The guy who ’s on the show now has already won something like twenty - five thousand dollars . ”
“ Promise me you wo n’t agree to do this without talking to me first , ” I remember her saying .
“ O.K. , I promise .
They probably wo n’t ask me . ”
They did — at least , Al Freedman did .
He called me and told me that his job was on the line .
A man named Herb Stempel was winning week after week , but he was n’t popular and the ratings were suffering .
“ They want me to find a contestant who can beat Herb Stempel , ” Al said .
“ It might be you . ”
It was n’t hard to guess why Al was interested in me .
My father was Mark Van Doren , a poet and critic and , as Al Freedman knew , a legendary teacher .
My uncle Carl , his oldest brother , had been a professor of American literature at Columbia .
In 1912 , Carl had married Irita Bradford , who not long afterward was named the book - review editor of the New York Herald Tribune .
Carl resigned his Columbia professorship in order to pursue a writing career , which included winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography ( of Benjamin Franklin ) ; he helped my father to become a teacher of literature at Columbia , too .
By 1956 , Carl was dead and my father was close to retirement , after nearly forty years .
The first time Al called , he asked me to come to his apartment .
When I arrived , he seemed nervous .
I wondered what I was getting into .
Right away , he said , “ You remember I told you about this fellow Stempel ?
Well , the sponsors want him to be beaten .
He ’ll walk away with a bundle , but they want somebody more sympathetic . ”
“ Do they have a right to do that ? ”
“ Hey , come off it , Charlie .
Do n’t be naïve . ”
And he launched into his argument — that , when all was said and done , these game shows were mere entertainment .
“ Even Shakespeare is entertainment , ” he said , although he conceded that the shows , unlike the plays , were presented as the real thing .
Al played an episode of “ Twenty - One ” for me , in which Stempel seemed very sure of himself .
His answers were obviously based on genuine knowledge .
I say “ obviously , ” although I realized that I could n’t be certain .
How would anyone know ?
Stempel ’s posture and gestures were awkward , his clothes were too tight — he seemed almost to be choking in his shirt — and his speech was wooden .
I remembered Al ’s remark that I might have a good chance against him , and then he came right out and said it : “ I ’ve thought about it , Charlie , and I ’ve decided you should be the person to beat Stempel .
And I ’ll help you do it . ”
He held up his hand .
“ I swear to you , no one will ever know .
It will be just between you and me .
Jack Barry ” — the show ’s host — “ wo n’t know and Dan Enright wo n’t , either .
Stempel wo n’t know — I ’ve got a way to handle that .
The sponsors wo n’t know — anyway , they ’ll be so happy they wo n’t give a damn .
And the audience will never know , because I wo n’t tell them , and you wo n’t , either . ”
He suggested that I could make at least eight thousand dollars , maybe a good deal more .
I was guaranteed a thousand dollars for the first show .
“ How would you do it ? ”
“ Jack would ask you a question you could answer and Stempel could n’t . ”
I leaned my elbows on the table , resting my head in my hands .
He was telling me , in so many words , that the show was fixed .
“ I do n’t know , ” I said again .
“ When would this be ? ”
A few days later , I took Gerry to dinner at Steak au Pommes Frites , the midtown restaurant where we ’d had our first date .
We drank some wine and then I told her .
She did n’t say much ; she ’s a woman of few , choice words .
But she did n’t like any of it .
My first appearance on “ Twenty - One ” was on November 28 , 1956 .
I must have put the whole thing out of my mind , but about a week after my conversation with Freedman I suddenly found myself in the studio , with the red light glowing above the camera , totally unaware that I was being watched by millions of people .
Herb Stempel by then had been on the show for six straight weeks and had won some seventy thousand dollars .
You can “ quit right now , ” Jack Barry was saying to Stempel , in a voice practiced in arousing suspense , “ and a check will be waiting for you , or you can decide to continue playing . ”
Barry then introduced me : “ He teaches music at Columbia University , and was a student at Cambridge University , in England . . . and his hobby is playing the piano in chamber - music groups . ”
Barry was reading from a “ continuity card ” written in haste .
In fact , I played the piano only clumsily and I taught literature .
There was no time for corrections , I knew ;
Al had stressed this .
Anyway , Barry was racing ahead , asking me if I was “ related in any way to Mark Van Doren , up at Columbia , the famous writer . ”
Papa , forgive me !
Mama , forgive me !
Uncle Carl , forgive me !
I ’ve remembered that moment for more than fifty years .
Al had given me my instructions .
My understanding was that I was to reach seventeen points in the first round , twenty - one in the second — at which point I ’d defeat Herb Stempel .
To my astonishment , both Stempel and I reached twenty - one points in the second round .
So bells rang , commercials were read , and both of us agreed to come back a week later .
It was then — on December 5 , 1956 — that I “ beat ” Herb Stempel and began my rise to celebrity .
I learned later that the question Stempel missed was one that he could have answered easily .
But they had him .
If he failed to go along with his script , he could lose a lot of the money he had already “ won . ”
Each week , Stempel had been told what to do : how many points to choose , how to deliver his answers .
He was to pat his brow ( it was hot in those glass booths ) but not rub it , to avoid smearing his makeup .
In addition , he was instructed to get a Marines - type “ whitewall ” haircut , to wear an ill - fitting suit ( it had belonged to his deceased father - in - law ) , and to describe himself as a penurious student at City College .
In fact , he was a Marines veteran married to a woman of some means who once appeared on the set wearing a Persian - lamb coat and was quickly spirited away so that she would n’t blow his cover .
Stempel was also told to wear a six - dollar wristwatch that “ ticked away like an alarm clock , ” as he later testified , and was audible when he stood sweating in the booth , earphones supposedly damping all outside sound .
Once , he wore a new suit and had let his hair grow out , for which he was severely chastised by Enright .
As Enright apparently believed , a successful game show needed two distinct personalities , one unsympathetic and unattractive , the other the opposite .
I continued to appear on “ Twenty - One ” until March 11 , 1957 .
During those four months , Freedman never stopped coaching me , and I came to see just how carefully controlled the show was .
In our sessions , he would ask me questions , I would answer them — and then he would tell me how to answer them : pause here ; add this or that remark or aside ; always seem to be worried , anxious ; never answer too quickly , let the suspense build up .
One January night , I was asked to give the nicknames of several Second World War airplanes , and in February I was asked to name the seven Prime Ministers of Britain between the world wars .
A critic later wrote that mine “ was a remarkable and seductive performance . ”
Toward the end , my face appeared on the cover of Time ( with earphones superimposed on my head ) , and I was seen in public with movie starlets ( the dates were arranged by Barry and Enright ) ; a couple of women found out where I lived and came to my door .
For several weeks , the programs had ended in ties between me and a lawyer named Vivienne Nearing .
At one point , it looked as if I could have won more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars — except I could n’t , because Al had informed me that I would lose to her .
On the evening of March 11th , Jack Barry asked both of us to name the kings of Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Jordan , Iraq , and Belgium .
According to our covert script , Nearing knew the answers and I did n’t .
For years after that , people enjoyed asking me if I knew the name of the one I missed — the king of Belgium .
A photograph of me writing the figure “ $ 128,000 ” on a blackboard was widely published .
I deposited the net amount ( a little less than that ) and began to try to understand the life I ’d created .
Part of it was going to work for the National Broadcasting Company , which was willing to sign me to a three - year contract as a consultant on public - service and educational broadcasting , at an annual rate of fifty thousand dollars .
One day in the spring of 1957 , shortly after Gerry and I were married , my father and I had a conversation .
We were walking slowly down the road from his house , a road lined with stone walls on each side .
At that time , our neighbor pastured heifers and dry cows — pregnant cows waiting to deliver — in the nearby fields .
When we walked at night , the cows , curious about us , would breathe and snuffle , sometimes scaring our city friends .
“ I ’ve never asked you about this whole experience , Charlie , ” Dad said .
He was dressed in overalls , denim shirt , and boots , like the farmers he was descended from .
In New York , he was an elegant figure , but this was the father I loved best .
“ But I get the impression you ’re not too comfortable with your new fame — I mean , the way the quiz show may have changed your life .
You have many opportunities now that you might never have had before .
But I ’ve wondered if they ’re good — for you , being the man you are , or the man I think you are . ”
It ’s interesting what you can find when you look around a bit on Google .

WHEN I CANVASSED restaurant owners across the country , most said that customer opposition precludes any significant move away from tipping .
“ I like the idea of a service charge , and I ’ve thought about having one , ” says Hakan Swahn , the owner of Aquavit , a restaurant in New York that serves Scandinavian cuisine and has branches in Stockholm and Tokyo .
Because tipping is negligible in Sweden and frowned upon in Japan , at these outposts the cost of service is factored into the bill .
But that ’s not possible at his Manhattan flagship , Swahn told me .
“ The customers would protest . ”
Image ALL FOR ONE , ONE FOR ALL :
At the Linkery , the staff , surprisingly , has embraced the no-tipping policy more readily than some of the restaurants customers .
Credit ... Jeff Minton for The New York Times
Eighty percent of Americans say they prefer tipping to paying a service fee , according to Zagat Survey .
They do so , Leo Crespi ’s surveys first demonstrated , primarily because they believe tipping provides an incentive for good service .
But there is little correlation , in fact less than 2 percent , according to Michael Lynn , a Cornell professor of consumer behavior and marketing .
Economists have struggled to explain tipping .
Why tip at all , since the bill is presented at the end of a meal and ca n’t retroactively improve service ?
And certainly there ’s no reason to tip at a restaurant you will never revisit .
“ Using a rational and selfish agent to explain tipping , one reaches the conclusion that the agent should never tip if he does not intend to visit the establishment again , ” Ofer Azar , the economist , writes .
“ Yet this prediction is sharply violated in practice : most people tip even when they do not intend to ever come back . ”
The single most important factor in determining the amount of a tip is the size of the bill .
Diners generally tip the same percentage no matter the quality of the service and no matter the setting .
They do so , Lynn says , largely because it ’s expected and diners fear social disapproval .
“ It is embarrassing to have another person wait on you , ” the psychologist Ernest Dichter told a magazine reporter in 1960 .
“ The need to pay , psychologically , for the guilt involved in the unequal relationship is so strong that very few are able to ignore it . ”
Ego needs also play a part , especially when it comes to overtipping , according to the Israeli social psychologist Boas Shamir .
These psychological factors also go a long way in explaining the steady rise of the average tip in the United States from 10 percent in the early 20th century to 18.9 percent today , with little regional variation .
“ To overtip is to appear an ass : to undertip is to appear an even greater ass , ” Benjamin Franklin reportedly noted during his stint in Paris , and his quandary continues to vex American diners .
But not at the Linkery .
Porter and his staff have found that most diners accept the no-tipping policy , which is explained on the restaurant ’s Web site and menu as well as upon the presentation of the check .
This does n’t surprise Lynn , who says he believes consumer preferences for tipping are not as strong as Zagat Survey suggests .
In a less - cited 1987 Gallup telephone survey , only 34 percent of American respondents said a 15 - to - 18 percent service charge was unreasonable .
In Lynn ’s own 2004 Internet survey , 44 percent of American respondents said they would prefer to have waiters paid higher wages instead of tips , while only 22 percent disagreed .
“ Given that consumers ’ preferences appear to be weak and are unlikely to have strong effects on patronage behavior , they need not dictate tipping policies , ” Lynn concludes .
That has already proved true at the antipodes of American dining  the fast - food restaurant and the private club  where tipping is not usually allowed .
And with few objections , many full - service restaurants include service charges for groups of six or more diners .
They do so because tip size is inversely proportional to the number of diners .
One 1973 study at an Ohio restaurant revealed that individual diners tipped 19 percent on average , while groups of six left 13.5 percent .
“ [ T ] o the extent that many people contribute to a check , the responsibility of each to the waiter may be psychologically divided among the people present , ” the researchers concluded .

Metallica , whose leaked album Death Magnetic is slated for a September 12 release , launched a promotion on YouTube today featuring the band ’s favorite Metallica cover songs on the site .
Drummer Lars Ulrich introduces their selections in the video to the right .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
" It makes us feels alive and special that you guys can be out there doing that cool stuff that you guys do … we ’re mighty proud of what you do out there . " says Ulrich .
Later , he explains one reason the band is doing this .
" You ’ve all seen enough versions of us playing Enter Sandman and Master of Puppets on German MTV for the last ten years .
Who needs that ,
right ?
Let ’s check out some really cool interpretations of all the Metallica songs that you guys out there are so cool to put up on thenet and share with everybody in the world . "
Other reasons behind Metallica ’s YouTube promotion are a bit more complicated .
More than eight years have passed since Lars Ulrich took that fateful elevator ride up to Napster headquarters with the names of 300,000 - plus Napster users who had shared Metallica songs through the network , and the band is trying to salvage its reputation by embracing , at long last , the realities of online music .
The band has continued to take a beating from some fans nonetheless , but Ulrich ’s recent admission that he was unconcerned about the leakage of their upcoming album and this embrace of YouTube show they really are thinking about the internet differently ( although it should be noted that they stand to make royalty money from their compositions being played as part of the promotion ) .
Below are the ten Metallica cover songs that Lars and other members of the band chose to be featured on the front page of YouTube .
Eight - year - old Robin busts out a respectable rendition of the solo from Metallica ’s " One " :

Apologists for the bailout plan say that it will have a trickle - down benefit for taxpayers .
But in his testimony to the Senate today , Bernanke pretty much admitted that the bailout is n’t aimed at helping taxpayers .
Specifically , as the Wall Street Journal summarizes it :
Bernanke used his time to argue for not buying assets at fire - sale prices in the Treasury ’s $ 700 billion bailout proposal .
*** Mr. Bernanke said the Treasury plan should have taxpayers buy the assets and hold them at close to their maturity value .
Removing the assets , he said , would bring liquidity back to markets , unfreeze credit markets , reduce uncertainty and allow banks to attract private capital .
( Reuters has a partial transcript ) ( Article continues below )
Forcing assets down to even lower fire - sale prices would protect taxpayers the most , since the government would own the assets below the value if held to maturity .
As long as those securities did n’t flat - out default , the government ’s purchase would have a substantial upside .
However , Mr. Bernanke essentially argued that doing so would hurt markets even further and would n’t solve the problem facing the economy .
In pushing back against congressional efforts to change the Treasury proposal , Mr. Bernanke said : “ We can not impose punitive measures on institutions that choose to sell assets . ”
The beneficiaries would be not just the companies selling , but markets and the overall economy , he said .
Still , he acknowledged that the precise approach to doing so had n’t been determined , arguing for flexibility .
“ We do not know exactly what the best design is , ” and that would come from consultation with experts , Mr. Bernanke said .
“ We believe that strong and timely action is urgently needed to stabilize our markets and our economy , ” he said .
In subsequent questioning , Mr. Bernanke distinguished between , on the one hand , “ fire sale prices , ” the ones that prevail “ when you sell into an illiquid market ” and , on the other , the prices that holders think the assets are really worth , sometimes described as “ fundamental ” values or “ hold - to - maturity ” value .
“ The holders have a view of what they think it ’s worth .
It ’s hard for outsiders to know , ” Mr. Bernanke said .
The point of an auction is to reveal those prices .
So Bernanke is arguing against the government purchasing Wall Street ’s toxic assets at their real price ( which would benefit taxpayers ) and for the Wall Street firms themselves to set whatever arbitrary price they like , since they “ have a view of what they think it ’s worth ” and “ it ’s hard for outsiders to know ” .
Further proof of the fact that the bailout is not aimed at helping taxpayers is that even very wealthy , solvent Wall Street ( and foreign ) firms may get bailout money .

Smoking has been so much part of our culture for so long that it is hard to imagine a world without it .
Yet that is exactly what the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) called for last week .
The RCP suggested that , with a concerted effort , smoking could be eliminated within 20 years .
To achieve this , two things would have to happen , the college said .
First , curbs on smoking would have to be strengthened , principally by ramping up taxes on tobacco .
But second , and more important , access to nicotine in other , safer , forms has to be greatly increased .
This latter demand chimes with developments under way in the tobacco industry .
This week , the Marlboro cigarette empire Altria bought the USA 's biggest maker of chewing tobacco , UST , for $ 10.4bn ( £ 5.8 bn ) .
The deal confirms the tobacco industry 's interest in diversifying out of cigarettes into " smokeless " products .
UST makes Skoal – tea bag - like pouches of tobacco that are held between the cheek and gum , allowing nicotine to be absorbed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
British American Tobacco is also investing heavily in the search for safer ways to deliver nicotine .
BAT paid £ 2bn to take control of the Swedish company ST , which makes Snus – also pouches of tobacco for sucking .
Evidence suggests that sucking a pouch of tobacco is 90 per cent less harmful than inhaling cigarette smoke .
But the products are banned in the EU on the grounds that they are , er , carcinogenic , and that to replace one carcinogen with another , albeit one less lethal , is unwise .
Meanwhile , investigations are under way into alternative ways of delivering nicotine that will satisfy the most hardened of addicts .
As more smokers give up , those who puff on are the ones who require most support to quit .
Nicotine gum and patches wo n't cut it ; these are addicts who need the " hit " that only a lungful of smoke supplies .
Nicotine is the closest we are likely to get to the perfect drug .
Its effects are diverse ; it stimulates , calms and enhances feelings of pleasure , but has few side effects .
Its great advantage over other drugs is that its effects are mild .
It is pleasurable only within a narrow range of concentrations in the blood .
That is what makes it safe .
Only the instrument of its delivery – the cigarette – is lethal .
A device that delivers nicotine quickly , efficiently and safely could earn a fortune .
But regulations on the sale of medicinal nicotine are so tight that they keep prices high – seven days ' worth of nicotine patches costs £ 17 – and the development of innovative products low .
Professor John Britton , consultant respiratory physician and chief author of the RCP report , said : " The ideal product would be a nicotine inhaler like an asthma inhaler , that delivered a hit of nicotine as close as possible to the experience of smoking a cigarette .
" But the companies [ makers of nicotine gum and patches ] do n't want to do it and the regulatory restrictions make it difficult to get it on to the market .
There is no competition .
That is why we need a Nicotine Regulatory Authority . "
The anomaly in the existing law is glaring .
Tobacco companies are permitted to sell nicotine to the public in the form of ( lethal ) cigarettes , yet it is illegal to sell alternative nicotine products without a licence .
Nicotine patches and chewing gums available on prescription and , now , sold over the counter are strictly regulated medicinal products designed for short - term use by people trying to quit .
They do not deliver the hit required to satisfy hardened smokers .
Tobacco companies have experimented with smokeless cigarettes , nicotine sprays and other devices , without success .
Smokers say the products have been unpleasant to taste , difficult to use and hard to smoke .
What is needed is a medicinal nicotine product designed not as a short - term crutch to support the quitter , but for long - term use as part of a " harm reduction " approach .
This idea is backed by the Royal College of Physicians and by Ash , the antismoking charity , but it causes disquiet among some public health experts who blanch at the prospect of condoning nicotine dependency .
Yet an effective medicinal product would be a better option than chewing tobacco .
The evidence suggests that nicotine is , if anything , less harmful than caffeine – if it carries less risk than a cup of coffee , where 's the problem in making it freely available in a more attractive form ?
And many in the health field are suspicious of the tobacco industry , believing that the promotion of sucking pouches is another way to keep us hooked on tobacco .
There are signs that the Government may be willing to listen .
Close readers of its cancer reform strategy , published last year , noted that the Department of Health said it would consult on measures " to reduce the significant harm to health caused by smoking for those who are addicted to nicotine and not able to quit altogether " .
Britton , who is the head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Nottingham , points to the lives such a strategy could save .
Of the 10 million current smokers in Britain , half will die prematurely if they do not quit .
He says : " If these people can be encouraged to use a safer product instead , the impact on public health would be huge .
If we end up with a society in which a lot of people use a safe nicotine product every day , so what ? "
When you ’re shopping at your local farmers ’ market or picking up this week ’s CSA box , do you get this nagging feeling that there ’s something more you can do to promote local food in your community ?
Feel the urge to active some activism for local food , but do n’t know where to start ?
Consider Patty Cantrell your local foods campaign advisor .
No hidden lobbying agenda or smoke and mirror political agenda , Cantrell wears her passion for growing healthy , economically vibrant communities through strengthening local food channels on an open sleeve .
“ Food is one of the most powerful ways to push the building of a healthy , local economy , ” explains Cantrell , Program Director of the Michigan Land Use Institute and a Food and Society Policy Fellow .
“ But this requires a significant shift in what economic developers and planners traditionally chase and prioritize , such as smokestack industries . ”
Communities with a healthy local food base will form the next generation of desirably , sought after places to live , argues Cantrell .
“ Increasing numbers of people today , particularly those in their 20s and 30s , prioritize where they want to live first and foremost , not just where they can get a job , ” explains Cantrell .
“ A healthy local food community proves to be an attractive , authentic appeal for moving to a certain area .
With increasing numbers of retired Baby Boomers resulting in less people in the workforce , communities will start competing to attract residents and those with a vibrant local food economy , from farmers ’ markets to restaurants showcasing area fare , will have a marketable advantage . ”
Cantrell believes we stand at a hopeful crossroad .
“ I see this economic shift in our near future from products to relationships where people consciously prioritize where and how something is grown or manufactured , ” Cantrell predicts .
“ Having a strong network of local producers gives authentic meaning to a community , and that is where the true value lies . ”
In the process of building local food assets and attractiveness , communities can grow green jobs in food and farm production and marketing , too .
Take your own food activism up a notch with these starter tips to grow your community ’s local food roots :
1. Do Your Homework
Research and collect examples of what ’s working in other communities and see what might apply to your community .
Woodbury , Iowa provides an inspiring example of a small Midwest community coming together to change their food system .
The Michigan Land Institute and the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies ( BALLE ) provide additional strong case studies and other resources .
2. Connect with Community Cash
Cantrell recommends seeking out community groups whose mission is to promote economic vitality , such as the chamber of commerce or county economic development association .
“ You will find allies out there , but sometimes it does require bringing new information to the table , ” advises Cantrell .
“ Economic developers historically have viewed farms and agriculture as part of the USDA , not as small businesses .
That perspective needs to change . ”
3. Organize a Task Force
Get together your local friends and allies and establish a “ task force ” to examine these local food issues .
Ideally this would be under the chamber of commerce or other community organization to give legitimacy and authority to your mission .
4. Rethink Land Use
Similar to economic developers , land use policies need to be reevaluated to better support local foods .
“ Agriculture has been defined from a zoning perspective as strictly producing commodity crops , which often works to the detriment of small - scale , on - farm start - ups such as agritourism enterprises , ” adds Cantrell .
“ Working with your planning and zoning officials to allow for more farm business activity , such as artisan cheese making or canning classes , is a great way to start ”
And here ’s a fine new resource from the Rocky Mountain Land Use Institute on how communities can encourage healthy food systems through zoning improvements
5. Continue Educational Outreach
“ Keep an open mind and keep connected with a variety of groups and organizations in your community , from University Extension to small business educators , ” Cantrell comments .
“ The positive spirit and intent of the local foods movement has the potential to bring diverse segments of the community together . ”

We ’re all going to die anyway , so at least do it like a man .
Meet ten manliest ways to die .
1 Steve Irwin : Impaled by a Stingray
Is it even possible to start a manly list about anything without the Crocodile Hunter ?
Steve died as manly as possible on 2006 , while filming a documentary entitled “ Ocean ’s Deadliest ” in Queensland ’s Great Barrier Reef .
His heart was impaled by nothing less than a short - tail stingray barb .
Of all the different ways to die , we ca n’t think of a manliest ; his legacy will impale us forever .
2 Eleazar Maccabeus : Crushed to death by a War Elephant
Here ’s a guy with balls of steel , just like his whole family .
During the Maccabean revolt , where Jewish people revolted against Seleucidic and Syrian rulers , Eleazar identified a war elephant that he believed to carry the Seleucid King Antiochus V –due to the special armor the elephant wore– so he decided to endanger his life by attacking the elephant and thrusting a spear into its belly .
Yes , the dead elephant then collapsed upon Eleazar , killing him as well , but remained a hero for eternity .
3 Empedocles : Jumped into a Volcano
Diogenes Laërtius records the legend that pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles died by throwing himself into an active volcano ( Mount Etna in Sicily ) , so that people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god ; however , the volcano threw back one of his bronze sandals , revealing the deceit .
Another legend has it that he threw himself in the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal ; he believed he would come back as a god among man after being devoured by the fire .
Ok , it did n’t work , but here we are talking about him , which makes him inmortal in a way .
4 J. G. Parry - Thomas : Died breaking a Speed Record
In 1927 , the Welsh racing driver J. G. Parry - Thomas was trying to regain his own world land speed record that had been broken just weeks earlier by Malcolm Campbell on the same beach of Pendine Sands .
His car , Babs , used exposed chains to connect the engine to the drive wheels while the high engine cover required him to drive with his head tilted to one side – the right .
On his final run the right - hand drive chain broke at a speed of 171 mph ( 270 km /h ) , setting a new record , but partially decapitating him as well .
5 Thích Quang Duc : Lit himself on Fire to make a point
Ok , we agree this was n’t the best way to protest , but he made his point .
On 1963 , Thích Quang Duc , a Vietnamese Buddhist monk , sat down in the middle of a busy intersection in Saigon , covered himself in gasoline , and lit himself on fire , burning himself to death .
He was protesting President Ngo Dinh Diem ’s administration for oppressing the Buddhist religion .
6 Kenji Urada : Killed by a Robot
After working on a broken robot at a Japanese Kawasaki plant , 37 - year old Kenji Urada forgot to turn it off .
Big mistake !
The Robot woke up , said “ hasta la vista ” , and pushed him into a grinding machine with its hydraulic arm .
Ok , he died , that ’s awful , but we ’ll always remember him as the man who second man ever to be killed by a Robot .
And by the way , the first ever , Robert Williams , went to hit himself with the robot ; not manly enough for our list .
7 Les Harvey : Killed by Rock and Roll
Out of all music styles , only Rock and Roll is manly enough to kill you .
On 1972 , scottish guitarist of Stone the Crows , Les Harvey , was rocking his guitar on stage with his band at the Top Rank Bingo club in Swansea , and then , rock and roll took his life : he was electrocuted by touching an unearthed microphone with wet hands .
8 Félix Faure : Killed by Sex
In 1899 , French president Félix Faure died of a stroke while in his office .
That ’s the official story , but it is popularly believed that he died in the arms of his 30 - year - old mistress Marguerite Steinheil , while receiving oral sex .
Au revoir !
9 Georg Richmann : Killed by a Ball Lightning
Yeah , that ’s right .
Richmann was a German physicist living in Russia .
On 1753 , created a kite flying apparatus similar to the one built by Benjamin Franklin a year earlier .
He was attending a meeting of the Academy of Sciences when he heard thunder , and ran home with his engraver to capture the event for posterity .
While the experiment was underway , ball lightning appeared and collided with Richmann ’s forehead .
He died , but we ’ll always remember him as the man who stood manly in the way of electricity .
10 Franz Reichelt : Fell to his death from Eiffel Tower while testing his invention
For being man enough to test his own invention and for giving us that AWESOME video , Franz Reichelt is number ten in our list .
Reichelt ( alias the flying tailor ) designed an overcoat to fly or float its wearer gently to the ground like the modern parachute .
To demonstrate his invention he made a jump of 60 meters from the first deck of the Eiffel Tower , at that time the tallest man-made structure in the world .
The parachute failed and Reichelt fell to his death .
But we ’ll always remember him for this video .

Two conflicting conceptions of feminine dignity ;
feminism as male - role - envy
By F. ROGER DEVLIN

More information appears below .
1 .
One of the hallmarks of Western civilization is the unusually high status it has accorded women .
That has often been attributed to the influence of Christianity , which prizes certain typically feminine virtues ( mercy , humility ) more than pagan society had .
But Tacitus had already noted the respect paid to women 's opinions as being typical of the pagan Germanic tribes of his time .
Some believe the regard paid to women to be a reflection of conditions in ancient Northern Europe , where the nuclear rather than the extended family was the more important economic unit .
But however it may have originated , women 's position in our civilization has recently been eroded by economic developments and by the feminist movement .
The present essay aims to explain how this has happened and argue the need to reverse the process .
Much confusion exists regarding the feminist attack upon women 's status , because the feminist movement has always presented itself to outsiders  usually with success  as an effort to improve that status .
Feminists , as we all know , assert that women are rightfully the " equals " of men and deserve a " level playing field " on which to compete with them .
In our time , it is a rare person whose notions about women 's claims remain wholly uninfluenced by these slogans ; that is true even of many who think of themselves as opponents of feminism .
For example , certain would - be defenders of Western civilization believe Islam presents a danger to us principally because it does not accept " equality of the sexes . "
Indeed , they sometimes make it sound as though they would have no objection to Islam if only Muslim girls were free to wear miniskirts , join the Army , and divorce their husbands .
Or again , many in the growing father 's movement describe their goal as implementing " true " equality rather than recovering their traditional role as family heads .
I have even known conservatives to earnestly assure young audiences that the idea of sexual equality comes to us from Christianity  a crueler slander upon the Faith than Voltaire or Nietzsche ever imagined .
The extreme case of such confusion can be found in " mainstream " conservatives such as William Kristol , who claims to oppose feminism on the grounds that its more exotic manifestations " threaten women 's recent gains " : in other words , the problem with feminism is that it endangers feminism .
It is difficult to combat a movement whose fundamental premises one accepts .
In fact , the high standing of women in our civilization not only long predates feminist ideology but is logically incompatible with it .
To understand why , one needs to keep two points in mind : 1 ) women 's traditional status was linked to behavioral expectations  fulfilling the duties of their station ; and 2 ) it assumed qualitative differences and complementarity ( rather than " fair " competition ) between the sexes .
As to the first point : strictly speaking , it was never women as such who enjoyed high status but rather the social roles proper to them  those of wife and mother , chiefly .
Being born female ( or male ) is merely a natural fact of no intrinsic moral significance , but the filling of a social role involves effort and often sacrifice .
Accordingly , the respect paid to women was not an unconditional birthright ; it was reserved for women who fulfilled their feminine obligations .
Among those obligations , marital fidelity was of supreme importance : so much so that in our language general terms such as virtue and morality have often been used to refer specifically to sexual fidelity in women .
That is owing not to irrational prudery , as the apostles of sexual liberation imagined , but to the recognition that all which is necessary to destroy a race and civilization is for its women to refuse to be faithful wives and mothers .
The Western tradition also includes a strong presumption that women wish to fulfill their role ; in other words , women are assumed to be " virtuous " until proven otherwise .
In certain eras it was dangerous even to suggest that a lady might not be a paragon of sexual self - restraint if one did not have very strong proofs : an aspersion upon a woman 's honor was grounds for a duel .
Of course , that does not make much sense when women have no honor ; and today , the proponents of equality and liberation openly repudiate the very idea as an " oppressive social construct . "
But to be frank , I suspect honor never was actually the primary determinant of women 's behavior .
Good example ( especially from their mothers ) , habit , lack of opportunity , religious instruction , and , in the last instance , the prospect of social disgrace and financial ruin were probably always more effective with them .
Men , however , have often been encouraged to believe that women are naturally monogamous , unmotivated by anything so base as sexual attraction , and only seek " good husbands " whom they disinterestedly marry out of love .
This pleasing and edifying view of womanhood is the basis of the West 's cultural forms surrounding relations between the sexes : gallantry , chivalry , courtship , and companionate marriage .
These are what place love , in Edmund Burke 's phrase , " if not among the virtues , among the ornaments of life . "
There are also certain more practical , if less delicate , considerations involved : viz. , if a husband trusts his wife , he can skip rushing home from the office unannounced to make sure she is not in bed with the gardener .
That leaves him free to devote his full attention to his own role as breadwinner for children he is sure are his own .
The socially beneficial effects of the chivalrous view of womanhood are quite independent of its accuracy .
There is not necessarily any pre-established harmony between what is true and what it is useful for men to believe .
A man may be better off not knowing the whole truth about women  even , or perhaps especially , his wife .
But most women cooperated enthusiastically in promoting the chivalrous view , even if they were not taken in by it themselves .
That is partly because they have been shrewd enough to perceive the advantages of maintaining a high reputation with men and partly because they are naturally more reticent than men about their sexual urges ( " modest " ) .
But whether based upon knowledge or pleasing illusion , the regard in which our civilization has held women depends utterly upon their practice of monogamy , and makes no sense apart from it .
As long as cases of female adultery were few enough , they could be passed off to men as freaks of nature , akin to two - headed babies .
When , on the other hand , wives in their millions act upon the feminist plan of " liberation , " walk out on their husbands , separate them from their children , bankrupt them in divorce court , and shack up with other men , that system breaks down .
That is where we are today .
To my mind , the most remarkable feature of the revolution we have undergone is the time lag between the changes in women 's behavior and changes in men's attitude toward them .
Men often strain to blame their own sex for what has gone wrong , though the natural disadvantage of the male 's position makes his primary responsibility unlikely on a priori grounds : since women have greater control over the mating process , they are inherently likelier than men to be at the root of any fundamental breakdown in family formation and stability .
It seems that many men have an emotional need to believe in the inherent virtue or innocence of women , a bit of sentimentality akin to the Romantics ' cult of childhood .
Even today , under a burgeoning feminist police - state , male commentators not infrequently berate their own sex for an allegedly insufficient appreciation of the lofty claims of womanhood .
The kindest thing one might say of such men is that they are condemning themselves to irrelevance .
A somewhat less kind judgment might be that they are collaborators .
The chivalrous view of women is helpful for keeping in check the naturally wayward desires of young husbands in a substantially monogamous society ; it is useless or positively harmful in a society being run by spoiled and tyrannical females who have " liberated " themselves from domestic obligations .
As usual , conservatives are busy calling for the barn door to be shut long after the horse has run off .
Our task today is not to " safeguard " or " protect " marriage but to rebuild it almost from scratch .
The strategy for doing so will necessarily be different from the strategy for defending it when it was merely under threat .
2 .
Let us now turn to our second point about women 's traditional status : namely , that it implied sexual complementarity and cooperation .
This means that their status cannot be maintained once complementarity is displaced by a normative ideal of sexual equivalence and competition .
The feminist movement has , of course , effected precisely such a displacement , thereby undermining the respect for women they claim to promote .
I will now try to explain how that happened .
First , a caveat : most critical discussions of feminism concentrate on refuting its doctrines , such as the ascription of feminine traits to upbringing rather than nature .
My approach will be different .
While such formal refutation of doctrines is not valueless , it seems to me to mistake the fundamental character of feminism .
The feminist movement consists essentially not of ideas at all but of attitudes , or even mere emotions .
Feminist " theory , " as it is grandiloquently called , is simply whatever the women in the movement come up with in post facto justification of their attitudes and emotions .
A heavy focus on feminist doctrine seems to me symptomatic of the rationalist fallacy : the assumption that people are motivated primarily by beliefs .
If they were , the best way to combat an armed doctrine would indeed be to demonstrate that its beliefs are false .
But in the case of feminism , even more than Marxism and other political ideologies , it is rather the beliefs that are motivated by various personal and nonrational needs .
I propose , therefore , that feminism may be better understood through a consideration of the feminist herself .
A feminist in the strict and proper sense may be defined as a woman who envies the male role .
By the male role I mean , in the first place , providing , protecting , and guiding rather than nurturing and assisting .
This in turn involves relative independence , action , and competition in the larger impersonal society outside the family , the use of language for communication and analysis ( rather than expressiveness or emotional manipulation ) , and deliberate behavior aiming at objective achievement ( rather than the attainment of pleasant subjective states ) and guided by practical reasoning ( rather than emotional impulse ) .
Both feminist and nonfeminist women sense that these characteristically male attributes have a natural primacy over their own .
I prefer to speak of " primacy " rather than superiority in this context since both sets of traits are necessary to propagate the race .
One sign of male primacy is that envy of the female role by men is virtually nonexistent  even , so far as I know , among homosexuals .
Normal women are attracted to male traits and wish to partner with a man who possesses them .
Healthy societies are marked by a cooperative reciprocity between the sexes , but an unequal one in the sense that it involves male leadership of the female , somewhat as in ballroom dancing .
The feminists ' response to the primacy of male traits , on the other hand , is a feeling of inadequacy in regard to men  a feeling ill - disguised by defensive assertions of her " equality . "
She desires to possess masculinity directly , in her own person , rather than partnering with a man .
That is what leads her into the spiritual cul de sac of envy .
And perhaps even more than she envies the male role itself , the feminist covets the external rewards attached to its successful performance : social status , recognition , power , wealth , and the chance to control wealth directly ( rather than be supported ) .
She tends not to give much thought to the great mass of men who struggle to fulfill the demands of their role without ever attaining the rewards of superior performance .
Let us consider next what envy is .
First , it involves a painful awareness of something good or desirable in another person .
This much it has in common with emulation .
The emulator , however , is primarily concerned with self - improvement .
Envy has a fundamentally negative character ; it wants to bring the other down rather than raise itself up .
The envier usually does not admit that explicitly but rather claims to have been cheated , whether by the envied party or by the surrounding society : he disguises his envy as a zeal for justice .
Often he claims to want to compete on a level playing field , but maintains that competition has been " fixed . "
Envy , however , is distinct from the sense of justice in being fundamentally unappeasable .
The righteously indignant person genuinely wants to come to a settlement .
By contrast , if the envied party grants what the envier demands , it merely further demonstrates his superiority and provokes more envy .
One reason the feminists have gotten as far as they have is that many men are untroubled by envy themselves .
These men cannot understand the psychology behind feminism .
Sincerely caring about women and wishing to promote their welfare , they waste effort on futile attempts to reason or compromise .
They imagine that limited concessions might persuade feminists that men are not really so bad after all .
But it is a metaphysical impossibility to " grant " what a feminist envies : the successful performance of the male role including risk overcome , obstacles surmounted , and objectively verifiable achievement .
What the appeasers actually do is grant women some of the external appearances and rewards of such achievement .
That is the meaning of corporate hiring and promotional preferences .
But a little reflection will reveal why such concessions can never satisfy the feminist .
She is humiliated precisely by the awareness that her advancement is an unearned act of charity on the part of the hated " patriarchy . "
It would be difficult to imagine , in fact , a more efficient means of stoking her frustration and resentment .
( The situation with racial preferences , incidentally , is precisely analogous : thus , one book on Black beneficiaries of " affirmative action " is aptly titled The Rage of a Privileged Class . )
Indeed , concessions are perceived as signs of weakness , and whet the appetite for more concessions , a cycle that could only end with the complete self - destruction of the envied party .
In other words , feminists ' claim to be motivated by love of justice or fairness is flapdoodle .
Feminism is a species not of righteous indignation but of hatred .
In practice , since the feminist can never be the equal of men at the male role , she concentrates her efforts upon sabotaging that role .
In other words , because she cannot level up , she contents herself as best she can with leveling down .
So the practical consequence of feminist political power is to make it impossible for men to " do their thing " ( fulfill their role ) .
For example , women may not be able to have careers as glamorous and successful as they imagined , but one accusation of " harassment " is all it takes to destroy the career of a man whose accomplishments she could never equal .
And there is no question that many women get a sadistic pleasure from wielding such power .
I myself once heard a woman boast of getting three different men fired .
A whole legal industry has mushroomed within a single generation based upon newly invented crimes and torts of which only men can be guilty and only women can be victims .
Obviously , the Western tradition of high regard for women is not going to survive the spread of such behavior indefinitely .
Women who wonder why men do not seem to " respect " them any more might seek the answer in the mirror .
Envy of the male role has devastating consequences for women 's performance of their own proper role as well .
Although it may be a secondary or supporting one in relation to men , it is indispensable for the survival of the race : the woman bears , nurtures , and to a great extent educates the rising generation .
The feminist either refuses to fulfill her natural role or at best does so resentfully , sullenly , and poorly .
For that reason , feminism should not be treated merely as a personal folly on the part of some misguided or spoiled women  it is a mortal threat to any society in which it truly takes hold .
Enemies of heterosexual cooperation and procreation are enemies of the human race .

Stocks down again ?
Do n't worry , even large fluctuations are totally normal .
Here 's why stocks go down , what to do about it , and what you should avoid .
I ’m an optimist , but seeing a lot of money disappear can be absolutely frightening .
So after the latest drop in stocks , I thought I ’d share my thoughts here .
if you invest , you ’re going to lose money at some point .
That ’s ok–especially when you ’re young because time helps mitigate loss if you have a good investment .
But ideally , it should n’t be happening very often , and when it does , it still sucks .
If you ’re worried about your personal finances , you can improve them without even leaving your couch .
Check out my Ultimate Guide to Personal Finance for tips you can implement TODAY .
Now check this out :
I was listening to some personal - finance pundits talking about the down markets , and more than one of them said the equivalent of , “ If a stock drops 8 % ( or 10 % , or 12 % ) , I ’m out of there . ”
What the hell ?
Here ’s the example one of them gave .
Try to figure out the answers before you go on :
“ If your stock does down from 100 to 50 , what percentage have you lost ?
Now , to get back up to 100 , what percentage does your stock have to increase ? ”
Answers :
It ’s gone down 50 % and it has to increase 100 % just to break even .
( If it only increased by 50 % , it would be at 75 . )
Most beginning investors get this wrong .
It ’s a good lesson , but I think one - size - fits - all advice is dumb .
I went roaming around to find some data to prove otherwise , so check out this Apple graph I took from finance .
yahoo.com :
Now , let ’s just eyeball it .
Clearly , the stock has done very well in the last few years of the graph .
But let ’s look at the period from 1995 - 1998 , during which time Apple dropped from about 17 to about 10 .
That is a big , big loss of about 41 % .
But because I cherry - picked this example to prove my point , I know that ’s not the whole story .
Apple closed at $ 188 , and it ’s split twice since that noted low point in 1998 .
Now there are a few things about this example :
First if you really think stock - picking is about looking at charts and guessing –especially retroactively –then you are going to lose a lot of money for being a moron .
This is just a superficial analysis to give an example .
Second , had you sold when Apple was down , you would have missed out on a lot of money .
If you ’re worried about your personal finances , you can improve them without even leaving your couch .

“ But Ramit , ” you might say , “ I would n’t know it was going to go up at that time !
I did the best I could . ”
Well , true .
In hindsight , everything ’s clearer .
“ But Ramit , ” you might say , “ when should I sell a stock then ? ” I ’ve written about that here .
“ But Ramit , ” you might say , “ what are you saying ?
You told us you lost a lot of money .
So are you just going to let your money sit there ?
Is n’t this just an excuse for being lazy and overly optimistic that your stock picks are really good ? ”
Now , this is a good question .
It ’s possible I ’m committing lots of cognitive and decision - making errors .
What you need to ask yourself is , “ Are these still good companies and good investments ? ”
If so , and you have the risk tolerance and time to ride the storm , great .
If not , your options are more limited , which is why it pays to invest earlier .
In fact , if you think the companies are good companies , they ’re on sale right now .

I want to show you something that hardly anybody knows .
It ’s research from Standard and Poor ’s , the S&P behind the S&P 500 .
In 2002 , they released an astonishing finding that made most investors ’ jaws drop :
During a 10 - year period they studied if you missed the best days of that 10 - year period , your returns would be cut in astonishing ways .
For example ,
If you missed the best 5 days of that 10 - year period , your return would be down 22.65 % .
If you missed the best 10 days , your return would be 37.65 %
And it just gets worse for missing the best 15 , 20 , and 30 days of a 10 - year period .
Here ’s a pretty picture :
If you think you can figure out exactly when those 10 days will fall in 10 years , then you are much smarter than I am .
Do n’t try to time the market .
But do n’t just sit around , either :
If you suffer a relatively big loss in your portfolio ( how big ?
you ’ll know when it happens ) , it would probably be dumb to just saunter around outside with your hands in your pockets , whistling and skipping .
Take some action :
1 . I spent part of last weekend doing an analysis of my current holdings to see if they still meet my investment criteria .
( They do , except one company , which I ’m not sure I would invest in knowing what I know now . )
2 . If I had properly diversified my investments , I would n’t have been hit as hard as I was .
I ’d been meaning to diversify into more non-tech stuff , including international funds , so I ’m treating this as a kick in the ass to get this done .
If you already have stocks , you can do this by either adding more money in different areas , or shifting current holdings to new areas .
A French unit was surrounded last weekend in Kapisa Province Afghanistan and had to withdraw from the field , leaving behind two anti-tank Milan missiles and a launcher .
Journalists say no French soldiers were hurt in the clash , but “ all 14 Taliban insurgents were killed . ”
French Defense Minister Herve Morin sought to downplay the significance of the loss , saying “ the essential thing is that everyone is alive , ” and that it would be difficult for anyone to use the captured missiles “ without proper training . ”
Still unclear from the reports are how 14 Taliban surrounded 300 French soldiers , or why the forces had to withdraw after having killed all 14 insurgents .
Even less clear is why the French paramilitary units were armed with anti-tank missiles in the first place .
Though the Taliban had tanks at one point , they were seemingly all destroyed during the 2001 invasion , and not a single insurgent attack involving tanks has been reported in the years since then .
The National Hurricane Centre in the United States has warned residents of Galveston , Texas , living in homes higher than a single storey that they " face certain death " if they do not flee before Hurricane Ike comes ashore from the Gulf of Mexico .
Across wide areas of coastal Texas , hundreds of thousands of people have been taking heed of the advice of emergency officials to leave their homes for safety further inland .
Hurricane
Ike is generating winds of 160 kilometres an hour , and is growing in strength as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico .
" All neighbourhoods and possibly entire coastal communities will be inundated during the period of peak storm tide , " the National Hurricane Centre said in a statement .
" Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single family one or two - storey homes will face certain death . "
Texans , mindful of the devastation caused to the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , are not taking any chances with a storm which has already left 800,000 people in Haiti in urgent need of food and shelter .
" We 're getting up out of here , " said Nykera Allen , a Galveston student who was loading up her car to drive to San Antonio in central Texas .
" They 're going to shut the lights and the water off and that 's not a good situation . "
The hurricane 's current track would see it hit the Texas coast near Freeport in Brazoria County , just south of Galveston .
It could be the worst storm to hit the Texas coast since Hurricane Carla came ashore near Corpus Christi in 1961 .
The coastal areas under threat from Ike are lined with oil refineries that process about 25 per cent of the nation 's fuel .
Some stretches boast resorts and million - dollar beachfront homes .
Ike arrives just 10 days after Hurricane Gustav forced 2 million people to flee the Louisiana coast and threatened a New Orleans still reeling from Katrina 's devastation .
" The most important message I can send is , do not take this storm lightly , " US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said in Washington .
" This is not a storm to gamble with . "

A Practical Guide to GPL Compliance

1 Executive Summary
This is a guide to effective compliance with the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and related licenses .
In accordance with the Software Freedom Law Center ’s ( SFLC ’s ) philosophy of assisting the community with GPL compliance cooperatively , this guide focuses on avoiding compliance actions and minimizing the negative impact when enforcement actions occur .
It introduces and explains basic legal concepts related to the GPL and its enforcement by copyright holders .
It also outlines business practices and methods that lead to better GPL compliance .
Finally , it recommends proper post-violation responses to the concerns of copyright holders .
2 Background
Early GPL enforcement efforts began soon after the GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 , and consisted of informal community efforts , often in public Usenet discussions .
Over the next decade , the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , which holds copyrights in many GNU programs , was the only visible entity actively enforcing its GPL ’d copyrights on behalf of the community of Free / Libre and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) developers .
FSF ’s enforcement was generally a private process ; the FSF contacted violators confidentially and helped them to comply with the license .
Most violations were pursued this way until the early 2000’s .
By that time , Linux - based systems had become very common , particularly in embedded devices such as wireless routers .
During this period , public ridicule of violators in the press and on Internet fora supplemented ongoing private enforcement and increased pressure on businesses to comply .
In 2003 , the FSF formalized its efforts into the GPL Compliance Lab , increased the volume of enforcement , and built community coalitions to encourage copyright holders to together settle amicably with violators .
Beginning in 2004 , Harald Welte took a more organized public enforcement approach and launched gpl- violations.org , a website and mailing list for collecting reports of GPL violations .
On the basis of these reports , Welte successfully pursued many enforcements in Europe , including formal legal action .
In 2007 , the SFLC filed the first U.S. copyright infringement lawsuit based on a violation of the GPL .
While the lawsuits filed by SFLC on behalf of its clients have been quite public , SFLC resolves the vast majority of enforcement actions privately via cooperative communications with violators .
As we have worked to bring individual companies into compliance , we have encountered numerous violations resulting from preventable problems such as inadequate attention to licensing of upstream software , misconceptions about the GPL ’s terms , and poor communication between software developers and their management .
In this document , we highlight these problems and describe best practices to encourage corporate users of FOSS to reevaluate their approach to GPL ’d software and avoid future violations .
SFLC continues to conduct GPL enforcement and compliance efforts for many of its clients who release their software under the GPL , the GNU Lesser Public License ( LGPL ) and other copyleft licenses .
In doing so , we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be , for the most part , easily avoided .
We hope to educate the community of commercial distributors , redistributors , and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place , and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs .
3 Best Practices to Avoid Common Violations
Unlike highly permissive FOSS licenses ( such as the ISC license ) , which typically only require preservation of copyright notices , the GPL places a number of important requirements upon licensees .
These requirements are carefully designed to uphold certain values and standards of the software freedom community .
While the GPL ’s requirements may appear initially counter - intuitive to those more familiar with proprietary software licenses , by comparison its terms are in fact clear and favorable to licensees .
The terms of the GPL actually simplify compliance when violations occur .
GPL violations are often caused or compounded by a failure to adopt sound practices for the incorporation of GPL ’d components into a company ’s internal development environment .
In this section , we introduce some best practices for software tool selection , integration and distribution , inspired by and congruent with FOSS methodologies .
We suggest companies establish such practices before building a product based on GPL ’d software .
3.1 Evaluate License Applicability
Political discussion about the GPL often centers around the “ copyleft ” requirements of the license .
Indeed , the license was designed primarily to embody this licensing feature .
Most companies adding non-trivial features ( beyond mere porting and bug - fixing ) to GPL ’d software , and thereby implicating these requirements , are already well aware of their more complex obligations under the license .
However , in our experience with GPL enforcement , few redistributors ’ compliance challenges relate directly to the copyleft provisions ; this is doubly true for most embedders .
Instead , the distributions of GPL ’d systems that we encounter typically consist of a full operating system including components under the GPL ( e.g. , Linux , BusyBox ) and components under the LGPL ( e.g. , the GNU C Library ) .
Sometimes , these programs have been patched or slightly improved by direct modification of their sources , resulting unequivocally in a derivative work .
Alongside these programs , companies often distribute fully independent , proprietary programs , developed from scratch , which are designed to run on the FOSS operating system but do not combine with , link to , modify , or otherwise derive from the GPL ’d components .
In the latter case , where the work is unquestionably a separate work of creative expression , no derivative work has been created .
The tiny minority of situations which lie outside these two categories , and thus involve close questions about derivative works , require a highly fact - dependent analysis and cannot be addressed in a general - purpose document .
Most companies accused of violations , however , lack a basic understanding of how to comply even in the straightforward scenario .
This document provides that fundamental and generally applicable prerequisite knowledge .
For answers to rarer and more complicated legal questions , such as whether your software is a derivative work of some copylefted software , consult with an attorney .
For this discussion , we will assume that you have already identified the “ work ” covered by the license , and that any components not under the GPL ( e.g. , applications written entirely by your developers that merely happen to run on a Linux - based operating system ) distributed in conjunction with those works are separate works within the meaning of copyright law .
In such a case , the GPL requires you to provide complete and corresponding source for the GPL ’d components and your modifications thereto , but not for independent proprietary applications .
The procedures described in this document address this typical scenario .
3.2 Monitor Software Acquisition
Software engineers should have the freedom to innovate and import useful software components to improve your product .
However , along with that freedom should come rules and reporting procedures to make sure that you are aware of what software is being tested or included with your product .
The companies we contact about GPL violations often respond with : “ We did n’t know there was GPL ’d stuff in there ” .
This answer indicates a failure in the software acquisition and procurement process .
Integration of third - party proprietary software typically requires a formal arrangement and management / legal oversight before the developers incorporate the software .
By contrast , your developers often obtain and integrate FOSS without intervention .
The ease of acquisition , however , does not mean the oversight is any less necessary .
Just as your legal and / or management team negotiates terms for inclusion of any proprietary software , they should be involved in all decisions to bring FOSS into your product .
Simple , engineering - oriented rules help provide a stable foundation for FOSS integration .
Ask your software developers to send an email to a standard place describing each new FOSS component they add to the system , and have them include a brief description of how they will incorporate it into the product .
Make sure they use a revision control system , and have store the upstream versions of all software in a “ vendor branch ” or similar mechanism , whereby they can easily track and find the main version of the software and local changes made .
Such procedures are best instituted at your project ’s launch .
Once a chaotic and poorly - sourced development process has begun , the challenges of determining and cataloging the presence of GPL ’d components is difficult .
If you are in that situation , we recommend the Fossology system , which analyzes a source - code base and produces a list of FOSS licenses that may apply to the code .
Fossology can help you build a catalog of the sources you have already used to build your product .
You can then expand that into a more structured inventory and process .
3.3 Track Your Changes and Releases
As we will explain in further detail below , the most important component to maintaining GPL compliance is inclusion of the complete and corresponding source code in any distributions that you make of GPL ’d software .
Knowing at all times what sources generated a given binary distribution is paramount .
In an unfortunately large number of our enforcement cases , the violating company ’s engineering team had difficulty reconstructing the precise sources for a given binary distributed by the company .
Ensure that your developers are using revision control systems properly .
Have them mark or tag the full source tree corresponding to builds distributed to customers .
Finally , check that your developers store all parts of the software development in the revision control system , including readmes , build scripts , engineers ’ notes , and documentation .
Your developers will also benefit from a system that tracks the precise version of source that corresponds to any deployed binary .
3.4 Avoid the “ Build Guru ”
Too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product .
Such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues , but it also endangers GPL compliance , which requires you to provide build scripts .
Avoid relying on a “ build guru ” , a single developer who is the only one who knows how to produce your final product .
Make sure the build process is well defined .
Train every developer on the build process for the final binary distribution , including ( in the case of embedded software ) generating a final firmware image suitable for distribution to the customer .
Require developers to use revision control for build processes .
Make a rule that adding new components to the system without adequate build instructions ( or better yet , scripts ) is unacceptable engineering practice .
4 Details of Compliant Distribution
In this section , we explain the specific requirements placed upon distributors of GPL ’d software .
Note that this section refers heavily to specific provisions and language in GPLv2 and GPLv3 .
It may be helpful to have a copy of each license open while reading this section .
4.1 Binary Distribution Permission
The various versions of the GPL are copyright licenses that grant permission to make certain uses of software that are otherwise restricted by copyright law .
This permission is conditioned upon compliance with the GPL ’s requirements .
This section walks through the requirements ( of both GPLv2 and GPLv3 ) that apply when you distribute GPL ’d programs in binary ( i.e. , executable or object code ) form , which is typical for embedded applications .
Because a binary application derives from a program ’s original sources , you need permission from the copyright holder to distribute it .
§ 3 of GPLv2 and § 6 of GPLv3 contain the permissions and conditions related to binary distributions of GPL ’d programs .
GPL ’s binary distribution sections offer a choice of compliance methods , each of which we consider in turn .
Each option refers to the “ Corresponding Source ” code for the binary distribution , which includes the source code from which the binary was produced .
This abbreviated and simplified definition is sufficient for the binary distribution discussion in this section , but you may wish to refer back to this section after reading the thorough discussion of “ Corresponding Source ” that appears in § 4.2 .
4.1.1 Option ( a ) : Source Alongside Binary
GPLv2 § 3 ( a ) and v3 § 6 ( a ) embody the easiest option for providing source code : including Corresponding Source with every binary distribution .
While other options appear initially less onerous , this option invariably minimizes potential compliance problems , because when you distribute Corresponding Source with the binary , your GPL obligations are satisfied at the time of distribution .
This is not true of other options , and for this reason , we urge you to seriously consider this option .
If you do not , you may extend the duration of your obligations far beyond your last binary distribution .
Compliance under this option is straightforward .
If you ship a product that includes binary copies of GPL ’d software ( e.g. , in firmware , or on a hard drive , CD , or other permanent storage medium ) , you can store the Corresponding Source alongside the binaries .
Alternatively , you can include the source on a CD or other removable storage medium in the box containing the product .
GPLv2 refers to the various storage mechanisms as “ medi[ a ] customarily used for software interchange ” .
While the Internet has attained primacy as a means of software distribution where super - fast Internet connections are available , GPLv2 was written at a time when downloading software was not practical ( and was often impossible ) .
For much of the world , this condition has not changed since GPLv2 ’s publication , and the Internet still cannot be considered “ a medium customary for software interchange ” .
GPLv3 clarifies this matter , requiring that source be “ fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange ” .
This language affirms that option ( a ) requires binary redistributors to provide source on a physical medium .
Please note that while selection of option ( a ) requires distribution on a physical medium , voluntary distribution via the Internet is very useful .
This is discussed in detail in § 4.1.2 .
4.1.2 Option ( b ) : The Offer
Many distributors prefer to ship only an offer for source with the binary distribution , rather than the complete source package .
This option has value when the cost of source distribution is a true per-unit cost .
For example , this option might be a good choice for embedded products with permanent storage too small to fit the source , and which are not otherwise shipped with a CD but are shipped with a manual or other printed material .
However , this option increases the duration of your obligations dramatically .
An offer for source must be good for three full years from your last binary distribution ( under GPLv2 ) , or your last binary or spare part distribution ( under GPLv3 ) .
Your source code request and provisioning system must be designed to last much longer than your product life cycle .
In addition , if you are required to comply with the terms of GPL v2 , you cannot use a network service to provide the source code .
For GPL v2 , the source code offer is fulfilled only with physical media .
This usually means that you must continue to produce an up - to - date “ source code CD ” for years after the product ’s end - of - life .
Under GPLv2 , it is acceptable and advisable for your offer for source code to include an Internet link for downloadable source in addition to offering source on a physical medium .
This practice enables those with fast network connections to get the source more quickly , and typically decreases the number of physical media fulfillment requests .
( GPLv3 § 6 ( b ) permits provision of source with a public network - accessible distribution only and no physical media .
We discuss this in detail at the end of this section . )
The following is a suggested compliant offer for source under GPL v2 ( and is also acceptable for GPLv3 ) that you would include in your printed materials accompanying each binary distribution :
The software included in this product contains copyrighted software that is licensed under the GPL .
A copy of that license is included in this document on page X .
You may obtain the complete Corresponding Source code from us for a period of three years after our last shipment of this product , which will be no earlier than 2011 - 08 - 01 , by sending a money order or check for $ 5 to :
GPL Compliance Division
Our Company
Any Town , US 99999
Please write “ source for product Y ” in the memo line of your payment .
You may also find a copy of the source at http://www.example.com/sources/Y/.
This offer is valid to anyone in receipt of this information .
There are a few important details about this offer .
First , it requires a copying fee .
GPL v2 permits “ a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution ” .
This fee must be reasonable .
If your cost of copying and mailing a CD is more than around $ 10 , you should perhaps find a cheaper CD stock and shipment method .
It is simply not in your interest to try to overcharge the community .
Abuse of this provision in order to make a for - profit enterprise of source code provision will likely trigger enforcement action .
Second , note that the last line makes the offer valid to anyone who requests the source .
This is because v2 § 3 ( b ) requires that offers be “ to give any third party ” a copy of the Corresponding Source .
GPLv3 has a similar requirement , stating that an offer must be valid for “ anyone who possesses the object code ” .
These requirements indicated in v2 § 3 ( c ) and v3 § 6 ( c ) are so that non-commercial redistributors may pass these offers along with their distributions .
Therefore , the offers must be valid not only to your customers , but also to anyone who received a copy of the binaries from them .
Many distributors overlook this requirement and assume that they are only required to fulfill a request from their direct customers .
The option to provide an offer for source rather than direct source distribution is a special benefit to companies equipped to handle a fulfillment process .
GPLv2 § 3 ( c ) and GPLv3 § 6 ( c ) avoid burdening noncommercial , occasional redistributors with fulfillment request obligations by allowing them to pass along the offer for source as they received it .
Note that commercial redistributors cannot avail themselves of the option ( c ) exception , and so while your offer for source must be good to anyone who receives the offer ( under v2 ) or the object code ( under v3 ) , it cannot extinguish the obligations of anyone who commercially redistributes your product .
The license terms apply to anyone who distributes GPL ’d software , regardless of whether they are the original distributor .
Take the example of Vendor V , who develops a software platform from GPL ’d sources for use in embedded devices .
Manufacturer M contracts with V to install the software as firmware in M ’s device .
V provides the software to M , along with a compliant offer for source .
In this situation , M can not simply pass V ’s offer for source along to its customers .
M also distributes the GPL ’d software commercially , so M too must comply with the GPL and provide source ( or M ’s own offer for source ) to M ’s customers .
This situation illustrates that the offer for source is often a poor choice for products that your customers will likely redistribute .
If you include the source itself with the products , then your distribution to your customers is compliant , and their ( unmodified ) distribution to their customers is likewise compliant , because both include source .
If you include only an offer for source , your distribution is compliant but your customer ’s distribution does not “ inherit ” that compliance , because they have not made their own offer to accompany their distribution .
The terms related to the offer for source are quite different if you distribute under GPLv3 .
Under v3 , you may make source available only over a network server , as long as it is available to the general public and remains active for three years from the last distribution of your product or related spare part .
Accordingly , you may satisfy your fulfillment obligations via Internet - only distribution .
This makes the “ offer for source ” option less troublesome for v3 - only distributions , easing compliance for commercial redistributors .
However , before you switch to a purely Internet - based fulfillment process , you must first confirm that you can actually distribute all of the software under GPLv3 .
Some programs are indeed licensed under “ GPL v2 , or any later version ” ( often abbreviated “ GPLv2 - or - later ” ) .
Such licensing gives you the option to redistribute under GPLv3 .
However , a few popular programs are only licensed under GPLv2 and not “ or any later version ” ( “ GPLv2 -only ” ) .
You cannot provide only Internet - based source request fulfillment for the latter programs .
If you determine that all GPL ’d works in your whole product allow upgrade to GPLv3 ( or were already GPLv3 ’d to start ) , your offer for source may be as simple as this :
The software included in this product contains copyrighted software that is licensed under the GPLv3 .
A copy of that license is included in this document on page X .
You may obtain the complete Corresponding Source code from us for a period of three years after our last shipment of this product and / or spare parts therefor , which will be no earlier than 2011 - 08 - 01 , on our website at http://www.example.com/sources/productnum/.
Under both GPLv2 and GPLv3 , source offers must be accompanied by a copy of the license itself , either electronically or in print , with every distribution .
Finally , it is unacceptable to use option ( b ) merely because you do not have Corresponding Source ready .
We find that some companies chose this option because writing an offer is easy , but producing a source distribution as an afterthought to a hasty development process is difficult .
The offer for source does not exist as a stop - gap solution for companies rushing to market with an out - of - compliance product .
If you ship an offer for source with your product but cannot actually deliver immediately on that offer when your customers receive it , you should expect an enforcement action .
4.1.3 Option ( c ) : Noncommercial Offers
As discussed in the last section , GPLv2 § 3 ( c ) and GPLv3 § 6 ( c ) apply only to noncommercial use .
These options are not available to businesses distributing GPL ’d software .
Consequently , companies who redistribute software packaged for them by an upstream vendor cannot merely pass along the offer they received from the vendor ; they must provide their own offer or corresponding source to their distributees .
We talk in detail about upstream software providers in § 7.2 .
4.1.4 Option 6(d ) in GPLv3 : Internet Distribution
Under GPLv2 , your formal provisioning options for Corresponding Source ended with § 3 ( c ) .
But even under GPLv2 , pure Internet source distribution was a common practice and generally considered to be compliant .
GPLv2 mentions Internet - only distribution almost as aside in the language , in text at the end of the section after the three provisioning options are listed .
To quote that part of GPLv2 § 3 :
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place , then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code , even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code .
When that was written in 1991 , Internet distribution of software was the exception , not the rule .
Some FTP sites existed , but generally software was sent on magnetic tape or CDs .
GPLv2 therefore mostly assumed that binary distribution happened on some physical media .
By contrast , GPLv3 § 6 ( d ) explicitly gives an option for this practice that the community has historically considered GPLv2 - compliant .
Thus , you may fulfill your source - provision obligations by providing the source code in the same way and from the same location .
When exercising this option , you are not obligated to ensure that users download the source when they download the binary , and you may use separate servers as needed to fulfill the requests as long as you make the source as accessible as the binary .
However , you must ensure that users can easily find the source code at the time they download the binary .
GPLv3 § 6 (d ) thus clarifies a point that has caused confusion about source provision in v2 .
Indeed , many such important clarifications are included in v3 which together provide a compelling reason for authors and redistributors alike to adopt GPLv3 .
4.1.5 Option 6(e ) in GPLv3 : Software Torrents
Peer - to - peer file sharing arose well after GPL v2 was written , and does not easily fit any of the v2 source provision options .
GPLv3 § 6(e ) addresses this issue , explicitly allowing for distribution of source and binary together on a peer - to - peer file sharing network .
If you distribute solely via peer - to - peer networks , you can exercise this option .
However , peer - to - peer source distribution cannot fulfill your source provision obligations for non -peer - to - peer binary distributions .
Finally , you should ensure that binaries and source are equally seeded upon initial peer - to - peer distribution .
4.2 Preparing Corresponding Source
Most enforcement cases involve companies that have unfortunately not implemented procedures like our § 3 recommendations and have no source distribution arranged at all .
These companies must work backwards from a binary distribution to come into compliance .
Our recommendations in § 3 are designed to make it easy to construct a complete and Corresponding Source release from the outset .
If you have followed those principles in your development , you can meet the following requirements with ease .
If you have not , you may have substantial reconstruction work to do .
4.2.1 Assemble the Sources
For every binary that you produce , you should collect and maintain a copy of the sources from which it was built .
A large system , such as an embedded firmware , will probably contain many GPL ’d and LGPL ’d components for which you will have to provide source .
The binary distribution may also contain proprietary components which are separate and independent works that are covered by neither the GPL nor LGPL .
The best way to separate out your sources is to have a subdirectory for each component in your system .
You can then easily mark some of them as required for your Corresponding Source releases .
Collecting subdirectories of GPL ’d and LGPL ’d components is the first step toward preparing your release .
4.2.2 Building the Sources
Few distributors , particularly of embedded systems , take care to read the actual definition of Corresponding Source in the GPL .
Consider carefully the definition , from GPLv3 :
The “ Corresponding Source ” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate , install , and ( for an executable work ) run the object code and to modify the work , including scripts to control those activities .
and the definition from GPLv2 :
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it .
For an executable work , complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains , plus any associated interface definition files , plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable .
Note that you must include “ scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable ” and / or anything “ needed to generate , install , and ( for an executable work ) run the object code and to modify the work , including scripts to control those activities ” .
These phrases are written to cover different types of build environments and systems .
Therefore , the details of what you need to provide with regard to scripts and installation instructions vary depending on the software details .
You must provide all information necessary such that someone generally skilled with computer systems could produce a binary similar to the one provided .
Take as an example an embedded wireless device .
Usually , a company distributes a firmware , which includes a binary copy of Linux and a filesystem .
That filesystem contains various binary programs , including some GPL ’d binaries , alongside some proprietary binaries that are separate works ( i.e. , not derived from , nor based on FOSS sources ) .
Consider what , in this case , constitutes adequate “ scripts to control compilation and installation ” or items “ needed to generate , install and run ” the GPL ’d programs .
Most importantly , you must provide some sort of roadmap that allows technically sophisticated users to build your software .
This can be complicated in an embedded environment .
If your developers use scripts to control the entire compilation and installation procedure , then you can simply provide those scripts to users along with the sources they act upon .
Sometimes , however , scripts were never written ( e.g. , the information on how to build the binaries is locked up in the mind of your “ build guru ” ) .
In that case , we recommend that you write out build instructions in a natural language as a detailed , step - by - step readme .
No matter what you offer , you need to give those who receive source a clear path from your sources to binaries similar to the ones you ship .
If you ship a firmware ( kernel plus filesystem ) , and the filesystem contains binaries of GPL ’d programs , then you should provide whatever is necessary to enable a reasonably skilled user to build any given GPL ’d source program ( and modified versions thereof ) , and replace the given binary in your filesystem .
If the kernel is Linux , then the users must have the instructions to do the same with the kernel .
The best way to achieve this is to make available to your users whatever scripts or process your engineers would use to do the same .
These are the general details for how installation instructions work .
Details about what differs when the work is licensed under LGPL is discussed in § 7.1 , and specific details that are unique to GPLv3 ’s installation instructions are in § 7.3 .
4.2.3 What About the Compiler ?
The GPL contains no provision that requires distribution of the compiler used to build the software .
While companies are encouraged to make it as easy as possible for their users to build the sources , inclusion of the compiler itself is not normally considered mandatory .
The Corresponding Source definition – both in GPLv2 and GPLv3 – has not been typically read to include the compiler itself , but rather things like makefiles , build scripts , and packaging scripts .
Nonetheless , in the interest of goodwill and the spirit of the GPL , most companies do provide the compiler itself when they are able , particularly when the compiler is based on GCC or another FOSS compiler .
If you have a GCC - based system , it is your prerogative to redistribute that GCC version ( binaries plus sources ) to your customers .
We in the FOSS community encourage you to do this , since it often makes it easier for users to exercise their software freedom .
However , if you chose to take this recommendation , ensure that your GCC distribution is itself compliant .
If you have used a proprietary , third - party compiler to build the software , then you probably cannot ship it to your customers .
We consider the name of the compiler , its exact version number , and where it can be acquired as information that must be provided as part of the Corresponding Source .
This information is essential to anyone who wishes to produce a binary .
It is not the intent of the GPL to require you to distribute third - party software tools to your customer ( provided the tools themselves are not based on the GPL ’d software shipped ) , but we do believe it requires that you give the user all the essential non-proprietary facts that you had at your disposal to build the software .
Therefore , if you choose not to distribute the compiler , you should include a readme about where you got it , what version it was , and who to contact to acquire it , regardless of whether your compiler is FOSS , proprietary , or internally developed .
4.3 Best Practices and Corresponding Source
§ 3 and § 4.2 above are closely related .
If you follow the best practices outlined above , you will find that preparing your Corresponding Source release is an easier task , perhaps even a trivial one .
Indeed , the enforcement process itself has historically been useful to software development teams .
Development on a deadline can lead organizations to cut corners in a way that negatively impacts its development processes .
We have frequently been told by violators that they experience difficulty when determining the exact source for a binary in production ( in some cases because their “ build guru ” quit during the release cycle ) .
When management rushes a development team to ship a release , they are less likely to keep release sources tagged and build systems well documented .
We suggest that , if contacted about a violation , product builders use GPL enforcement as an opportunity to improve their development practices .
No developer would argue that their system is better for having a mysterious build system and no source tracking .
Address these issues by installing a revision system , telling your developers to use it , and requiring your build guru to document his or her work !
5 When The Letter Comes
Unfortunately , many GPL violators ignore their obligations until they are contacted by a copyright holder or the lawyer of a copyright holder .
You should certainly contact your own lawyer if you have received a letter alleging that you have infringed copyrights that were licensed to you under the GPL .
This section outlines a typical enforcement case and provides some guidelines for response .
These discussions are generalizations and do not all apply to every alleged violation .
5.1 Communication Is Key
GPL violations are typically only escalated when a company ignores the copyright holder ’s initial communication or fails to work toward timely compliance .
We urge accused violators to respond very promptly to the initial request .
As the process continues , follow up weekly with the copyright holders to make sure everyone agrees on targets and deadlines for resolving the situation .
Ensure that any staff who might receive communications regarding alleged GPL violations understands how to channel the communication appropriately within your organization .
Often , initial contact is addressed for general correspondence ( e.g. , by mail to corporate headquarters or by e-mail to general informational or support - related addresses ) .
Train the staff that processes such communications to escalate them to someone with authority to take action .
An unknowledgable response to such an inquiry ( e.g. , from a first - level technical support person ) can cause negotiations to fail prematurely .
Answer promptly by multiple means ( paper letter , telephone call , and email ) , even if your response merely notifies the sender that you are investigating the situation and will respond by a certain date .
Do not let the conversation lapse until the situation is fully resolved .
Proactively follow up with synchronous communication means to be sure communications sent by non-reliable means ( such as email ) were received .
Remember that the FOSS community generally values open communication and cooperation , and these values extend to GPL enforcement .
You will generally find that FOSS developers and their lawyers are willing to have a reasonable dialogue and will work with you to resolve a violation once you open the channels of communication in a friendly way .
5.2 Termination
Many redistributors overlook GPL ’s termination provision ( GPLv2 § 4 and GPLv3 § 8 ) .
Under v2 , violators forfeit their rights to redistribute and modify the GPL ’d software until those rights are explicitly reinstated by the copyright holder .
In contrast , v3 allows violators to rapidly resolve some violations without consequence .
If you have redistributed an application under GPLv2 , but have violated the terms of GPLv2 , you must request a reinstatement of rights from the copyright holders before making further distributions , or else cease distribution and modification of the software forever .
Different copyright holders condition reinstatement upon different requirements , and these requirements can be ( and often are ) wholly independent of the GPL .
The terms of your reinstatement will depend upon what you negotiate with the copyright holder of the GPL ’d program .
Since your rights under GPLv2 terminate automatically upon your initial violation , all subsequent distributions are violations and infringements of copyright .
Therefore , even if you resolve a violation on your own , you must still seek a reinstatement of rights from the copyright holders whose licenses you violated , lest you remain liable for infringement for even compliant distributions made subsequent to the initial violation .
GPLv3 is more lenient .
If you have distributed only v3 - licensed programs , you may be eligible under v3 § 8 for automatic reinstatement of rights .
You are eligible for automatic reinstatement when :
you correct the violation and are not contacted by a copyright holder about the violation within sixty days after the correction , or
you receive , from a copyright holder , your first - ever contact regarding a GPL violation , and you correct that violation within thirty days of receipt of copyright holder ’s notice .
In addition to these permanent reinstatements provided under v3 , violators who voluntarily correct their violation also receive provisional permission to continue distributing until they receive contact from the copyright holder .
If sixty days pass without contact , that reinstatement becomes permanent .
Nonetheless , you should be prepared to cease distribution during those initial sixty days should you receive a termination notice from the copyright holder .
Given that much discussion of v3 has focused on its so - called more complicated requirements , it should be noted that v3 is , in this regard , more favorable to violators than v2 .
6 Standard Requests
As we noted above , different copyright holders have different requirements for reinstating a violator ’s distribution rights .
Upon violation , you no longer have a license under the GPL .
Copyright holders can therefore set their own requirements outside the license before reinstatement of rights .
We have collected below a list of reinstatement demands that copyright holders often require .
Compliance on all FOSS copyrights .
Copyright holders of FOSS often want a company to demonstrate compliance for all GPL ’d software in a distribution , not just their own .
A copyright holder may refuse to reinstate your right to distribute one program unless and until you comply with the licenses of all FOSS in your distribution .
. Copyright holders of FOSS often want a company to demonstrate compliance for all GPL ’d software in a distribution , not just their own .
A copyright holder may refuse to reinstate your right to distribute one program unless and until you comply with the licenses of all FOSS in your distribution .
Notification to past recipients .
Users to whom you previously distributed non-compliant software should receive a communication ( email , letter , bill insert , etc. ) indicating the violation , describing their rights under GPL , and informing them how to obtain a gratis source distribution .
If a customer list does not exist ( such as in reseller situations ) , an alternative form of notice may be required ( such as a magazine advertisement ) .

Appointment of a GPL Compliance Officer .
The FOSS community values personal accountability when things go wrong .
Copyright holders often require that you name someone within the violating company officially responsible for FOSS license compliance , and that this individual serve as the key public contact for the community when compliance concerns arise .

Many copyright holders wish to monitor future compliance for some period of time after the violation .
For some period , your company may be required to send regular reports on how many distributions of binary and source have occurred .
These are just a few possible requirements for reinstatement .
In the context of a GPL violation , and particularly under v2 ’s termination provision , the copyright holder may have a range of requests in exchange for reinstatement of rights .
These software developers are talented professionals from whose work your company has benefited .
Indeed , you are unlikely to find a better value or more generous license terms for similar software elsewhere .
Treat the copyright holders with the same respect you treat your corporate partners and collaborators .
7 Special Topics in Compliance
There are several other issues that are less common , but also relevant in a GPL compliance situation .
To those who face them , they tend to be of particular interest .
7.1 LGPL Compliance
GPL compliance and LGPL compliance mostly involve the same issues .
As we discussed in § 3.1 , questions of modified versions of software are highly fact - dependant and cannot be easily addressed in any overview document .
The LGPL adds some additional complexity to the analysis .
Namely , the various LGPL versions permit proprietary licensing of certain types of modified versions .
These issues are well beyond the scope of this document , but as a rule of thumb , once you have determined ( in accordance with LGPLv3 ) what part of the work is the “ Application ” and what portions of the source are “ Minimal Corresponding Source ” , then you can usually proceed to follow the GPL compliance rules that we discussed , replacing our discussion of “ Corresponding Source ” with “ Minimal Corresponding Source ” .
LGPL also requires that you provide a mechanism to combine the Application with a modified version of the library , and outlines some options for this .
Also , the license of the whole work must permit “ reverse engineering for debugging such modifications ” to the library .
Therefore , you should take care that the EULA used for the Application does not contradict this permission .
7.2 Upstream Providers
With ever - increasing frequency , software development ( particularly for embedded devices ) is outsourced to third parties .
If you rely on an upstream provider for your software , note that you cannot ignore your GPL compliance requirements simply because someone else packaged the software that you distribute .
If you redistribute GPL ’d software ( which you do , whenever you ship a device with your upstream ’s software in it ) , you are bound by the terms of the GPL .
No distribution ( including redistribution ) is permissible absent adherence to the license terms .
Therefore , you should introduce a due diligence process into your software acquisition plans .
This is much like the software - oriented recommendations we make in § 3 .
Implementing practices to ensure that you are aware of what software is in your devices can only improve your general business processes .
You should ask a clear list of questions of all your upstream providers and make sure the answers are complete and accurate .
The following are examples of questions you should ask :
What are all the licenses that cover the software in this device ?
From which upstream vendors , be they companies or individuals , did you receive your software from before distributing it to us ?
receive your software from before distributing it to us ?
What are your GPL compliance procedures ?
If there is GPL ’d software in your distribution , we will be redistributors of this GPL ’d software .
What mechanisms do you have in place to aid us with compliance ?
If we follow your recommended compliance procedures , will you formally indemnify us in case we are nonetheless found to be in violation of the GPL ?
This last point is particularly important .
Many GPL enforcements are escalated because of petty finger - pointing between the distributor and its upstream .
In our experience , agreements regarding GPL compliance issues and procedures are rarely negotiated up front .
However , when they are , violations are resolved much more smoothly ( at least from the point of view of the redistributor ) .
Consider the cost of potential violations in your acquisition process .
Using FOSS allows software vendors to reduce costs significantly , but be wary of vendors who have done so without regard for the licenses .
If your vendor ’s costs seem “ too good to be true , ” you may ultimately bear the burden of the vendor ’s inattention to GPL compliance .
Ask the right questions , demand an account of your vendors ’ compliance procedures , and seek indemnity from them .
7.3 User Products and Installation Information
GPLv3 requires you to provide “ Installation Information ” when v3 software is distributed in a “ User Product . ”
During the drafting of v3 , the debate over this requirement was contentious .
However , the provision as it appears in the final license is reasonable and easy to understand .
If you put GPLv3 ’d software into a User Product ( as defined by the license ) and you have the ability to install modified versions onto that device , you must provide information that makes it possible for the user to install functioning , modified versions of the software .
Note that if no one , including you , can install a modified version , this provision does not apply .
For example , if the software is burned onto an non-field - upgradable ROM chip , and the only way that chip can be upgraded is by producing a new one via a hardware factory process , then it is acceptable that the users cannot electronically upgrade the software themselves .
Furthermore , you are permitted to refuse support service , warranties , and software updates to a user who has installed a modified version .
You may even forbid network access to devices that behave out of specification due to such modifications .
Indeed , this permission fits clearly with usual industry practice .
While it is impossible to provide a device that is completely unmodifiable , users are generally on notice that they risk voiding their warranties and losing their update and support services when they make modifications .
GPLv3 is in many ways better for distributors who seek some degree of device lock - down .
Technical processes are always found for subverting any lock - down ; pursuing it is a losing battle regardless .
With GPLv3 , unlike with GPLv2 , the license gives you clear provisions that you can rely on when you are forced to cut off support , service or warranty for a customer who has chosen to modify .
8 Conclusion
GPL compliance need not be an onerous process .
Historically , struggles have been the result of poor development methodologies and communications , rather than any unexpected application of the GPL ’s source code disclosure requirements .
Compliance is straightforward when the entirety of your enterprise is well - informed and well - coordinated .
The receptionists should know how to route a GPL source request or accusation of infringement .
The lawyers should know the basic provisions of FOSS licenses and your source disclosure requirements , and should explain those details to the software developers .
The software developers should use a version control system that allows them to associate versions of source with distributed binaries , have a well - documented build process that anyone skilled in the art can understand , and inform the lawyers when they bring in new software .
Managers should build systems and procedures that keep everyone on target .
With these practices in place , any organization can comply with the GPL without serious effort , and receive the substantial benefits of good citizenship in the FOSS community , and lots of great code ready - made for their products .
( CNN ) -- Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO turned top John McCain aide , said she does n't think Sarah Palin is qualified to run a major corporation .
For that matter , Fiorina said , McCain , Obama and Biden are n't capable of that kind of job either .
Ex -Hewlett - Packard CEO and McCain adviser Carly Fiorina said Sarah Palin could not run a major company .
The Republican presidential candidate has been trying to portray himself as someone who can fix the country 's economic woes .
But that is a far different task than running a Fortune 500 corporation , Fiorina told MSNBC Tuesday .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama 's camp immediately circulated copies of her words -- which did n't exactly paint their candidate in a soft light , either .
" Well , I do n't think John McCain could run a major corporation , I do n't think Barack Obama could run a major corporation , I do n't think Joe Biden could run a major corporation , " Fiorina said .
" It is a fallacy to suggest that the country is like a company .
So , of course , to run a business , you have to have a lifetime of experience in business , but that 's not what Sarah Palin , John McCain , Joe Biden or Barack Obama are doing . "
Fiorina was president of Hewlett - Packard until her high - profile ousting in 2006 after the company 's unfavorable performance .
" If John McCain 's top economic adviser does n't think he can run a corporation , how on Earth can he run the largest economy in the world in the midst of a financial crisis ? " said Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor .
" Apparently , even the people who run his campaign agree that the economy is an issue John McCain does n't understand as well as he should . "
Watch Fiorina says Palin is n't ready for big business »
Fiorina made similar comments earlier Thursday to a St. Louis , Missouri , radio station .
She was asked if she thinks Palin is qualified to run a company like Hewlett - Packard .
" No , I do n't , " Fiorina answered .
" But that 's not what she 's running for .
Running a corporation is a different set of things . "

Jack Bogdanski ( Lewis & Clark ) & Bryan Camp ( Texas Tech ) have independently reviewed the tax issues raised by the release of Gov. Palin 's 2006 and 2007 tax returns and financial disclosure form , as well as the remarkable opinion letter issued from Washington D.C. tax lawyer Roger M. Olsen .
Jack and Bryan conclude that there are serious errors in Gov. Palin 's returns as filed and that she and her husband owe tens of thousands of dollars in additional taxes .
Jack Bogdanski , There 's No Debate : Palins Owe Thousands in Back Taxes :
There is no serious debate ( at least , none that has been brought to our attention ) about the fact that at least the amounts paid for the children 's travel -- $ 24,728.83 in 2007 , according to the Washington Post -- are taxable .
The campaign 's tax lawyer has got at least that much of the law , and perhaps more , wrong .
...
The Palins , who had their tax returns done by HR Block , simply got it wrong .
And the fact that the state payroll office got it wrong , too , does n't erase the Palins ' unpaid tax liability .
Bryan Camp , A Brief Analysis of Governor Palin's Tax Returns for 2006 and 2007 :
The release of an opinion letter by attorney Roger M. Olsen dated September 30 , 2008 , has stirred up the pot once again about the accuracy of Sarah and Todd Palin ’s 2006 and 2007 tax returns .
Not only that , but Mr. Olsen ’s letter raises a couple of new issues .
This paper focuses on five problems : three raised in the tax returns and two new ones raised by Mr. Olsen ’s letter .
Here ’s a summary of the five problems and my conclusions , for those who want to cut to the chase .
My analysis will follow .
The Palins did not report as income some $ 17,000 that Governor Palin ’s employer ( the State of Alaska ) paid her as an “ allowance ” for her travel .
Can they do that ?
Yes , most likely .
The Palins did not report as income some $ 43,000 that the State of Alaska paid the Governor as an “ allowance ” for her husband and children ’s travel .
Can they do that ?
No , most likely not .
The Palins deducted $ 9,000 on their 2007 return , claiming it was a loss from Mr. Palin ’s snow machine racing activity .
Can they do that ?
Most likely not , but more info could make the deduction OK .
If any of the above issues goes against the Palins they then risk getting hit with the section 6662 penalty for “ negligence or disregard of rules or regulations . ”
Can the Palins avoid the section 6662 negligence penalty by claiming that they reasonably relied either ( a ) on the W - 2 ’s sent to them by their employer , which did not reflect either the $ 17,000 or the $ 43,000 , or ( b ) on their tax return preparer H&R Block , or ( c ) on Mr. Olsen ’s opinion letter dated September 30 , 2008 ?
The three reliance defenses are unlikely to succeed , but more info may make the ( b ) defense a good one .
Does Mr. Olsen have any exposure to sanctions by the IRS because of his letter ?
I believe Mr. Olsen ’s letter probably violates 31 C.F.R. section 10.35 .
If so , he would be exposed to possible sanctions from the IRS Office of Professional Responsibility .

Massive Stars in NGC 6357
Credit & Copyright : Johannes Schedler ( Panther Observatory )
Explanation : Massive stars lie within NGC 6357 , an expansive emission nebula complex some 8,000 light - years away in the tail of the constellation Scorpius .
In fact , positioned just below center in this close - up view of NGC 6357 , star cluster Pismis 24 includes some of the most massive stars known in the galaxy , stars with over 100 times the mass of the Sun .
The nebula 's bright central region also contains dusty pillars of molecular gas , likely hiding massive protostars from the prying eyes of optical instruments .
Intricate shapes in the nebula are carved by interstellar winds and energetic radiation from the young and newly forming massive stars .
This alluring telescopic view spans just under 50 light - years at the estimated distance of NGC 6357 .
Fishermen in the village of Maruata , which is located on the Mexican Pacific coast 18 degrees north of the equator , have no electricity .
But for the past 16 years they have been able to store their fish on ice :
Seven ice makers , powered by nothing but the scorching sun , churn out a half ton of ice every day .
There 's a global scramble to drive down emissions of carbon dioxide : the electricity to power just refrigerators in the U.S. contributes 102 million tons annually .
Solar refrigeration can also be inexpensive and it would give the electric grid much - needed relief .
Electricity demand peaks on hot summer days — 150 gigawatts more in summer than winter in the U.S. ( A gigawatt equals on billion watts . )
That 's almost 1.5 times the generating capacity of all the coal - fired power plants west of the Mississippi River .
Further , solar is plentiful .
The solar energy hitting 54 square feet ( five square meters ) of land each year is the equivalent of all the electricity used by one American household , according to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Energy Information Administration , both part of the U.S. Department of Energy .
Making cold out of hot is easier than one might think .
A group of students last year at San Jose State University built a solar - powered ice maker with $ 100 worth of plumbing and a four - by - eight - foot ( 1.2 - by - 2.4 - meter ) sheet of reflecting steel .
No moving parts , no electricity but give it a couple hours of sunshine and it can make a large bag of ice .
The key is the energy exchanged when liquids turn to vapor and vice versa — the process that cools you when you sweat .
By far the most common approach , the one used by the refrigerator in your house , uses an electric motor to compress a refrigerant — say , Freon — turning it into liquid .
When the pressure created by the compressor is released , the liquid evaporates , absorbing heat and lowering the temperature .
Absorptive chillers like solar refrigerators use a heat source rather than a compressor to change the refrigerant from vapor to liquid .
The two most common combinations are water mixed with either lithium bromide or ammonia .
In each case , the refrigerating gas is absorbed until heat is applied , which raises the temperature and pressure .
At higher pressure , the refrigerant condenses into liquid .
Turning off the heat lowers the pressure , causing that liquid to evaporate back into a gas , thereby creating the cooling effect .
As with most technologies , the efficiency of such absorptive refrigeration depends on the degree of engineering ( and expense ) brought to bear .
Single - effect devices have a coefficient of performance of 0.6 to 0.7 — that is , they create 60 to 70 Btus ( British thermal units ) of cooling for every 100 Btus of input heat .
That low level of efficiency can be achieved with something as crude as some pipe , a bucket of water , some calcium chloride ( as absorbant ) , ammonia ( as refrigerant ) , and a sheet of shiny metal ( the solar collector ) .
If what you want to do is heat or cool , using solar energy this way is probably more efficient — and certainly cheaper — than converting it first into electricity .
" That approach ought to be comparable to photovoltaics , or a little better , " said Tom Mancini , program manager for solar power at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M .
It would take a fair - size collector — 86 square feet ( eight square meters ) , assuming 40 percent panel efficiency — just to deliver the cooling of a small ( 6,000 Btu per hour or half - ton ) window air conditioner .
And central air - conditioning units are often 30,000 Btu or more ; few homeowners could spare the space for that .
But concerns over collector area depend on location .
In the developing world , solar powered ice makers allow locals to store the village 's food or medicine without any electricity .
For example , in May charitable organization , Heifer International , set up three solar ice makers in remote areas of Kenya .
Each will be able to keep 26.5 gallons ( 100 liters ) of milk chilled .
More than 500 members of two dairy cooperatives are expected to benefit directly .
Most of the interest in such solar refrigeration in Western countries comes from the commercial , not residential , sectors .
Cost is one reason — absorption chiller systems typically cost $ 7,000 to $ 10,000 per ton of cooling ; one - ton window air conditioners from big box retailers start around $ 250 — but companies can save on electric bill as well as enjoy a more benign environmental image .
Building occupancy patterns is another ; most Americans are not at home during the day .
" We do n't have as much daytime occupancy in residential buildings as in commercial , " says Pat Hale , sales manager for Yazaki Energy Systems , in Plano , Tex .
Other problems include the expense of retrofitting homes to add plumbing to the attic .
And the high temperatures associated with concentrating solar collectors raise liability concerns .
But some entrepreneurs think a residential market nevertheless is emerging .
Walter Ross is CEO of Austin Solar AC , a start - up that is testing 36,000 and 60,000 Btu solar - fired chillers .
The units provide cooling in summer and heating during winter by just using the sun 's heat directly .
" We 're getting a lot of interest from people who have been using propane for heating , " he said .
" The biggest issue we run into with these is siting : Most neighborhood associations wo n't allow these things on your roof . "
Koji Igarashi has shed a bit of light on Castlevania Judgment and the future of Castlevania in general .
First off , Igarashi stated that although the development team would have been interested in using Wii MotionPlus for the game , Judgment is too far along in development to add such functionality .
Furthermore , there was a remark made that Judgment might not be the only spin - off of its kind , granted there are strong sales for Judgment .
Finally , Igarashi reaffirmed his consideration of a classic - styled Castlevania title , although he still has n’t written anything down and stone and will not discuss further details ..
Personally , although more spin - offs might be an interesting way to expand the Castlevania series , prior titles ( and recent impressions of Judgment ) have proven that the series is at its best in 2D , Metroid - esqe format .
I think I ’d die if I saw Castlevania : Mini -Games of Blood hit the market !

What is it about some technology companies that inspires enthusiasm , even love , amongst millions of consumers ?
People who would never dream of becoming fans of their bank ( Woooooo ... let 's hear it for Barclays !!! ) or an oil company ( I love you BP !!! ) , develop an emotional attachment to the products and personalities which emerge from firms like Apple , Nokia , Nintendo and , yes , even Microsoft .
Over the last decade Google has been one of the big beneficiaries of this cult of fandom .
First , because out of nowhere it emerged with a product that did the job so much better than anything else .
Then because it was seen as the smart , scrappy kid taking on the big boys of the internet - or rather one very big Seattle - based bruiser .
And when it arrived on the stockmarket with 2004's IPO , it reinforced that edgy , radical image .
The first line of its so - called ' Owner 's Manual for Shareholders ' read : " Google is not a conventional company .
We do not intend to become one . "
There was much talk from Larry Page and Sergey Brin of giving the world access to information and great play was made of the company 's ethical stance , summed up with the motto " Do n't be evil . "
Over the last four years , it has sought to retain the affection of its many fans , by offering them more and more for nothing - from Google Earth , to Google Docs , to Chrome .
But somehow I feel the love is beginning to fade .
Why ?
Well the scrappy kid has grown up into a muscle - bound giant which , in the eyes of some web developer pygmies , is the new playground bully .
It may claim that it is just a technology start - up , constantly looking for cool new tools to make us all more productive - but it is rapidly becoming an advertising and media giant , with as much domination of some sectors of the online market as Microsoft has over operating systems .
It may , with some justification , paint itself as a champion of open - source - but users of its new Chrome browser were quick to ask questions about some pretty scary terms and conditions , since amended by Google .
And it may claim to be a champion of liberty - but Amnesty International and others will respond with one word - China .
But the main bone of contention in the relationship between Google and its users is privacy .
Google loves us so much it wants to know everything about us - so that it can help us live better lives .
But users are beginning to suspect that we 're being , well , used - that Google just wants to know us better so that it can send us more adverts and sell us to its trading partners .
When Eric Schmidt said earlier this year that he wanted the search engine to be able to answer questions such as " What shall I do tomorrow ? " or " What job shall I take ? " , did you think " cool " or " creepy " ?
So a decade of extraordinary innovation is worth celebrating , and Google is continuing to surprise and delight with new products .
But it is also becoming just what Page and Brin said it would not become - a conventional company .
Hardly surprising - like Apple , Microsoft , Nokia or Nintendo - its first duty is to its shareholders , and their returns depend on Google grabbing an ever larger slice of the online advertising market .
However , all of those happy , shiny , Googlers in their multi-coloured offices with the free muffins had better get used to one thing .
The early passion of your users is fading .
We 're now in a conventional , commercial relationship - and if someone else comes along offering something better , we 're off .
Greg Palast 's book : Armed Madhouse is a good read .
Intimidation is a big part of Republican strategy to keep turn out low .
Latinos should band together and show up to vote in groups of at least four so that they wo n't be intimidated when someone tries to deny them the right to legally vote .
Republicans are deathly afraid of the Latino influence in elections ever since Sennsenbrenner tried to call them all felons and the radical right shot down any attempt to get an immigration deal .
Why do you think Rove and Bush tried to pass that legislation ?
Greg and Robert Kennedy , Jr. have a new article out in Rolling Stone called : Block The Vote :
This November , what happened to Maez will happen to hundreds of thousands of voters across the country .
In state after state , Republican operatives — the party 's elite commandos of bare - knuckle politics — are wielding new federal legislation to systematically disenfranchise Democrats .
If this year 's race is as close as the past two elections , the GOP 's nationwide campaign could be large enough to determine the presidency in November .
" I do n't think the Democrats get it , " says John Boyd , a voting - rights attorney in Albuquerque who has taken on the Republican Party for impeding access to the ballot .
" All these new rules and games are turning voting into an obstacle course that could flip the vote to the GOP in half a dozen states . "
These 7 steps come from the website : Steal Back Your Vote .
You can watch it too ...
STEP 1 : DON'T DON'T DON'T mail in your ballot !!
Absentee ballots are often not counted for the weakest of reasons .
Furthermore , there are new rules in many states that you must photocopy your ID and send it with the ballot .
However , they often do n't even tell you that .
So HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of absentee votes will not be counted for this reason .
STEP 2 : VOTE EARLY ... VERY EARLY !
Many states are already allowing you to vote .
Do it NOW .
That way if you 're not listed on the voter roles , you have plenty of time to get your complaint heard .
STEP 3 : REGISTER AND THEN REGISTER AND THEN REGISTER !
There is a TON of purging of voter rolls going on .
It 's not enough to think you 're registered .
Double check twelve times .
You can check online at www.votersunite.org/info/RegInfo.asp .
Once you 're done with that , go register .
... Then go register .
STEP 4 : DO NOT FILL OUT A PROVISIONAL BALLOT if your vote is challenged !!
In 2004 the Republicans challenged a ridiculous number of voters .
The voters were then told by a sweet little lady at a table that their " provisional ballot " would be counted , BUT IT WON'T .
Do n't listen to the little old lady !!
DEMAND that poll judges make the judgement ON THE SPOT .
Demand a call to the supervisor of elections .
If you have to , go home and come back with a better form of ID .
If you need help , call ELECTION PROTECTION at 1-866-OUR-VOTE .
And help those around you when you 're at the polling place .
Look for people having trouble .
Call the number for them .
Tell them not to fill out a provisional ballot !
I 'M SURE we ’re all helpful sorts who would volunteer to assist the security services in testing new devices at airports .
But the body - scanning machines being put through their paces at Melbourne airport reveal rather more of the scannee than you might expect .
This could well be the future of airport security , and private it is n’t .
According to Cheryl Johnson , the general manager of Australia ’s Office of Transport Security :
" It will show the private parts of people , but what we 've decided is that we 're not going to blur those out , because it severely limits the detection capabilities . "
But Gulliver was particularly intrigued by another comment :
" The faces are automatically blurred and ... it 's only a chalk - style outline , it 's not as invasive as some of the other equipment that we 've got . ”
Passengers , it seems , are meant to be grateful the security officers will only be seeing their assets in blurred outline because , hey , their other machines would allow them to see a whole lot more .
ExoFly is a dragonfly like MAV or Micro Air Vehicle .
The current model weighs 17 grams and is based on its predecessor the DelFly Micro from the folks at the Delft University of Technology .
The ExoFly is now being prepared for a possible journey to Mars by adding a solar cell and increasing the weight to 20 grams .
This should give the ExoFly a range of 15 km .

Ruins of a Roman temple from the second century CE have recently been unearthed in the Zippori National Park .
Above the temple are foundations of a church from the Byzantine period .
The excavations , which were undertaken by the Noam Shudofsky Zippori Expedition led by of Prof.
Zeev Weiss of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , shed light on the multi-cultural society of ancient Zippori ( also known as Sepphoris ) .
The discovery indicated that Zippori , the Jewish capital of the Galilee during the Roman period , had a significant pagan population which built a temple in the heart of the city center .
The central location of the temple which is positioned within a walled courtyard and its architectural relation to the surrounding buildings enhance our knowledge regarding the planning of Zippori in the Roman era .
The building of the church on the foundation of the temple testifies to the preservation of the sacred section of the city over time .
This new finding demonstrates not only the religious life , culture and society in Roman and Byzantine Zippori , but also that this was a city in which Jews , pagans and later Christians lived together and developed their hometown with various buildings .
The newly discovered temple is located south of the decumanus - colonnaded street - which ran from east to west and was the main thoroughfare in the city during the Roman through Byzantine period .
The temple , measuring approximately 24 by 12 meters , was built with a decorated façade facing the street .
The temple ’s walls were plundered in ancient times and only its foundations remain .
No evidence has been found that reveals the nature of the temple ’s rituals , but some coins dating from the time of Antoninus Pius , minted in Diocaesarea ( Zippori ) , depict a temple to the Roman gods Zeus and Tyche .
The temple ceased to function at an unknown date , and a large church , the remains of which were uncovered by the Hebrew University excavation team in previous seasons , was built over it in the Byzantine period .
North of the decumanus , opposite the temple , a monumental building was partially excavated this summer .
Its role is still unclear , although its nature and size indicate that it was an important building .
A courtyard with a well - preserved stone pavement of smooth rectangular slabs executed in high quality was uncovered in the center of the building , upon which were found a pile of collapsed columns and capitals - probably as a result of an earthquake .
The decoration on these architectural elements was executed in stucco .
Beyond a row of columns , an adjacent aisle and additional rooms were discovered .
Two of them were decorated with colorful , geometrical mosaics .
Here she was last night answering the following two - tiered question to Biden and then Palin :
The next round of -- pardon me , the next round of questions starts with you , Sen. Biden .
Do you support , as they do in Alaska , granting same - sex benefits to couples ?
...
Governor , would you support expanding that beyond Alaska to the rest of the nation ?
Palin's answer :
Well , not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman .
And unfortunately that 's sometimes where those steps lead .
But I also want to clarify , if there 's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners , choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves , you know , I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue , some very dear friends who do n't agree with me on this issue .
The clear implication is that she would favor extending healthcare benefits to same - sex couples across America - as long as that did n't approach the superior benefits and rights of heterosexual married couples .
Quite how you do that is very hard for me to figure out ( Do gays get to visit but not stay as long in the hospital ?
Do we get half the benefits ?
How do you give gay spouses lesser health benefits than straight spouses ? )
But leaving those nuances behind , here she is in 2006 , responding to the same question , but giving a clearly different answer :
Her response ( around 2 minutes in ) :
This is also important and significant in terms of what the voters said back in 1998 here in Alaska when they defined via the constitutional amendment what marriage is and marriage was defined as traditional - one - man - one - woman would constitute a marriage - and inherent in that constitutional amendment was , I believe , the reference to benefits .
When asked if she would support clarifying the amendment to bar healthcare benefits to gay couples , she replied :
It 's tough to say what I would do today not having all that information that governor Murkowski had in front of him when he called that so it 's tough in a hypothetical to answer that but what I do know is that inherent in that question that was asked in the ballot box that a majority of Alaskans voted for and approved in a constitutional amendment I think was a reference to benefits .
So I think what this will lead to is a clarification of that constitutional amendment .
I do n't see any way to interpret that except that she wanted to deny healthcare benefits to gay couples because such benefits belonged to heterosexual married couples alone .
But there 's one way to clear this up .
The campaign should now answer the following question :
Do governor Palin and Senator McCain believe that gay couples in civil marriages or civil unions should have the same healthcare benefits as straight , married couples ?
Yes or no ?

Joe McCain Says Inner Suburbs Are " Communist "
Sen .
John McCain 's brother , Joe , made an apparent joke today that Democratic - leaning Alexandria and Arlington are " Communist country . "
Speaking at an event in support of his brother in Loudoun County , Joe McCain said , " I 've lived here for at least 10 years and before that about every third duty I was in either Arlington or Alexandria , up in communist country , " according to a Washington Post reporter who was there .
Joe McCain , who like his brother is a veteran of the Vietnam war , then apologized , but he drew laughter from the GOP faithful at the event .
Joe McCain 's remarks may not sit well with some residents of Arlington and Alexandria , who by the way include his brother .
John McCain owns a condominium in Arlington County .
The McCain campaign 's national and Virginia headquarters are also located in Arlington County .
" This was Joe McCain 's unsuccessful attempt at humor , " said McCain spokeswoman Gail Gitcho .
" John McCain and Sarah Palin are committed to winning the support of voters in Northern Virginia and understand the region 's importance to victory statewide . "
In one of those reflecting moods at the moment , thinking about what I ’ve been learning in my philosophy class , “ Philosophy of Mind . ”
The western philosophers propose that we have a problem , the problem of “ other minds . ”
A great rift seems to occur between thinking we are all mind , or all body .
There are varying degrees in between , too , but the problem itself , between the mental and the physical , seems to be a choice , rather than a real problem .
My question is : mind vs body , physical vs mental– is this duality built on an assumption ?
Well , yes , that the mind is somehow separated from the body , and we as thinkers must somehow close the gap one way or another .
But what if there is no gap in the first place ?
What if the answer is “ both / and , ” not ‘ either or ’ ?
This necessitates that we take a step beyond traditional logic , where two statements : “ A is True , B is False , ” and “ B is true , A is false ” are actually a very limited way to see our situation .
If any of these philosophers , who have developed these mind / body theories had taken a look at their own mind / body experience , they would notice that there is truly nothing separating the two .
Somehow , the mind moves to the body , the body to the mind .
What hurts mentally brims over to the physical , and vice versa .
The act of meditation itself reveals this nature clearly , and better yet directly for the practitioner to discover .
If you meditate , for even an hour or two , you ’ll begin to notice things about yourself .
Both thoughts and feelings , physical and mental , appear intertwined– and better yet , inseperable .
If half of the philosophers of the west had merely sat for a while , and listened to the closest experience they had , their very minds and bodies , silently , what differences in their philosophies we could see now !
Still , it is not as important as noticing these features in the present .
I encourage any serious philosophers to begin with the very experience of consciousness they have now .
What differences could it bring to our assumptions about the world , or to be clear : our conclusions ?
Because logic itself is a very structured way of viewing the world .
It has set rules , and methods to help us understand .
Philosophers are n’t just guessing , or throwing out guess work about the nature of the mind .
They ’re thinking very hard– and perhaps that ’s part of the problem .
The problem could truly be this : our method of thinking is inherently limited , like a mechanism with built in frames and scopes that can only see a certain way .
Imagine a telescope of limited technology that can only peer into the stars so far , and thus reveal a limited picture of our universe .
This could be true of the analytical mind .
What I think the problem is , at least it seems to be : our approach is top - down .
We attempt to A ) detach ourselves as objective observers , and then B ) Peer from afar , as if we were looking down into the complex problem of mind , or anything else for that matter .
We can make some insights , for sure , but it ’s a very dualistic , fragmented approach , ultimately leaving seemingly contradictory truths in unending battle .
This approach is considered to be the best possible way we know of , and practically all of western science and philosophy are built upon it .
But , what if we are reaching the limits of this approach ?
What if this problem of “ mind / body ” is revealing the walls of this analytical instrument all too clearly , sending us bouncing back and forth without greater revelation ?
It could be argued that scientists are n’t quite doing this , but even in physics we often have conflicting truths ( Well , they only appear conflicting …
And it does n’t work for one truth to collapse into the other .
Often enough , there is a synthesis , or an integration , and I believe that is what is going to happen with this mind / body problem eventually ) .
What if we began at the very essence of experience , the most direct approach ?
What if we removed that telescope viewing far into the stars and began here , right in front of us ?
We would observe things that the “ top - down ” approach missed .
In essence we would be embracing a bottom - up way .
Exploring the nature of our relationship , about how we are connected , or interconnected with so many things .
Take , for instance , the Buddhist approach to the nature of the mind vs. the world .
They are inseperable , and not without good reason .
Meditators have observed the mind and the world for centuries , carefully writing their observations and repeating their experiments in their own right .
Despite the superstition and metaphysics surrounding meditation , there have been profound insights into the nature of mind and body .
For instance , to a Buddhist , there is no “ thing ” in itself– everything that exists has a counter part .
Moon , sun , night , day , life , death– and we do not wish to collapse all of one thing into another .
Death is life , and night and day co-exist like yin -yang .
There is a certain harmony to eastern cosmology , and it occurs before all of the books , the writers and philosophies of both east and west .
To the eastern mind , so to speak , how could anything exist without relation to another ?
Or , put simply , to be is to be in relation with .
There is no stand - alone object .
Without subject , there is no object .
Without observer there is no observed , and vice versa .
So , beginning to see the world from this point of view– how could there be a mind / body problem ?
It becomes less “ mind or body ” and more “ mind and body . ”
Or , mind - body .
The only thing remaining to be answered is the nature of this relationship .
It could be argued that the philosophers of the west are doing just that– understanding the nature of the relationship .
But they are inherently seeing this as a problem , from the top - down , wondering how this mechanism works .
And many of them traditionally attempt to see this as an “ either or ” according to a logical analysis .
This way is bound to dance back and forth , forever unanswered ( It ’s been a few hundred years already , and if anything , this should be a tell - tale sign that something in the approach is off ) .
So , what if we see the nature of mind and body as one movement ?
What if mind - body understanding must begin with clearing our heads ( no pun intended ) , and listening ?
Dare we say that there could be transformative insight from stepping off our analytical podiums and growing into the understanding .
Let ’s try the bottom - up approach , and in now way is this proposing an “ opposite , ” but merely an alternative .
By starting with our bare attention , we are trying to observe the very essence of relationship .
There is a certain flow to things , and logical analysis is missing this water - like ebb and flow of the universe .
Analytical thinking should not and could not be abandoned , but is it possible we have forgotten a vital tool to our understanding ?
DIGG THIS
As I have read countless analysts , including professional economists , offer " solutions " to the financial crisis , I have become more convinced of the importance of capital theory .
You see this with the dichotomy people keep drawing between the financial markets and the " real economy , " a distinction that is useful for some purposes but which in this context often reinforces the idea that the stock market is really just a casino .
When the Paulson Plan was first being debated , even sharp , free - market thinkers who are otherwise very solid were recommending instead that " bank recapitalization " was the way to fix things .
But if our troubles stem from a diversion of real resources into the housing sector — if too many and too big homes were built at the expense of other possible uses for those inputs — then government financial transfers per se wo n’t do anything except redistribute the losses .
Once we understand how our present problems are due to a Fed - induced distortion in the capital structure , it becomes clear that the worst recommendation is for the Fed to cut interest rates and pump in ever more " liquidity . "
It was artificially cheap credit that fueled the housing boom in the first place .
Greenspan brought the federal funds target rate down to a ridiculous 1 percent — meaning the interest rate was actually negative , once we adjust for price inflation — and held it there for a year .
He did this in order to ( apparently ) obviate the need for a harsh recession in the " real economy " after the dot - com crash .
But in fact he sowed the seeds for our present crisis .
If Bernanke continues shoveling in hundreds of billions to needy bankers , five years from now Americans ( and the rest of the world ) may look back fondly on the present the way the 2001 downturn now seems like a minor inconvenience .
Krugman and Cowen Ridicule the Austrian " Hangover " Theory
Rather than start from scratch , in this article I will illustrate the importance of a solid theory of capital by showing how very intelligent economists — one of whom is now a Nobel laureate — make elementary mistakes in their critique of Austrian business cycle theory ( ABCT ) .
For the sake of brevity , I wo n’t recapitulate the theory here ; in the links above you can see my own watered - down expositions , or go here for Roger Garrison ’s amazing PowerPoint presentation , or here for a more comprehensive introduction .
Now then , assuming the reader understands the basic Austrian story , let us quote Tyler Cowen ’s recent discussion of Paul Krugman ’s Slate critique of ABCT :
[ Paul Krugman : ]
Here ’s the problem :
As a matter of simple arithmetic , total spending in the economy is necessarily equal to total income ( every sale is also a purchase , and vice versa ) .
So if people decide to spend less on investment goods , does n’t that mean that they must be deciding to spend more on consumption goods — implying that an investment slump should always be accompanied by a corresponding consumption boom ?
And if so why should there be a rise in unemployment ?
[ Tyler Cowen commenting on the above quote : ]
But I think the point is more effective in reverse .
Why should the boom be a boom in the first place ?
The shift toward investment goods , and thus away from consumption goods production , should mean falling real wages , not rising real wages .
In other words , the Austrian theory does n’t generate the very high degree of comovement found in the data .
These are actually two separate points ; i.e. , Cowen did more than simply " reverse " the argument , he slightly changed the point .
To help the reader understand my response , let me paraphrase ( what I take to be ) Krugman ’s and Cowen ’s similar ( but distinct ) objections to the Mises - Hayek theory .

The Best of Bob Murphy
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Money market funds saw nearly $ 90 billion of net investor cash pulled out on Wednesday , among the largest single - day drops in history .
Figures from iMoneyNet show that assets dropped to $ 3.35 trillion from $ 3.44 trillion , a fall of $ 89.2 billion .
Among the funds hit hardest by the redemptions was the $ 12.3 billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund PPMXX institutional fund , which saw such a severe run on its assets that Putnam Investments , a subsidiary of Great West Lifeco Inc. GWLI said Thursday it would liquidate the fund .
Also Wednesday , it was revealed that money market funds managed by Bank of New York Mellon Corp .'s BK , - 1.22 % Dreyfus and Columbia Management , the fund arm of Bank of America Corp. BAC , - 1.32 % held commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings LEHMQ and needed support from their parent companies to maintain their $ 1 a share net asset value .
Figures from iMoneyNet show that $ 130 billion left prime institutional money market funds Wednesday .
This follows $ 61 billion of redemptions on Monday and $ 37.2 billion of redemptions on Tuesday .
" This is the largest week of outflows that we 've ever had , " said Connie Bugbee , managing editor of iMoneyNet .
" It 's not even close . "
She added that some of the outflows , perhaps as much as $ 20 billion may be due to companies moving money around because Monday was quarterly corporate tax day .
Putnam said that the run on its fund made it unable to keep the afloat .
" Constraints on liquidity in money market instruments created the risk that in order to process redemptions , the fund would realize losses in selling its portfolio securities , " it said in a statement .
" The Trustees determined to close the fund to ensure equitable treatment of all fund shareholders . "
The statement did not say when shareholders will receive their money , nor did it say whether the payouts would maintain the fund 's $ 1 a share net asset value .
" This action is specific to the Prime Money Market in reaction to that fund 's circumstances and redemption pressures and does not affect any other Putnam money market fund , " said Laura McNamara , spokeswoman .
Investors continued their flight to quality .
Government institutional funds saw assets grow by $ 47.2 billion Wednesday .
Figures released earlier this week by iMoneyNet showed that $ 35 billion headed into government institutional on Monday and Tuesday .

The move into Treasuries presents its set of headaches for firms .
With yields at historic lows , some funds may have to consider waiving management fees to ensure that yields are n't negative .
Some money market funds made similar moves in the wake of the market turmoil following Bear Stearn 's collapse and in 2003 - 2004 when rates were around 1 % .
" This is a phenomenon that would only matter if it continues , " said Peter Crane , president of market research firm Crane Data .
Columbia , Dreyfus take steps
Columbia said in a shareholder letter Wednesday that it also held American International Group Inc. AIG , - 1.23 % debt .
Columbia Cash Reserves NCIXX held $ 400 million in Lehman paper , while Dreyfus said Dreyfus Liquid Assets DLAXX , , Dreyfus BASIC Money Market Fund DBAXX , , Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund DWDXX and Dreyfus Cash Management Plus DPSXX between them held $ 262 million of unsecured debt obligations issued by Lehman .
" The Bank of New York Mellon entered into support agreements with [ the funds ] , pursuant to which BNY Mellon will support the value of Lehman notes held in the Funds , " said Dreyfus in a statement posted to its Web site Wednesday .
" These agreements are intended to ensure that a decline in the value of the Lehman notes will not result in a decline in the share price of the funds below $ 1 . "
A Dreyfus spokeswoman said that none of its money market funds hold AIG or Washington Mutual Inc. WM , - 0.55 % debt .
Dreyfus posts its money market holdings on its Web site daily .
Columbia said in its letter that its money market funds did n't hold Washington Mutual debt , and that its AIG holdings mature on or before October 6 .
A spokesman did n't return a call .
" Bank of America and Columbia Management have taken a number of steps to manage the money market mutual funds during this unprecedented period , such as providing capital support to the funds , purchasing certain assets from the funds , and other measures to seek to ensure that the retail money market funds continue to transact at $ 1 , " said Columbia .
" As we have stated previously , Bank of America may provide additional support in the future to the money market mutual funds , but it is under no obligation to do so . "
Columbia manages just under $ 144 billion of money market assets and Dreyfus has about $ 250 billion in its money market funds .
As well as Dreyfus , Columbia and The Reserve , three other money market fund companies held Lehman paper when the company declared bankruptcy : Evergreen Investments , the fund arm of Wachovia Corp .
WB , - 3.74 % , Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s Russell Investments and RiverSource Investments , the fund arm of Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP , - 0.72 % .

Separately on Thursday , Fitch Ratings withdrew its AAA / V1 + ratings for 17 money market funds managed by Lehman Brothers Asset Management , an indirect subsidiary of Lehman .
" The ratings withdrawals reflect the uncertain and evolving status of Lehman Brothers Asset Management 's strategic direction and stability of its investment platform following the bankruptcy filing by its parent company , " said Fitch .
Moody 's Investors Service also said it may downgrade the Aaa ratings on 13 money market funds and one bond fund that are sponsored by Lehman .
Moody 's said it has liquidity and prospective operational concerns related to the ability of the funds to sustain increasing levels of redemptions .
I spent a week in early April of 1998 riding dual - suspended bikes in and around Bradford - on - Avon , England , where Alex Moulton lived and where his revolutionary Moulton bicycles are built .
There are canals in this part of England that people traverse in houseboats ( sort of like floating RVs ) .
Next to the canals are gravel paths called towpaths because at one time horses walked there pulling the boats .
Today , these towpaths are a great place to cycle if they happen to go your way .
And when they do n’t , you can always find beautiful stone wall–lined country lanes to follow .
Due to their bumpy nature , the paths and lanes are a perfect place to pedal on a bicycle with built in shock absorbers front and rear .
Suspension for the street
Why test dual suspension anywhere but on the side of a mountain , you ask ?
Because I was riding a road bike .
We tend to think of suspension as a relatively new phenomenon brought to us by mountain - bike innovators .
So it may be surprising to learn that Alex Moulton has been working on bicycle suspension since 1956 , when gasoline was rationed in England and he took up pedaling to cut fuel usage .
Finding the conventional bike limited and uncomfortable , he did what any engineer might do : he began reinventing it .
Moulton ’s experience was in building automobile suspensions .
A descendant of a family of rubber technologists , he developed new car and truck suspensions that incorporated rubber .
These are still used today in cars such as the Mini , MG and Land Rover .
Coming from an automobile background it was only natural for Moulton to question the need for large wheels on a bike .
He knew that smaller wheels offered advantages such as less weight , better acceleration , allowing a lower frame design that could be used by men and women ( even children ) and that loads over the wheels would be carried lower for better stability ( and that more gear would fit by utilizing the space over the wheels ) .
Of course , he also recognized that smaller wheels would yield a harsh ride .
But he had a great solution : suspension ( shock absorbers ) .
Mini wheels and cloud - like comfort
In 1963 , the first Moultons were produced .
Startlingly unique at the time , they featured 16 - inch wheels with a wonderfully soft ride thanks to a telescopic - suspension ( coil spring and rubber ) front fork and a rubber - sprung rear end .
The bike was super versatile because the same frame fit most riders ( child to adult ) , meaning one bike could work for the entire family .
There were also integral and instant - on / off racks with handy baskets and bags , making it simple to carry all loads .
Plus , you could disassemble the frame ( on certain models ) for toting a bike ( even two ) in the trunk of the smallest car .
Ingeniously , there was even a handle built into the frame at the exact balance point , so carrying the bike up and down stairs ( or perhaps to get on a bus ) was a breeze .
Sales of the bikes took off to the tune of 150,000 units in their heyday , which prompted Raleigh to purchase the design and begin producing numerous knock - off small - wheel and folding bikes .
In the 1980s Moulton came out with a new design with all the features of the first bikes but based on a space frame built with small - diameter Reynolds tubing .
And in the 1990s , he worked with British producer Pashley to introduce a Moulton called the APB ( All Purpose Bicycle ) with 20 - inch wheels and a lower price .
Brilliant debut
But that ’s old news .
What brought me to England was to see Moulton ’s latest creation : the New Series Moulton .
I wanted to be there because it ’s amazing to me that at 78 years old ( he was born April 9 , 1920 ) , Alex is still driven to refine his design and improve cycling .
I missed the first introduction of his bike ( I was ten years old ) .
I did n’t want to miss this one .
The debut took place at the Royal College of Art in London , a fitting location for the unveiling of the result of a life ’s work .
True to previous designs , the New Series sports all the features expected of a Moulton .
The take - apart ( it now separates into more pieces to fit in the smallest case yet ) unisex space frame is there in either Reynolds 531 or aerospace - grade stainless - steel tubing .
The small wheels are now built around a 406 rim , which solves one of the main problems with past Moultons , some of which used a proprietary tire size available only from Moulton .
Now lots of tires can be used .
Shimano ’s Dura - Ace crank , brake calipers , pedals , 10 - speed cassette and derailleur are used .
The large - diameter seatpost is now titanium ( and yes , as with former Moultons , a pump is stored inside ) .
The hubs are British - made Gold Tecs , and the spacing is non-standard at 70 mm front , 120 mm rear .
Total bike weight is about 22 pounds .
( Note : Specs will change year to year . )
The best suspension yet
Most impressive is the new Flexitor front suspension , which is the most active I ’ve experienced .
The spring medium is rubber in torsion , which promises long life , little maintenance if any , and zero stiction .
As the suspension is compressed , resistance is created by rubber pieces that are bonded inside the crossmembers of the fork legs .
As the legs move , the bars twist and the rubber resists , providing the spring .
You ’ve got to feel it to believe it .
I rode with one hand on the bar and rested a finger of my other hand on the forward crossbrace .
Even on smooth pavement , while my hand on the bar felt absolutely no buzzing or bumps , the suspension moved furiously like the needle on a sewing machine .
Suspension this active may bug someone who muscles over the hills , because it can bob .
For this type of rider , there ’s a soft lockout that can be engaged and released easily while riding , though you do have to reach down .
This prevents most of the suspension movement while still providing shock absorption on bigger bumps .
There ’s also a second stage to the fork .
A rubber bumper kicks in when the fork is bottomed on a big hit , which comes in handy for heavier riders .
Plus the fork has an anti-dive feature , meaning it is n’t activated by braking forces .
Moulton ’s Flexitor fork ( above left ) and Hydrolastic rear shock ( below ) take all the abuse out of rough roads .
For out - of - the - saddle climbing , use the manual soft lockout , which prevents bobbing ( above right ) .
High - tech Hydrolastic rear shock
Though it looks more conventional than the front fork , the new Hydrolastic rear shock unit now offers adjustable liquid damping so you can tune the feel .
This improves ride quality but still feels similar to past Moulton rear suspensions .
Interestingly the bike uses a unified - rear - triangle design to eliminate all suspension - induced pedal movement .
Another innovation is a new handlebar called the Mosquito .
Moultons use an adjustable stem , which can be moved to put the rider as high or low or as stretched out or compact as she likes with the turn of an Allen wrench .
The Mosquito bars can also be rotated to provide a racing or touring position .
They ’re narrow because Moulton believes thoroughly in providing an aero rider profile to the wind .
I found them slightly too narrow when standing on steep hills .
They were comfortable enough when seated and a slightly wider version is available .
It ’s also a simple matter to swap for either flat or drop bars if you like .
I especially liked the new brake levers , a German design that ’s adjustable for all hand sizes and includes a parking - brake feature .
Moulton ’s New Series bikes are intended to be extremely limited production , a best - of - the - best hand - produced custom product , if you will .
They ’re built in a small shop on Moulton ’s estate by craftsmen , some of whom have been building Moultons for decades .
Consequently and appropriately , the New Series sells for a dear price .
But , if you ’re looking for a one - of - a- kind , incredibly versatile dual - suspended road bike , hand - built by a legend in cycling , there ’s really no equivalent .

Whistleblower effectively gagged by FBI RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 10 , 2008

In what his attorney is calling censorship , an FBI whistleblower is being severely limited on what he is allowed to share with an audience at an upcoming trade meeting .
Bassem Youssef , the highest ranking Arab - American FBI agent , is scheduled to speak to the ALA on January 12 .
After receiving a warning on January 3 , Youssef decided , on the advice of his attorney , to no longer give the originally planned presentation on what he calls " critical failures within the FBI 's counterterrorism program , " said to undermine not only Americans ' basic constitutional rights , but counterterrorism efforts as well .
Instead , he will answer prepared questions from audience members .
The FBI , between its original clearance in October of 2007 and its recent warning , had become displeased with the contents of an ALA press release dated December 20 , 2007 , which detailed the planned speech .
Says attorney Stephen M. Kohn , " The FBI does not want the general public to know the contents of the censorship provisions it unconstitutionally demands that its agents follow . "
As the Wall Street Journal reports , Youssef sued the FBI in 2003 alleging discrimination , career sabotage and retaliation , which internal investigations have at least partially substantiated .
In the case of Youssef 's speech to the American Library Assocation , the FBI stated that it sought to " balance the speech rights of employees with the need to protect classified and sensitive information . "
The FBI , according to Youssef and Kohn , provided Youssef with a list of requirements , not previously published , by which he would be bound .
" Although I understand the document contains no confidential information , " says Kohn in a letter to the ALA , " the FBI does not want the general public to know the contents of the censorship provisions it unconstitutionally demands that its agents follow . "
The GOP pick for VP was a brilliant political strategy .
It accomplished two important goals .
It increased donations to the Republican Party and it also has kept the spotlight off important issues .
In addition , if E - mail traffic is any indication , it has unnerved the Democrats .
By now everyone has to admit that the US voter is about as informed on issues as a fruit fly is .
Can anyone pretend that the average voter casts his ballot based on the economy , justice , or matters of war and peace ?
The two words that are the biggest threat to the sale of Ambien are “ foreign policy ” .
Just mentioning those two words will clear a room faster than a skunk at a picnic .
Think of how many democrats still believe that their Party is the anti-war Party .
The average US voter is so uninformed that he does not even vote in his own interest .
How else can it be explained that 18,000 of our fellow citizens will continue to die every year because of the lack of access to health care .
That is like having a 9/11 every 60 days , but worse .
We are doing it to ourselves – and it is so unnecessary .
There is at least one candidate , Nader , who supports health care for all , while lowering the cost by eliminating the insurance companies .
Both McCain and Obama support the insurance companies ’ profits over health care for the people .
A Single Payer system would save lives and also save taxpayer money .
Why is there no national discussion about it — because both Parties have sold out to the insurance industry .
Take the hot issue of ‘ experience ’ .
Of course experience is important – the kind of experience that no Washington insider gets .
How about the experience of having no health care , or having to cut back on groceries , or cutting the thermostat down to 55 in the winter and hoping that pipes do n’t freeze .
How about the experience of hoping that last year ’s shoes will still fit the kids for this school year .
How about the experience of not being able to take the family out for pizza , because that , too , is now a luxury that can no longer be afforded .
How about the experience of facing foreclosure so some Hedge Fund manager can buy another yacht .
For years , many have wished for other ways of selecting a president .
How about a national lottery .
That would make it possible for ordinary people — truck drivers , teachers , nurses , farmers , and plumbers to hold the highest office .
That wo n’t happen without changes in the Constitution .
This time around there are some choices for the voters .
There is a list of candidates to chose from —
Barr , McCain , McKinney , Moore , Nader , Obama and others .
The electronic and the print media have all but excluded any candidate who is not a Democrat or Republican .
About Sarah Palin – yes , a brilliant political strategy .
She will get the votes of the pro-war , pro-gun crowd .
She can fire a weapon while wearing high heels .
Biden , can you top that ?
And maybe most important of all , she will get the votes of all who envy those teeth .
In a country where dental care is rapidly becoming a luxury – you have to admire those teeth .
Beautiful teeth are becoming the ultimate status symbol .
Oprah once said that you could determine persons ’ economic class just by looking at their teeth .
That just might be the most astute observation that Oprah has ever made .
US politics is all about fluff — personality and celebrity .
Image over substance .
Voters could change that by demanding that participation in the debates not be limited to Democratic and Republican candidates .
Here is a challenge for Governor Palin .
How about refusing to participate in any debate which excludes the other VP candidates .
Open the debates up to the top four or five candidates .
That simple act would elevate Gov. Palin to the category of Statesperson .
It would show that she places a higher value on the welfare of the nation than on Party affiliation .
It would show a respect for the voters .
The inclusion of VP candidate Matt Gonzalez and others would elevate the national discussion to include important issues such as foreign policy , health care , the economy , corporate welfare , and education .
The same voters , who would never tolerate a massive book burning , allow the media to pre-select the political messages allowed for public discussion .
The media presents a virtual book burning every night with its exclusion of ideas that do not conform to the Republican / Democratic model .
Shame on the media , more shame on the people who tolerate such censorship .
This election could be like a shining light , but unless voters become informed the bright light will just lead to another four - year dark tunnel .
In the quiet privacy of the voting booth will voters be thinking about the hundreds of thousands killed in our illegal , pre-emptive war , and the 18,000 who die every year because of lack of health care ; or , will the voters ’ minds wonder to those issues publicized by the media — lapel pins , age , pomp and ceremony — and do n’t forget those teeth .
A well - known hedge - fund manager has hit out at Microsoft ’s “ overaggressive and almost panicky ” attempts to plump up its online investments .
David Einhorn , president and founder of Greenlight Capital , yesterday accused Microsoft of suffering from “ Google - envy ” and said he was giving up on investing in the software giant until it learns to play ball .
The scolding came in the firm 's latest report to shareholders , according to Silicon Valley Insider .
We wanted to share some thoughts on Microsoft ( MSFT ) , which we closed during the quarter .
We believe that we purchased the shares at an attractive time , and for a good while the investment worked nicely .
As has been our habit of late , we overstayed our welcome as the shares peaked after the company announced a very good September 2007 quarter .
Since then , management has acted in an overaggressive and almost panicky fashion regarding its online offering .
First , it sought to acquire Yahoo !
and then after that failed , it announced extremely high internal investment requirements to pursue this ' huge ' opportunity ( read : ' Google - envy ' ) .
We doubt the opportunity is what they say it is and wish MSFT focused on its core strength : software .
The CEO is a very smart and very wealthy man .
Perhaps , he is so wealthy that he has bigger ideas and aspirations than making MSFT ’s shareholders wealthier .
We ’ve given up on MSFT for now as we feel better investing in companies where management at least appears to be trying to work for shareholders .
Many will likely agree with Einhorn 's grumbles about Microsoft 's failed efforts to out - Google Google , while others have lambasted CEO Steve Ballmer 's online vision as short - sighted .
Einhorn famously fingered the Lehman Brothers debacle months before it collapsed , questioning the accuracy of accounting and warning that trouble was brewing at the brokerage firm .
He has felt the pinch from the deepening financial crisis hitting the world 's banking systems .
In September his company suffered a huge loss when regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission banned short selling of more than 900 financial services stocks .
Meanwhile , Microsoft shares have tanked over the past few weeks forcing Ballmer to admit on his recent tour of Europe that no one was safe from the dollar meltdown on Wall Street .
" Financial issues are going to affect both business spending and consumer spending , and particularly ... spending by the financial services industry , " he said . ®

WASHINGTON —
The FBI is declining to release at least 15,000 pages of documents related to the now - deceased prime suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks despite lingering suspicions that the bureau has accused the wrong man .
In August , the FBI and Justice Department identified Bruce Ivins , a former microbiologist at the U.S. Army ’s biological weapons research center at Ft. Detrick , Md. , as the “ only person involved ” in the attacks that killed five people .
But David Hardy , the section chief of the FBI ’s records management division , notified McClatchy Newspapers that his office could n’t immediately release the records because there were “ investigative leads still open ” and the FBI needed to withhold the documents to protect confidential sources , privacy , law enforcement techniques and a suspect ’s right to a fair trial .
McClatchy had filed a request for the documents under the federal Freedom of Information Act , which generally permits the release of records of a dead person .
Ivins committed suicide in July .
In a letter received by McClatchy today , Hardy said the FBI has identified a “ significant number ” of documents related to Ivins that have n’t been released and is still searching for other relevant records .

As a screener at Newark Liberty International Airport , Pythias Brown was supposed to keep deadly objects off airplanes .
But for the past year , authorities allege , Brown has been swiping electronic equipment from luggage of the passengers he was supposed to protect .
A laptop here , a cell phone there .
Within months , he had snatched more than 100 items , authorities say .
But this summer , Brown got too ambitious for his own good , allegedly stealing a $ 47,900 camera from an HBO crew and a camcorder from a CNN employee , authorities said .
Brown attracted the attention of one of his victims -- and eventually investigators -- when he tried to sell the equipment on eBay , the online auction site , authorities said .
Federal investigators charged the 48 - year - old Maplewood resident this week with theft .
He is scheduled to appear Wednesday in federal court in Newark .
If convicted , he faces up to 10 years in prison , Assistant U.S. Attorney Jenny Kramer said .
Officials at the Transportation Security Administration , which employees the airport screeners , said Brown has been placed on administrative leave and , based on their own findings , will soon be fired .
Brown has worked Brown has worked as a screener at Newark Liberty since 2002 .
" The TSA takes these matters of theft and any wrongdoing very seriously , and takes a hard line against those offenders , " spokeswoman Lara Uselding said .
When investigators raided Brown 's home last week , they seized a trove of contraband , according to an affidavit signed by Thomas Adams , an agent with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 's Office of Inspector General and the lead investigator on the case .
Among the items seized were 66 cameras , 31 laptop computers , 20 cell phones , 17 sets of electronic games , 13 pieces of jewelry , 12 GPS devices , 11 MP3 players , eight camera lenses , six video cameras and two DVD players , the affidavit said .
According to the affidavit , Brown confessed that he began stealing two to three items per week from the airport beginning in September 2007 .
He told authorities he put most of the stolen items up for sale on eBay , it said .
One of the items was a Sony camcorder that was swiped from the bag of a CNN employee who was a passenger on flight from Newark to Houston in July 2008 , authorities said .
In August , the CNN employee contacted police to report that the stolen camera was listed for sale on eBay .
Authorities said the camera was posted by a person with the user ID " alirla . "
Investigators then used their own eBay account to place the winning bid on the camera , and arranged to pay Brown through a PayPal account , the affidavit said .
Authorities said they gave Brown an address in Marlton where he sent the camera .
On the package , Brown listed his Maplewood home as the return address , authorities said .
The serial numbers on the camera matched those of the stolen CNN equipment , authorities said .
Video images from security cameras at the Newark post office from where the shipment was mailed linked Brown to the package , authorities said .
Brown 's credit card was used to pay for the postage , they said .
As investigators built their case against Brown , an HBO employee reported the theft of a $ 47,900 camera from a bag he had checked at Newark Liberty for a flight to London in September .
Again , authorities found the camera posted for sale on eBay by " alirla , " according to the affidavit .
They traced the eBay account to a Verizon Internet address listed to Brown 's fiancee , authorities said .
The couple , who had their wedding scheduled for Oct. 12 , lived together at the Maplewood residence where the Verizon account was registered , authorities said .
Authorities raided the home on Oct. 1 .
Uselding said the TSA worked closely with homeland security investigators to bring the charges against Brown .
She also said that his crimes were rare and that less than 300 TSA employees have been terminated for theft .
" The actions of a few individuals in no way reflect on the outstanding job our more than 43,000 security officers do every day to ensure the security of the traveling public , " she said .
Also , I 'm not sure if Tyrol is supposed to be strangling Callie for real , or if this was a fantasy he was having .
The clip cuts from the strangling to him with the baby , and I 'm not sure .
Was this how she was originally going to die ?
( Damn , this clips are QUIET .
Anybody else have trouble hearing them ?
I probably missed half the dialogue . )

Yes , the stock market was falling apart , but up on the seventh floor of CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , you could almost hear the sighs of relief Monday thanks to another bit of news : Former top Agency official Kyle Dustin Foggo had quietly entered a guilty plea in an Alexandria , Virginia , federal courtroom .
Henry Paulson still has his job cut out trying to rescue the banking system , but Langley ’s spymasters had just been spared the imminent prospect of having some of the nation ’s most sensitive secrets spilled in what promised to be one of the more revelatory and cinematic trials of the Bush era .
As court documents laid out in 28 charges , the man known to colleagues as “ Dusty , ” a former logistics officer , served as the CIA ’s number three official and effectively day to day manager when he badgered the Agency to hire one of his mistresses , identified in the indictment as “ E.R. ” : “ On or about March 19 , 2005 , ” the indictment reads , “ Foggo sent the CIA Acting General Counsel an email stating , in part , that his staff would tag E.R. ’s conditional offer of employment as ‘ ExDir Interest ’ in order to ‘ zip her to the top of the pile . ' ”
( E.R. was indeed hired , to a position in the CIA general counsel ’s office .
“ ExDir ” refers to Foggo ’s position as CIA Executive Director . )
Foggo ’s generosity extended beyond his girlfriend :
He also , according to the indictment , engineered the hiring of his best childhood friend ’s company for a CIA contract to provide bottled water to staff in Iraq at a 60 percent price markup over the offer of another contractor ( who , under the deal worked out by Foggo , was hired as the subcontractor to actually perform the work ) .
He was frequently dealt into a weekly poker game at
various memorable Washington hotels ( the Watergate was one ) popular with congressmen such as Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - Calif . ) , lobbyists , and House intelligence committee staff members ; as well as — according to other court documents — prostitutes .
That childhood friend , Brent Wilkes , also turned out to be among two defense contractors bribing House intelligence committee member Duke Cunningham with tens of thousands of dollars in antiques , travel , fancy meals , house payments , and hookers in exchange for earmarks steering more than $ 100 million worth of government contracts to Wilkes ’ San Diego - based firm , ADCS .
But it was n’t the hookers , the card games , the water contract , or even the staff mistress that concerned the Agency ’s executives when Foggo spared them by entering a guilty plea on a single count of wire fraud Monday .
In exchange for the plea , prosecutors agreed to drop the 27 other charges and requested only three years prison time out of the 20 Foggo could have faced .
( “ Your lawyers did a good job for you , ” US District judge James C. Cacheris told Foggo after he accepted his guilty plea , with evident understatement . )
No , what truly worried Agency brass were the darker secrets their former top logistics officer was threatening to spill had his case gone to trial as scheduled on November 3 .
They included the massive contracts Foggo was discussing with Wilkes , estimated by one source at over $ 300 million dollars .
“ Wilkes was working on several other huge deals when the hammer fell , ” a source familiar with Foggo ’s discussions with Wilkes told me .
What kinds of deals ?
According to the source , they included creating and running a secret plane network , for whatever needs the CIA has for secret planes now that the network it used for extraordinary rendition flights has been outed .
“ In or about December 2004 , ” the Foggo indictment says , “ Foggo discussed with Wilkes and J.C. the idea that Foggo might be able to get Wilkes a classified government contract to supply air support services to the CIA … .
In or about January 2005 , Wilkes directed various ADCS employees to begin developing an air support proposal that would be designed to answer the CIA ’s classified needs as outlined by Foggo . ”
The indictment continues : “ On or about February 3 , 2005 , an employee of Wilkes ’ corporation emailed J.C. with an offer to update him on their work developing the air support proposal . … ” ( J.C. , the indictment explains , is Wilkes ’ nephew , whom I ’ve identified as Joel G. Combs , the nominal head of a Wilkes ’ front company , Archer Logistics . )
The “ classified air support contract ” and its implied purposes for renditions are among the truly damaging national security secrets , along with the methods the CIA uses to create front companies and dole out black contracts , that the CIA and Bush White House would have been anxious not to have exposed , especially in a trial set to take place the day before the election in a suburban DC courtroom within a ten - minute drive of the entire national security press corps .
“ Greymail ” is the term of art for an old legal defense technique employed by those in possession of classified information :
The accused and his lawyers will demand the revelation of so many government secrets in order to get a fair trial that prosecutors come under pressure to make the case go away .
And in Foggo , the official responsible for the logistics of much of the administration ’s war on terror , federal prosecutors met their greymail match .
Foggo threatened “ to expose the cover of virtually every CIA employee with whom he interacted and to divulge to the world some of our country ’s most sensitive programs — even though this information has absolutely nothing to do with the charges he faces , ” prosecutors howled in an early September court filing , before they were evidently compelled to extend Foggo the lenient plea deal ; Foggo ’s lawyers , the filing continued , were attempting to “ portray Foggo as a hero engaged in actions necessary to protect the public from terrorist acts . ”
The plea deal has n’t stopped Foggo ’s former CIA colleagues from continuing to fume in outrage at Foggo ’s behavior , or from pointing the finger at former CIA director Porter Goss for appointing Foggo to the Executive Director position in the first place .
“ This behavior is not typical of CIA officials , ” one former senior CIA operations officer told me .
“ We all knew him to be sleazy … This is a guy who should never have gotten that job . ”
Goss abruptly resigned in May 2006 just as federal investigators were raiding Foggo ’s office .
Foggo is scheduled to be sentenced January 8 .
His co-conspirator Brent Wilkes is currently serving a 12 year jail sentence in California .
Cunningham , a onetime ace fighter pilot who reportedly served as the inspiration for Tom Cruise ’s character in Top Gun , is serving out an eight year sentence , the longest prison sentence ever meted out to any member of Congress .
Meanwhile Foggo , based on his plea agreement , is likely to leave prison well before a McCain or Obama administration finishes its first term .
Correction : A previous version of this story noted that “ E.R. ” as described in the Foggo indictment was hired to a “ new position Foggo created — deputy director of administration . ”
In fact , another Foggo mistress , already a CIA staff member , was appointed to the position Foggo had created for her as deputy director of support .
That person was eventually removed from the post .
Welcome to the Icelandic Saga Database
The Icelandic Saga Database is an online resource dedicated to publishing the Sagas of the Icelanders — a large body of medieval Icelandic literature .
The sagas are prose histories describing events that took place amongst the Norse and Celtic inhabitants of Iceland during the period of the Icelandic Commonwealth in the 10th and 11th centuries CE .
The Icelandic sagas are believed to have been written in the 13th and 14th centuries CE , perhaps originating in an oral tradition of storytelling .
While their facticity and authorship is for the most part unknown , they are a widely recognized gem of world literature thanks to their sparse , succinct prose style and balanced storytelling .
The sagas focus largely on history , especially genealogical and family history , and reflect the struggles and conflicts that arose amongst the second and third generations of Norse settlers in medieval Iceland , which was in this time a remote , decentralised society with a rich legal tradition but no organized executive power .
This website contains all the extant Icelandic family sagas .
They are accessible in a variety of open formats .
The texts use modernised Icelandic orthography .
Translations into English and other languages are also made available where these exist in the public domain .
As a dedicated Libertarian voter , I have watched with amusement the pontifications and hyperbole offered by both dominant parties regarding the relevant qualifications of their candidates and platforms , and the current situation on Wall Street .
One glaring omission in the polemics is the acknowledgement that , of all the recent presidential candidates , only Dr. Ron Paul presented the current Wall Street crisis as a valid concern for the American public in his campaign .
For his prescience , he was scorned and marginalized by the mainstream media , and we were led like lambs to the pending slaughter .
Wake up , people !
The Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned and were licensed in 1913 to print and lend money to the U.S. government at 6 percent interest .
It is they to whom the multi-trillion national debt is owed .
The government sold us out then , and they ’re about to do it again .
A wise man once said , “ There are none so blind as those who will not see . ”
How true .
Cannabis less harmful than drinking , smoking : report Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 2 , 2008
Print This Email This
LONDON ( AFP ) - Cannabis is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco , according to a report by a research charity Thursday , which called for a " serious rethink " of drug policy .
The Beckley Foundation , a charity which numbers senior experts and other academics among its advisors , said banning cannabis has no impact on supply and turns users into criminals .
" Although cannabis can have a negative impact on health , including mental health , in terms of relative harms it is considerably less harmful than alcohol or tobacco , " says the report by the Foundation 's Global Cannabis Commission .
The government is pressing for cannabis to be re-classified in law as a Class B drug compared with its current , less serious , Class C classification .
Authorities are concerned notably by the growing prevalence of the potent " skunk " form of the drug .
Around 80 percent of cannabis seizures are of this strain , said to be linked to mental health problems , official figures show .
The Beckley Foundation , a charitable trust , claimed only two deaths worldwide have been attributed to cannabis , while alcohol and tobacco use together kill an estimated 150,000 people in Britain alone .
" Many of the harms associated with cannabis use are the result of prohibition itself , particularly the social harms arising from arrest and imprisonment , " it said .
" It is only through a regulated market that we can better protect young people from the ever more potent forms of dope , " it added .
The decision to reclassify cannabis upwards into the more punitive Class B category -- which includes amphetamines -- is a U - turn for the Labour government .
Cannabis was downgraded from Class B when Tony Blair was prime minister , but Gordon Brown announced a review of its status soon after taking over in June last year .
An earlier review of the cannabis classification , at the time of the last 2005 general election , resulted in it remaining Class C .
" A door supervisor and the general manager approached it , " Mr Laidlaw told the jury .
" Peering in through the front nearside window they could see gas vapour which appeared to be venting into the passenger compartment and there was a strong smell of liquid petroleum gas .
Im normally a kdb+ kind of guy when it comes to managing huge amounts of streaming and historical tick data , the performance is great , the app small and clean and the language Q terse with just enough to get the job done .
On the downside Q is a bit cryptic , and the documentation is brutally terse .. though readable .
I decided to do a bit of googling to see whether another product was out there that might be useful , and came across StreamBase , which is the commercial outgrowth of some research projects at MIT – Aurora , Borealis and Medusa .
These projects were led by Michael Stonebraker , who invented {|discovered ? } ingres and postgresql databases in their original form .
His short blurb on Stream processing – Data Torrents and Rivers – is a worthwhile introduction .
The StreamSQL language spec seems to be independent of StreamBase , as it has its own site which describes the language – StreamSQL.org .
StreamSQL does seem to fall short of being a fully independent spec , and I wanted to make some comment on this … because the world really does need an accessible stream processing language that acts in the same way as SQL – I love Q but I just dont see your average quant developer having time to grok it when they already have to learn C++/ Perl / Python / Matlab / R and I guess soon ruby [ until lisp becomes the 100 year language ] .
Heres my Open Letter to the StreamSQL people –
Ok , StreamBase looks like a good product , StreamSQL looks like a good language …
The value of StreamSQL is that it can be vendor neutral and have several competing implementations – exactly analagous to SQL , right ?
Your StreamSQL site is nice … and very annoying :]
1 ) Please put a formal spec of the complete language as a single text file on your site – and give it a version number .
Its nice to have the pages describe the formal spec , but its also annoying for people who have read a _lot_ of BNF / language specs – I want to see the complete language on one page , and know that that is exactly the syntax of version 0.96.20080321 of the spec !
0 ) This needs to be done as a consortium – currently StreamSQL is ‘ owned ’ by streambase and this site just makes that obvious , by trying to not make it obvious – until you get past this , no - one will touch StreamSQL with a bargepole , and we will have N competing standards that vary by unimportant details … no matter what happens they will , over time , converge to a default that everyone will then use ..
Now , would you rather that default be Q? Making StreamSQL the defacto standard is in your interests … you will sell more streambase if you fully open the spec… it should be a consortium , have a voting body , and have at least 2 vendors who support it – or a vendor and perhaps an open source product .
A side issue is tone down the marketing … yes you ’re already doing that , but not enough to make this work .
Consider having people involved who are in academia or open source but who are not being paid by StreamBase .
[ am I wrong in assuming your bloggers are employees ? ]
I think part of maturing as a standard is that you start to see more examples publicly available on this site – I know this is the microsoft way to make people register to get to see your samples , but in the year 2008 , with all the open source movement victories … well , it is evil to do that the old way :]
ps. Congratulations on a nice spec and a great product – things will advance for all if the spec grows away from its parent , and gains real independence !
Maybe a ‘ Stream Query Language ’ is important enough that it should just be added to ansi SQL ?
– the reason I think this wo n’t happen is that its just too expensive for vendors to say they are SQL compliant .
I guess in time , we ’ll see an opensource stream database which is language compatible with either StreamBase / StreamSQL or kdb+ / q .
But it ’s the same old war of BetaMax vs VHS or Bluray vs HD - DVD , only one can win .
A DOT plan [ pdf ] to install a protected bike path on Eighth Avenue – similar to the one that ’s already been implemented on Ninth Avenue from 14th to 23rd Street – has been rejected by Manhattan Community Board 4 , which includes Chelsea .
The proposal , which would not require the elimination of any traffic lanes while buffering cyclists from motorists , was previously approved by the board ’s Transportation Planning Committee , as well as Community Board 2 .
Chelsea
Now reports that the committee “ enthusiastically ” presented the DOT proposal at Wednesday night ’s meeting and recommended it for approval , but seemed unprepared “ for the onslaught of opposition from the rest of the board . ”
Board member and long - time gay rights activist Allen Roskoff led the dissent :
I refer to Eighth Ave. between 14th and 23rd Streets as ‘ Gay Boulevard . ’
Large numbers of gay people go there …
It ’s where we feel at home …
The atmosphere there — the restaurants , the activity , the people walking — it ’s a home to many of us that no other avenue is .
I do n’t think these changes are for the positive in any way , shape or form .
The board voted against the change , but the DOT could still push the project through against the their wishes .
Beyond painting the bike lane pink , it 's unclear how the city would win over dissenters like Roskoff .

Sorry for the late update ; I had a busy day and there were a ton of new polls today :
The general pro-Obama trend seems to be holding with the exception of a few deviations .
West Virginia , a state Obama led briefly in our projection is securely back in the Safe Rep category .
The Kentucky Senate race also appears to have calmed down ; the tie in yesterday 's poll appears to be an anomaly .
Speaking of anomalies : there has been some chatter regarding the " tightening of the race , " mainly by the Associated Press , after their national poll revealed Obama with just a percentage point lead .
People , specifically the liberal side , have been quick to discredit the merits of poll .
While it does not align with the vast majority of national polling , that does n't mean its result is invalid .
When dealing with population sampling there are many factors taken into account , but ultimately the random sample decides the outcome .
If you get a bad sample no amount of finagling can change that .
Rather the outcome of the AP - Gtk poll is nothing more than a statistical outcome .
Given the monumental number of polls taken this election cycle , the standard distribution principle dictates that any set of data will have outliers .
The AP poll is simply an outlier , nothing more , nothing less ; but apparently the Associated Press failed to realize this mathematical caveat given the degree to which they pushed this singular poll .
I hope to have an article pertaining to the Bradley Effect later tonight , and then after that I 'll look to finish the new Senate Projection page .
For Republicans , the Senate outlook is ominous RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 6 , 2008
Print This Email This ' If you have an R in front of your name , you better run scared , ' says GOP senator Mississippi , one of the nation 's most conservative states , has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter - century , " notes an article in Sunday 's LA Times , which adds that Republican presidential candidates have won the state 's votes in seven straight elections .
" But this year , there is a real chance that the state will send a Democrat to the Senate , " Janet Hooks writes .
#
That prospect is a window onto a remarkable political trend that has been eclipsed by the fireworks surrounding the 2008 presidential contest : Democrats are running strong Senate campaigns in states such as Mississippi , Alaska and North Carolina that Republicans have long taken for granted .
The outlook for the GOP is so grim that party leaders have readily conceded there is no chance they can regain control of the Senate in 2008 , even though Democrats ' current majority is slim , 51 - 49 .
" If you have an R in front of your name , you better run scared , " said Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , who says the party will do well if it holds its losses to three or four seats .
The Mississippi race between Democratic former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove and Republican Sen. Roger
Wicker distills the wide range of factors that have put congressional Republicans in their weakest position since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s .

CNN LIVE EVENT / SPECIAL
The Next President : A World of Challenges
Aired September 20 , 2008 - 21:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
FRANK SESNO , CNN CO - HOST : And welcome to the Lisner Auditorium on the campus of The George Washington University in the heart of Washington , D.C.
Thanks for joining us .
I 'm Frank Sesno .
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR , CNN CO - HOST : And I'm Christiane Amanpour .
The next president of the United States will inherit a very troubled world , with the U.S. fighting two wars , facing a global economic crisis , and rising powers to the east .
SESNO : There are opportunities too , of course , but many challenges .
To look ahead to these challenges and how the next president must respond to them , we have an extraordinary group , as you can see : five former secretaries of state whose experience spans four decades .
AMANPOUR : From detente with the Soviets to opening the door to China , from humanitarian interventions to full - scale war , and from trying to spread democracy to defeating terrorism , these former secretaries have confronted it all .
SESNO : So joining us : Warren Christopher , who served in the first Clinton administration ; Henry Kissinger , who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations ; and Madeleine Albright , who served in the second Clinton administration as secretary of state .
AMANPOUR : And also , James Baker , who served the first President George Bush ; and finally , General Colin Powell , who served the second President George Bush .
Thank you all for being here .
And today , we 're not looking for pat party - line talking points .
I 'm sure we 're not going to get any of that .
What we really want is for candid , robust , meat and potatoes advice for the next president , no matter who he might be .
Our future , your future depends on it .
SESNO : It 's Inauguration Day , 2009 .
You 're all invited to the presidential ball .
And while you 're there , the president brushes by , and he says , General Powell , what 's my biggest worry in the world , besides the U.S. Congress ?
What do you tell him ?
( LAUGHTER )
COLIN POWELL , 65th SECRETARY OF STATE :
You 've obviously never been to an inaugural ball .
( LAUGHTER ) POWELL :
One of the first things that you have to do as president , the very next day , is to start to restore a sense of confidence in the United States of America , let all of our friends and allies around the world know that America is reaching out to them .
We want to hear them and we want to listen to them , tell them we 're going to work in unison .
We always reserve the right to act when we feel we have to act in our own interest , but we understand the importance of allies and alliances .
I would also communicate to the American people that we may have some difficulties in Afghanistan , Iraq , or wherever else we 're going to have difficulties in January .
But we 're Americans , we should confidence in ourselves , confidence in our system , reach out to the rest of the world .
And it will be important for the president to convey this message to the American people and to the rest of the world .
SESNO : Secretary Albright , what would you say ?
MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT , 64TH SECRETARY OF STATE : I ...
SESNO : My biggest worry in the world ?
ALBRIGHT : Well , I think , first of all , I 'd say , remember , you wanted this job .
( LAUGHTER )
And that there are a tremendous number of challenges and opportunities .
I do think -- I agree with Colin , that it is very important to give this sense of confidence , but also to understand that the issues that are out there are primarily the kind that can only be solved in cooperation with other countries .
And therefore , the idea that you reach out to other countries has to be a different way of operating .
I think that 's going to be one of the really important parts .
And the American people need to understand that if you work with other countries , it 's actually a sign of strength .
And I think that is a very important message .
SESNO : Warren Christopher ?
WARREN CHRISTOPHER , 63TH SECRETARY OF STATE :
Well , I think we have to deal with the two wars we 're dealing with at the present time .
They 're draining our economy in enormous way .
I found when I came into office that our economy was in some difficulty .
The first year the president got through the Deficit Reduction Act , and it just improved things so much .
So I think the president needs to begin to work on that to give the world confidence that we can manage our own economy and thus we are a trusted partner .
SESNO : Secretary Baker ?
JAMES BAKER , 61ST SECRETARY OF STATE :
There are two things I think that the president ought to focus on in the very beginning .
And the first is to structure his national security apparatus , his -- used to say , or hers , but now I would his -- in a way that provides clear lines of authority and responsibility so that it can work together as a team , and so that everybody is singing from the same sheet of music .
That is extraordinarily important ...
SESNO : Is that a change ?
Are you suggesting that has n't happened ?
BAKER : In some administrations it has been good .
in some administrations it has been not so good .
But it is really critical to the formulation and implementation of a solid foreign policy .
SESNO : Dr. Kissinger , toughest problem ?
HENRY KISSINGER , 56TH SECRETARY OF STATE :
One of the problems early in an administration is a jockeying for position among various advisers who come in with strong opinions and then the president winds up in the position of adjudicating practical ( ph ) disputes that arise ( INAUDIBLE ) .
( CROSSTALK )
SESNO : Competition within the administration , imagine that , right ?
KISSINGER : Well , competition is good .
But it has to be resolved in -- to lead in an agreed direction so that ...
AMANPOUR : And what ...
KISSINGER : And then we can talk with conviction to the rest of the world .
I agree with what my colleagues have said about the importance of reaching out to the rest of the world .
AMANPOUR : Let 's have a look at where the U.S. stands in the world right now .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
AMANPOUR ( voice - over ) : Iraq , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , and embassies even in London that look like fortresses .
In much of the world , these images are telling America 's story .
Negative feelings towards United States are widespread , according to the most recent Pew study of global attitudes , which polled in two dozen countries .
In Egypt , Jordan and Pakistan , all U.S. allies , only 22 percent of respondents had a favorable opinion of the United States .
In Turkey , a member of NATO , 70 percent described the U.S. as the enemy .
Even in Germany , less than one - third said they hold America in high esteem .
There is some good news and improvements in some places , attributed to hopes for new policies under a new American president .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
AMANPOUR : So what should the new American president do to regain America 's respect around the world ?
Of course , it 's not a popularity contest .
This is not just about being liked .
It 's being able to get America 's business done .
Here is an e-mail question that I want to read out : " America is at a crossroads , " says Diana , from a viewer .
" We have a stretched military and tarnished if not destroyed relationships with other powers in the world .
Do you think , " she asks , " that the bully attitude is possible as American leaders move forward ?
What would enable America to gain respect ? "
Secretary Christopher , can the United States continue to be the demander in the world ?
CHRISTOPHER : No .
I think we have to take a much more cooperative attitude than we have been in the past , listening to other countries , recognizing our strength , but moving forward in a way that makes other countries feel they 'd like to be on our side , helping us .
AMANPOUR : General Powell , it 's not just about like , is it ?
It 's about being able to get things done .
America is the strongest nation in the world .
But a new intelligence report is going to tell the next president that America 's dominance is not going to be as supreme as it was .
So what do you tell the next president about how to regain respect ?
POWELL : I think we have to recognize that there are other nations in the world now whose economic strength is growing , and therefore their political influence is growing .
I do n't know that we should be afraid of this or see that as a threat to us .
Is n't this what we were working for all of these many decades ?
We wanted them to rise up and join the international economic community .
And that is what is happening .
We 're working multilaterally to solve the Iranian problem , the North Korean problem .
We have worked with the world to increase funding for HIV - AIDS .
We 've doubled the amount of money we 're putting into development assistance around the world .
So I think a case can be made that we can build on that strength .
And the new president , with a different approach to things , and with a different attitude to the rest of the world , can reverse this .
SESNO : But how about some tangible things that the next administration , the next president can do to change policy or send a signal that will address these issues ?
POWELL : Close Guantanamo .
ALBRIGHT : Close Guantanamo .
I think ...
BAKER : Close Guantanamo .
We were on a panel together several months ago , and we all agreed , one of the best things that could happen would be to close Guantanamo , which is a very serious blot upon our reputation .
ALBRIGHT : One of the issues is that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor in the world .
And there is the feeling that the United States is contributing to that gap .
I think that we have to do what Colin was saying in terms of helping on HIV - AIDS , and what Jim was talking about in terms of using various elements of our power .
The trick in this , and what 's hard , is how to have confidence and at the same time have some humility .
And that 's not easy if you 're in office .
And I think that is why how the next president immediately talks to the American people is going to be very important .
And realize that when he is talking to the American people , he is also talking to a foreign audience .
SESNO : Secretary Christopher ?
CHRISTOPHER : Outlaw torture in the same way it is outlawed in our military , have that extend to all agencies ...
SESNO : Waterboarding , all of that ?
CHRISTOPHER : Waterboarding and the ...
( CROSSTALK )
SESNO : Make a clear statement to the international community , that would have an impact ?
CHRISTOPHER : Absolutely , right away .
And second , I think that the new administration ought to take a forward - leaning position on climate change .
We ought to be leaders there rather than hanging back .
You know , we 've had sort of a dog in the manger position in the past .
We have n't been willing to move until China moves .
We have n't been willing to move until India moves .
I think the United States needs to be in a position of leadership to do the next thing after Kyoto in a very meaningful , effective way .
I think if we did those three things , Guantanamo , torture , and climate change , we'd be off to a very good start .
SESNO : Do you want to jump in , Dr. Kissinger ?
KISSINGER : America , in the nature of its position has had to be concerned -- maybe excessively , but in anyway , has had to be concerned with global security , which is very difficult for Europeans to ask their people to make sacrifices for .
So we have to understand that not everything that affects public opinion in the world is necessarily our fault , or we become totally paranoid .
BAKER : I really support what Chris said about climate change .
And I support it because we were in office when Kyoto first came down the pike .
We thought it was a bad treaty for the United States .
I still think that .
So we did n't sign it .
But America is going to have to lead the effort to get a global climate change treaty .
It 's a global problem .
It 's going to have to be solved globally .
We are going to have to bring all of these other countries in .
They can't be excluded , China and India and others .
But only America is going to be able to lead that charge .
SESNO : We 're going to have to take a break .
When we come back , we 'll start to get specific and peal back a bit of them map , Russia and Iran , the Middle East .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
SESNO ( voice - over ) :
This past August conjured up images of the Cold War as Russian tanks rolled yet again , this time in the small nation of Georgia .
It prompted growing concern that this is the new Russia , united under the authoritarian control of Vladimir Putin , plush with profits from oil and gas , resentful of what in many in Russia see as Western arrogance as the U.S. builds a missile shield in its backyard .
And the NATO alliance expands right to its door step .
Russia is determined to be a powerful player on the world stage again , and could change the whole game .
SESNO : What does the next president do about this new Russia ?
KISSINGER : We have a number of common issues that we have to settle , if possible , with Russia .
We need Russia for a solution of the Iranian problem .
We may need Russia if Pakistan evolves in some of the directions that it might .
We have to face the fact that the first shot in Georgia was fired on the Georgian side .
Now Russia reacted in an excessive manner .
But we should not make the whole relationship depend on the pictures that you showed ( ph ) .
And I would urge the new president , as I 'm urging this president , to explore the possibilities of cooperation and be very sure before we go the route of cutting off WTO and the other international measures for which cooperation with Russia may be very important .
And I think also that this Russia is not democratic , but it is also not what it was before , and that one must permit some evolution to take place .
SESNO : Secretary Baker ?
BAKER : Well , I told -- I agree with what Henry said .
I think it was interesting to note what Secretary Gates said just last week when he said the United -- the administration has come to a unified position on how to deal with the Russia - Georgia problem , and that is to look at it in a strategic context and not tactically .
You know , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , when the Soviet Union broke up and Russia -- I mean , Georgia became an independent country back there in 1991 , neither of those enclaves wanted to join Georgia .
SESNO : You were there .
You were ...
BAKER : And I was there .
And they wanted to be -- they wanted to be with Russia .
They did n't want to be with Georgia .
And so I guess what I 'm saying is , we have some big picture issues that we need to be conscious of when we think about our future with Russia .
And we ought to cooperate with them where we can , where it makes sense , but we ought to also be willing to confront them where our vital interests are involved .
We are committed to the independence of these former republics of the former Soviet Union .
And that should continue to be our position .
That does n't mean we ought to send the 101st Airborne in to guard the South Ossetian border .
I mean , that would not make very good sense .
And that 's not the kind of thing we ought to be speculating about .
AMANPOUR : But can we just cut to the chase here .
Both the Clinton administration and the current Bush administration have pushed for NATO expansion eastwards and right to the former Soviet republic .
Georgia they want in NATO , Ukraine , they in NATO .
Now you 've got Russia invading Georgia .
Is the advice to the next president of the United States therefore , you have to go to war against Russia in order to protect your NATO allies ?
ALBRIGHT : Well , first of all , I think we have to understand what NATO expansion was about .
It was trying to erase an artificial line from the Cold War and was not , as we saw it , anything that was anti- Russian .
It was not a NATO -- it was a new NATO , theoretically against a new Russian that was there that we even talked about Russia being a part of it .
So it is now -- it should not be viewed that way .
And I also think that countries have the right to choose whatever alliance they want to be in .
And the main thing , while I fully agree that we can't go back to the Cold War and have a really very bad adversarial relationship with Russia , Russia cannot think that independent countries on its border are a threat to them .
So I think -- I personally believe that we need to go forward with the Membership Action Plan for Georgia and for Ukraine , and keep explaining that it is not a threat .
AMANPOUR : Except for , General Powell , it basically hopes that Russia is not going to be the aggressor .
And if Russia is and you have to , you know , keep your NATO allies ' security , are n't you then committed ?
POWELL : Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty , which is the NATO Treaty , when one member of the alliance is attacked from abroad -- meaning outside the NATO geographic limits -- then all members of NATO treat that as an attack .
AMANPOUR : And yet ...
POWELL : Article 5 has only been invoked once in the history of the alliance , and that was on the 12th of September , 2001 , when it was invoked in our favor , when the whole NATO alliance said we were attacked , the alliance was attacked on 9/11 .
Now , in the current situation , the Russians acted brutally .
I think they acted foolishly .
But it was also absolutely predictable what the Russians would do .
You could see them stacking up their troops .
And I think it was foolhardy on the part of President Saakashvili and the Georgian government to kick over this can , to light a match in a roomful of gas fumes .
SESNO : So you 're saying the Georgians provoked this ?
POWELL : They did .
I mean , there was a lot of reasons to have provocations in the area , but the match that started the conflagration was from the Georgian side .
AMANPOUR : And yet ...
POWELL : And that 's a given .
AMANPOUR : And some debate in the presidential elections has basically been , " We are all Georgians now . "
What does that mean ?
It 's the same as was said after 9/11 .
POWELL : One candidate said that , and I 'll let the candidate explain it for himself .
( LAUGHTER )
SESNO : You can help a little , if you 'd like .
POWELL : No , the fact of the matter is that you -- you have to be very careful in a situation like this not just to leap to one side or the other until you 've taken a good analysis of the whole situation .
This was something that might have been avoided if people had looked at the Russian troops that were stacked up , if people had realized that the Russians were serious about South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and if perhaps more guidance and suggestions had been given to President Saakashvili beyond those that he received , it might have been avoided .
But it was n't .
It 's over .
The Russians are the offenders right now .
And we have to see that .
We cannot say to the Russians , " We are not going to allow the Georgians or Ukrainians or anyone else to start down the path toward NATO membership . "
It 's not for the Russians to decide that .
But I think it is wise for us to look at the whole strategic situation and all of our equities before deciding how fast that should happen and whether it 's the time to do it right now .
The Russian Federation is not going to become the Soviet Union again .
That movie failed at the box office .
But they do have interests .
And we have to think carefully about their interests .
So you have to treat Russia as a proud country that lost a lot of its pride some 15 , 16 years ago , and it 's restored with a political leadership that is enormously popular in the country and with a level of wealth they 've never had before , and with concerns about their near abroad , and treat them in a straightforward , business - like , objective way and not emotionally .
BAKER : Do it strategically and not tactically .
You 're going to -- you had these -- you 're going to have these border conflicts all around the periphery of the former Soviet Union .
They 're there .
Stalin created it , ethnic tensions .
And these are little flash fires that we need to be aware of and deal with properly , but it 's -- that should not be a cause for rupturing the entire big relationship , unless we can't keep that big relationship together to deal with nonproliferation , to deal with environment , climate change , you name it .
AMANPOUR : Secretary Baker , you just talked about strategically , not tactically .
Let 's talk about Iran , which has been a strategic and tactical headache for the United States over the last 30 years .
Let 's say , in the few weeks after the inauguration of the next president , a message comes from Iran that the Iranians are ready to do a deal , all conditions on the table .
Is the advice to the next American president to once again put conditions to expect Iran to cry uncle or to engage ?
Secretary Albright ?
ALBRIGHT : I believe we need to engage with Iran .
I think the whole point is you try to engage and deal with countries that you have problems with and take the Russians ( ph ) ... AMANPOUR : So what do you advise the president when he gets this message across his desk or it comes to the State Department that the Iranians are seeking feelers ?
ALBRIGHT : You begin to look at what level to talk at .
And actually , something like that happened when we were in office .
And you begin to find the right level .
And I think it 's one of the most important relationships that we need to work on .
We are not gaining anything by this .
And I -- while there are many issues , ultimately , Iran has benefited the most from the war in Iraq .
And I think that we need to deal with them .
AMANPOUR : The intelligence assessment that 's going to be given to the next president says that Iran , they believe , will continue to seek to enrich uranium , but at the moment they do n't see evidence of building a weapon .
Can the United States , despite all that 's been said up to now , can the world live with a nuclear Iran ?
POWELL : The Iranians are telling us that they are developing a nuclear program and they 're doing it for civilian use and for power generation .
Once you know how to do that , that 5 percent enrichment , you can scale it up to 90 percent enrichment and make a weapon .
So I agree with Madeleine , and I suspect my other colleagues , that we should start to talk to them .
Do n't wait for , you know , a letter coming from them .
Start discussions .
We were talking to them up through the middle of 2003 .
AMANPOUR : So take the initiative ?
POWELL : Yes .
Why should n't we ?
( CROSSTALK )
POWELL : We did .
BAKER : We did .
In our administration , way back in '91 .
POWELL : We were talking to them through 2003 at a low level .
And then it was stopped .
And so find a way -- and do n't make it , " Let 's get together and talk just about nuclear weapons or just about this or just about that . "
Start a dialogue at a low level and let it grow over time .
SESNO : Might the next president have to have a showdown with his Israeli allies , to tell them to hold back ?
CHRISTOPHER : I must say our relationship with Israel needs to be strong enough so we can say to them , " Look , we want to have a comprehensive dialogue with the Iranians .
We can't be complacent about the nuclear possibilities in Iran , but nevertheless we cannot afford not to have a comprehensive dialogue to see if it can be stopped , " because , frankly , the military options here are very , very poor .
And if that 's what the Israelis are advocating , I think that we have to tell them that we think their military options are very poor and we do n't want to go down that route .
SESNO : So neither candidate , neither of the men who would be president has taken the military option with respect to Iran off the table ?
CHRISTOPHER : I did n't say to take them off the table .
( CROSSTALK )
BAKER : Can I just say one -- one more thing ?
When I was in office , we had a standing policy with the Iranians .
We were ready to talk to them , provided it would be done at an official level , at the level of the secretary of state , and they did -- they would n't -- they did n't have enough domestic political support for that .
Having vilified us as the Great Satan for so long , they could n't get the domestic political support necessary to meet with us .
So it was n't the case of our -- we had n't been isolating Iran from that standpoint .
We offered to meet with them at the level of secretary of state .
And I think a well - placed , quiet , private phone call to the Iranian leadership , if you can find out which leaders to talk to , to the effect , " Look , if you do so much as aim a missile or anything else toward Israel or toward anything else , toward Israel or toward us , our strategic nuclear deterrent can be re-aimed in 20 seconds , " they would understand that , I think .
AMANPOUR : I 'm sure they would .
( LAUGHTER )
But the question is , do you want to change the policy ?
And do you want to actually try to engage for strategic reasons ?
BAKER : We ought to engage , yes .
AMANPOUR : To use them for help in ...
POWELL : I think we 're all saying yes .
BAKER : We 're all saying you ought to engage , I think .
I do n't know .
I have n't heard Henry .
He may not .
( LAUGHTER )
KISSINGER : Well , I am in favor of negotiating with Iran .
And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East , of a stable Middle East , and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it .
And , therefore , I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we -- we know we 're dealing with authentic ...
( CROSSTALK )
SESNO : Put at a very high level right out of the box ?
KISSINGER : Initially , yes .
And I always believed that the best way to begin a negotiation is to tell the other side exactly what you have in mind and what you are -- what the outcome is that you 're trying to achieve so that they have something that they can react to .
Now , the permanent members of the Security Council , plus Japan and Germany , have all said nuclear weapons in Iran are unacceptable .
They 've never explained what they mean by this .
So if we go into a negotiation , we ought to have a clear understanding of what is it we 're trying to prevent .
What is it going to do if we can't achieve what we 're talking about ?
But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations .
We ought , however , to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government .
ALBRIGHT : I think also we need to make clear that what we 're doing is not counterproductive .
At the moment , I think we do n't understand Iranian society .
It is not monolithic .
There are various aspects of the fact that Ahmadinejad is not particularly popular .
There are economic issues .
And the more that we go around vilifying them , we create -- put him a stronger position .
And so not only should we do these steps that the others have been talking about , but we have to make sure that we 're not undercutting what we want to do by creating a bigger problem than we have .
AMANPOUR : So it looks like there 's possibly some different advice to the next president .
And on that note , we 're going to take a break .
When we come back , we 're going to discuss Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan , and the war on terrorism .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
AMANPOUR : Welcome back to the Lisner Auditorium on the campus of the George Washington University .
I'm Christiane Amanpour .
SESNO : And I 'm Frank Sesno .
And we 're discussing what advice these five former secretaries of state have for the next president .
AMANPOUR : The Pentagon believes that the Iraq war has begun winding down , Afghanistan beginning to ratchet up .
And the general , your successor , one of your successors , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , has said , " I 'm not convinced that we 're winning in Afghanistan , " but he adds that we can win .
What does the next president of the United States have to do to make sure that Afghanistan , six years later , actually is winnable ?
POWELL : Well , you have to first ask Admiral Mullen what he meant and what does he need to keep that from happening ...
AMANPOUR : Well , he said more troops .
That 's for sure .
POWELL : More troops is one thing .
And , of course , General Petraeus is now responsible for that theater as well , that sub - theater , as we call it .
And more troops is one thing to do , but I think you also have to get into the Afghan government .
It is not functioning as effectively as it must if it is going to create a solid democracy .
There 's a great deal of corruption .
You 've got to do something about the drug problem in Afghanistan .
But perhaps the problem that is causing the most difficulty now is the tribal areas in Pakistan , which are a free zone right now for the Taliban .
And so the Taliban has been able to re-create itself and grow itself in those areas .
And so one of the major challenges for the next president is to create a relationship with Pakistan where we can get their full cooperation and their activity to help bring that border area under control .
Otherwise , there is a sanctuary there that can be violated or crossed constantly and create problems in Afghanistan .
And when you look at Afghanistan , you have to consider Pakistan .
They 're interrelated .
AMANPOUR : You say Pakistan .
Does there have to be a new Pakistan policy ?
Right now , or up until now , until he was basically booted , the Pakistan policy was a Musharraf - type policy .
BAKER : Yes , but you now have a new government in Pakistan , but I think the policy is not -- should not change much .
But as Colin pointed out , we 've got to get the Pakistan government to , together with us , take control of those tribal areas .
We need to beef up the elements of soft power for this country .
We need more -- we really need more civilian ( INAUDIBLE ) .
When you talk about reconstructing a country , beyond the provision of more troops , you 've got to get civill reconstruction teams in there , economic development .
You need more -- actually , we need more foreign service personnel .
You know , we have today , I think , active foreign service officers , maybe 6,500 , not as many as there are on one aircraft carrier .
We need more there .
We need more foreign assistance .
That has been diminishing every year for the past probably 15 years .
So how can we -- how can we reconstruct these countries if we do n't have the elements of soft power that we need to do it ?
SESNO : Secretary Christopher , what do you tell that next president ?
If he 's going to build on these elements of power and win in Afghanistan , what 's the winning strategy or combination ?
CHRISTOPHER : Ironically , Secretary Gates has been the strongest spokesman for having more support on soft power .
You know , the ...
SESNO : Can I stop you right there ?
We actually were drawn to a comment that Secretary Gates said .
Take a look at what he said .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ROBERT GATES , SECRETARY OF DEFENSE : Based on my experience serving seven presidents , as a former director of CIA and now as secretary of defense , I am here to make the case for strengthening our capacity to use soft power and for better integrating it with hard power .
One of the most important lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
CHRISTOPHER : Well , that 's a terrific statement by him .
You know , the military budget is about 20 times the State Department 's budget .
I have nothing against lawyers , but there are more lawyers in the Pentagon than there are foreign service officers -- just amazing .
If we want -- if we really believe in negotiation , if we believe in diplomacy , we have to strengthen that arm of our government .
So I would make the case to the president we must enormously strengthen that and change those budgetary priorities , that budgetary disproportion .
POWELL : In Afghanistan , we did not create conditions of security in the early years .
And so soft power has a role to play , and it 's complementary to hard power , but do n't underestimate the need to do the first thing that all governments have to do , and that is to provide security for their people .
AMANPOUR : OK , just to be , you know , call a spade a spade , Afghanistan was on the way to success , and you were there -- your administration was there .
I would say the consensus is that the eye was taken off the ball , and it went to Iraq .
Now you face what could have been a success and an example and a stabilizing phenomenon in that region .
You know , you need to snatch back victory from the jaws of defeat .
So really , practically , pragmatically , what do you tell the next secretary of state -- the next president , as a diplomat and as a military man , what do you tell him ?
How do you get back Afghanistan ?
POWELL : If we have provided a level of security in Iraq with our troops -- those that are remaining , as well as the improving Iraqi forces -- shift your attention , shift your hard power attention and your soft power attention to Afghanistan , because I think the risks in Afghanistan almost outweigh the risk we 've been facing for the last three years in Iraq .
AMANPOUR : We 'll talk more about some of the major responsibilities , including some of the leads that the next president can take , climate change , energy .
And , indeed , we 're going to talk a little bit about the Middle East , which has burned so many administrations .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
AMANPOUR : Israel - Palestine has been a challenge for American administrations since it first began .
Is there , Secretary Baker , a deal to be made anywhere there -- Israel , Palestinian , Syrian , anywhere ?
BAKER : Today , I do n't think there is , but I think there could be for the new president .
I would advise the new president to engage fully and completely with Syria .
I happen to be one who thinks that we could flip Syria away from Iran .
I think Syria 's marriage to Iran is a marriage of convenience , and therefore I think it 's ridiculous for us to say we 're not going to talk to Syria , and yet the Israelis have been negotiating peace with them for the last six or eight months .
Now , because of the situation domestically within Israel and the Israeli politics , I do n't think they 're going to reach an agreement , but I think there is a Syrian deal to be had .
And it is much , much easier to do that deal than it is to do a deal with the Palestinians .
SESNO : Secretary Christopher , let me flip over to you for a minute and go to Iraq .
What should the next president do to assure success and continued progress in Iraq ?
CHRISTOPHER : I think the next president ought to put a lot of pressure on people in Iraq to try to come to some political conciliation .
They really have not made any progress down that road at all .
But I think the No. 1 thing that needs to be done in Iraq is to try to , one way or the other , through either pressure or incentives , to try to encourage them to come to some political reconciliation , which they 're a long ways from .
All the developments on that front in the last two or three weeks have been discouraging rather than encouraging .
SESNO : General Powell , I 'm wondering whether you agree with that and agree with putting the timetable out there and what kind of -- you 're a military man , as well .
So how does that work ?
POWELL : Well , I agree with Chris that we have to put more pressure on the Iraqi political leaders to move on with reconciliation -- that ultimately is the answer -- and to build up their own security forces .
SESNO : Timetable for leaving ?
POWELL : They are giving us a timetable .
They 're telling us when they want us out .
They do n't want us to stay a day longer than necessary .
So I would not want to put down an artificial timetable , but I would make it clear that the draw - down will continue .
If conditions are getting better , then increase the rate of draw - down .
If conditions are getting worse , then stop and pause and make sure we do n't lose what we 've gained .
KISSINGER : I think the right outcome is to continue on what we 'll -- on what we 're doing , to withdraw troops as we can but we should not put this in terms of a -- of pressure that we need to put on the government in order to achieve a reconciliation with groups that have been fighting each other , which is essentially Sunnis and Shias .
AMANPOUR : The other big thing that we were talking about , in terms of advice to a new president , is climate change .
Can we first know whether there 's a consensus amongst all of you that climate change has a lot to do with mankind , that man is contributing to the global warming ?
We all agree ?
ALBRIGHT : Except in Alaska .
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AMANPOUR : Now , now .
( UNKNOWN ) : You broke the rules .
You broke the ...
BAKER : That 's a breaking of the rules .
( UNKNOWN ) : You broke the rules .
BAKER : This is a nonpolitical gathering here .
ALBRIGHT : ( OFF - MIKE )
SESNO : It was just coincidental , right ?
I see .
Uh-huh .
AMANPOUR : So it 's a gathering of like minds on the origin of climate change and perhaps on what we need to do about it .
What does the United States need to do to take the lead on something that is so vital globally ?
BAKER : Kill all the cows , because most of it comes from cow farts .
( LAUGHTER )
AMANPOUR : We 're leaving that in .
BAKER : I know that .
( CROSSTALK )
SESNO : How very diplomatic of you .
( LAUGHTER )
AMANPOUR : Cows against Baker .
BAKER : Cows , that 's right .
AMANPOUR : Seriously .
BAKER : Well , I 've said it earlier , Christiane .
I think the United States needs to lead an effort , global effort -- it 's a global problem -- to round up all the countries that have to be -- major countries that put carbon dioxide in the air , that have to be a party to any treaty .
And you 're not going to get it done if the president of the United States does n't lead the charge .
So it 's one of the major , I think , responsibilities of the new president to do something about that , but do it in a way that does n't destroy our economy and that is not -- and that is not detrimental to the United States in the way that the Kyoto treaty was , where you exclude some of the biggest polluters .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
SESNO : And welcome back to our conversation with five former secretaries of state .
Christiane Amanpour and I are pleased to be here at the campus of the George Washington University .
Let 's go to the floor now .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Hello .
My name is Harris Davidson ( ph ) , and I 'm from Greenwich , Connecticut .
Many members of the media have suggested that electing the first African - American to our nation 's highest office would send a powerful image to our allies overseas .
Do you think electing Senator Obama would send the same message abroad as electing Senator McCain would ?
BAKER : Well , I think electing the first African - American president would send a powerful message not just abroad , but within this country as well .
Having said that , I have , of course , endorsed Senator McCain .
( LAUGHTER )
ALBRIGHT : We just came from the Democratic convention , and I 'm chairman of the board of the National Democratic Institute , and we had over 500 foreign visitors there .
About -- more than half of the visitors there were people of color .
And I think it would send a huge message , in terms of what America stands for and in terms of diversity and potential .
And I , of course , am supporting Senator Obama .
( APPLAUSE )
You -- you said you were supporting Senator McCain .
AMANPOUR : We have to ask you .
POWELL : I think there 's no question that it would send that kind of a message .
I think it would be electrifying .
But at the same time , we have to make a judgment here within our country as to which of the candidates brings the right measure of experience and judgment to the task and which would be best for America .
I have been watching both of these individuals .
I know them both extremely well , and I have not decided who I 'm going to vote for yet .
And I 'm anxious to see what the debates are going to be like , because we 've got get off this " lipstick on a pig " stuff and get into issues .
( APPLAUSE )
SESNO : How much harder is this for you ?
You were the first African - American secretary of state .
This has to be personal ...
POWELL : I 'm an American , first and foremost .
And I 'm very proud ...
( APPLAUSE )
... I 've said -- I 've said to -- I 've said to my beloved friend and colleague , John McCain , a friend of 25 years -- John , I love you -- but I 'm not just going to vote for you on the basis of our affection and friendship .
And I 've said to Barack Obama , I admire you , I 'll give you all the advice I can , but I 'm not going to vote for you just because you 're black .
We have to move beyond this .
AMANPOUR : Should we go to our next question ?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : My name is Michael Herman ( ph ) .
I 'm from Minneapolis , Minnesota .
And I was wondering , how do you see the U.S. responding to humanitarian crises , like the situation in Darfur ?
CHRISTOPHER :
When you look at some of the problems around the world , we need to work through the other countries of the world and other regional organizations .
And that 's especially true in Darfur .
It 's a very demanding , appealing crisis , but I 'm not sure putting a lot of American troops in there , without thinking through those other issues , makes a lot of sense for us .
POWELL : I could n't agree more with Chris .
You look at something like Darfur , and it just breaks your heart .
But the ultimate solution to the crisis in Darfur is political solution between the rebels and the government in Khartoum .
AMANPOUR : Well , not to put ...
POWELL : We 've done a lot , though , with humanitarian support in other places .
AMANPOUR : Not to put too fine a point on it .
It 's the same that was said about Bosnia , Rwanda , and et cetera .
Since all of you have presided over these periods in American history and global history , can we pin you down ?
The United States has called it genocide , what 's happening in Darfur .
Secretary Albright , what should the next president do ?
ALBRIGHT : Well , I think it 's in U.S. national interests , in fact , to do something about humanitarian situations that lead to or are genocidal .
And the question is how you get the will of the American people behind it .
It is not easy .
But , I 'll say this , is , if you 're the United States , you 're damned if you do or damned if you do n't .
We intervened in Somalia , and people thought that was a mistake .
We did n't intervene in Rwanda , and people thought that was a mistake .
And what has to happen is for us to be clearer about the extent to which humanitarian intervention and humanitarian assistance is in U.S. national interest .
And if it is , as I believe it is , it 's to have the various resources that are necessary for it and explain it to the American people as a national security issue .
BAKER : But you also have to have a healthy dose of national interest involved , because otherwise you lose the support of the American people .
Your foreign policy can only be sustained as long as you bring the American people along with it .
They are the final arbiter of foreign policy in our democracy .
We can not be the policemen for the world .
We should n't be asked to be , could n't be if we wanted .
AMANPOUR : OK , so many , many people on campuses all over the United States have distinguished themselves by creating a grassroots movement for Darfur .
If I remember , you in your administration said that we do n't have a dog in this fight about the Balkans , about Bosnia ...
BAKER : That 's not actually what I said , but it's now out there in the ether , and you 'll never get rid of it .
AMANPOUR : What did you say ?
BAKER : I did n't say that .
I did n't say that .
It was reported that I said that , but I did n't .
I did n't say it .
AMANPOUR : OK , but , nonetheless , we did n't do anything at that time .
So the question is , should the American president lead ...
BAKER : Well , we did n't do anything for about four or five years after that , if I 'm not mistaken .
AMANPOUR : OK .
Should the American president lead on these issues of vital human rights interests ?
BAKER : He should lead , but he should lead wisely and not commit American lives to a task that is not going to be supported by the American people .
We should do what Colin said : work through private voluntary organizations , do what we can diplomatically with countries that are involved in Darfur , particularly the government of Sudan , the government of China and others , to bring about a solution to the problem .
But do n't start talking about sending troops on an issue like that all the way around the world , because you 're going to lose the American people .
Then you 'll lose the policy .
ALBRIGHT : Then we should not have declared it genocide , because once it 's declared a genocide ...
BAKER : I did n't declare it genocide , Madeleine .
POWELL : I did .
ALBRIGHT : Well ...
( LAUGHTER )
AMANPOUR : You did ?
POWELL : I did .
No , I did .
I sent teams over to see what was going on , and the reports came back in .
And it was a judgment call on my part .
But based on what I saw the Janjaweed doing under the leadership of the Khartoum regime and how it was affecting the people -- and I visited the area -- I felt that it met the standards of being called genocidal .
And our responsibility when we make such a declaration is to report it to the U.N. for the U.N. to make a judgment independently , under the law .
This is the international law .
And the U.N. made their analysis and did not judge it to be genocide , and we pretty much stand alone in the international community calling it that .
And I still think it is .
The problem has to be solved politically between the government in Khartoum and the rebels .
SESNO : If I may just follow up briefly on that , then , Secretary Albright , is not there then an important point to be made by the United States and the world going on record and saying , " This is genocide , " recognizing the limitations as you 've just established them .
It does clearly establish a point , an important historical point , does it not ?
ALBRIGHT : I think it does .
But , also , there are so many aspects to this .
We need to figure out how to prevent genocide .
And one of the things ...
SESNO : What you 're saying is you should n't declare it if you can't back it up with your troops if it 's happening ?
ALBRIGHT : Well , I think there is an issue , in terms of it is n't just our troops .
It 's a matter of whether we provide logistics assistance to those who might want to go in , strengthen the African Union , decide whether there should be a no - fly zone .
SESNO : Do something .
ALBRIGHT : But I have to say , I anguish over this , because I know how difficult it is .
And we did n't do anything about Bosnia for a while , but we actually did in the end , and we won , and we did it in Kosovo , and it was the right thing to do .
And I think we have to figure out where our resources are .
And when you say it 's up to the president of the United States , I agree .
And that 's why we have to figure out what the role of the United States is .
That is what this election is about .
AMANPOUR : And , unfortunately , we are out of time now , and we'd like to thank our panel once again , the former Secretaries of State Warren Christopher , Henry Kissinger , Madeleine Albright , James Baker , and Colin Powell .
Thank you all very much for being here .
( APPLAUSE )
SESNO : We 'd also like to thank the organizations that made this possible , the School of Media and Public Affairs and the Elliott School of International Affairs here at the George Washington University , the Center for a New American Security , the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University , and the Colin Powell Center of Policy Studies at the City College of New York .
I 'm Frank Sesno .
AMANPOUR : And I'm Christiane Amanpour .
Thank you very much for joining us .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Many pesticides used in the European Union may damage brain growth in fetuses and young children , according to a study published on Friday .
The study urged the European Union to tighten restrictions .
“ Toxicity to the brain is not routinely included in testing pesticides , ” Philippe Grandjean of the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Southern Denmark told Reuters .
“ Because many of them are by design toxic to the brain of insects , it is very likely that they are also toxic to human brains , ” he said of a review of almost 200 scientific reports worldwide about the brain and pesticides .
“ Laboratory experimental studies using model compounds suggest that many pesticides currently used in Europe ... can cause neuro - developmental toxicity , ” Grandjean and two colleagues in Denmark wrote in the journal Environmental Health .
The developing brain of the fetus and young child is far more sensitive than the adult brain to disruptions from chemicals , they said .
The study focused on the use of pesticides in the 27 - nation EU , which is currently reviewing pesticide laws .
It urged greater testing and caution in approving chemicals because of uncertainties about their effects .
Manufacturers say their pesticides are safe for humans .
“ Many other countries are watching what the EU is doing ... It should take these matters much more seriously than in the past , ” Grandjean said .
Many pesticides used in the EU are also used in other nations .
Pesticides used on food crops in the EU exceed 140,000 tonnes a year , corresponding to 280 grams ( 10 ounces ) per EU citizen , the study said .
More than 25 percent of fruits , vegetables , and cereals contain detectable residues of at least two pesticides .
The study said that pesticide chemicals that could be damaging included organophosphates , carbamates , pyrethroids , ethylenebisdithiocarbamates and chlorophenoxy herbicides .

While the current financial crisis has received much attention , another crisis has led to calls for government intervention .
The Maryland blue crab population has dropped sharply in recent years .
The annual catch is now thirty percent of its previous level of 140 million crabs .
Some people blame pollution , overharvesting , and development of nesting areas for the decline in the crab population .
The Virginia Marine Resources Commission has failed to remedy this situation .
Twenty - two regulatory measures ( enacted in 1994 ) have failed to stem the decline in the crab population .
New regulations and licensing requirements have been proposed to limit the ability to catch crabs .
Some senators are urging that the crab crisis be declared a federal disaster , so that Chesapeake crabbers can receive $ 20 million in aid .
This is not the first time that there have been calls for subsidies for the Maryland crab industry .
While politicians think in terms of subsidies and production limits as solutions to the crab crisis , economics points to different solutions .
The root cause of the crab crisis is that nobody owns the breeding grounds ( which of course are water ) for crabs or crabs themselves .
Fishing areas and swamps are not generally private property , and crabs themselves for the most part roam freely and are not the property of any individuals .
Lack of private - property rights leads to particular problems .
The tragedy of the commons exists because nobody has an incentive to invest in communal property .
In a true fishing commons , anyone can draw fish or crabs , simply by having access ( by boat ) and the necessary equipment .
Private owners of cattle capture the gain from breeding and caring for their livestock , but anyone investing in breeding and maintaining crabs shares any gain with all other ( noncontributing ) fisherman .
Government regulations and licensing requirements set limits on the ability to harvest crabs , but these limits are arbitrary .
Since the crab population is itself commonly owned , there is no price on any market for the crab population as an asset .
So government restrictions on crab harvesting are not economically rational .
A government - regulated crab industry will therefore not be coordinated with other lines of production .
The ability to invest rationally in preserving or breeding crabs requires some estimate of the associated capital costs .
Of course , one could argue that there is no way to establish property rights for schools of crabs .
But this is not true .
There are many examples where people have established self - governing , self - organized associations to solve the type of problems that plague the Maryland crab industry .
People all over the world have established " common pools resource " ( CPR ) associations that regulate access to water - related resources that are difficult to define in terms of normal property rights .
The specific terms of CPRs vary according to local circumstances and problems , but the general idea behind a CPR is that the people who are directly involved in using resources where property boundaries are hard to define construct a set of rules for exploiting the resource in question .
For example , fishermen in Alanya , Turkey established a CPR organization that defined rights to fishing areas .
Central officials in government could not have crafted such rules , as only the local people understood the economic value of fishing areas ( Ostrom , p. 20 ) .
While CPR organizations do not produce property rights in exactly the same way as we are accustomed to , such arrangements do function very much like normal property - rights systems .
CPR systems also have a good track record in comparison to overt government regulation .
CPRs are in fact quasi - governmental arrangements that emerge to deal with tragedies of the commons .
Those who have publicized their concerns about the Maryland crab crisis have turned to governmental regulation and subsidies too quickly .
CPR organizations can emerge out of individual trading and negotiating , and such arrangements are more likely to lead to economically efficient results .
In fact , the government has already tried and failed to alleviate the Maryland crab crisis .
Perhaps we should let capitalism have a crack at this problem .
India imports tonnes of hazardous waste from 105 nations despite an SC ban on itNAGPUR : India has indeed grown significantly in the past few years in terms of international clout and economic strength , but many countries still treat it as a dustbin .
From the debris of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) to the titanium wastes of the nuclear reactors worldwide , India is becoming a dumping ground for the world ’s trash .
“ The scenario of hazardous wastes in India is grim , ” says a senior scientist with the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute ( NEERI ) , the central research body with its headquarters at Nagpur .
“ It ’s a growing cause for worry .
” A research by the NEERI some time back says that in 2002 - 2003 India imported 6,751 tonnes of explosive scrap , most of it from the Ivory Coast .
But thousands of tonnes of unaccounted hazardous waste were dumped , which has been lying at various ports .
Environmentalists and environmental scientists say India is already a trashcan for the world .
Be it hazardous municipal wastes , nuclear spillages or asbestos , it ’s all being dumped clandestinely here , subverting environmental concerns on the pretext of boosting recycling business .
Sources in NEERI say some 105 nations dump their hazardous non-biodegradable waste in India , at the peril of ignorant masses , mocking at the supreme court ’s clear “ no ” to bringing this trash in .
“ The import of non-biodegradable plastic waste grew exponentially at an annual rate of 62 % between 1997 and 2005 and that of organo - mercury compounds by an astounding 1,500 times , ” the research paper of the NEERI says .
Add to it hazardous wastes generated in India .
Reports of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee ( SCMC ) on hazardous waste estimate that India generates around 44 lakh tonnes of waste annually .
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pegs it at 50 lakh tones .
The estimate is based on 18 categories of wastes , as per the Hazardous Wastes Manual rules first published in 1989 .
Out of this , only 38.3 % are recyclable , 4.3 % are incinerable and remaining 57.4 % are disposable in secured landfills .
But environmentalists say the country has no secured landfills at all .
The figure is small , compared to the US ’s 275 MT waste generation .
“ However , considering India ’s fragile ecosystem , even this quantum of waste can cause considerable damage if untreated before releases , ” says a top NEERI scientist .
India has 13,011 big industrial units located in 340 districts .
Of those , 11,038 units have authorization for multiple disposal practices encompassing incineration , storage land disposal and other disposal options .
Environmentalists say the small and medium enterprises are major sources of hazardous waste generation .
According to the National Productivity Council , New Delhi , there are more than three million small and medium scale industries spread in the country in clusters and industrial estates , which need to be monitored for their waste disposal .
Significantly , 12 states , including Maharashtra , account for 97 % hazardous waste generation , according to the SCMC on hazardous waste constituted by the apex court three years ago .
It has submitted a status report on hazardous waste in India , but the contents are not yet public .
Last year , the SCMC said the country lacks in hazardous waste disposal .
Only five states — Gujarat , Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh — have treatment storage disposal facility , a must for every state .
I 'm sorry , there 's no pattern , it was just made up as I went along .
It 's basically just a long rectangle with the first and last row sewn together to make the walls .
Then I made two same size squares for the bottom and top , and sewed those on .
That 's the box .
Then I made a slightly smaller rectangle and attached that on the roof .
Finally , I made a short ribbon ( a chain and sc back ) to imitate the bit that in reality and the police box signs .
This is all judging by the picture , because I can't remember really making this
One of the most interesting elements of the Friday night Presidential debate was the focus group lines that were colored for Republican , Democrat and Independents .
These lines showed how real Americans ( not political pundits ) felt about what was being said during the debate .
Barack Obama did have an edge with the focus groups to be certain , especially noticeable during the final minutes .
But what was perhaps the most shocking reaction :
When Republican John McCain made mention of his " Maverick " partner , without saying Sarah Palin 's name outright , the focus group lines dipped dramatically .
Has the Sarah Palin love fest ended already ?
Much of the lines stayed flat throughout but McCain 's discussion related to the Iraq war did little to stimulate the focus groups .
As for the prediction markets , McCain appears to have improved his standing following the debate .
Prior to the start , McCain was listed with a 43.9 percent chance of becoming the next US President .
He moved up to 47.2 percent immediately following the debate while Obama dropped from 55.7 percent to 53.6 percent .
( all courtesy of intrade.com )
The first 30 minutes of the debate focused on the economy , even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy .
The economy has dominated the campaign trail for the past two weeks .
Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $ 700 billion plan proposed by President Bush 's top economic advisers , saying the final details of the proposal were not yet known .
McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it and the focus group lines dropped noticeably .

The fact that a conservative approach to Wall Street — down with regulations !
down with oversight ! — has led to America ’s financial mess appears to be sinking in .
But do n’t forget that deregulation has screwed up much more than Wall Street .
The conservative hands - off approach has neutered nearly every science - based agency in the federal government these last eight years .
That ’s the point of Chris Mooney ’s “ Return of the Geeks . ”
Check it out .
No surprise , Bush Administration hacks prioritized deregulation of industry over science and oversight , to disastrous results .
Conservatives love to slam “ big government . ”
But the lack of effective regulation and oversight has led to problems in a number of areas , many of which Mother Jones has covered .

THIEVES in Jamaica have embarrassed police and triggered a political row by stealing a beach .
Hundreds of tonnes of white sand vanished from a planned resort on the island 's north coast in July , but three months later there is no sign of suspects nor sand .
An estimated 500 truckloads of sand were removed from the Coral Spring beach in Trelawny and were believed to have been sold to rival resorts , a hefty logistical feat that stumped police .
" It 's a very complex investigation because it involves so many aspects , " Mark Shields , the deputy commissioner for crime at the Jamaica Constabulary Force , told the BBC .
" You 've got the receivers of the stolen sand , or what we believe to be the sand .
The trucks themselves , the organisers and , of course , there is some suspicion that some police were in collusion with the movers of the sand . "
Most browser implementors are quick to adopt emerging Internet technologies , but Microsoft can't or wo n't make Internet Explorer a modern web browser .
Despite some positive steps in the right direction , Internet Explorer still lacks many important features .
Its mediocrity has arguably hampered the evolution of the web and forced many site designers to depend on suboptimal proprietary solutions .
IE 's shortcomings wo n't hold back the Internet for much longer , however , because Mozilla plans to drag IE into the next generation of open web technologies without Microsoft 's help .
One of the first steps towards achieving this goal is a new experimental plugin that adapts Mozilla 's implementation of the HTML5 Canvas element so that it can be used in Internet Explorer .
The Canvas element allows web developers to programmatically render interactive bitmap images in HTML content .
It was invented by Apple to bring richer graphical capabilities to the company 's WebKit renderer .
The Canvas functionality eventually became part of the HTML5 standard and has been implemented in both Gecko and Presto .
Canvas is used extensively in several popular web applications , including Google Maps , but it has n't gained widespread acceptance because it is n't available in Internet Explorer .
Taking advantage of ActiveX
In order to make Google Maps work in IE , Google had to develop ExCanvas — a complex library that implements many of the Canvas element 's features with VML , Microsoft 's proprietary alternative to SVG .
Unfortunately , scripted manipulation of VML is too slow to be used for highly interactive web applications .
Mozilla 's solution is to bake its own native Canvas implementation into an ActiveX plugin that can be integrated directly into Internet Explorer .
Mozilla 's Vladimir Vuki?evi ? has developed a working prototype which demonstrates the viability of the plugin approach .
His Internet Explorer component is built with Firefox code and implements much of the HTML5 Canvas specification .
There are still some missing pieces , however , including support for several drawing functions .
It 's still largely a work in progress , and development is still at a somewhat early stage .
Vuki?evi ? is confident that a lot of the holes can be filled without substantial effort , but his primary concern is with the challenges posed by deployment .
The plugin is designed to snap into IE as a binary rendering behavior , but the browser 's defensive security mechanisms insist on prompting the user before every time it is used .
This detracts from the seamlessness of the plugin and makes it difficult to use for conventional web applications .
" Currently , the experience is pretty crappy : you have to click through an infobar to allow installation of this component , then you have to click ' Yes ' to say that you really want to run the native content , and then you have to click ' Yes ' again to allow the component to interact with content on the page , " he wrote in a blog entry .
" In theory , with the right signatures , the right security class implementations , some eye of newt , and a pinch of garlic , it 's possible to get things down to a one - time install which would make the component available everywhere . "
This Canvas plugin is only the first step toward bringing standards - based web technologies to Internet Explorer .
Mozilla is working on a much more ambitious initiative called Screaming Monkey that will make it possible to plug Mozilla 's entire next - generation JavaScript engine directly into Microsoft 's web browser .
If these plugins gain widespread acceptance , it will empower web developers and give them the ability to target web standards and not have to compensate as much for Internet Explorer 's broken behavior .
Unfortunately , achieving a sufficient level of adoption for web compatibility plugins is easier said than done .
Firefox , Opera , and even Safari all deliver a vastly superior user experience than IE on Windows , and yet Microsoft 's browser still has massive market share .
If Mozilla can't convince diehard IE users to install Firefox , it seems unlikely that such users will be willing to install Internet Explorer plugins that provide Firefox features .
Getting Adobe on board
Getting this technology to end users will be a huge uphill battle , but there are some intriguing possibilities and a number of possible solutions .
Adobe is collaborating closely with Mozilla on next - generation web scripting technologies .
This is purely speculation , but If Adobe decided to ship Screaming Monkey and the Canvas functionality as part of the next major iteration of the Flash plugin , it would rapidly accelerate adoption and get it onto lots of computers .
Although Canvas arguably competes with Adobe 's Flash plugin in a certain set of use cases , it 's worth noting that Adobe does n't generate revenue from the Flash plugin itself .
Adobe cashes in on Flash by selling its powerful authoring tools , which the company could easily extend to support standards - based web technologies .
Adobe is clearly inching toward openness with its recent Open Screen initiative and its contribution of source code to the Tamarin project .
If Adobe were to fully embrace open web standards , Microsoft 's stranglehold on web innovation could finally be broken and Adobe would also have more competitive leverage against Silverlight .
This is ultimately going to be a protracted conflict , but the recent emergence of consensus within the ECMAScript community about the future of JavaScript has ended a long - standing impasse and created the opportunity for real progress in open web technology .
This means that getting these features into every browser is now more important than ever before .
Mozilla 's plugin experiments offer a clear path for circumventing IE 's shortcomings and bringing innovation to end users .

In bailout , Bush will allow oil company tax he opposes
In signing bailout bill , Bush will allow oil company tax he opposes
WASHINGTON — President Bush has long opposed singling out oil and gas companies for higher taxes .
But today he signed a bill that will do just that .
The massive financial bailout package approved by the House today — supported by the administration and now heading for the president 's desk — blocks oil and gas companies from enjoying nearly $ 5 billion in anticipated tax cuts , while raising nearly $ 4 billion more in new taxes to help fund tax breaks for renewable energy .
The legislation freezes the tax deduction oil and gas companies receive for their domestic manufacturing operations at 6 percent , while other American manufacturers will see that deduction rise to 9 percent in 2010 .
That provision will raise $ 4.9 billion over 10 years .
The legislation would raise another $ 2.2 billion by tightening the rules applying to oil and gas companies ' taxes on income earned overseas .
And the bill would raise $ 1.7 billion by increasing what producers must pay to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund from 5 cents per barrel to 8 cents per barrel starting in 2009 and then 9 cents a barrel in 2017 .
Oil industry leaders were opposed to those provisions .

Testimonials
Your seminar presented incredibly important information and all of the participants walked away with a deeper understanding of cyberbullying , ways to help prevent it , and ways to address and respond to it with students .
All of the evaluations were very positive and said the information you presented was meaningful and worthwhile to know .
The teachers will use the resources you provided them .
Your outreach to help in cyberbullying situations that might arise went above and beyond , and we truly feel grateful to know that we have an advocate in the community .

I value instructional time so I allow very few assemblies or guest speakers .
Sameer was recommended to us and after doing our research we felt he could fill in a gap for us .
We are constantly telling our students about cyberbullying , social media , and the implications for years to come .
Students just turn us off the minute we begin to speak about their cell phones , just like they turn off their parents .
Sameer was able to bring a level of awareness to the students by actually allowing them to anonymously answer questions using their cell phones during the assembly .
This real - time data allowed them to see the attitudes and behaviors of the entire student body - not national data or state data - which brought it home to them .
I received lots of comments from the students about the impact this presentation made on them .
Thank you Sameer !
Dr. Mary Rouse , Principal , Tennessee High School
Thank you so much for the time you spent with the students at our school .
Several parents and the Principal of our school , Ms. Rogers , told me stories of how you impacted our kids .
One 8th grade girl who rarely says anything about her day at school , jumped in the car and said “ Mom , we had the most amazing speaker today ! ”
Another 8th grader had the bad idea to talk meanly about a 7th grader that night on Facebook and the 7th grader followed your advice to gather evidence and printed it out and brought it to the principal the next day .
Game over !
My son who had been arguing with me about me having access to get on his Facebook agreed to let me be his “ friend ” on that web site .
He also went into his account and took himself off several networks and changed his privacy settings to “ friends only ” as per your advice .
Your specific advice andwonderful demeanor touched so many of our children today .
We look forward to bringing you back to our school again and again .
Your advice is invaluable to children of all ages .

Dr. Hinduja ’s workshop on cyberbullying was one of the highlights of our first - ever Answers Summit .
Numerous contributors mentioned to me that they found the presentation insightful and appreciated hearing from one of the foremost experts in the field .
If we knew that our contributors would have so many questions for Dr. Hinduja we would have increased the time allotted for his workshop .
Not only did Dr. Hinduja educate our community about the issue of cyberbullying but he provided pertinent real - life examples of the practice and offered suggestions for combating the problem .
I would recommend him to any online community which would like to stop this destructive behavior .

Sameer Hinduja ’s presentations were a resounding success at CCDS ; they were worth every dollar we spent to bring him to our school .
In an intense morning , Sameer gave three distinct and powerful presentations .
While the subject was the same , Dr. Hinduja skillfully tailored his presentation for each session – parents , high school students , and middle schoolers – in a way that was engaging and informative .
Students loved the real time polling and real life examples .
Conversations carried on for days after Dr. Hinduja left campus .
The Cyberbullying Research Center and Dr. Hinduja are terrific resources for anyone who works with adolescent students and their parents .
Stephanie Luebbers , Head of Upper School , Cincinnati Country Day School
The handouts , Q&As , and use of the big interactive screen were very helpful .
These guys were to the point , did not waste our time with fillers , and left us with enough curiosity to go home and search out these sites to become familiar with them .
We NEED to stay in step with our teens and adolescents as they mature into young adults .
Janelle Taylor , Social Worker , Tift County
Thank you Sameer for the very informative and engaging presentation on cyberbullying and practicing positive online behaviour .
After an hour of speaking , Sameer still had full attention from just over 900 high school students .
His presentation provided not only real life examples of online behavior and bullying , but also included Sameer 's own personal experiences , which the students could very much relate to .
One of many responses from the students included the following , " I want to be a speaker when I 'm older and encourage kids to not cyberbully just like Sameer . "
Lyndsey Pankratz , Project Manager of " I Am Stronger " , SaskTel , Regina , SK , Canada
I have heard a lot of good things from the staff and students about your presentations , Dr. Patchin .
We thoroughly enjoyed having you here with us and so greatly appreciated your message - and your wonderful speaking style .
You did such a great job engaging our students .
That is not easy with high school students !
Educator , Beloit , WI
Dr. Hinduja ’s presentation on cyberbullying was fantastic .
I have been looking for more concrete and statistical information on this subject so that I can take the information to the parents of our local schools .
Sameer provided that and more .
As soon as I left the presentation I ordered his book he wrote with his colleague , Dr. Patchin , Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard .
Thanks again for your wonderful research .
Jennifer Hultberg , Community Educator , Crime Victim Center of Erie County , Inc .
I truly enjoyed your talk in Atlantic City , Dr. Hinduja , and I was thinking of you yesterday .
A group of middle school students had created a skit about exclusion , and the counselor made it available for all of the classes to view before their classroom meetings .
One of the sixth graders , who has Cerebral Palsy , volunteered to act as the victim for the skit .
The students could see the skit multiple times , and analyze the behavior of the bystanders .
It was a roaring success .
Next week , the students will be presenting a video about the difference between tattling and telling .
I also have placed my Cyberbullying Trustee sign prominently on my office door , as well as on the podium of the school library .
I have had a surprising number of adults approach me about internet security and social networking since the conference .
I gave a lesson to the sixth grade about online publishing using the materials on your website .
Even though that particular class has approached me often with defiance , they did seem to appreciate the information , dropping their attitudes and asking thoughtful questions .
Thank you for all of your efforts to provide information about cyberbullying .
You are a true hero .

Thank you for a very informative , insightful presentation .
I plan on taking this information and helping to make our school district a more cyber - friendly place .
School Counselor , Duluth , Minnesota
While at the National Girl Bullying Conference I attended the “ Cyberbullying Among Adolescent Girls ” general session .
Dr. Hinduja ’s was very humorous , laid - back but yet very informative .
I appreciated his speaking approach because it kept me alert and I was not bored with statistics .
He is very knowledgeable and passionate about his work .
It instantly inspired me to learn as much as I can on the topic , which is why , I immediately changed my schedule to be sure I attended his “ Safe Social Networking and Adolescent Girls : Best and Worst Practices ” session .
Although I was aware of cyberbullying I was taken aback by the statistics of the common practice it has become , age of victims and aggressors , but most of all the intensity of the abuse .
I appreciate the generosity of allowing us to access his free resources ; it is a great help in implementing education and change amongst our youth .
I walked out of the sessions with a new way of looking at combating the problem : technology is not the enemy but has to be our ally .
I look forward to going back and building our blogs and chat rooms for our groups !
Elvia Pace , Mi Carrera Coordinator , YWCA San Antonio
He really got me thinking and brainstorming !
The world is a better place with Sameer in it .
Our youth are lucky to have him as an advocate for positive change .
Conference attendee , Kansas National Guard
Dr. Hinduja was a captivating speaker .
His passion for keeping all of us safe online , but especially for protecting young children , is contagious .
The teachers and administrators loved Dr. Hinduja ’s key note address .
Many teachers left the conference telling me that this was the best professional development they had been to !
Three days later the school district was still a buzz about the conference and our wonderful lineup of speakers , but especially Dr. Hinduja .
Philene Harte - Weiner , Associate Director , Education , Anti-Defamation League , Miami , FL .
This past Tuesday I had the privilege of attending a Cyberbullying Summit where Dr. Sameer Hinduja was the guest speaker .
Even as an adult , I was a little apprehensive about sitting at a designated table , staring at unfamiliar faces , wondering how this would all go down , and could only imagine how the teens were feeling .
Nonetheless , Dr. Hinduja quickly captivated our attention by asking us to take out our cell phones and respond to his posted question .
Immediately I knew I would like this guy because the first thing he did was remind us that technology is here to stay and will only become more a part of our daily routine , in class or not .
It ’s not something we should be afraid of .
We live in a time where we should embrace the technology and make sure others know how to use it safely and in a positive way .
Not only did I enjoy the manner in which Dr. Hinduja delivered his ideas , but what he chose to speak about was relevant .
Without a doubt , I ’m sure attendees left the meeting with hearts full , wanting to make a difference , and taking with them the resources to do just that .
Thank you Dr. Hinduja , for taking the time to share and make a difference .

Sameer recently spoke to our conference attendees in Australia .
The audience was comprised of over 400 very experienced education and bullying professionals .
His thoughtful insights into strategies and evidence to build inclusion , spread kindness and reduce bullying were insightful , genuine and compelling .
Sameer brought his years of research , his wisdom , humility and heart to the session and we left as better , more informed people .
Lesley Podesta , Chief Executive Officer , Alannah & Madeline Foundation , South Melbourne , Victoria , Australia
Dr. Patchin , wow , what a tremendous presentation !!!!
Such energy and passion you have for protecting children .
The remarks and evaluations for your class were through the roof .
I can definitely see us asking you to come back and present again .
Les Kerr , Unit Chief , Law Enforcement Relations Unit , United States Attorney ’s Office , Western District of Missouri
As an organization that works specifically with middle school students in an anti-violence program , we have become increasingly concerned about how social media is influencing youth violence , specifically cyberbullying .
I have been following Dr. Sameer Hinduja and his groundbreaking research on this topic for several years now .
We were fortunate to be able to have Dr. Hinduja speak to our Chairs at a recent meeting .
Our Chairs come from across the nation and all are in various professions of influence over young people .
Dr. Hinduja was a wealth of information and he presented it in such a way that all were interested in extending his allotted time to speak .
He was knowledgeable , personable , and cared deeply about the subject of social media ’s influence for good and bad on our youth .
He is an expert who is accessible for follow - up as we continue to come up against methods of violence against young people that we have never dealt with prior to a decade or so ago .
Lisa Cone , Program Director , National Campaign to Stop Violence
This was the most useful workshop I have attended in 13 years as an educator .
The information about cyberbullying was current , relevant and engaging .
Dr. Hinduja ’s delivery style is easily engaging and authoritative about this subject matter .
The workshop inspired me to create a workshop for my staff and students about this important and unfortunately very real topic .
Kim Hemingway , Flagstaff High School Counselor , Flagstaff , Arizona
My endorsement for having Sameer Hinduja come and speak with your organization is one grounded in having an audience of teachers , social workers , principals , LPC's , etc. completely riveted to him & his presentation !
He was kind enough to come to our Teen Suicide Prevention Symposium in February of this year .
The event sponsored by the Junior League of Waco , McLennan Community College and the Educational Service Center of Region 12 in Waco , TX had positive feedback both in what they learned about Cyberbullying as well as , how to reach out to parents , teens and fellow co-workers .
I myself , have decided to share the community tips , parent and teen tips with those within our community services department to aid in their work with our residents .
Milet Hopping , Sr. , Teen Suicide Prevention Symposium , Junior League of Waco , TX
I found your presentation insightful , informative , and eye opening .
I recommend anyone who can attend this workshop should attend .
You will not regret attending this session .
Deborah Washington , Family Liaison at Aurora West Academy with Aurora Public Schools , Aurora , CO
Sameer speaks with passion and purpose as he brings to light the realities and dangers of cyberbullying among our children today .
He articulates the urgency of reaching the bullied with the truth that they are loved and valued , while also wisely discerning the need to gracefully shepherd the bully into moral living .
He equips his listeners with valuable tools , strategies , and practical resources to better identify and understand the social context of cyberbullying and to protect the children in our lives .
Corrie Freeman , Volunteer Church Youth Leader
At a time when technology has become the lifeline for our kids , Dr. Hinduja ’s eye- opening , educational presentation on cyber bullying , social networking , and online safety is critical for teachers , parents , counselors , and anyone who deals with children .
Wanda W. Finnie , Esq. , Special Projects Administrator , Miami - Dade County Juvenile Services Department .
I recently attended a Cyberbullying Prevention presentation by Sameer Hinduja .
I found the presentation to be highly informative and engaging .
Sameer presented information on the various ways students are using technology to bully / harass one another and the dangerous and lasting impacts this can have on children .
His presentation style is engaging and I would highly recommend him as a presenter for adults but also for middle school and high school students .
His message to teens is powerful and one that needs to be heard by as many teens as possible .
Karen Breslawski , LMSW , Student Assistance Program Coordinator , Brockport Central School District , Brockport , NY
Sameer Hinduja came to speak at our Annual Victim Services Conference in Wyoming and highlighted many interesting and relative topics .
The information presented was interesting , useful , and Sameer presented in a way to make sure we not only learned information but enjoyed the presentation with laughs as well .
Many people enjoyed his presentations very much and have asked him back for future presentations .
Randi Losalu , Victim Services Coordinator , Cheyenne , WY
Sameer ’s presentations to students , faculty , and parents were all well - received .
Students felt they could relate well to Dr. Hinduja .
He understood the significance of technology in their lives and was respectful of them .
He was funny and charismatic and connected with the kids appropriately .
Sameer was able to deliver his message in a way that was accessible to all .
One student compared the presentation to a similar one at her previous school and said that Sameer ’s was so much better because he understands and relates to adolescents so well .
Probably the greatest testimonial to the effectiveness of his message is that students and faculty related that they checked and changed their Facebook settings and culled their friends list as a result of the assembly .
Parents were very thankful to receive information in a way that could open up communication channels with their children .
Sameer does not use scare tactics but simply presents the challenges and opportunities of social networking in an authentic and accessible way .
David Rost , Dean of Students , Concord Academy
Listening to Dr. Hinduja speak was both engaging and informative .
The topics that he addressed are highly relevant .
As a high school teacher , I see the significant impact that technology has on the lives of our students .
What I learned from Dr. Hinduja has provided me with a basis of information to use as I begin to work with other staff at my school to develop and implement programs to teach our students how to use technology ethically and act as responsible cyber-citizens .
Shawna Sache , Teacher , Rick Hansen Secondary School , Abbotsford , B.C .
I enjoyed your presentation a great deal .
I ’m glad I attended .
I mostly like how you approach the topic without blaming anyone rather encouraging responsibility , kindness and sensibility from all parts .
I love that stressed crucial aspects of the issue like creating awareness about the fact that it ’s a small number of children / people who do this and also that the enemy might not necessarily be an outsider , stranger but a friend or a peer .
I appreciate the websites and information , data you provided and also the simple , “ common sense ” , tips for us parents .
Often times the little things are the ones that make the difference .
I love your perspective in general , I have not heard anyone talking about involving the bullies in the solution rather than blaming or punishing them .
It was awesome to see involved in activities that helped raised their consciousness about the harm they were / could be causing .
My son , a 9th grader , was also very impressed with your presentation .
He was actually very happy about the way the topic was discussed .
He also appreciated that the topic was discussed from a legal , social , educational … point of view rather than just punitive .
Eugenia Almonte , Carol Morgan School , Dominican Republic
Dr. Hinduja 's presentations to our school were very well received .
Our middle school students were captivated and upper school students and parents specifically appreciated his concrete , actionable suggestions .
Dr. Hinduja shared follow - up materials that we are using to continue the conversation .
He was lovely to work with .
Heidi Butz , School Counselor , Greenhills School
Sameer … Thank you …such a pleasure to meet you and have you participate in the evolution of our youth .
As I reflect on the day ’s events , I am reminded of the words of one of my teachers , Miriam Dior .
Her work is guided by the simple principle of “ spirit , take me to where I am needed . ”
I believe that your work is about this in the purest sense .
I am inspired by your compassion , passion , conviction , and authenticity embodied in your work and being .
I appreciate your seeming fearlessness about the subject matter regardless of your audience .
Our work ( U32′s ) is to evolve from this day of information and move forward in a meaningful way .
I hope that we can continue this journey with the same optimism that you emulate .
Our work , in my being , is always for the current and future generations .
Ellen Cooke , School Counselor , U32 Schools , Montpelier , VT
I felt Dr. Sameer Hinduja was a great speaker .
He not only knew and understood the cyber / crime world , but he understood children and that was great !
I did walk away from this workshop with ideas to bring back to my school / campus , and I am working on putting some of the ideas in place at my school .
Amy Immekus , Sullivan High School , Sullivan , MO
This training was very helpful .
I really enjoyed learning about the legal aspect of cyberbullying as well as learning about the social networking sites students are using currently .
The statistics discussed really helped shed light on where we as a nation stand with regards to the prevalence of cyberbullying in our student population .
I also liked seeing the videos about how kids are responding to cyberbullying and bullying within their schools .
The positive use of social media to combat bullying seems to be most effective when utilized by peers so this really helps us as a school to plan our anti-bullying campaigns around student involvement .
All the interventions discussed help guide our responses to cyberbullying and the way we will educate our students on it .
We also loved hearing about the #startswithus campaign the students at the end of the training touched on .
We have started utilizing this campaign within our own building with teachers modeling the pinning of clothespins first and then passing them down to the student body .
Sharon Blue , Guidance Counselor , Central Middle School
It is an honor and privilege to recommend Dr. Hinduja as a guest speaker for your school assembly on digital safety and cyberbullying .
He wowed all of our audiences ( parent , elementary , middle and upper school ) with his knowledge , professionalism , expertise and incredible ability to captivate .
It is unusual to find a speaker who can deeply connect and engage with students of all ages and Dr. Hinduja did this seamlessly .
Many of our parents commented how they were worried to come to a presentation that would scare them but that they left his presentation feeling inspired and empowered .
Our students , always our toughest critics , also had only positive feedback to share .
Dr. Hinduja is truly the consummate professional : warm , approachable , engaging , and a bonafide expert in his field .
If you are looking for someone to speak to about digital safety and cyberbullying , you need not look any further .
Susie London , Psy.D. , NCSP , Middle and High School Psychologist , RASG Hebrew Academy , Miami Beach , FL
Though he tailored his presentations to match the developmental needs of his audiences , Dr. Hinduja 's message was the same across the board : social media and technology present many wonderful benefits , but to be smart consumers and creators of digital content , we must take proactive steps to forge a positive reputation for building others up and bettering one ’s community .
His message resonated with our students and earned the resounding approval of the adults in attendance .
Sam Straub , Upper School Counselor and Mary Foard , Middle School Counselor , Severn School , Severn , VA
Recently I was privileged to attend a seminar on cyberbullying presented by Sameer Hinduja , Ph.D .
It was two hours extremely well - spent .
Dr. Hinduja is an engaging speaker and an expert on this topic .
I found myself completely entranced and will be much more alert to this pervasive kind of bullying .
I would highly recommend this seminar to students , parents and educators .
Karyn Tercy , Counselor , Cathedral Catholic Academy , Honolulu , HI
Dr. Hinduja ’s session was such an eye opener for me because it made me realize that school attendance is not just a simple problem .
There are so many complex aspects of why children do not come to school daily .
The session on cyberbullying put school attendance at a much deeper level for me .
Based on what I learned my colleagues and I are in the process of preparing forums for students , parents , and school staff on the topic of cyberbullying .
This is an important topic that all need to be aware of .
We do n’t want any more innocent youth hurting themselves or taking their lives because of this .
Thanks Dr. Hinduja you are truly a genius in this area and I ’m sure your research has helped a lot of kids and will continue to help them in the future .
Dr. Tanya Williams , Coordinator of Attendance and Truancy , Baltimore City Public Schools
Dr. Hinduja ’s presentation on cyberbullying did a great job of outlining issues caused by new technologies .
School professionals need to be aware of the problems so that they can be addressed in an appropriate way .
Dr. Hinduja had great suggestions for both prevention of problems and steps to take when problems occur .
Greg Galtere , Principal , Boyertown Junior High West , Boyertown , PA
The presenters were excellent and make a great team .
School Counselor , Lenox , GA
What an enriching experience you provided our Pyle community during your recent visit here .
I really appreciate how you open yourself up to everyone in each audience you are with and break down information with a candidness , realness , and undeniable coolness .
You really rock and are making a difference in this world !
Rebecca Bloom , M.A. , LGPC , NCC , NCSC , Counselor and Program Specialist , Thomas W. Pyle Middle School , Bethesda , MD
As a Head of Middle School , I felt it was critical to address the issues of bullying and social media with our community .
I came across Dr. Hinduja ’s work and emailed him to get feedback on some of my ideas .
He responded in less than 24 hours and gave me his cell phone number .
From that point forward , he has been incredibly responsive and available , not to mention professional and personable .
We had the pleasure of inviting Dr. Hinduja to campus last month .
He gave 3 distinct presentations : to parents , to faculty , and to students .
Each presentation was effective and engaging for the targeted audience .
His message of using social media for positive outcome was communicated as was the importance of adult involvement in the digital life of kids .
After each presentation , I received many compliments and our student body is already actively making plans to follow some of his suggestions .
I believe our awareness has increased and we , as a faculty , have tangible data to support our initiatives as well as concrete ideas on where to start and what path to take as we do our part to keep our youth safe .
Jennifer White , Head of Middle School , Emery / Weiner School , Houston , TX
Thank you for sharing your expertise and your research on Cyberbullying with the District Safety and Security Directors at the March Statewide Meeting .
Your presentation was most relevant to the audience of both law enforcement officers and educators .
As a matter of fact , it served as a catalyst to begin the necessary dialogue needed between all agencies so that we can address the most potentially dangerous behaviors that occur all to often in our schools and communities .
You communicated most eloquently and so effectively , the importance of being skillful with technology , so that we can responsibly understand and monitor the online environments of our youth .
We hope that you will accept our invitation to attend future meetings .
Our future forums will be designed so that we will share the unique best practices and lessons learned that relate to the Cyberviolence incidents we experience in our respected roles .
Kim Mazauskas , Bullying Prevention / Intervention Coordinator , School District of Palm Beach County , Florida
Cyberbullying is posing a dangerous threat to the youth of our nation , mostly because of the unknown nature of the beast .
Most of the adults working in the school system do not understand social networking sites , and other outlets that students are using for online bullying and harassment .
Dr. Hinduja ’s presentation provides the knowledge and preventive education that school staff and administrators need to tackle this problem , and try to get a grip on it , as it is already spinning wildly out of control .
Their website is a wonderful tool for school staff , parents and students to learn about online safety , both in the preventive and reactive stages of cyberbullying and online harassment .
Lori Devon Shapiro , Bullying Violence Prevention Program , Office of School Climate and Safety , School District of Philadelphia
As a professional that has to intervene , investigate , and provide guidance within situations that arise almost daily due to cyberbullying , I am always looking for ways to improve my work along with making the process more efficient .
By attending the Comprehensive Cyberbullying Prevention workshop and listening to Sameer share his insight on this ever growing concern within schools I was able to gain multiple useful tools , ideas and new legal perspectives within the subject matter .
Dr. Sameer Hinduja is an engaging professional that has something to offer to all individuals who work with youth .
Daniel Kosick , LMSW , School Social Worker , R.T.S. Middle School , Susquehanna Valley School District
Dr. Hinduja 's presentation immediately grabbed the attention of the students in the audience .
He does not preach about staying off of social media , but rather he asks students to stop and think about what they are posting online .
Students remained engaged and loved using their phones for flash polls throughout his presentation .
The content was relevant and current , including a news story from less than two weeks before he came to our school .
I am so glad he came to speak to our students .
Allie McDonald , School Counselor , Glenelg High School
The Meadowbrook School of Weston , Massachusetts is grateful and appreciative of the half day you spent with our children and faculty .
You offered three completely different yet equally effective workshops on cyberbullying and on - line safety ( among numerous topics ) .
The parents unanimously commented to me that your presentation was the best they had attended in this area .
Your talk with them was factual , informative , poignant , supportive and emotional .
Your presentations to our children in grades 3 , 4 and 5 and then again to grades 6 , 7 and 8 were equally informative but uniquely tailored to each age group .
Additionally , you were authentic in your presentation and very personable , witty and caring .
You captured their attention , ignited their interest and fostered instantaneous believability with all of them .
The level of questioning from them indicates the level of trust you earned with them .
At the end of three workshops you gave freely of your time in the faculty room so that you could be a resource to teachers seeking greater understanding and clarity .
Bringing you to Meadowbrook was a stroke of genius and already there is a clamoring for return engagements .
Thank you for your passion in this area , for educating our parents and teachers and for passionately striving to make our children safe .
I ca n’t wait to have you return to our campus .
Steve Hinds , Headmaster , Meadowbrook School , Weston , MA
Dr. Sameer Hinduja educated Williston students on Tuesday ( and a gathering of parents the evening before ) about the clear and present dangers of teenage use of social media .
An expert in his field , Dr. Hinduja ’s deceptively youthful appearancegained him quick credibility with our students — a hip college professor connects well with those in middle and upper school .
One aspect of his message was not especially new : Electronic postings last a lifetime even if “ taken down ” from original sites .
Yet the advice he gave students was newly framed for them .
Dr. Hinduja also focused as well on the world of cyberbullying , interspersing his lecture with YouTube videos made by teens who have suffered from the humiliating effects of campaigns waged against them .
Robert W. Hill , Head of Schools , Williston Northampton School , Easthampton , MA
I am a doctoral student writing my dissertation in the area of cyberbullying and was attracted to this seminar because Dr. Hinduja has written so many of the cutting - edge research papers on this topic .
His website is the leading site in this field for informative and helpful material for educators , parents , students , and policy makers .
His seminar was engaging , educational , and provided participants with a full “ tool box ” of materials to help understand and begin to address the issue of cyberbullying .
Jenny Walker , Department of Educational Psychology , Arizona State University
I attended a Cyberbullying Conference at the University of Penn on April 27 , 2010 .
Before arriving , my expectations were not that high as I anticipated hearing the same message that I have heard at other conferences on this issue , “ The Internet is dangerous , ” “ Protect your kids – limit their usage , ” “ Do n’t let them use Facebook . ”
However , within a few minutes of hearing Sameer speak , I was encouraged that the message he presented was going in a different direction .
He was not trying to “ taint ” the Internet or discourage it ’s use .
Rather , he promoted the importance of open dialog with our children and education on proper use .
He highlighted the need for adults to be “ safe havens ” where children feel they can go when a problem does arise on the Internet , without the fear that they , as the victim , would be punished by losing their access to technology .
He did n’t only talk about cyberbullying as being a problem , but he offered solutions .
Good , applicable guidelines that educators , parents and students alike could implement .
I appreciate the work he is doing in this field and his willingness to share many resources - for free – with others .
I left the conference with a renewed sense of hope in being able to offer valuable feedback and resources not only to the youth and families that I work with , but to my own family as well .
Elizabeth J. T. Valdez , M.Ed. , N.C.C. , L.P.C. , Student Assistance Program Consultant , Pennsylvania Counseling Services
Sameer 's presentation was excellent !
He tailored it to meet the needs of our varied audience members , which included parents , school staff , school administrators , and law enforcement officers .
Sameer is extremely knowledgeable about bullying / cyberbullying and he has excellent presentation skills .
In addition , he is very personable , organized , flexible and punctual .
The Chester County Intermediate Unit would absolutely call on him again should the need arise in the future - he 's awesome !
Tonia Farnum , Communications Manager , Chester County Intermediate Unit
I have been to so many conferences on the topic of " Bullying " .
So often they are riddled with data and legalities .
You , Dr. Hinduja , are the first speaker that truly pulled in the human element .
I applaud you for that .
Yes you gave the research , but you also gave us hope that a school climate could be achieved that would make it difficult for unfair treatment of others to exist .
My colleagues and I all agreed we would have stayed for hours more at the conference because you were that fantastic !
Thank you !
Rebecca Nahrebeski , Social Studies Teacher , Hamburg Central School District
When it comes to the subject of cyberbullying , Sameer is a “ rock star . ”
He not only knows this subject inside out , but is able to share his knowledge and relate to his audiences on an amazingly human level .
Our high school peer trainers not only walked away with the tools to address and counter cyberbullying ……. they walked away feeling as if they had made a friend .
A good one !
We are already planning on bringing Sameer back to Arizona .
Bill Straus , Arizona Regional Director , ADL
Your presentation was exceptional , the audience raved , and words of appreciation are continuing to pour in from the attendees .
Personally , I loved it !
You introduced and presented the new and up - to - date information on computer programs and social networking sites that attract young people .
You talked about the importance of influencing school climate and approaching it with a positive spin .
You stressed the importance of communicating to young people and shared some strategies in talking with children about on - line safety , social networking respect and general , common courtesy , like what takes place “ in the Hinduja household . ”
The sharing of your personal stories made it easy to relate and identify with you .
The presentation was interesting , interactive and jam - packed with bullying and cyberbullying prevention tips .
We thoroughly enjoyed texting back responses and the videos viewed to stress a point .
Your support and involvement throughout the process in putting this presentation together was generous and kind .
You promptly responded to all questions and concerns , assisted in rearranging chairs to help make the room more conducive to the presentation , and offered your professional assistance in the future if a concern arises .
Additionally , you read the audience very well , sensing best when to offer a break and when to move to the next topic .
Thank you for a top - notch , comprehensive and inspiring presentation that helped to educate and support kindergarten through high school parents , educators and community involved residents .
Lori Butera , School District 26 Family Advocate , Bayside & Queens , NY
We had a wonderful day , extremely informative ; each presentation was tailored for the audience .
The Lower School Presentation was very engaging ; there was great student participation .
Students connected with the presenter and with his use of a variety of user - friendly headings and subheadings prior to talking about the topic .
The parents walked away from their session with valuable information ; we could easily have had an additional hour or two for dialogue and the exchange of thoughts .
The Middle School was also full of energy .
The students were enthusiastic and participated in various questions ; they also left with an increased knowledge base .
The Upper School was great ; the majority of the students were captivated by Dr. Hinduja ’s knowledge , information and wit .
The flash polling was exceptional ; it was a very interactive touch for the students with insightful questions and answers .
The Faculty & Staff Session was also very productive ; he covered data , statistics , various categories of bullying , relational aggression , choices , decision - making , and connections to cyberspace as well as providing websites with a wealth of information for parents and faculty .
The entire day was an outstanding presentation , filled with high energy and a wealth of information !
Theo Stephenson , Director of Counseling , St. Andrew's School
Dr. Hinduja was amazing !
His expertise and delivery were exactly what we were looking for .
His keynote speech and breakout session got excellent reviews from the teachers , counselors , psychologists and parents that attended our summit .
The presentation was thought provoking as well as practical .
Dr. Hinduja also led a student leaders presentation for 150 students from private and public schools .
His examples , videos and experiences made a real difference .
A 12th grader approached me after the workshop and said : “ I will never look at this behavior the same way again . ”
She then went on to lead a student assembly for her whole school .
Maribel Gonzalez , Puerto Rico
Your presentation was the most informative presentation I ’ve heard on the behaviors today ’s students are subjected to .
Your objective , calm and thorough summary of the pervasive reach of cyberbullying in the lives of our children was instructive .
Teachers , school board members and parents who are not aware of the complexity of this topic would benefit from hearing your presentation .
Debbie Martin , Human Resources , Brooks School
Sameer Hinduja 's presentation on cyberbullying was relevant , fresh , and engaging .
In a large group he was not only able to be interactive , but gave useful information for educators to take back and use with staff , students and parents .
I left the training with an excitement about implementing new ideas on how to make this a reality in our district and could not wait to share what I learned with other educators !
Christine Baker , District Counselor , New York area
Dr. Sameer Hinduja ’s authenticity permeates throughout his presentation .
He uses networking , real - world situations , and extensive research to shape his content .
Without complaint , he tailored his presentation to fit our curriculum needs , and adjusted it according to our time requirements .
He came to our training overly prepared and extremely well - organized .
Dr. Hinduja has a vast knowledge and real passion for the topics of cyber - bullying and safe social networking , and that was very evident throughout the day .
He did n't need any fancy gadgets or tricks up his sleeve to get the audience mesmerized .
The flawless way he delivered the information was enough .
In fact , months later , I am still getting rave reviews about him .
Simply put - when he speaks , people listen .
His content is relevant and timely more today than ever .
Dr. Hinduja made a huge impact , and given the chance , every single person who attended our training agreed that they would return to listen to him speak again .
To highly recommend Dr. Hinduja would feel like an understatement .
Darcy L. Meyer , Lead Child and Youth Program Coordinator , Kansas National Guard
I found the presentation very informative .
I am not that far removed from the age of my students yet I was astonished by the number of websites that are being used for cyberbullying and negative social interactions .
I had never even heard of many of the sites that were discussed in the presentation !
The presentation was such an eye - opener and I was very grateful for the resources and materials that were provided to conference attendants .
The websites are so thorough and I will definitely use them to help my school with their anti-bullying policies and programming .
Laura Kleemook , Guidance Counselor , Moniteau Jr. Sr. High School
Dr Hinduja 's presentation is engaging and meaningful .
He combines detailed research and captivating videos with practical applications for schools .
After hearing him speak , I return armed with wonderful resources and an action plan for our district .
Thank you Dr Hinduja for doing all your hard work and for sharing .
Your work touches the lives of many !

The State of Maryland was fortunate to receive funding from the Anti-Defamation League to host a one - day workshop for educators on the prevention of cyber bullying .
The Maryland State Department of Education jointly hosted the training in one of our local school systems with representatives from all school systems in Maryland being invited .
Dr. Sameer Hinduja provided an enlightening and engaging keynote address .
He is extremely knowledgeable on the topic , engages his audience , and uses humor to deliver his message on this very serious topic .
Evaluations from the day rated his presentation highly .
I highly recommend him as a presenter .
Please do not hesitate to contact me at ( 410 ) 767-0311 if you would like more information .

Dr. Hinduja ’s cyberbullying and cyber safety presentation to the middle school youth in our county was right on target for this age group .
His stories and insight hit home with the youth as he speaks their language and knows how they think .
He gave clear examples of problems youth are encountering along with easy to use tips that youth can utilize to keep safe .
Additionally , his presentation to parents and educators was a real ‘ eye - opener . ’
His explanations and stories received high marks in our county as he helped get adults up - to - speed on the latest technology news in regards to teenage communication .
Becky Carlson , Assistant Director , Center for Prevention and Counseling , Newton , NJ
I just wanted to thank you for your important and timely presentation you gave today .
I have an 8th grader who just got a twitter account and a senior who will be off to college next year .
They both commented on what a great presentation it was and what a great speaker you are !
My senior heard you previously .
His comment about you is , " He 's sick ! "
Thanks again for your important work and research !
Parent , Eau Claire , Wisconsin
Your seminar on Cyberbullying was one of the best seminars that I have attended in several years .
The information was very pertinent to my middle school students and very up to date .
This made the seminar very relevant .
Also , that fact that you allowed us plenty of opportunities to ask questions and have discussions on the different topics you were talking about .
You treated us all like professionals , with respect .
Barbara Zarzycki , Mohave Valley Elementary School District
Very interesting workshop .
I learned so much about cyberbullying , especially about the laws as it relates to this issue .
Idefinitely have a better understanding of cyberbullying now .
Thanks !

In looking for a featured speaker for our annual conference , I immediately thought to contact the Cyberbullying Research Center as it has become my “ go to ” place for the latest research and practical information on cyberbullying .
Sameer Hinduja ’s presentation to our diverse audience of educators , law enforcement agents , and social service providers was informative , engaging , and extremely well - received .
Participants across the board rated the presentation as Excellent ” ( with some people putting several stars next to their ratings ) , praising Sameer as being knowledgeable , passionate , genuine , intelligent , and practical .
We loved the balance of research , analysis of relevant legal cases , text polling , videos , and practical solutions focusing on creating a positive school climate .
The only downside is that he is going to be a hard act to follow in our future events !

It was a pleasure working with and hearing Dr. Sameer Hinduja ’s presentation on cyberbullying .
Not only was his information relevant for the group of 13 - 18 year olds he presented to , his presentation style was very down - to - earth and non-threatening to our students .
With this approach , he was able to open a dialogue with them about the proper use social networking rather than patronizing them about it .
He also presented to many of our parents who walked away with useful tools to help protect their kids in the cyber world .
I highly recommend Dr. Hinduja for any event , his knowledge and demeanor are a perfect combination to be effective across all forums .
Krystal Watson , Orlando
I was highly impressed with your presentations on cyberbullying at the workshop in Virginia .
You are a tremendous expert on this topic and hope to stay in touch as we roll out our program for girls .
We are taking the approach of a “ girl - led ” advocacy program .
After hearing you speak , it started to become clear that this problem must be solved in part by including our young people in the solution .
In fact , we have to start with them .
Our vision is to help young women find their voice and show them how to use it effectively to make a difference on cyberbullying .
Jean Burke Young , Advocacy , Girl Scout Council of the Southern Appalachians
Dr. Hinduja did a thorough and comprehensive presentation of issues regarding social media .
This young , gifted professor is impressive and a research guru on the subject .
I appreciate that his work includes legal and professional responsibilities regarding these issues .
He reminded us to let students spear - head and become involved in solving their own issues .
The clothespin activity will be presented to our student council today to get the pinning started .
We will use our PIE ( Partners in Education Dept ) , principals , counselors and teachers to work together with our students .

I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Hinduja present at our Safe Schools Conference in the fall and I knew it would be an excellent opportunity for my students , staff and community .
I invited him to my school to share his expertise with our students during two different presentations and he was available for a teacher roundtable and a community meeting in the evening .
He shared real world experiences , data and made connections for the students and parents highlighting the importance of internet safety and etiquette .
His passion for cyber-safety and his ability to relate to students , teachers and parents made the presentation extremely valuable !

Our students and faculty have all responded very positively .
The kids were especially appreciative of the fact that you are not “ anti- technology ” but instead helped them to think about the positive and appropriate ways in which technology can and should be used .
Our faculty was also appreciative of your presentations , your straightforward approach , and the way in which you timed things within your presentation ( for example , the use of flash polling ) in order to maintain the attention of the your audience .

Dr. Hinduja presents information that is relevant to his audience in a way that educates without using fear tactics .
His statistics grab the attention of the audience and show situations of which all parents and educators need to aware .
Most important is that he suggests realistic techniques to help combat cyber bullying .
Dr. Rosemary Daniels , Head of The Weiss School
At this moment Sameer is one of the premier speakers on the issue of cyberbullying and sexting with adolescents and young adults .
He is personable and easily connects with young people .
His technophile perspective makes students feel that he is an advocate for their technological reality .
He helps parents bridge the gap to understanding their “ Internet Generation Child . ”
Sameer will provide deep understanding to the ever changing technological reality our children must navigate .

Dr. Hinduja ’s presentation was just what we needed .
He did an excellent job of connecting with our 650 middle schoolers ; he spoke their language and got the message across that quick electronic messages can have a lasting impact on others , as well as on one ’s own future .
His evening presentation with the parents was especially informative .
With visual aids and handouts , Dr. Hinduja did an outstanding job of covering the world of social networking sites and then responding to their questions and concerns .

Karl J. Schindler , Principal , Glenelg High School
I just wanted to thank you again for your excellent presentations to our students , teachers and parents .
Your information was so helpful .
Many students in the Middle School learned new information and had great discussions after they heard your presentation .
The Upper School students ’ feedback was complimentary – the 12th grade Lead Advisor told me that in some discussions students said that they “ cleaned up ” their Facebook pages after hearing you .
They also appreciated your tone with them – they said you talked to them as “ one of them ” and were not “ preachy . ”
Also , they felt open to receive your information because you knew what you were talking about .
Your presentation was one of the most well received , across all groups , of any that we have had at our school .
You receive my highest recommendation .
Thank you again .

I have recommended Dr. Patchin to schools this morning .
He related very well to all the different levels of his audiences .
He did a very good job engaging the audiences and keeping their attention .
He was very open and willing to answer all questions posed by the audiences .
His experiences and authentic stories were very engaging for the audiences .
IT Staff ,
Dr. Patchin ’s presentation and resources on the topic of cyberbullying are the best I ’ve seen on the topic .
His work ismuch more effective than the typical “ Internet safety ” program in that he focuses on cyberbullying , a common occurrence among students , instead of deflecting the discussion to blame technology or highlight the edge cases of sexual predators .
Dr. Patchin is right up there with danah boyd and Nancy Willard in his knowledge , experience , and passion with the topic of youth and technology .
He has a great presentation style with a ton of great information to share .
John Pederson , Educational Technology Liaison – WiscNet
Great information - hope to use this information to inform parents and incorporate some into our safety lessons for our 4th and 5th graders .
Staci Haire , Elementary Counselor , Lowndes County Board of Education
In today ’s world of bullying and victimization , our students must be taught the skills and strategies needed to survive and thrive .

Terri Anderson , Coordinator , Health Services and Wellness , Leon County Schools
Dr. Hinduja delivered a wonderful presentation that was very informative for the parents of our school community .

Dr. Hinduja spoke with passion and brought to light the reality of cyberbullying , and the dangers and advantages of technology .
We were very fortunate to have him present to our parents and look forward to his visit with the Middle School students later this year .

Dr. Patchin always does a great job interacting with the crowd .
It is obvious he is very knowledgeable in his field of study .

He provided exceptional information to a group that had a variety of needs without losing any of his audience .
By using a mixture of powerpoints , videos and group activities , he kept everyone engaged , on task and communicated a wealth of pertinent and timely information .
Jean Campbell , Coordinator , Safe & Drug - Free Schools , School District of Lee County
Dr. Sameer Hinduja is an eloquent and enthusiastic speaker .
His presentation on cyber bullying was very effective and well received by our employees as he addressed how parents and the community can work together to solve this issue .
Sound advice was shared along with an inspiring movie which set the tone for his presentation .
Annabelle Gallois - Bernos , Ph.D. , Johnson & Johnson Vision Care
Dr. Sameer Hinduja recently presented two workshops at our Bullying Prevention and Intervention Conference to an audience of almost 350 .
The attendees were school administrators , educators , and counselors , as well as community mental health representatives .
The presentations went above and beyond our expectations .
Dr. Hinduja is a highly skilled and extremely knowledgeable presenter that is able to actively engage his audience while sharing his expertise regarding teen technology use and misuse .
Dr. Hinduja designed and executed both presentations after communicating with our committee to ensure our expectations for content and methodology were met .
We highly recommend Dr. Hinduja and look forward to his continued support .
Colleen O'Brien , Program Coordinator and Conference Co-Chair , Retired School Administrator , Worchester , MA School District
Dr. Hinduja 's presentation was informing and enlightening .
His research and knowledge provided me with some immediate tools and resources to take back to my school .
The coolest part was the live text survey .
I 've got to learn how to do that at my next conference !
Carletta S. Hurt , public charter school educator , Washington , DC
My principal and I saw you a few years back .
Recently my daughter , a 7th grader , came home and spoke of your presentation .
First of all she does n’t share much about school so the fact she shared this was impressive .
Secondly , it sounded like your presentation was very concrete and realistic - “ I know you are going to do this so here ’s how you can and still be safe ” was the message that my daughter took away .
I shared this with our school ’s safe culture committee and they are interested in hearing how we can get a similar presentation at our school .
Mother of 7th grade girl in Wisconsin ,
I really enjoyed the conference with Dr. Hinduja .
There were several things I took away from the conference , but one being the most prominent is : Sharing the positive stories .
We have many positive stories at FHHS and I know that by sharing these , our climate will continue to improve and students will learn the “ Howell Way . ”
Some others include the variety of preventions ( such as Lock it down day , Delete day , Positive Referrals , Decoding your Digital Footprint , etc ) .
I also felt like some of the things we plan to do this year or have done in the past ( i.e. pledges , signage throughout the building ) were validated as effective prevention strategies and we ’ll keep doing those things .
Dr. Angie Kozlowski , Associate Principal , Francis Howell High School
Dr. Patchin came to our school and community and presented to our 3rd - 12th grade students , staff , and community members .
His knowledge is vast and he has a way to relate to all ages of students , staff , and parents in his knowledge of cyberbullying and beyond .
His examples were super and his stories were priceless and hit close to home to all involved .
Teacher ,
Dr. Sameer Hinduja was the perfect keynote speaker for Auburn University ’s 2016 International Anti-bullying Summit .
His sessions encompassed solid research , social media bullying intervention , school climate improvement strategies , and character building — all topics of tremendous interest to attendees that included educators , counselors , social workers , students , and law enforcement personnel .
He engaged the audience during the Keynote by conducting short on - the - spot surveys about bullying prevalence in the audience ‘s own environments .
He was highly knowledgeable as well as warm and accessible .
Thank you , Dr. Hinduja !
Linda Dean , Truman Pierce Institute , College of Education , Auburn University ,
Dr. Sameer Hinduja has pieced together a very informative and professional research study pertaining to cyber bullying , which should be perused by all teachers , administrators , and district supervisors throughout the world .
In his esteemed research he offers tremendous insight into and support for the lives of our youth of today .
Raising awareness of cyber bullying is a must !
Thanks to Dr. Hinduja ’s work , we move forward to teach the users of technology to use the internet more and more responsibly .
Michael Busekrus , Principal , St. John Vianney School , Kailua , HI
I was shocked at the statistics presented to us and was unaware how prevalent cyberbullying is today .
The conference was very informative and I feel I am much better prepared to face this issue in my classroom .
Maria Valencia , Northern Arizona University
I enjoyed your cyberbullying workshop in North Carolina today .
It was very well organized , clear , and reflected your obviously extensive knowledge of the subject .
You also responded to questions very sensitively , and I was particularly impressed with how respectfully you interacted with [ a sixteen - year - old in the audience ] .
As I told you at the end , of the hundreds of professional presentations I ’ve heard in my 37 year career , yours was clearly in the top 5 % .
I ’ve also ordered your book and look forward to learning more about this important subject .
C. Drew Edwards , PhD , ABPP , Clinical Child Psychologist and Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychology , Wake Forest University
My heartfelt thank you for sharing your wisdom , knowledge , and perspective with our students and parents last Thursday .
There was definitely a buzz Friday — I had immediate feedback from parents talking to their kids about their experiences and habits on social media .
It ’s no surprise many parents have never had these conversations .
It is easier to turn our heads and hope it will be fine — but as you said yourself , “ It ’s much harder to meaningfully and intentionally parent children in this digital age . ”
It takes work .
Your frank presentations opened some eyes and started conversations — which marks the evening as a success .
You truly have a gift in the way you deliver , and on behalf of CCDS I thank you !
Lori Smith , President , Cincinnati Country Day School
I found the workshop extremely interesting , scary , and informative .
The information was given in a concise and organized manner .
All information was timely in nature .
The consequences of improper use were totally shocking .
Our children and society must be taught to be aware of the dangers , and must learn to use the Internet responsibility .
Bullying in any form must be stopped .
We need an organized and consistent curriculum to help our children of today understand this very powerful tool they have at their disposal and parents must ensure its proper use .
Monitoring the internet at several different levels is critical .
The presentation was wonderful and professionally done .
Donna Eldredge , Assistant Principal , H. L. Johnson Elementary School
I really enjoyed this workshop .
Cyberbullying is a topic that needs some light shed on it .
I was excited to see something brought to our area .
Seeing the legal ramifications is eye - opening and it ’s all great information to pass on to the youth that we work with as well as our co-workers .
Kitzi Woodard , Case Manager , Frontier Health / Highlands Juvenile Detention Center
The workshop on Cyberbullying offered at NAU was informative and timely .
I work with 7th and 8th graders , and “ drama ” is a very big part of their lives .
You gave me tools that I will share with them so that they may be safe as they travel the cyber highway .
The format of the workshop was refreshing .
We were treated as professionals with respect and dignity , the opportunity to ask questions and share some experiences was very valuable .
Wilma Robillard - Hoffman , Middle School Teacher , Mohave Valley School District
Sameer expertly blends important advice for both youth and parents ( and caregivers ) , which is very helpful for multi-generation audiences .
His realistic approach reminds parents that technology is not evil , but rather a part of life that we need to learn to get along with .
What I loved most about his overall message is that resiliency and empathy play important roles in combating negative cyber behavior .
After listening to Sameer speak , audience members are provided with realistic solutions that can be easily incorporated into a family ’s everyday life .
I highly recommend Sameer as a speaker on these important topics of cyberbullying and sexting .
Carol Johnson , Community Education Manager , Eagle River Youth Coalition , Edwards , CO
Dr. Hinduja 's presentation on school climate and cyberbullying was enlightening and entertaining .
I came away with many concrete ways to prevent cyberbullying and building a positive climate in my high school .
Christine Stricker , Journalism and FACS Teacher , Clayton High School , Clayton , MO
As an international school in the Caribbean , we seem to be behind the curve in addressing social media and its benefits and perils .
Dr. Hinduja brought us up to speed , and also gave us tons of hard facts , ideas , and tools with which we will be able to help our kids safely navigate social media , both now and in the future .
Heather Caputo , PTA President , Learning Unlimited , Sint Maarten , Netherlands
I think the biggest thing we got out of the day was the focus on school climate .
My take away was that if you foster a school climate of acceptance , respect , and relationships , you set the stage for students to take care of each other .
You also insure that students feel comfortable reporting incidence of bullying and harassment , and are therefore able to address those issues quickly and efficiently .
We were already focusing this year on community building , but we 're paying special attention this November with a " Month of Thanks and Giving " .
We want to focus on all the wonderful things that our students do everyday and celebrate them .
We are also the single largest provider for Feed My People and have our annual drive during November .
We plan to culminate in a day of celebration before Thanksgiving break .
We 're pretty excited about it !
Thank you for bringing him in !
It was well worth the time .
Jennifer Gross , M.Ed. , Ed.S. , Freshman Counselor , Oakville High School
Your presentation was not only interesting , but it redirected the way I have been looking at the issue .
I ’m not the only one .
I have seen all sorts of emails going back and forth from people that are looking at this in a new light .
I have seen a flow of fresh ideas on how we should deal with these situations .
What you do makes a difference .
Thank you for that .
Myra Binnicker , Answers.com Quality Program Coordinator
Your message (s ) were powerful and right on target with so many issues .

Beki Perkins , Operator , SafeWay Driving Centers
I personally had the opportunity to observe Sameer Hinduja speak at the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 2010 .
His presentation was the most comprehensive and on target resource that I have found on the topic of cyber - bullying .
His doctrine is supported with a strong research base as well as a youthful perspective .
His philosophical approach on how to deal with cyber bullying makes sense .
He provides convincing evidence and insights that will ignite a paradigm shift on one ’s approach to addressing cyber - bullying .
Dr. Detrick McGriff , Haverford High School , Philadelphia , PA
You presented authentic information that directly related to our current generation of teens .
Your presentation highlighted honestly that , “ Technology is not part of their life … it is their life . ”
That is a simple , but profound , statement .
Listening to your keynote was informative and empowering .
Information was empirically vetted and practical strategies or positions were shared to enable principals to take action .
Mark Schultz , Principal , Pioneer High School
I could not more highly recommend Dr. Hinduja .

Not only was the information current and presented in a user friendly way - but Dr. Hinduja 's passion for educating everyone in the area of cyberbullying was phenomenal .
You walk away from the conference feeling that the information you have gained can certainly help make a difference in keeping our children and students safe .
Colleen Kaney , Director of Special Education Services at Hamburg Central School District
The presentation was so very helpful to us at Hamburg High School especially in light of the recent the New York State law changes ( DASA - Dignity for All students Act ) .
Dr. Hinduja 's interactive style kept me engaged throughout the entire conference .
I found myself running out of room to take notes on my legal pad because his wealth of knowledge is so extensive .
I would strongly recommend attending any conference with Dr. Hinduja .
It was truly one of the best conferences I 've ever attended out of my 12 years as a school social worker .
Tina LaMendola , Social Worker , Hamburg Central School District
Dr. Sameer Hinduja did an excellent job during recent presentations at the Indian Valley Local Schools in Ohio .
He spoke to all of our students in grades four through twelve as well as to administrators , counselors , computer teachers and other staff members .
In addition , he conducted an evening session with parents .
The positive feedback we received from all of these groups indicated that Dr. Hinduja opened a lot of eyes about the ever - growing problem of cyberbullying .
His statistics and case scenarios were on target for each audience .
Most importantly , he supplied every audience with specific strategies for keeping safe in cyberspace .
Our district plans to follow up on this issue by implementing many of the suggestions he covered , especially in the area of working closely with parents to stem the growing tide of cyberbullying incidents .
I would recommend Dr. Hinduja ’s presentation to all school districts across the country .
Janis Hunter , Curriculum Director , Indian Valley School District
Sameer Hinduja ’s presentation on cyber bullying was thorough , well delivered , articulate , informative , and helpful .
Despite the horrific content , what cyber bullying is and the tragic consequences there have been and could be if we do not act decisively and compassionately as educators and parents , Sameer presents with the eye on positive change and ultimate idealism .
He is clearly passionate about this topic and it is imperative that as many educators and parents as possible learn about this extremely disturbing aspect of technology in our world today .
Sameer is in a unique position as Co-Director of the Cyberbullying Research Center to be able to give us accurate and relevant information in a manner that is both compellingand supportive .
Amy Tai , Director of Community and Diversity , The Chestnut Hill School
What I love the most about Dr. Hinduja 's presentations is how he speaks with the students .
Like a master teacher , he makes it clear that the space is safe for all types of comments and questions .
He does n't blow by an answer .
Instead , he stops , looks directly at the student , and gives him / her complete validation .
Our students walked out of the theater feeling that they had been part of a discussion .
They love that he “ gets them , ” and for the faculty and families , his current research astounds us .
As a faculty , we look to continue having conversations about cyber bullying and online safety with the help of his resources .
Sarah Kemeness , Head of Upper School , Palm Beach Day Academy , Palm Beach , FL
This one of the most important conferences that I have attended .
Sameer presented the information that is current and understandable .
The presentation was extremely interesting and the information shared will help us put at better plan together for our district regarding bullying and cyberbullying .
Thank you for being so passionate about this topic .
Susan Moore , Technology Coordinator , Lewis Co. C - 1 School District
Thank you so much for the thoughtful and engaging conversation you lead with our students yesterday .
I heard from many parents that kids went home talking about the presentation last night .
I can't wait to hear what the teachers say as they regroup on this topic next week .
You truly made an impact and added another dimension to our Digital Citizenship program .
I appreciate the time you took with the kids to individually answer their questions and the respect you showed for their concerns .

I recently attended the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention conference , Understanding and Addressing Cyberbullying .
I was excited to hear the featured speaker , Dr. Sameer Hinduja share his insights and understanding of this timely and complex issue facing our youth .
As a school counselor with many years of experience working with young people , I believe this is one of the most challenging issues we face today .
As an anti-bullying trainer , I have utilized Dr. Hinduja ’s website to illustrate the current data trends in cyberbullying and to link my colleagues to the resources it provides .
To have an opportunity to listen to and learn from Dr. Hinduja , in person , was valuable and educational , as well as entertaining .
I would encourage educators at all levels to seize the opportunity for themselves .
James Traver , School Counselor , Gates Chili Middle School , Rochester , NY
Drs. Hinduja and Patchin are not only the most knowledgeable team in the field of cyberbullying right now , they are the most engaging and fun .
Their thorough discussion of the legal history of cyberbullying and free speech is fascinating , and is an essential building block of knowledge for educators and policymakers .
Furthermore – at a time when keeping our kids safe while socializing online is more important than ever before – they share and detail practical strategies and solutions that school districts can and should implement today .

Robyn Wolfe , Secondary School Principal , Lake Mary Preparatory School , Lake Mary , FL
Sameer 's presentation at our District Administrator 's EdSummit entitled " Positive School Culture : Establishing Trust , Grit , and Empathy to Decrease Bullying " was exceptional .
He made a connection between social and emotional factors and bullying and the steps educators can take to improve school climate and encourage positive relationships that prevent bullying .
His message clearly aligned to Collier County Public Schools ' 5 Social Emotional Learning ( SEL ) Priorities .
Karen Stelmacki , Executive Director , Exceptional Education & Student Support Services , Collier County Public Schools

We have only five copies of your book left ( out of one hundred ) .... that speaks for itself .
We are donating them to the UWSP education dept . for aspiring teachers .
Here 's a story you will love .
On Saturday evening of our convention , there was an athletic banquet taking place in the adjoining rooms .
One of the parents saw your book on our registration table and came over to ask about it and said her daughter is a victim .
She bought a book and got all the info on you and the reasearch you 've done .
Now , that 's what I call " making a difference . "
Again , Dr. Patchin .... thank you from all of us .
You were great .
It was such a pleasure to meet you and work with you on this project .

The cyberbullying legislation is overwhelming and can be confusing .
Dr. Hinduja not only shared the facts , but great perspective that was empathetic to school districts and the community agencies working with them .
He understands the real life situations , has done his research and is able to articulate that with a supportive message .
At the same time , his orientation toward youth development and youth centered ideology is critical to what needs to be done .
He believes in young people and the adults that care about them .

We were fortunate in Nassau County , Florida to bring Dr. Hinduja to our middle schools as part of a Learn ‘n Serve grant .
After meeting with students in classrooms , club meetings and assemblies , Dr. Hinduja was able to bring our county ’s dialogue about cyberbullying to a different level .
He was flexible about the setting he spoke in , the size of the audience he spoke to , the time he was allowed to present in , and the busy schedule required of him .
Administrators appreciated having a copy of his book as a resource , students appreciated his real world cyber experiences , and I appreciated his passion for and expertise of his subject .
Keep up the good work , Dr. Hinduja !
Your message is going to continue to be relevant for youth , teachers and administrators for years to come .
Kim Clemons , Project Manager , Office of Intervention and Prevention , Nassau County School District
I appreciate you taking the time to present to us at the Safe School Institute .
The information you brought was extremely eye opening .
I have known about cyberbullying ; however , I did not realize the extent to which this is happening .
As an administrator it is important to understand what is going on with our students .
You gave me a better understanding so that I am better prepared as this new year begins .
Sherri Graham , Assistant Principal , Loggers ’ Run Middle School
Thank you for sharing valuable information about the relationship between cyberbullying and teens .
Working in a middle school , our students are constantly faced with issues connected to Twitter and Facebook posts .
As student support staff , we are working hard to help our students manage cyberbullying and assist them in stopping the cycle of bullying .
Our school is planning a ‘ No Namecalling Week ’ and we will incorporate some of your resources to support our efforts to stop cyberbullying in our community .

I had the pleasure of meeting and working with Dr. Sameer Hinduja as part of a Fulbright scholarship award in Ireland .
We worked together on improving a Digital Safety programme that I am involved in coordinating and I have to say his feedback was and is invaluable .
The research he conducts gives us a true insight into the reality that the youth of today face in terms of social threats .
He has such a measured approach towards the topic of Cyberbullying which in this current climate is essential .
Too many times we overreact to situations around potential threats .
Sameer , however , has the measured and balanced approach to step back and assess the scenario via thoughtful and analytical methods .
This results in a measured and calm response with useful help for those involved rather than introducing an emotionally charged response which clouds judgement .
I believe we can all learn from him .
Irene Guedan , Digital Safety Program Coordinator , McAfee Ireland ( Intel Security )
Your seminar presented incredibly important information and all of the participants walked away with a deeper understanding of cyberbullying , ways to help prevent it , and ways to address and respond to it with students .
All of the evaluations were very positive and said the information you presented was meaningful and worthwhile to know .
The teachers will use the resources you provided them .
Your outreach to help in cyberbullying situations that might arise went above and beyond , and we truly feel grateful to know that we have an advocate in the community .

Tying this all to the assailant ’s fury over a McCain sticker transformed Todd into a heroine for the right against the forces of darkness led by that uppity darkie , Senator Obama , the " B " cut into her face standing , obviously , for " Barack . "
And despite what many people saw as grotesque inconsistencies in Todd ’s story – like the fact that none of this attack was caught by the ATM ’s video camera – the race - baiters ran with the story , and comment threads at various blogs generated the kind of vile remarks you ’d expect from aryannation.com .
See , America , elect a black man for president and your white daughters will be legitimate targets for black men everywhere .
This antebellum viewpoint , covert and coded though it be in the 21st Century , remains as putrescent as it was 40 and 140 years ago .
Foxaganda ’s Executive Vice President Joe Moody wrote a commentary that was itself a prime study in how to race - bait while denying it :
It had to happen .
Less than two weeks before we vote for a new president , a white woman says a black man attacked her , then scarred her face , and says there was a political motive for it .
Ashley Todd , a 20 - year - old white volunteer for John McCain ’s presidential campaign , says she was mugged at an ATM machine in Pittsburgh ( my hometown ) by a big black man .
She further says he threw her down , then disfigured her by carving the letter " B " into her face with a sharp implement when he saw that she supported McCain , not Barack Obama .
Part of the appeal of , and the unspoken tension behind , Senator Obama ’s campaign is his transformational status as the first African - American to win a major party ’s presidential nomination .
That does not mean that he has erased the mutual distrust between black and white Americans , and this incident could become a watershed event in the 11 days before the election .
If Ms. Todd ’s allegations are proven accurate , some voters may revisit their support for Senator Obama , not because they are racists ( with due respect to Rep. John Murtha ) , but because they suddenly feel they do not know enough about the Democratic nominee .
Revisit their support for Obama not because they are racists ?
Why then ?
What exactly is it , Joe , that connects a blackety - black man who attacks a white female McCain volunteer with support or lack of it for the Senator ?
It would be encouraging if I could call Foxaganda mere dupes and sloppy journalists for not vetting Todd ’s story in the first place .
Just an honest mistake in the flurry of day - to - day reporting and commentary .
But they do n’t deserve to be let off the hook with the incompetence defense .
They , Joe Moody included , knew goddamn well what they were doing .
Trying against the odds to squeeze out a few more fear votes for John McCain .
Using race as the tool .
Behaving like a lynch mob , in other words .
The mugger and face carver turned out to be invented .
Just as many of us said would turn out to be the case two minutes after we heard the story and saw Ashley 's photograph .
But the racism of those who exploited that story is no invention .
Once again we 're shown that whatever strides have been made in the past 40 years , the matter of race is far from being transcended in America .
Some people will say the exploitation of Ashley Todd 's bogus story was not really racist .
Just as they say that politicians when they try to spur voter fears about the " otherness " or " unAmericanness " of Senator Obama or other non-white candidates for office are n't really racist , not personally racist .
It 's just campaigning .
And campaigns are n't beanbag .
That 's puerile nonsense .
True , candidates like John McCain ( and media execs like Joe Moody and bloggers like Drudge ) may not personally believe that African Americans or other non-whites are inferior .
They probably do n't .
But trying to keep people of color " in their place " is , in fact , the very definition of racism .
Two Debates Down , Two Wins for Obama George Stephanopoulos grades McCain and Obama 's second presidential debate .
Oct. 8 , 2008  -- Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama squared off in their second town hall - style presidential debate taking questions from voters at Belmont University in Nashville , Tenn. , Tuesday night .
It was Obama who once again edged out McCain in the debate , sticking to his strategy of portraying himself ready to serve as president .
Report Card : Winner : Obama
Strategy : Obama ( A ) McCain ( B+ )
McCain started out strong by pledging to require the federal government to buy up all of the nation 's bad mortgages .
He showed real compassion and empathy as he sought to shore up his credentials on the economic crisis .
" It is my proposal , " McCain said .
" It 's not Sen . Obama 's proposal .
It 's not President Bush 's proposal . "
With polls showing more that Americans believe Obama is better able to handle the economic crisis , it was a smart move McCain had to make .
The McCain campaign quickly circulated McCain 's mortgage plan , which the campaign estimates would cost taxpayers $ 300 billion .
McCain 's plan seems to be based off a proposal that President Bush 's former economic adviser Glenn Hubbard wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week , and the Obama campaign says that the rescue plan that passed Congress last week already gives the Treasury secretary this authority even if lawmakers did n't put a price tag on it .
But as the debate went on , we began to see the substantial differences between the two candidates on taxes , on health care and on foreign policy .
Obama began to make real progress rebutting the false charge that he 's going to increase taxes on all Americans , arguing that health care is a fundamental right and questioning McCain 's judgment in voting for the war against Iraq .
Striking an emotional chord , Obama connected his health - care plan with his mother , who died of cancer .
" It should be a right for every American , in a country as wealthy as ours … for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in a hospital room arguing with insurance companies who say it was a pre-existing condition , and they do n't have to pay her treatment , there 's something fundamentally wrong with that , " Obama said .
Striking back at a McCain charge that Obama " does n't understand " foreign policy , Obama said , " It 's true , there are some things I do n't understand .
I do n't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 while Osama bin Laden set up safe havens for terrorists . "
In this debate we saw Obama continue with the strategy that he started with in the first debate : showing that he belongs up there on that stage as a potential commander in chief .
That is where Obama made his greatest advances Tuesday night and he will likely be seen as the winner of this debate .
Style : Obama ( A-) McCain ( A-)
McCain was extremely comfortable in the town hall - style format , walking the stage , calling voters by name and at one point shaking hands with service member Terry Shirey , a questioner in the hall .
" Thanks for serving , " McCain told Shirey .
The Arizona senator likes town hall debates , and that showed .
McCain had previously challenged Obama to more town hall debates but the negotiations broke down .
Obama 's style was more subdued and explanatory .
He gained style points when the cameras showed him smiling repeatedly as McCain verbally attacked him .
Obama appeared unflappable , and yet at one point firmly insisted he wanted to correct the record when McCain mischaracterized his tax plan .
Obama 's steady , calm demeanor may be paying off .
In the last three weeks , America has struggled against the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression , and polls show voters now view the Illinois senator as the safe choice on the economy .
Accuracy : Obama ( A-) McCain ( B+ )
McCain mischaracterized Obama 's tax plan when he claimed that Obama had voted to raise taxes 94 times , which is not true .
McCain also falsely claimed that 50 percent of small businesses will get a tax increase under Obama 's plan -- that is simply not true .
The bottom line is that Obama is now 2 for 2 .
He showed during the course of the two debates the number - one question that Americans have of him :
Does he have the experience it takes to serve as president ?
During the course of three hours he is answering that question minute by minute .

In his statement to the legislative inquiry ( which was supposed to remain confidential but promptly released to the press by the McCain campaign )
Todd Palin admits that he ’d been trying to get his trooper brother - in - law fired for years .
But he insists , improbably , that that did n’t have anything to do with the subsequent dismissal of the guy he and Gov.
Palin were pressuring to fire him .
That , and he too says , Walt Monegan , the Commissioner of Public Safety at the center of the story , was not fired but rather resigned .
In one of the odder parts of the deposition , he seems to have implied that two reasons Monegan was actually fired were for emailing the governor reports that she ’d driven with her newborn son without a car seat and that he did n’t have a state plane available enough for her trips .
For those of you keeping score , the Palins ’ purported rationales for firing Monegan are tellingly similar to those originally put forward for firing those US Attorneys — vague and barely consequential complaints that no one ever seems to have mentioned before the press started asking questions , peppered with occasional defenses of the reasons for the firing which they claim are n’t even the real reasons .
And oh yeah , he was n’t fired .
He was reassigned but decided to quit .
With any luck the voters will spare the country from this intemperate , thuggish man .
Russia sees the US missile defence in central Europe as a threat
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has announced plans to build a " guaranteed nuclear deterrent system " , to be in place by 2020 .
He said he wanted military chiefs to submit plans by December .
He called for a programme to build new nuclear submarines as well as " a system of aerospace defence " .
The announcement comes just weeks after Russia accused the US of starting a new arms race by siting part of its missile defence shield in Poland .
" We must guarantee nuclear deterrence under various political and military conditions by 2020 , " Mr Medvedev told military commanders .
He said it was necessary to build " new types of armaments " and to " achieve dominance in airspace " , according to quotes carried by the Itar - Tass news agency .
" We plan to start serial production of warships , primarily nuclear - powered submarines carrying cruise missiles and multifunctional submarines , " Mr Medvedev said .
" We will develop an aerospace defence system , as well , " he added .
Russia 's move would not change the balance of power , said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
She told Reuters : " The balance of power in terms of nuclear deterrence is not going to be affected by those measures . "
She said the US nuclear deterrent was " capable " and " robust " .
Moscow has repeatedly criticised the US for going ahead with plans for a missile defence shield , using rockets based in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic , saying it destabilises the strategic balance and builds " a ring of steel " around Russia .
Russia warned it would be " forced to react " .
This , it seems , is Russia showing its own determination to bolster its nuclear deterrent , says the BBC 's defence correspondent , Caroline Wyatt .
Bush Decides to Withdraw 8,000 Troops From Iraq By February
By VOA News
08 September 2008
The White House says President George Bush has decided to withdraw about 8.000 U.S. troops from Iraq by next February and that he will announce the plan in a speech Tuesday in Washington .
A transcript of that speech was released on Monday .
In the prepared remarks , Mr. Bush says the U.S. military will bring home 3,400 combat support forces from Iraq in the next few months .
He also says a Marine battalion will leave Iraq 's Anbar province by November and an army combat brigade will withdraw from Iraq in February .
Mr. Bush says a Marine battalion that was due to be sent to Iraq in November will instead go to Afghanistan and an army combat brigade will follow in January .
President Bush 's announcements on troop levels are in line with recommendations he received from his top defense advisers last week .
U.S. officials have said the defense chiefs recommended waiting until early next year to withdraw the next combat brigade from Iraq .
Mr. Bush leaves office in January .
The White House has said the president does not want to do anything that could reverse the security gains made in Iraq during the past year .
U.S. commanders have expressed hope that Iraq 's sharp drop in violence will free up more U.S. forces to fight an escalating insurgency in Afghanistan .
The United States now has 15 combat brigades in Iraq and a total of 140,000 troops .
The U.S. military contingent in Afghanistan numbers about 34,000 .

The open source Python programming language is on the verge a sweeping revamp in the form of version 3.0 of its platform -- a release will deviate in many ways from the current , mainline Python 2.x series .
So how do you meet the needs of current 2.x Python developers while transitioning to the bleeding edge of Python 3.0 development ?
That 's where the new Python 2.6 release comes into play .
Python 2.6 is intended to help ease the migration of Python 2.x developers to Python 3.0 , a major redesign of the language that 's about revisiting earlier design decisions that are now considered flaws -- and fixing them , David Goodger , an officer of the Python Software Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
As yet , no date has been set for the release of Python 3.0 .
The move comes as the market for Python use is expanding , thanks its use on Google 's AppEngine and enterprise adoption is on the rise .
Growing adoption , however , means that a growing population could be impacted with dramatic shifts in the project -- an impact that Python 2.6 aims to soften .
" Python 2.6 is n't about Python 3 compatibility , it 's about Python 2.x compatibility , " Goodger said .
" We are not expecting or encouraging developers to migrate to Python 3 immediately , and the Python 2.x line will continue to be supported and improved for years to come .
Python 2.6 is an upgrade intended for most developers of production systems .
Python 3.0 is for those who like to live on the bleeding edge . "
He added that design aspects of Python 2.6 pave the way for migration to Python 3.0 , a release with enhancements he sees as improving the foundations of Python going forward .
Kevin Dangoor , co-author of " Rapid Web Applications with TurboGears : Using Python to Create Ajax - Powered Sites , " told InternetNews.com that , in his opinion , Python 2.6 is a huge release -- probably the biggest since Python 2.2 .
For him , too , the key to Python 2.6 is the fact that it is a stepping stone to Python 3.0 .
" In many cases , Python 2.6 lets you selectively use Python 3.0 features today , without sacrificing compatibility with existing libraries , " Dangoor said .
" For example , you can use the new Unicode literals or print function just with a simple import statement . "
AM - Wednesday , 24 September , 2008 08:09:00 Reporter : Alexandra Kirk TONY EASTLEY : Because of the size and reach of the American economy no country is immune to events unfolding in the US .
Already Australians have seen their superannuation 's earnings plummet .
But the International Monetary Fund says Australia 's sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia to weather the storm .
That 's music to the ears of Federal Treasurer , Wayne Swan .
He says it vindicates the Government 's economic management and the fiscal position outlined in Labor 's first Budget .
Mr Swan is in our Canberra studio and he 's speaking to Alexandra Kirk .
ALEXANDRA KIRK : Treasurer good morning .
WAYNE SWAN : Good morning Alex it 's good to be with you .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
You heard Rupert Murdoch 's concern about the deepening crisis in the United States also Leon Panetta , the former Clinton chief of staff says that the US is facing an economic 9/11 .
Are you confident what the US financial chiefs are proposing will rescue the American economy ?
WAYNE SWAN : Well Alex , we are facing the toughest global circumstances in a very long period of time , it 's impacting in the United States , it 's impacting around the globe , so substantial action is required by the US authorities .
I 'm not going to go into buy into the domestic US debate but at the core of this problem is toxic debt in the US banking system and any long - term , sustainable solution has to deal with that toxic debt in the US banking system because the consequences of not dealing with it are more substantial than I think the costs of dealing with it .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
But the strategy 's been dubbed " a financial socialism " and the world - renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs says that there is no plan , that it 's just a few paragraphs long and the financial bosses do n't know what they 're doing , the rescue package wo n't fix bad mortgages and get them off the books , do you know more than he does ?
WAYNE SWAN : Well I 'm not going to buy into the domestic United States debate , I 've been talking regularly to the US authorities , our regulators are also talking regularly because what 's going on in the United States can't be divorced from what 's happening elsewhere in the world .
The US authorities have proposed a course of action that will go through its normal course in the US congress as it should but at the end of the day , the United States needs and the world needs a sustainably solution to this problem which is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister is in the United States at the moment , because global action when it comes to systemic problems in the international financial system is essential if we are to avoid a repeat of these events in five , ten or 20 years time .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
But knowing what you do about the financial bailout , do you expect unemployment in Australia for example , to rise dramatically ?
WAYNE SWAN :
Well there 's no doubt that the world economy is slowing and events in the United States are pushing up borrowing costs for both households and for businesses , that is impacting on Australia because it comes on top of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the former government .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
And what do you think is going to happen to unemployment ?
WAYNE SWAN :
And what that is doing , what that is doing is slowing our economy , we were upfront in the May Budget , we forecast a modest increase in unemployment in our Budget and as you will note Alex , the IMF has commended our May Budget for its prudent fiscal policy , for its attention to a future reform agenda and singled out for mention the strength of our banking and regulatory system .
So we are in a better position to withstand the fallout from these events than perhaps any other country in the world , but we are not immune and it will certainly have an impact on domestic growth , that certainly has an impact on employment growth and we will see on our current Budget forecast , a modest increase in unemployment .
We 've been upfront and frank about that because , you see Alex , in the May Budget we did talk about the countervailing forces impacting upon the Australian economy , the Prime Minister and I were acutely aware that things internationally could take a turn for the worse and we did take that into account in our settings .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
But there are warnings in the IMF report that Australia is in the midst of a resources boom that wo n't last forever , that Australia 's productive capacity is increasingly stretched , that underlying inflation is the highest in more than a decade and that banks while they may have demonstrated a soundness there are some vulnerabilities .
WAYNE SWAN :
Well these were all challenges we recognised as we went through the economic debate last year before the Government was elected .
And inflation in the months of October , November and December last year hit a 16 - year high , the economy has been bedevilled with capacity constraints over recent years because of the failure of the previous government to invest for the future .
These were all issues that were front and centre in our May Budget , and you would note that the IMF also commends the Government for the creation of the investment funds to expand the productive capacity of the economy , to also put downward pressure on inflation and therefore interest rates in the long term .
ALEXANDRA KIRK :
Well you say the economy 's in good shape , is n't this the best time then to be helping pensioners ?
That it 's unlikely to get any better in terms of fiscal position ?
WAYNE SWAN :
Well the best time to have had that intervention was actually some stage in the last 12 years under the previous government , we 've made it very clear , we are going to take additional measures , additional measures to those that we put in the Budget , the $ 500 bonus for aged pensioners , the increase in the utilities allowance .
But it has to be done in a measured way because this is a very big expenditure item , it has very significant implications for the Budget long term and we will act on the report from Mr Harmer , but we 'll do it in a responsible way , it can't be done in a short term way , it 's got to be done in a long term responsible way .
ALEXANDRA KIRK : Is n't that argument undermined though because Treasury documents show that the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd recommended a pension measure over and above the extra utilities allowance and that the Government considered a $ 30 a week pension increase , exactly what the Coalition 's been calling for ?
WAYNE SWAN : No , it is most certainly not the case , we had a look at all of the options in the lead - up to the Budget which is why we opted to pay the $ 500 bonus that had not been budgeted for by the previous government , it 's why we opted to increase the utilities allowance and to pay it to all pensioners , not just to some and to go through the Harmer process because a one - off change without sufficient preparation would have adverse consequences for many people in the system .
We 're going to get this right , we 're going to get it right for the long term , we 'll get it right for the pensioners of Australia .
ALEXANDRA KIRK : Wayne Swan , thank you .
WAYNE SWAN : Good to be with you .

Hurricane
Ike news blackout on dead bodies in Bolivar , Texas
And fear of Internet gossip should not prohibit responsible journalism .
The ABC News affiliate in Houston carried a video of investigative reporter Wayne Dolcefino confronting Texas governor Rick Perry about temporary “ no - fly ” zones for TV helicopters over parts of the Bolivar peninsula and west Galveston , the hardest hit areas .
Later in the video , Dolcefino tells the ABC anchors :
After Katrina , we were able to go to Waveland , Mississippi , and Gulfport , and Biloxi , and places that were devastated , where there were , sadly , bodies on the road .
Now that ’s a horrible thing to see and a horrible thing to show , but people who live there , who have friends there , who have relatives there , have a fundamental right to know that stuff .
They have a fundamental right to know , not just from the words of a politician or public official , but from the news media , which are independent of government and have also the responsibility of trying to help the public evaluate response …
We could n’t get crews back on Galveston last night and this morning until we complained on the air for about twenty hours .
And it ’s not because we want to sightsee , guys , it ’s because we have the responsibility of telling people …
I made it as clear to [ Gov. Perry ] off camera as I did on camera that this is not going to be tolerated .
You know , we hear about disasters in other countries — what was it , Burma , Myanmar — where they wo n’t let people in to see and you know , this is the state of Texas ; this America .
And we ’re not trying to interfere with rescue and search operations , nor did anyone suggest we would be .
When asked why he thought the government was obstructing access , Dolcefino did not mince words :
I do n’t think they want us to see images that may remind people … of the images that we saw in New Orleans .
I do n’t think they want us to see the images that were seen in Waveland , Mississippi or Gulfport …
I think that ’s the reality ; they do not want us to see yet , until they can control what we see and how we see it .
And that is simply , at least in my career , unacceptable .
Maybe a lot of reporters wo n’t say it , but I will .
I think they do not want us to see images of potential fatalities that may be on land or on water .
Other reporters did n’t think access was much of a problem .
The Houston Chronicle ’s Matthew Tresaugue said he was n’t sure why TV choppers were prohibited from flying last Sunday , but that there were , in fact , reporters in the air .
On SEJ ’s list - serv he noted that :
The Chronicle had a photographer over Bolivar on Sunday about the same time as the televised confrontation .
I flew with a photographer from High Island to Galveston ’s west end to Surfside Beach in a Cessna yesterday , and one of our columnists and a photographer got a closer view of the same area from a helicopter . …
I think the difference is the television guys wanted to take their helicopters , and we hitched rides .
On my flight , I was able to see what I needed and even double back to take second looks .
I ca n’t complain .
At any rate , its ’ hard to imagine that information about the government ’s response to Hurricane Ike would not get out sooner or later , and access seems to have improved since the weekend .
But authorities should realize that obstructing the media ’s ability to report in disaster zones only makes the public more suspicious about the adequacy of their response .

JS. Class – JavaScript in a Ruby Style
By Peter Cooper
JS. Class is an attempt at making JavaScript more Ruby - like .
More specifically , it 's a library that makes object oriented development easier in JavaScript ( in comparison to JS 's prototype technique , at least ) by implementing Ruby 's core object , module , and class systems as well as some of Ruby 's meta- programming techniques .
As well as ports of Enumerable , Observable , Comparable , and Forwardable , you get subclassing , mixins , reflection , late - binding arguments , singleton methods , method binding , and Ruby - like inheritance .
Of course , JavaScript gives access to many of these elements already , but JS .
Class presents things with a Ruby flavor .
The official JS .
Class site is particularly well done and each main area is well documented .
In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network , Gov. Sarah Palin responded to news reports indicating that supporters of the Republican ticket have made offensive and threatening comments directed at Senator Barack Obama at campaign rallies , saying that she had not heard them .
“ We have heard through some mainstream media is that folks have hollered out some pretty atrocious and unacceptable things , ” including threats of harm , she said , adding “ we have not heard that . ”
Ms. Palin added : “ If I ever were to hear that standing up there at the podium with the mic , I would call them out on that , and I would tell these people , no , that ’s unacceptable , let ’s rise above that please . ”
But Governor Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , said she would not hesitate to continue accusing Mr. Obama of “ palling around with terrorists ” because of his association with the former founder of the radical group , the Weather Underground :
“ I would say it again , I would say it again , because again , according to the information that we have , the association that he ’s had with Bill Ayers was n’t just one or two time sitting on a board together , ” Ms. Palin said .
“ No , there ’s been quite a few associations and events and meetings and discussion and emails and calls and to not disavow that too , I think is troubling . ”
Mr. Obama has portrayed his association with Mr. Ayers as limited .
And a Times report notes that the two men do not appear to have been close .
Governor Palin made her comments in an interview over the weekend with the Christian television network ’s political reporter , David Brody , who also spoke to her about issues of faith and politics .
She expressed support for a Constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman .
“ I wish on a federal level that that ’s where we would go because I do n’t support gay marriage , ” she said .
In the interview she also discussed her personal religious beliefs and said that “ faith and God in general has been mocked through this campaign . ”
She also spoke about the things she prays for and suggested how that faith has helped her through the grueling campaign .
“ I do n’t know how anybody would want to do this if they did n’t have real strong faith in God that he ’s got it all under control , ” she said .
A series of tunnels that run underneath central London and were used for communications during the Cold War have gone on sale for an estimated £ 5 m .
The deep tunnels were built in 1940 and used as air raid shelters holding 8,000 people during World War II .
They were used by MI6 in the last two years of the war .
They have since been used as a " reserve war room " , public record library and the telephone exchange which connected the Cold War hotline between the presidents of the US and USSR .
In its days as an exchange it housed about 80 workers , who enjoyed a canteen and recreation room - complete with snooker tables .
Access to the mile - long system of horizontal and vertical shafts is in lifts through unmarked doors in the street on High Holborn .
BT has owned the tunnels since 1986 and tried selling the site 10 years later but with no luck .
It expects offers of about £ 5 m for the 77,000 square feet of space .

What are these ?
The bad news , of course , is that right now Obama ’s approval / disapproval rating is better than McCain’s .
Indeed , Obama ’s is a bit higher than it was a month ago .
That suggests the failure of the McCain campaign ’s attacks on Obama .
So drop them .
Not because they ’re illegitimate .
I think many of them are reasonable .
Obama ’s relationship to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is , I believe , a legitimate issue .
But McCain ruled it out of bounds , and he ’s sticking to that .
And for whatever reason  the public mood , campaign ineptness , McCain ’s alternation between hesitancy and harshness , which reflects the fact that he ’s uncomfortable in the attack role  the other attacks on Obama just are n’t working .
There ’s no reason to think they ’re suddenly going to .
There are still enough doubts about Obama to allow McCain to win .
But McCain needs to make his case , and do so as a serious but cheerful candidate for times that need a serious but upbeat leader .
McCain should stop unveiling gimmicky proposals every couple of days that pretend to deal with the financial crisis .
He should tell the truth  we ’re in uncharted waters , no one is certain what to do , and no one knows what the situation will be on Jan. 20 , 2009 .
But what we do know is that we could use someone as president who ’s shown in his career the kind of sound judgment and strong leadership we ’ll need to make it through the crisis .
McCain can make the substantive case for his broadly centrist conservatism .
He can explain that our enemies wo n’t take a vacation because the markets are down , and that it ’s not unimportant that he ’s ready to be commander in chief .
He can remind voters that even in a recession , the president appoints federal judges  and that his judges wo n’t legislate from the bench .
And he can point out that there ’s going to be a Democratic Congress .
He can suggest that surely we ’d prefer a president who would check that Congress where necessary and work with it where possible , instead of having an inexperienced Democratic president joined at the hip with an all - too - experienced Democratic Congress , leading us , unfettered and unchecked , back to 1970s - style liberalism .
At Wednesday night ’s debate at Hofstra , McCain might want to volunteer a mild mea culpa about the extent to which the presidential race has degenerated into a shouting match .
And then he can pledge to the voters that the last three weeks will feature a contest worthy of this moment in our history .
He ’d enjoy it .
And he might even win it .
" This crisis is starting to look like the Black Wednesady in 1992 .
Unless we see an extension of central bank swaps in dollars and euros to Eastern Europe within days to stop this uncontrolled process of deleveraging , this could get out of control and do serious damage to Western Europe .
We could see the euro fall to parity against the dollar by next year , " he said .
McCain 's campaign put the candidate on " The View " because it attracts the sort of female voters he 's targeting .
But while it may be personality - oriented , that does n't mean the liberal - leaning ladies will go easy on McCain .
Joy Behar and Barbara Walters tag - teamed him with effectively the same question : Come on , you know you 're running a disingenuous , cynical campaign .
McCain 's uncomfortable response :
They 're attacking me , too , and I would n't have had to drop these daisy cutters on Obama if he had only done town hall meetings .
" I do n't think you 'd see the tenor this campaign , " he observed .

Early speculation that Oprah Winfrey would endorse the Amazon Kindle has been confirmed .
A posting on her website says that the e-book reader is her “ favorite new gadget . ”
" I 'm telling you , it is absolutely my new favorite thing in the world , " she said in the post , which notes that she first received the Kindle this past summer .
Oprah also gave away a Kindle to everyone in her audience on Friday , which oddly enough , caused one woman in the crowd to tear up .
" There are not any keys in there , " Oprah said telling them to look in a box under their seats .
" But something equally as good . "
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made an appearance , but Oprah hardly let him get a word in edgewise , other than to announce a special offer and say what books he is reading ( Cormac McCarthy 's The Road and a book on the history of cryogenic engineering ) .
Not only should her endorsement alone boost sales significantly , but Amazon is also promoting a discount of $ 50 off the sales price to anyone who purchases a Kindle before November 1 and uses the code “ OPRAHWINFREY . ”
And in her first big Kindle - related book promo , she is also offering 10 percent off the sales price ( both Kindle and hardcover versions ) of The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski .
She took a moment from her outpouring of praise for the Kindle to make it clear that there was no hidden agenda .
" I have no stake in the Kindle , " she said .
German Finance Minister Warns of Crisis Fallout ' Our Economy Will Also Suffer '
At a meeting of parliament in Berlin on Thursday , Germany 's finance minister warned of the longterm consequences of Wall Street 's near collapse .
Still , he reiterated his stance that the country would not join Washington in creating a bailout fund for failing banks .

For any mom who 's ever felt frazzled , overwhelmed or rushed , Oprah says this show is for you .
" It 's your wake - up call to slow down , " she says .
" What happened to my guest today could so easily happen to any of you . "
Brenda Slaby still blames herself for her daughter 's death .
She tells moms to slow down and appreciate their kids .
Brenda Slaby says she was once an assistant principal and mother of two who tried her best to be " supermom . "
" It was very hard trying to be the perfect mom and the perfect employee , " she says .
" I try to be everything to everybody ...
I 've always been the kind of person that lived for doing things for other people . "
Then , on a hot August afternoon in 2007 , she says she went from being a good role model for children , a good administrator and a good parent to being the most hated mom in America .
When Brenda woke up on August 23 , 2007 , she says she knew she had a busy day ahead of her .
Summer vacation was coming to a close , and it was the first day back for teachers at her school .
That morning , the rush to get out the door was more frantic than usual , she says .
Brenda and her husband , Gary , got their two young daughters , Allison and Cecilia , dressed and ready to go .
Then , in a departure from their regular routine , Brenda loaded 2 - year - old Cecilia into her car to take her to the babysitter 's house .
" I had a dentist appointment , and I asked Brenda to take Cecilia , " Gary says .
" I normally took both Cecilia and Allison , dropped Cecilia off at the sitter and Allison off at preschool . "

With Cecilia sleeping in the backseat , Brenda pulled out of the driveway at about 6 a.m .
When she realized it was too early to drop her youngest child off , she decided to run a quick errand .
Brenda stopped at the store to buy doughnuts , a treat for the returning teachers .
After loading her car with snacks , she got on the road that led to her school and drove straight there .
With her mind racing through all the things she needed to accomplish before teachers arrived , Brenda got right to work .
" I had lots of things to set up , " she says .
" I was nervous and frantic that morning because it was such an important day to get the school year [ off ] to a great start . "
The day began with a staff meeting , followed by lunch .
While chatting with new teachers between meetings , Brenda says she talked about her daughters .
" My feeling was it was a great first start , " she says .
" It was going to be a great school year , and it was a great start to the day . "
At about 4 p.m. , Brenda was in her office , getting ready to head home when all hell broke loose .
" A good teacher friend of mine -- sometimes I think it was a blessing it was her -- was on her way home , and she walked by my car , " Brenda says .
" She ran into my office and she said , ' Brenda , your baby 's in the car . ' "
Brenda immediately grabbed her keys and raced to the parking lot .
" I knew what I was going to find , " she says .
" I opened my car door , and I remember hearing the voices around me .
Teachers who were close to me [ were ] screaming . "
When she got to her car she found Cecilia in the backseat , still strapped into her car seat .
Brenda says she grabbed her daughter out of the car as fast as she could , but she knew it was too late .
" I knew she was gone as soon as I picked her up , I knew , " she says .
" I remember I took her , and I ran through the parking lot with her , screaming her name .
Then , what brought me kind of to consciousness , I guess , was somebody from the cafeteria yelled for me to bring her here . "
Brenda says she handed her lifeless daughter to someone who tried to revive her .
Then , she retreated to another part of the cafeteria and began to pray .
" I heard people yelling for ice , and I sat in a ball and I prayed , " she says .
" I prayed harder than I 've ever prayed in my life ...
But I knew she was gone . "
Cecilia died of a heatstroke after being left in the car for nearly eight hours .
Outside , temperatures had reached 100 degrees .
Gary was working when he received a frantic call from Brenda 's principal .
" He said , ' Get over to the school right now , ' " Gary says .
" And I said , ' What 's up ? '
[ He said , ] ' It 's an emergency . ' "
In the car on the way to his wife 's school , Gary says he never considered that his child 's life might be in danger .
" The whole time I 'm thinking , ' What disgruntled employee did something crazy ? ' " he says .
" I said , ' Well , maybe something happened to Brenda . ' "
When Gary pulled into the school parking lot , he says he saw a lot of commotion .
Brenda 's principal pulled him off to the side to tell him what happened .
" He looked at me and he says , ' Cecilia 's dead , ' " Gary says .
" I did n't even think to ask him , ' How ?
Why ? '
I just got up and sort of walked off to be by myself .
I was just in shock .
I did n't know what to do . "
Despite his grief , Gary says he has never blamed his wife for Cecilia 's death .
" I could have done the same thing very easily , " he says .
On nights when his wife had to work late , Gary says she 'd ask him to pick up the girls from the babysitter 's house , a break from their normal routine .
A few times , he says he forgot .
Oprah.com : How to heal your grief
" I get out of work thinking about what I 'm going to do when I get home , this and that .
I 'm going up the highway , [ I realize , ] ' Oh , my gosh .
I left her at the sitter 's , ' " he says .
" I would have to turn around , go back and get her . "
Gary does n't hold Brenda responsible , but Brenda still blames herself .
" I realized the most important person in the world to me lost out because I did n't plan well enough , " she says .
" She 's the one that slipped through the cracks . "
The day Cecilia died , Brenda was taken to a police station where she was questioned for more than two hours .
During her emotional confession , she says police officers were empathetic .
" Never during the questioning did they seem accusatory , " Brenda says .
One officer assured Brenda that no one thought she meant to hurt Cecilia .
Brenda , on the other hand , was not easy on herself .
" Good mothers do n't do this , " she said during the questioning .
" How could I not think of my daughter ?
I want to die .
I just want to die . "
Brenda admits she had left Cecilia in a running car before , but she says she never made a habit of it .
" The day that Cecilia died was so different because I completely forgot that she was there , " she says .
While the police may have been empathetic , Brenda says her community was not .
" My community was in outrage , " she says .
" I was the most hated mom . "
Although Brenda says her staff and principal were wonderful to her , she says the decision makers in the school district decided they wanted nothing to do with her .
Oprah.com : How to slow down
Although coping has been difficult , Brenda says she has found a higher purpose that is helping her move forward .
" Almost immediately , I said , ' How am I going to make something out of this ? '
I have been given this to bear for a reason , and I 'm not going to let Cecilia 's life be in vain .
That I 'm going to use what I 've learned in this whole process to change lives for other people . "
Brenda says the lesson she learned that she wants to pass on to other moms is to slow down -- do n't become overwhelmed with perfection .
" I 've learned to say a lot , ' It just does n't matter , ' " she says .
" The house does n't matter , the perfect dinner does n't matter -- the kids matter . "

CNN just played the Social Security portion of John McCain ’s interview with Wolf Blitzer .
And two key points stood out .
First , McCain fabricated an alternative history of the 2005 Social Security battle in order to create a new tax talking points .
According to McCain , and he repeated this again and again , “ the [ Social Security ] talks broke down because the Democrats insisted as a precondition that we raise taxes . ”
That ’s very weird .
First , there were no Social Security talks .
And the Democrats did n’t make any demands to raise taxes .
They did n’t even propose raising taxes .
As many of you know , I followed that debate extremely closely .
And McCain just made this stuff out of whole cloth .
Really bizarre .
Second , Blitzer asked if McCain still would have favored President Bush ’s privatization plan , as he did in 2005 , that we see how volatile the stock market it is .
McCain repeatedly refused to answer the question and instead repeated the tax precondition fib .
Blitzer actually complicated the matter by misstating what Bush proposed — claiming he proposed allowing people to put 10 % of their Social Security funds in the market rather than just under 20 % .
But the key point remains — after standing behind privatization as recently as a few weeks ago , now McCain refuses to say he still supports it .
A patch of land in Ventura County ’s section of Los Padres National Forest where the ground recently heated up to 812 degrees continues to puzzle firefighters and geologists after weeks of monitoring .
“ It ’s a thermal anomaly , ” said Ron Oatman , spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department .
Firefighters responded to reports of a blaze there a month and a half ago , when observers noticed smoke rising from the parched scrub .
But when they arrived , they found no flames .
Firefighters and geologists who have surveyed the area in the Sespe Oil Field are uncertain what ’s causing the heat , but they do have a theory .

Allen King , a retired geologist with the U.S. Forest Service who went to the site Friday , said the smoking ground is “ a normal occurrence ” that does not appear to be the result of human activity .
The hot spot is in an area considered to be an active landslide that has shifted for more than 60 years .
Several hundred feet below its cracked surface lie pockets of gas , tar and oil .
King said he suspects cracks along the landslide ’s slope allow oxygen to enter into the earth and hydrocarbon material to “ seep out ” of the fine - grain shale .
The combination can create underground combustion , he said .
King said the depth at which hydrocarbon material can be found “ varies tremendously ” and that he does not know at what depth the combustion in the oil field is occurring .
The 812 - degree temperature was measured Friday about a foot below the surface , he said .
No other temperature checks have been made since , according to Oatman .

During Friday ’s visit to the hot spot , smoke rose through five cracks in the ground .
From a distance , it looked like “ a small , smoldering camp fire , ” Oatman said .
The smoke comes and goes , he said , and fire officials expect it will last until the next heavy rainfall , when water and mud plug the fissures .
The steep , rugged terrain is owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and leased by Seneca Resources Corp .
The area is gated off from public access and is free of equipment and buildings .
The hot spot is not considered to be a threat to public safety , Oatman said , and the Fire Department is monitoring the area daily .
The 3,000 - acre Sespe Oil Field was discovered in 1887 and has since produced about 50 million barrels of oil , said David Christy , spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management .
The field contains more than 300 oil wells , 210 of which are active .
In January 2007 , about 200 to 300 gallons of oil spilled into a nearby creek after a pipe containing a mixture of groundwater and oil burst .

Jeff Kuyper , executive director of Los Padres ForestWatch , said he had not heard of hot spots in the oil field but was concerned about their potential effect on the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary and the forest ’s fire - prone nature .
“ It ’s just a disaster waiting to happen . . . regardless of what the cause is , ” he said .

( CNN ) -- Evangelist Tony Alamo was arrested Thursday in Flagstaff , Arizona , on charges related to a child porn investigation , an FBI spokesman said .
The 74 - year - old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries was arrested without incident at 2:45 p.m. ( 4:45 p.m. ET ) as he was departing the Little America Hotel with his wife , said Manuel Johnson , spokesman for the FBI in Phoenix , Arizona .
The FBI , the Flagstaff Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety were involved in the arrest , he said .
Alamo was charged under a federal statute with having knowingly transported a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity , Johnson said .
Alamo , whose real name is Bernie Hoffman , was taken to Coconino County Jail in Flagstaff , where he is to have an initial appearance Friday in federal magistrate court , Johnson said .
Over the weekend , about 100 federal and state agents authorities raided Alamo's 15 - acre compound near Texarkana , Arkansas , and took six children into temporary custody .
The children were interviewed as part of a two - year investigation into Tony Alamo Christian Ministries to determine whether they were physically or sexually abused , said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police .
Alamo , reached by phone Saturday in Los Angeles , California , denied any wrongdoing .
" It 's a hoax , " Alamo said .
" They 're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I 'm a pornographer .
Saying that I rape little children .
... I love children .
I do n't abuse them .
Never have .
Never will . "
Asked why authorities were searching the property , Alamo compared himself to Christ .
" Why were they after Jesus ? " he asked .
" It 's the same reason .
Jesus is living within me . "

Boilerplate disclosure in Google 's quarterly report ( GOOG ) : A list of projects / units that are n't making the search company any money .
As it did last quarter , Google notes that YouTube is n't making any kind of " material " revenue contribution ; other units on the goose - egg list include Postini , Google Audio Ads ( d Marc ) , Google Checkout , etc .
Not included in this list , though , is DoubleClick , which Google paid some $ 3 billion for this spring .
Lehman analyst Doug Anmuth , who had previously predicted that DoubleClick would add $ 300 million in revenue and up to $ 60 in Ebitda this year , now figures that the company contributed $ 178 million in the first half of 2008 .
Given that Google did n't actually finish the acquisition until March 11 , we assume that Doug will be revising his estimate for the rest of the year .

Your credit score is important – it ’s the first thing a lender is going to look at when you apply for a loan and it directly affects the interest rate you pay .
A good credit score can save you thousands of dollars in interest over the life of a loan .
Your FICO credit score is based on your credit history , which can be found in your credit report .
You can get a free credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com .
Unfortunately , it is n’t always easy to get a free credit score .
Most companies charge you for it .
Note : Your credit score and credit report are different .
Your credit report covers credit history and your FICO credit score is a number based on a weighted and proprietary formula .
While it ’s good to know your credit score , it is n’t something you can just look up any time you want .
You almost always have to pay for it , usually anywhere from $ 5 - $ 15 , depending on where you get it .
However , you can get a free copy of your FICO credit score if you are willing to do a little legwork .
How to Get Your Free Credit Score Online
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACT Act ) requires each of the 3 major credit bureaus to provide you with a free credit report once per year upon request .
The credit bureaus are not required to provide your credit score , but they are happy to offer you an upsell .
The good news is that you can get a free credit score online through the credit bureaus , or from one of several third party companies .
Many of these companies only provide you a copy of your credit score free if you sign up for a free trial of their monthly credit monitoring service .
The credit monitoring service gives you the ability to check your credit score , verify your credit history is correct , and verify that there are no unauthorized items on your report .
You can always cancel the credit monitoring service before the free trial period ends if you do n’t wish to pay for it .
Your credit score will be free as long as you cancel in time .
Get a free credit score with no trials and no credit card required .
The good news , is not all of the free credit score offers require you to sign up for a free trial or provide your credit card number .
Credit Karma and Credit Sesame both offer free credit scores without restrictions .
These scores are not your actual FICO score but are based on information from one credit bureau .
So you may decide to use another service that offers a free credit score based on all three credit bureaus .
We list the top options below .
Where to Get Your Free Credit Score
The FICO credit score is the most commonly used credit score in the US .

Many banks and credit card companies now offer free credit score updates from one or more credit agency .
I am able to get free monthly updates from my primary bank , one of my credit card companies , and through both Credit Sesame and Credit Karma .
This helps me keep up to date with my credit score and any changes reported by any of the major credit agencies .
Here are some helpful lists :
GoFreeCredit
GoFreeCredit.com .
GoFreeCredit stands out because they offer a credit score and credit monitoring based on all three major credit bureaus .

It is $ 1 for a seven day trial and you receive your FICO credit score during that time .
After the seven day trial it is $ 21.95 per month and includes credit monitoring , credit alerts , and suggestions for .
Learn more abou with Experian >>
FreeCreditReport.com
FreeCreditReport.com became famous several years ago through their catchy commercials .
At the time , they offered free credit scores when you signed up for a free trial membership .
FreeCreditScore.com is now owned by Experian .
If you go to this site now you will be taken to an Experian page , but does not include your Credit score .
The reason we brought it up in this list , is that the brand is so ingrained in people ’s memories that we felt it best to address that this site will not get you your score , but can only get you your free Experian credit report .
Why should you get your free credit score ?
Knowing your credit score comes in handy if you plan on applying for a loan or if you have a need for credit in the near future .
For most people , it is a good practice to have an idea of your score , but it may not be necessary to know the exact number .
However , reviewing your credit history frequently ( at least every few months ) is a good idea so you can monitor for changes to your credit profile and be alerted to possible changes or unauthorized access to your credit .

Unit Testing CSS - Looking for a Solution
I think it ’s an epic failure of web standards that CSS is the only essentially untestable technology invented in last decade - Tomasz
Talking today on Twitter with Tomasz got me thinking again about one of those problems that I come back to once in a while .
Unit testing CSS .
CSS development is a pain , even with some sort of system .
Admit it .
I actually like CSS most of the time but it ’s still painful at times .
Hopefully with that out of the way you feel better .
unit testing is a method of testing that verifies the individual units of source code are working properly .
A unit is the smallest testable part of an application .
All testing past simple validation of CSS seems to be done visually at present .
Thinking about this from the point of view of CSS seems straight forward , but turns out not to be so for a variety of reasons .
The problem lies in the cascading and compounding nature of the beast .
Each individual CSS rule might do something which is self contained , but the chances on a real site are probably slim .
For instance :
pre. body { font - size : 100 % ; } p { font - size : 2em ; }
What is the size of the font size of a paragraph ?
It turns out it depends .
Not just on more than one unit of source code ( we have two rules here ) but also on things like the browser .
And how do we get this font size from a browser in the first place ?
I generally dislike Selenium but does it provide a mechanism for getting at the calculated DOM attribute values ?
Do we have to interface directly with a browser at a lower level ?
wxMozilla , wxWebKit or maybe pywebkitgtz might prove useful , but I ’m not sure at what level they operate .
What I ’m imagining here is maybe something like ( excuse the Python , hopefully you get the idea ) :
pre. def test_text_size_is_12 px( self ) : response = fetch_with_browser( ‘ http://www.google.com') self.assertEquals (12 , response.search ( “ p ” ) . fontSize
So we could use CSS selectors ( ie. p ) to find elements and then assert various DOM properties ( ie. fontSize ) are equal to values we specify .
The magic is in getting access to those calculated DOM attribute values from an actual browser engine .
Another approach would seem to be looking at visual rendering and comparing against a known good version .
This seems to be something that the Mozilla folks got up to a while back to test different browser versions .
Their are a few tools that might help us out here too ; BrowserCam provides a paid for service , Webkit2png is a handy command line script I ’ve had fun with in the past and IECapt appears to be a similar beast for Internet Explorer .
CutyCapt is another cross platform webkit based utility .
I can see a few gotchas lurking here .
Animations or slow loading javascript would obviously throw this into disarray .
But disabling these in the browser might get up somewhere .
How to compare images produced I ’m not yet sure , but I reasons someone reading this might have a good idea ?
As the title would suggest this post does not contain the answer , only a few useful links and two possible approaches to the problem .
The questions at this stage are :
Does any of this exist already ?
If so who do we need to cuddle up to to get access to it ?
Are any of the technical hurdles to either of the approaches mentioned above insurmountable ?
If not what is the best solution ?
Does anyone except me and Tomasz even want this ?
I reason their are a fair few things that would be needed to make this first practical and later standard ; nice APIs , run times in various languages , and working out whether or not it actually helps CSS development to name but a few .
But right now I ’d go for a limited proof of concept that works on my machine .
If anyone has any links to thinks that might be good starting points please let me know .
Other ideas welcome as well .
One last thing ; Mozilla ’s latest employees are looking at the whole spectrum of developer tools .
I ’d love for them to start with something like this .
Tech Today or Tech Tomorrow ?
Energy Debate 2
September 1st , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
This is Part Two on a debate by The Economist .
The official debate concluded earlier this week , but you can still vote and leave comments or critique .
The question was :
“ Can we solve our energy problems with existing technologies today , without the need for breakthrough innovations ? ”
Though we often envision debates as pitting two opponents against each other , hopefully in an intense battle of wit and wordsmithing , this one was not so .
Both sides found themselves agreeing with each other more often than not , and parried with points on implementation .
Proposition
Mr. Joseph J. Romm , who sides with massive technology deployment , points out that massive renewable technology development should have a positive economic result .
All that construction creates jobs , and studies have suggested that in the long term you can reasonably expect gross economic growth after implementing a plan like this .
Cleantechnica has written before that wind power is most cost effective after building regional manufacturing factories .
Think of the cost of shipping a 50ft ( or larger ) turbine blade long distances !
Similar principles also apply for bulky or delicate solar technologies .
There ’s also an issue concerning the way some electric producers bring home the bacon .
If they earn the most money when customers use the most energy , encouraging energy efficiency or decreasing CO2 emissions looks like bad business .
In some places regulations have decoupled profit from generation .
Energy companies earn money from energy efficiency , so they still get a cut when their customers use less .
As a result , you see huge solar projects and initiatives rolling out of states like California .
So why is massive deployment better than improving our infrastructure ?
Two reasons : first , bigger is cheaper .
Industries of scale are a great way to reduce prices .
By building the existing renewable energy manufacturing base faster , hopefully you can make it cost effective sooner .
Secondly , you give existing companies opportunity to learn from and perfect their products and their business strategy .
Romm refers to a “ learning curve “ , which is necessary to bring any product to peak efficiency – the best possible product performance and business performance .
Together , both can dramatically drive prices down .
Then the market can take care of itelf .
Opposition
Peter Meisen believes that we need to upgrade our infrastructure first , then work on deploying all that renewable technology .
The reason is simple enough : at the moment we do n’t have the power lines to link remote energy production , like solar thermal and wind power , to population centers where it ’s needed .
He attempts to overcome two problems , base load and energy storage , with the same solution : a massive , interconnected energy grid .
With centralized power production , most energy is needed during the day so at night some power stations sit idle , which is not efficient .
If vast regions across multiple time zones shared their energy reserves , in theory the energy could be used more efficiently .
Available energy could move throughout a massive grid to where it ’s needed , when it ’s needed .
This would naturally require a vast expansion of existing power grids , upgrading less efficient transmission lines , and sharing across multiple political boarders .
Energy produced in Denmark could help power Paris under this scheme .
In the midst of this infrastructure upgrade / restructuring , several priorities must be implemented .
Energy conservation comes first , then energy efficiency and renewable energy .
This strategy is better because it makes the most of the technology we have today , and it provides the opportunity to improve and upgrade our ageing technology .
Building a new wind farm does n’t help if you ca n’t connect it to the grid , and even then it ’s possible that some of its clean energy will go to waste if extra energy can not be distributed to the places that need it .
Conversely , if the wind ( or sun ) are n’t available locally , you can rely on a distant source of clean , green energy .
The catch is that both plans would require an intelligent and massive political and industry push that would last years , if not decades .
To provide well - rounded points of view , guest comments from this week include the case for future technologies , and the need for continued research and innovation .
There is also an expert comment favoring nuclear power .
Reader comments also provide jewels of technical know - how and innovative ideas .
My only critique is the extra political will required for the Opposition ’s side .
Is it reasonable to believe that dozens , if not hundreds of countries would be willing to share electricity in a permeable , friendly way ?
If so , what about energy security in times of conflict or disaster ?
What happens if a natural disaster damages the grid of an entire nation ?
Or the nation ’s neighbor ?
The fact that both sides of the debate were mostly in agreement about technology playing a role now makes a potent point .
Most people , and probably most experts , agree that the question is not whether to act , or when to act , but how to act .
This debate calls for immediate planning and implementation .
That ’s why instead of disagreeing with each other over this or that solar technology , they move into differing views of how to use it now .
In fact , the debate was so amiable that some readers protested .
What ’s the point if both sides seem to be on the same side ?
Other readers , and indeed comments from Cleantechnica ’s previous post , pointed out that both strategies – technology deployment and infrastructure improvement – need to be done simultaneously .
The Debate Moderator replied that economically speaking , “ you can not spend the same dollar twice . ”
It ’s safe to assume that any given government and / or industry is not going to allocate infinite resources to a project of this scale , despite the urgency of the issue .
With finite resources it is then necessary to find the most efficient strategy to get the biggest bang for each buck – hence the “ this or that ” structure of the debate question .
So which strategy is most cost effective ?
I leave that question to you , the reader .

After receiving $ 3.5 million in January from Benchmark Capital , Engine Yard now closed a Series B financing round of $ 15 million led by New Enterprise Associates , Inc. ( NEA ) , with participation from Amazon.com and current investor Benchmark Capital .
" Engine Yard 's exceptional track record and substantial mindshare within the open - source community position the company to be at the forefront of two key emerging markets in the computing space : Ruby and Rails and cloud computing , " said NEA 's Mr. Sonsini .
" I look forward to working with the Engine Yard team to build the business and take the company to the next growth stage . "
The new funding will help Engine Yard accelerate its business , bolster R&D of their forthcoming cloud computing cluster platform , and continue to drive innovation with its Ruby open - source projects , Rubinius and Merb .
" Ruby and Rails are gaining traction in the enterprise , as companies look for alternatives to Java and .NET that would free up resources , speed up development , and get them to market faster , " said Lance Walley , Engine Yard co-founder and CEO .
" Engine Yard is committed to delivering the deployment infrastructure , services , and in - house expertise to take Ruby and Rails applications to the cloud .
We 're pleased that NEA and Amazon.com share our vision and , through their investment , have committed to helping Engine Yard execute on this vision . "
InfoQ talked to Engine Yard 's CTO Tom Mornini .
We wanted to know , if hosting will still be Engine Yard 's core business :
Hosting is very near and dear to us , as it has allowed us to understand Ruby and Rails deployment in a very intimate way .
We live Rails deployment in the cloud day to day , and that has given us very deep insight into Ruby and Rails application deployment on cloud computing architectures .
Our plan since the series A round has been to extract and generalize the knowledge and code we 've created to efficiently operate Engine Yard .
We have been , and will continue to release that code as open source software , and fully intend to offer commercial support and , perhaps , commercial software that is composed of , and / or , works in conjunction with those open source offerings .
Are there additional services planned ?
( Perhaps something like Heroku or Morph AppSpaces )
The largest item that customers purchase from us is access to our 24x7 support organization .
That organization is spread around the world and is 100 % focused on Ruby and Rails deployments .
This service ranges from environment setup , application deployment , scalability expertise , database tuning and maintenance , etc. Engine Yard is 100 % focused on providing the best set of talent and tools to allow customers to deploy their applications , as opposed to develop those applications .
What does this mean for Vertebra ?
The new funding will definitely benefit the R&D we 've been putting into Vertebra .
Watch for the official launch of Vertebra later this year .
Many pundits have recently suggested that cloud computing needs a new set of tools to harness the capabilities of the cloud .
We believe that Vertebra is an essential tool in that respect .
And what about Rubinius and Merb ?
We 'll continue to invest in these projects , certainly .
Both projects have an active committer base already .
However , while the first round of funding allowed us to accelerate development and build a solid company structure , this round of funding is intended to allow us to continue operating as we currently do .
We 're pleased that our original series A investor and new series B investors have given us a vote of confidence on our series A performance !
Any final words on the future of Engine Yard ?
“ The race is over , ” said Howard Wolfson in The New Republic online .
John McCain ’s campaign had collapsed when the Wall Street did , because most Americans believe Barack Obama is better equipped to fix the economy .
And trumping up Obama ’s relationship with ’60s radical Bill Ayers wo n’t change that reality .
The economy does n’t have to work against McCain , said Donald Lambro in The Washington Times .
He can regain the offensive by “ tearing into Obama ’s plan to raise taxes on corporations and investors at a time when businesses are struggling to survive . ”
Voters afraid of losing their jobs will see they have reason to fear the Democrats .
“ The odds are against John McCain and Sarah Palin winning this election , ” said William Kristol in The Weekly Standard online .
It 's hard to make up a six - point poll deficit in four weeks .
But if McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , can emphasize their record of reform and convince voters they ’re not offering a “ third Bush term , ” they can climb back .
McCain made that task harder by picking Palin as his No. 2 , said Tristram Korten in Salon .
Jewish voters , who could tip the crucial swing state of Florida , do n’t seem comfortable with Palin ’s level of religious conservatism .
LG Double Sided Display
Lg is showing off thier new double sided LCD display at this years IMID 2008 conference held in Goyang City , Korea .
The displays are 15 ″ and have a 14:1 contrast ratio .
From a technical standpoint this is very impressive , these are not simply two screens attached to each other , but rather the same screen displaying an image on its front and back .
Will the “ two screens , one display ” become a sensation or remain an oddity shown off at various industry shows ?
Only time and more importantly manufacturing costs will tell .
Provided LG can reign in the price of these displays there are countless scenarios where a double sided display would come on handy .
From business presentations , to retail the applications would be endless , any one up for a game of Battleship ?

A ludicrously strong pale and a ludicrously strong dark Belgian beer , taken in Ghent .
Style guidelines .
Doncha just love them ?
As homebrewers , we can see that they have their uses sometimes , if you ’re trying to recreate a specific beer , or describe what you ’ve created in terms that everyone will understand .
But the categories that exist for Belgian beers are pretty daft .
Objectively speaking , is there actually much difference between a “ Belgian Golden Strong Ale ” , and a “ triple ” , at least as defined here ?
Or even a Belgian Blond Ale ?
“ Dubbels ” and “ tripels ” are surely only relative terms , depending on which brewery makes them .
At least the idea of separate styles for “ Trappist ” beer and an “ Abbey ” beer seem to have fallen by the wayside , although you still get sweeping generalisations such as :
“ Finish is variable depending on interpretation ( authentic Trappist versions are moderately dry to dry , Abbey versions can be medium - dry to sweet ) ”
Personally , I think we should start again with Belgian beer styles .
My simpler categorisation would go as follows :
(1 ) witbiers
( 2 ) sour ones
( 3 ) fruity ones
( 4 ) boring pilsners
(5) Belgian pale ales ( you know , the ones that are n’t ludicrously strong )
( 6 ) ludicrously strong pale beers
( 7 ) ludicrously strong dark ones
Have I missed anything ?
Obviously , within these , there are some huge ranges of flavours , but that ’s the case with the guidelines as they currently stand .
My classification is also easier for the layman to understand .
Next week : having sorted beer styles , how to end world hunger .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Back in the late l950s and l960s , Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling turned his attention to studying and documenting how vitamin C could improve health status and help the human body resist and heal from disease .
His reward ?
By the time of his death in l994 , he had been branded a " quack " by a large part of the medical community .
Now , almost 25 years after his passing , not only is his research being taken more seriously but other scientists are documenting how vitamin C can be the key to preventing and treating a host of health problems .
In fact , most everyone knows vitamin C is now lauded for helping to reduce symptoms of a cold if taken in sufficient quantity when sniffles first appear .
But what you may not know is that researchers have found evidence strongly suggesting vitamin C can be used to head off some serious diseases and disorders -- and may even help you lose weight !
In fact , some of these uses for the vitamin are just plain amazing .
Yet you 'll seldom find vitamin C " prescribed " and , instead , are more likely to get drugs to treat maladies after they develop .
And the odds are , your family doctor may be clueless about these ways vitamin C can help you .
Here 's the latest on the relatively secret but very real ways vitamin C can improve your health :
Researchers in the Department of Nutrition at Arizona State University found that research subjects who had low blood concentrations of C burned a whopping 25 percent less fat than those who had plenty of the vitamin in their body .
The scientists think this may be because vitamin C is a co-factor for the biosynthesis of carnitine , a molecule your body needs to oxidize fatty acids .
They concluded inadequate vitamin C could explain why some people have such a hard time losing and keeping off excess pounds .
British scientists at the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the Institute of Public Health in Cambridge studied 515 adults with asthma and 515 matched controls .
They found that adults with symptomatic asthma had the lowest intake of fruit , especially citrus fruit , and low plasma vitamin C levels .
These findings , the scientists stated in their research paper , suggest diet may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for the development of asthma .
In the l700s , sailors found that eating limes during low sea voyages kept their gums healthy .
No doubt the vitamin C in the fruit was responsible .
Research published in theshowed that people with too little vitamin C have higher rates of periodontal disease .
Also , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) report inadequate C is associated with weakened tooth enamel as well as the painful inflammation of gums known as gingivitis .
The NIH also lists rough , dry and scaly skin as signs of too little C .
So is dry hair and even split ends .
What 's more , research published inshowed that people who ate a lot of vitamin C - rich foods had fewer wrinkles than those with inadequate amounts of the vitamin .
While we all are bombarded with ads about statins and other drugs that purport to reduce the risk of heart disease , you seldom hear about the mounting evidence a natural therapy -- vitamin C -- may protect your cardiovascular system .
A case in point : Finnish researchers published a study in thesuggesting higher doses of supplemental vitamin C cause the incidence of major coronary heart disease events like heart attacks to plummet .
So how much vitamin C do you need ?
Most experts agree that you can take large amounts , usually up two grams , safely unless an excess causes diarrhea or other stomach upset ( if that happens , simply cut back on your dose ) .
Vitamin C is not stored in the body so toxicity is very rare .
To increase the C in your diet , eat more green peppers , citrus fruits and juices , strawberries , papayas , mangos , watermelons , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , cabbage , winter squash , red peppers , raspberries , blueberries , cranberries , tomatoes , broccoli , turnip greens and other leafy greens , sweet and white potatoes , pineapples and cantaloupes .

THINGEYRI , Iceland -- Kristjan Davidsson went to sea as a deckhand at 16 .
At fisheries college he aspired to be a boat captain .
For two decades , he sold fish and fish - processing equipment .
Like his father , and practically everyone in this remote village , he owed his living to the fish his country pulled from the ocean .
But in 2001 Mr. Davidsson got bored .
He joined one of Iceland 's newly privatized banks .
He got rich .
Now , he says , it looks like it 's back to fish .
That may be true for this nation 's fortunes as a whole .

Reading through an excellent 2005 paper by Ferraro , Pfeffer and Sutton * on the way that social science theories in general , and economic theories in particular , can make themselves true when previously they were not , I came across a fabulous social psychology article they cited .
The 1981 article , Economists Free Ride , Does Anyone Else ? , by Marwell and Ames ( M&A ) analyzes the results of 11 different variations on a single experiment involving the provisioning of a public good .
The experiment was designed to maximize the likelihood of free riding – participants were given detailed explanation several times about the options for the investment of a small amount of tokens ( worth a few pennies each , depending on the experiment ) into either a collective or individual fund , such that investing 100 % into the collective fund produced the maximal total payout .
M&A then asked 6 economists and 1 sociologist to make predictions , and to verify that the experimental design conformed nicely to the classic free rider problem .
The economists willing to make predictions mostly agreed that the problem conformed to the strong version of the free rider hypothesis , and thus theory predicted 0 % investment in the public fund , but they personally predicted between 0 and 20 % investment in the public fund .
M&A ran this experiment on various groups of high school students ( by mail and phone , with different variations allowing for feedback , higher stakes , etc. ) and some college students .
In almost all cases , participants contributed around 40 - 50 % .
Raising the stakes decreased this amount a little – to 35 % probably .
Decreasing the group size ( i.e. telling participants that only 3 other people were investing in the fund ) increased participation somewhat .
Interestingly , telling participants that the collective good was going to be something nondivisible ( spending the collective fund money on the common area of a floor , for entering college freshmen in the example ) doubled contributions to about 80 % , despite theoretical predictions that this sort of collective good would be less valuable than simply getting money , and thus would reduce contributions .
Only one group reacted very differently to the experimental conditions : first - year economics graduate students .
They contributed , on average , 20 % to the collective fund and many more tried to free ride completely .
The experimenters additionally asked the participants about fairness , in particular , whether they took fairness into account when making their decisions , and what they thought a fair contribution was .
Most though around 50 % was a fair contribution , and there was some correlation between the amount people thought was fair and what they actually contributed .
However , “ More than one third of the economics graduate students either refused to answer the question regarding what is fair , or gave very complex , uncodable responses .
It seems that the meaning of ‘ fairness ’ in this context was somewhat alien for this group . ”
The questions remain though : why do people give the amount they do ?
100 % would be socially optimal , 0 % is the prediction of the classic version of the free - rider paradox .
Feedback mechanisms ( where participants had two opportunities to invest , and got to see each others ’ behavior in between ) had little or no impact , suggesting against Elster ’s conditional altruism hypothesis ( though that could be explored more ) .
Why close to half ?
Why any ?
And are economists such free riders because they ’ve been taught that way , or did they become economists because of their existing preferences ?
This last question is taken up a bit in , amongst other places , Carter and Irons ( 1991 ) article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives , Are Economists Different , and If So , Why ? , tries to tackle precisely this question by running similar experiments ( well , actually a variation of the ultimatum game ) on freshmen and seniors in economics and other disciplines .
C&I found small but significant differences between econ students and non-econ students , but did not find that those differences came from learning economics – senior econ students actually kept less money than freshmen .
The more interesting finding to me – in line with M&A – is that the econ students were not all that far from their peers , and were quite far from the predictions , “ It seems even economists sometimes fall short of behavior expected of all good homines economici . ”
I love the language of that sentence – that this rational , self - interested , infinitely calculating , atomistic person is some sort of ideal from which even its most devout adherents fall short .
I ’m sure there ’s been plenty more evidence generated in the last 15 - 20 years on the subject of the effects of learning economics , and I am pretty sure some of these studies have reported significant findings for the learning effect , not just the selection effect .
When I get a bit more time , perhaps I ’ll track some down ( maybe in Stephen Marglin ’s new book , The Dismal Science : How Thinking Like an Economist Undermines Community , which I have not yet tracked down a copy of ) .
To return to Ferraro , Pfeffer and Sutton – it certainly does seem that the free rider problem is an example of an economic model that does not accurately describe most situations ( at least in its strong version ) , but M&A ’s study does not really support the hypothesis that studying economics leads to enacting the principle – econ grad students may have already been less inclined to provision public goods before they ever took up the subject , and M&A do not try to claim otherwise .
I think that point is very much elided in the FPS paper , in its discussion of both M&A and C&I , which reserves the discussion of the learning hypothesis ( which is not supported in the C&I study , nor even in play in M&A ) for other work .
I still very much want to argue that ideas matter , but I want better data , that ’s all .
* Economic Language and Assumptions : How Theories Can Become Self - Fulfilling , in the Academy of Management Review .
Today sees the return to the House of Lords of the contentious issue of extending to 42 days the time someone can be held by the police without being charged .
I would have wanted to take part in the debate , though unavoidably I will be absent overseas .
My view is that this pernicious provision should be removed from this bill now .
I regard it as not only unnecessary but also counterproductive ; and we should fight to protect the liberties the terrorists would take from us , not destroy them ourselves .
This proposal is wrong in principle and dangerous in practice .
During my time as attorney general I studied the issue of how long suspects can be held before being charged , and was closely involved with a number of the terrorist plots with which the bill is designed to deal .
I had been a solitary voice in government in questioning 90 days .
I am confident that it is a wrong - headed and dangerous approach to extend still further the time for pre-trial detention .
It is now hard to find anyone outside the ranks of government who regards this as a sensible proposal .
It has been rejected by two former directors of MI5 ; the experience of prosecutors is that 28 days is sufficient ; it has been condemned by former attorneys general , lord chancellors and senior police officers .
In the House of Lords , eminent speaker after speaker spoke against it , cataloguing its faults and dangers .
It is unnecessary , unworkable , a constitutional muddle and an easy propaganda coup for the extremist radicalisers .
There is now no public support from the police .
Last week former assistant commissioner Andy Hayman , one of the most senior officers to have dealt with anti-terrorism and one of the original proponents of the 90 - day plan , revealed that the police do not support the proposal .
He says that it is unworkable because of the procedures the government had to put in place to buy support in the Commons .
It is particularly unfortunate that a Labour government has been so committed to this .
There are other things that would improve our prospects of prosecuting and convicting terrorists and on which we could better spend energy and time : in particular , to allow prosecutors to use evidence from eavesdropped communications .
Among our allies , we alone do not allow intercept evidence ( though Britain does allow it if the interception was by someone other than our own state agencies ) .
Of course , if this were to be allowed , there would have to be safeguards to protect secret sources of information .
But there is , I believe , a way of doing this .
If only the government had used the effort it has spent on trying to force 42 days past sceptical and unwilling parliamentarians , on polishing the plans to allow intercept into evidence , we would be making a really useful contribution to tackling terrorism .
I too want to support the party and its leadership .
But in the long run , Labour 's reputation for decent values will be seriously tarnished if we force through an unnecessary and draconian restriction on liberty .
The timing of this vote is especially telling .
Both presidential candidates in the US have said that they will shut Guantánamo Bay .
We are about to see some of the most visible and wrong practices of the " war on terror " come to an end .
So , right at the moment that the US would be turning decisively against such draconian anti-terrorist laws , a Labour government could have the shameful distinction of being the last to enact a reviled piece of law that undermines the fundamental values of our society .
Forty - two days should be consigned decisively to the bin .
The house has the chance to do that today .

Grammar just ain't what it used to be , it seems .
When we explained the difference between " fewer " and " less than " , following Tesco 's policy shift on this matter , readers told us what grammar rules they see being flouted or find confusing .
The list was a long one .
Here are the best .
1 . The one that really annoys me is how people suddenly seem to confuse " have " and " of " , as in : " I could of learnt how to write properly . "
There 's no excuse for it !
Pete , Sheffield 2 .
The phrase " for free " is becoming commonplace and is used often on television and it's wrong .
It should be " for nothing " .
Mary , Basingstoke 3 . That guardian of our language , the BBC , is full of solecisms these days ; just one example : 12 pm .
There is no such time ; " meridiem " as in am ( " ante meridiem " means " before noon " ) and pm ( " post meridiem " means " after noon " ) means midday .
The 12th hour is neither before nor after midday .
So please , BBC use either midday or noon with midnight the correct term for the other end of the day .
This is not being pedantic ; in these days of 24 - hour days , it is often not readily apparent what time 12 pm might be .
Mervyn , Usk , Monmouthshire 4 .
If you do something to change a situation , then you " effect " a change .
If your circumstances are changed by an action , then the change has caused an " effect " .
You cannot " affect " a change in something , nor can you be " effected " by one .
Rob , Lyme Regis 5 .
I get annoyed at the reckless use of apostrophes , for example , the plural of CD can't be CD's .
Shahed Alam , London 6 .
Many people , including public speakers , incorrectly use " I " instead of " me " .
For instance , they would say " She said some very kind things about George and I " , thinking that they are being polite or grammatically correct .
An easy way to remember which to use is : if you would say him or her on its own , use me ; if you would say he or she on its own , use I .
For example , " She said some very kind things about him " .
Lorraine , Aylesbury 7 .
Incorrect use of reflexives make my blood boil .
I think that for someone to say " yourself " and " myself " when they just mean " you " or " me " is possibly out of a false sense of politeness , or maybe the insidious effect of TV soaps , or both .
Those who use it correctly can give " themselves " a pat on the back .
John Self , Wisset , Suffolk 8 .
How about " none of them is " and " none of them are " ?
Most people would use the latter whereas the former is correct .
" None " is short for " not one " therefore " not one ( none ) of them is " would be used .
Most newsreaders still get it right though - on the BBC anyway !
Emily , Bristol NOTE : Fowler 's Modern English
Usage says that " none " is not short for " not one " and although using a singular verb is more common , using a plural verb has also been an acceptable option since the reign of King Alfred .
9 . Similar TO , different FROM , compared WITH .
Not " to " used for all of them !
Susan , Brisbane , Australia NOTE : Fowler 's Modern English
Usage says : " The commonly expressed view that ' different ' should only be followed by ' from ' and never by ' to ' or ' than ' is not supportable in the face of past and present evidence or of logic . "
It adds that " compare to " is to liken and " compare with " or " compare to " is used to point out similarities and differences .
The BBC News website style guide differs with Fowler 's on this last point .
It says that when pointing out differences , " compare with " should always be used .
10 .
Here 's one they often get wrong on BBC news !
BBC reporter : " Then they opened fire on us " .
This is incorrect .
In military terms there are two methods of shooting at an enemy , controlled - fire and open - fire .
I.E. you are not opening anything so using the past tense of open is incorrect .
The correct expression should be " Then they open - fired on us "
JWTH , Belfast 11 .
I find the increasing , incorrect use of " literally " annoying ....
" I literally went blue with anger ! ! " " Really ? " I ask .
Ned , Wallingford 12 .
The proper use of " its " and " it 's " seems to confound many people , with " its " being a possessive and " it's " being a contraction of " it is " .
I 've seen this mistake made even in some rather lofty publications ...
Eric , Berlin 13 .
It annoys me when people use " due to " when they mean " owing to " .
But then I 'm a pedant .
Guy , London NOTE : The BBC News website style guide says " due to " means " caused by " and needs a noun , but " owing to " means " because of " and relates to a verb .
Hence , " the visit was cancelled [ cancelled is the verb ] owing to flooding " is correct .
So too is " the flooding [ flooding is the noun ] was due to weeks of heavy rain " .
14 .
As a secondary teacher , I 'm beginning to despair when it comes to " they 're " , " there " and " their " ; not to mention " to " , " two " and " too " .
Why are we so afraid to correct these simple mistakes which make all the difference at a later stage ?
Alexandra , London 15 .
There is also confusion over lend and borrow .
I keep hearing school children asking " to lend your pencil " when what they actually mean is to " borrow " the pencil .
Ian Walton , Bedford 16 .
I cringe when I hear BBC reporters say " amount of people " when it should be " number of people " !
Jill Thistlethwaite , Leyburn , UK NOTE : Fowler 's says " amount " is used with nouns that are not countable , such as " amount of forgiveness " and " amount of glue " - but " number " is used with countable nouns , such as " number of boys " and " number of houses " .
17 . I do n't like it when people say : I can go there " by foot " instead of " on foot " .... the right preposition to use is ON .
Daniela , Urbana , IL 18 .
The usage that I find particularly irritating is that of a single noun with a plural verb , for example : " the team are happy with their victory " , or " management have congratulated the workforce on the recent increase in productivity " .
Team is a singular noun so it should read " the team IS happy ... " or " the team members ARE happy " , the same applies " management HAS congratulated ... "
Also , what has happened to the word " versus " , abbreviated " vs " ?
Now all we see is " v " ; it is even read like that in sports announcements .
Lucia , Horndean , UK NOTE : The BBC News website 's style is that sports teams and pop / rock bands are always plural .
19 .
A classic confusing rule is the one that states that one is supposed never to end a sentence with a preposition .
While this is easy and appropriate to follow in most cases , for example by saying " Yesterday I visited the town to which she has just moved " instead of " ... the town she has just moved to " , it becomes troublesome when the verb structure includes a preposition that cannot be removed from it , as in " At work I am using a new computer with which my manager recently set me up " , which cannot correctly be changed to " ... I am using a new computer up with which my manager recently set me " .
Philip Graves , Stockholm , Sweden 20 .
Stadiums , as a plural of stadium , rather than stadia .
C. Matthews , Birmingham , UK NOTE : Fowler 's says that when dealing with modern sports grounds , rather than ones from the classical world , the plural is " stadiums " .

What are these ?
Herbert Hoover converted a mundane recession into the greatest economic disaster in modern history the Great Depression .
Unfortunately for all of us , George W. Bush is headed down that same path .
Periodic recessions are the necessary price for the bountiful harvest of the capitalist system .
People and businesses are not perfect , and supply and demand get out of whack every so often .
If there is no interference from government , in time , the market will right itself back to equilibrium .
Because supply temporarily exceeds demand , wages , prices , business investment must drop to restore equilibrium .
However , since Hoovers time ironically partly because of the monstrous economic catastrophe that he wrought Americans expect the government to come galloping to the rescue in any economic slowdown .
Somehow they expect the government to be more perfect than the admittedly imperfect market after all , the private sector has gone askew .
Yet because the government is gambling with other peoples money and private businesses are using their own , markets , rather than bureaucrats , usually make better economic decisions .
Presidents , legislatures , and the public in the 19th century recognized these facts and did not expect the government to interfere in the economy in vain attempts to correct economic problems .
They knew that the market would self - correct as it always had .
Today , Americans routinely expect politicians to make the economys ailments better and bail out businesses and citizens for bad economic decisions an expectation created by Woodrow Wilsons massive government meddling in the U.S. economy during World War I and Hoovers and his successor Franklin Delano Roosevelts ( FDRs ) interventions later on .
Thus , in that spirit , the conventional wisdom nowadays is that too little was done by Hoover about the economic downturn until FDR saved the day with massive government intervention .
In fact , Hoover did too much about the recession and things went downhill from there .
Instead of letting wages , prices , and investment fall to restore equilibrium in the market , Hoover pushed businesses to keep wages and investment high , despite falling demand for their products .
He created public works programs that also kept wages artificially high and signed a draconian hike in tariffs that declared economic warfare on the world .
But most important , Hoover flooded the market with credit even though excessive increases in the money supply mostly during predecessor Calvin Coolidges one - and - a - half terms had created conditions in which businesses had been tricked into a sense of false prosperity and thus had undertaken excessive investment .
The reduction of that bad investment had led to the recession in the first place .
Now Hoover was trying to artificially pump up the economy , which made the inevitable economic malaise even more dire .
FDR then came into office and continued Hoovers government intervention into the marketplace on a massive scale .
The market was never allowed to right itself until resources were returned from the public to the private sector after World War II ended ; only then was prosperity restored .
The same mistake by Hoover is being repeated now .
Initially , Alan Greenspan followed the laudable tight monetary policies of Paul Volcker appointed by Jimmy Carter and responsible for the prosperity of the Reagan years after an initial recession and assisted in the prosperity of the Clinton years .
Toward the end of his tenure at the Federal Reserve , however , Greenspan began to sow the seeds of the current crisis by providing more cash to the economy .
Ben Bernanke has continued this ill - advised monetary expansion .
In an economy already flush with cash , the government is worried that people and businesses wont get enough credit to spend the economy out of its doldrums ; it is now socializing or bailing out the financial institutions that made bad loans and is buying up bad debt itself to pump up the credit markets .
This massive artificial infusion of cash into the economy at the possible staggering cost of $ 2.3 trillion ( approximately the budget of the gargantuan federal government for an entire year ) provides welfare to the wealthy and makes it that much harder for the market to right itself .
In other words , government action may very well have turned a sluggish economy into a catastrophic tailspin , ala Hoover and FDR .
But at this point , the deed is done and the market will just have to struggle to right itself .
We can now just refer to Washington as Hooverville .
Unfortunately , U.S. government intervention into the market has shamed other countries into bailing out their own financial sectors , probably spreading this cataclysm to other nations .
But governments should avoid further bailouts or well end up in a depression that could last years .
You might remember some months ago that I posted a proof - of - concept plasma plugin for Mozilla Firefox on Linux .
Well , a lot of tweaking later , we can now see a wide assortment of clocks in Mozilla Firefox on another platform ( no prizes for guessing which one ) .
The most time consuming part of getting this up and running on Windows was actually just getting KDE compiled in the first place ( emerge hates me ) .
After that , it took about 10 lines of code and a few tweaks to CMakeLists .
txt and it works .
Well , I say it works , but if I were more honest I ’d say I managed to get the clocks to appear once out of many attempts in Firefox , and to grab a quick screenshot before I started trying to interact with them and brought everything crashing down .
So , if you want to try this out yourself , be warned : you ’ll need a lot of patience to do all the tweaking needed to get it working , and then it ’ll still eat your babies .
Source code is in the same git repository as last time .

When I blogged about this originally , there were lots of comments from people worrying about the security implications .
I ’d like to write about that in more detail , but I do n’t have enough time , so it will have to wait for another day .
For now I ’ll just point out one thing : it is only a proof - of - concept at this stage .
Obviously if this ever becomes a finished product , there will be security in place to stop plasmoids from the web interacting with your local computer in inappropriate ways – it will not work like Microsoft ’s ActiveX , but much more like Adobe Flash .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - The Australian government has issued its first license allowing scientists to create cloned human embryos to try and obtain embryonic stem cells .

The in vitro-fertilization firm Sydney IVF was granted the license and reportedly has access to 7,200 human eggs for its research .
If the firm is successful it would be a world first , the Australian government ’s National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC ) , which granted the license , said on Wednesday .
Scientists in other countries have made stem cells they believe are similar to embryonic cells using a variety of techniques , but none have been able to extract embryonic stem cells from cloned human embryos .
An Australian ban on the research , known as therapeutic cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer , was lifted in December 2006 after a rare conscience vote in the national parliament .
But the use of excess IVF embryos and the creation and use of other embryos in research is restricted by law through national legislation .
Human cloning for reproductive purposes is banned .
Chair of the NHMRC ’s licensing committee , Dr John Findlay , said Sydney IVF ’s research would be closely monitored .
“ They have been given a license to do therapeutic cloning , ” Findlay told Reuters , adding the scientists are not licensed to reach the fetal stage .
“ They can go to the stage called blastocyst .
They must stop at that point , ” he said .
The blastocyst is a very early - stage embryo not yet implanted into the womb .
Findlay said scientists will try and create stem cells from patients who have abnormalities or create stem cell lines which will be compatible with patients which have given the cells .
Initially , any stem cells extracted would be used to test new drugs to fight diseases such as muscular dystrophy and Huntington ’s disease , and later therapeutic cloning would be used to produce body tissue matched to patients .
The director of Australians for Ethical Stem Cell Research , David van Gend , criticized the issuing of the license , saying new technology meant cloning was no longer necessary .
“ We have regulations in Australia such that the abuses of cloning would n’t happen here , we will not get live birth cloning , ” he told local radio .
“ We wo n’t get cloning right through to the fetal stage in order to use them for organ transplants , but if we teach the world how to clone you can be quite sure it will be used in less rigorous jurisdictions . ”
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique in which DNA from the nucleus of an unfertilized egg is removed and replaced with the nucleus of an adult cell such as a skin cell .
The technique can be used to create cloned embryos in order to derive embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes , but can also be used for reproductive cloning .
There are several types of stem cells .
Embryonic stem cells , made from days - old embryos , are considered the most powerful because they can give rise to all the cell types in the body .
Sydney IVF said only eggs that were unusable for IVF because they were immature or had not been fertilized properly , and which donors had given consent for , would be used in the research .
The firm said it will use three different types of cells , embryonic stem cells , cumulus cells attached to the collected eggs , and skin cells , to produce the cloned embryos .
Sydney IVF was the first , in 2004 , to extract stem cells from Australian IVF embryos , and has since extracted and grown 10 more colonies of embryonic stem cells this way .

The Environmental Protection Agency has released an interactive Google Earth - based database which pinpoints energy development opportunities on contaminated properties .
According to Biofuels Digest , the EPA ’s site shows opportunities for solar , wind and biomass benefits , by combining Google Earth visuals with the database list of places that show promise for progress .
The “ Renewable Energy on Contaminated Land and Mining Sites ” Web page gives interested parties tools to see what ’s possible and where .
For example , someone interested in building a community wind farm might want to view the “ EPA Tracked Sites with Community Wind Energy Generation Potential ” map .
The U. S. map briefly explains the associated criteria — e.g. size ( 100 - 1,999 acres ) and distance to graded roads ( 25 miles or less ) — and shows seven power classes based on amount of wind at any given point .
The map is color coded based on those classifications for resource potential .
Why Develop Contaminated Lands ?
The EPA provides a fairly bulky list , explaining its opinion on why this idea to develop contaminated lands is worthwhile .
Here is one of their points :
“ There are approximately 480,000 sites and almost 15 million acres of potentially contaminated properties across the United States that are tracked by EPA .
Cleanup goals have been achieved and controls put in place to ensure long - term protection for more than 850,000 acres .
This leaves open many potential opportunities to develop renewable energy facilities on these sites , and coordination and partnerships among federal , state tribal and other government agencies , utilities , the private sector and communities , will only help advance renewable energy production . ”
Advantages of the EPA ’s Google Earth Tool
The EPA describes and bullet - points several advantages it feels users can gain from this new , Web - based tool :
“ This tool makes it possible to view EPA ’s information about siting renewable energy on contaminated land and mining sites alongside other information contained in Google Earth .
Furthermore , detailed information about each site is available in addition to the site ’s location .
By clicking on a dot associated with a site , you can view :

They may not have raped and pillaged , but “ Viking ” mice conquered the outer reaches of the British Isles all the same .
Rodents living in Wales , Scotland and Ireland can trace their ancestry to Norwegian house mice , presumably stowaways on Viking ships .
Because grain - eating house mice – Mus musculus domesticus – depend on dense human populations , they serve as a reliable proxy for human settlement and migration , says Jeremy Searle , an evolutionary biologist at the University of York , UK , who led the new study .
“ It ’s just a completely different angle to look at and potentially add new pieces of evidence that historians and archaeologists can use , ” he says .
Advertisement
The discovery that mice made the journey to the northern and western British Isles at the time of the Vikings is n’t much of a surprise in itself .
The Orkney Islands served as a major Norwegian Viking settlement in the 11th and 12th centuries , and rodents probably sailed between Scandinavia and Scotland .
Earlier settlers
What surprised Searle ’s team was the difference in mitochondrial DNA from these “ Viking ” mice and those recovered in other parts of Britain .
When they examined the ancestry of rodents from elsewhere in the British Isles , they found a link to Bronze Age human migrations , beginning about 2300 BC .
This probably means that the Vikings were the first humans to live densely enough in Scotland and Ireland to support house mice , Searle says .
“ If a place is empty of mice the first that come are the winners , ” agrees François Bonhomme , an evolutionary biologist at Montpelier University , France , not involved in the study .
“ One boat with three mice – that ’s sufficient to start a population . ”
Other such human and house mice populations should prove more interesting and enlightening , Searle says .
“ Now that we ’ve got a Viking mouse , if you like , we can actually focus on much more specific aspects of Viking history . ”
For instance , mice could solve two puzzles about the settlement of Iceland .
Some historians think that Iceland was home to multiple Viking settlements , each with a different home base in the Viking kingdom , a contention that mice could bolster .
Also , the Hebrides may have served as a pit stop from Norway to Iceland , where Viking men picked up women for second leg .
This theory might be confirmed if DNA from Icelandic mice most closely matches that of Hebridean mice .

Genetics – Keep up with the pace in our continually updated special report .
It is hard , sometimes , to remember that I do n't have a vote in the US election .
The media coverage is constant , my Twitter feed is full of it , and it is all that the blogs I read seem to be interested in - even the non-political ones .
While Peter Mandelson is being brought into British government for the third time , the US political scene seems to dazzle with its array of new faces and new personalities .
Barack Obama 's inspirational idealism and John McCain 's time spent as a prisoner of war make our politicians look a little grey and ordinary .
And then there 's Sarah Palin , who can see Russia from her house .
I am someone who really would like to see more women in government , but Palin makes me cringe every time I hear about her .
Dan Quayle 's repeated gaffes - and who can forget his gnomic remarks and inability to spell potato ?
- simply made many think that he was an intellectual lightweight .
But it 's hard not to worry that some people might see Palin 's mistakes as a reflection on the intelligence of women in general .
From her rambling and incomprehensible answers to simple questions , to her inability to define the Bush doctrine , to her apparent unwillingness to name a single newspaper she reads , her performance seems constantly to support the charge that she is simply not ready to become vice - president of the US .
Interestingly , Jed Lewison , writing in the Huffington Post on October 1 , dug up footage of Palin performing in debates on Alaskan issues in which she acquitted herself well , suggesting that she might simply have been brought up through the party ranks too quickly rather than that she 's entirely incompetent .
And although I 'd rather see a hard - hitting intellectual woman on either ticket , it has to be said that Palin has n't sunk McCain 's campaign .
Of course it's hard for British people to understand why anyone would vote for McCain / Palin .
Our political consensus is to the left even of the Democratic Party .
For example , even Obama is n't suggesting that the US bring in socialised medicine on the scale of the NHS .
But for many centrist voters in America , the desire to vote in more leftwing leaders may be outweighed by other considerations .
On a recent visit to the US , I met one or two of that rare breed of American voter whose existence I had previously considered merely a myth : centrists who want to elect a woman candidate , would have voted for Hillary Clinton if she 'd been running , but are now intending to vote Republican because Palin is on the ticket .
What is this about ?
One explanation is the classic " ice - cream vendors on a beach " model of the two - party system taught to first - year politics undergraduates .
This model , first conceived by Harold Hotelling and later developed by Anthony Downs , explains why political parties tend to move closer to one another .
Imagine a long stretch of beach , with people evenly distributed along its length .
Two ice - cream vendors set up their carts on the beach , one at the exact midpoint of the right - hand side of the beach , the other at the exact midpoint of the left - hand side .
They both attract all the customers who are closer to them than to the other vendor ; 50 % each of the market .
But if one vendor moves closer to the middle of the beach , they keep the customers at the extreme end of the beach , but also gain a few of the " centrist " customers .
In order to gain back the lost ground , the other vendor also has to move toward the middle of the beach .
Applying this model to politics suggests that in a two - party system political parties will tend to move closer together over time , both ending up near the median point of voter sympathies .
In practice , this would mean that , over time , there is less and less to choose between the political parties .
If their policies are often practically identical , the only thing to choose between the candidates may be their religion , ethnicity , gender or sexuality .
This would lead to an increasing emphasis on identity politics .
But , although the UK may have been getting closer to an equilibrium of this sort over the past 15 years , the US certainly is n't there .
On the Iraq war , taxes , healthcare and the environment , McCain and Obama have made their policy differences clear ; it 's hard to imagine that anyone would feel they were too close together to decide between .
Another possible explanation of the increasing importance of identity politics that occurs to me is the decline of trust in politicians .
In a survey carried out in 1964 , about 75 % of Americans said that they trusted the federal government .
More recently , surveys have shown that around 75 % of Americans now do not trust their government .
Perhaps people were simply too naive 40 years ago , or perhaps we 're too cynical now .
One conclusion is clear to me , though : if you can't trust politicians to keep their promises , then policy statements lose some of their force to motivate the voter .
If you believe that politicians will simply break their election promises , then what 's left as a rational way to choose between them ?
The rationale goes that , if elected , a McCain / Palin ticket might or might not actually follow through on any of their policies , but Palin will still - in all probability - remain a woman .
For those who feel it would be an important breakthrough to have a woman in the office of vice - president , this is one campaign commitment she can hardly help but keep .

Microscopic particles in polluted air can adversely affect the heart 's ability to conduct electrical signals in people with serious coronary artery disease , researchers reported in Circulation : Journal of the American Heart Association .
In a recent study of 48 Boston - area patients , all of whom had coronary artery disease , 24 - hour Holter monitors were used to examine electrocardiograms for the conductivity change called an ST - segment depression , which may indicate inadequate blood flow to the heart or inflamed heart muscle .
The average 24 - hour levels for all pollutants included in the analysis were below accepted or proposed National Air Quality Standard thresholds , meaning patients were breathing air considered healthy .
" We found that an elevation in fine particles , from non-traffic as well as traffic sources , and black carbon , a marker for traffic , predicted ST - segment depression , " said Diane R. Gold , M.D. , M.P.H. , the study 's senior author and an associate professor of medicine and environmental health at Harvard University in Boston , Mass .
" Effects were greatest within the first month after hospitalization , and for patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack or had diabetes . "
Previous studies have documented that exposure to road traffic can trigger heart attacks , and that particulate air pollution increases the risk for cardiac death or heart attack .
" When coal sales were banned in Dublin , Ireland , and black smoke concentrations declined by 70 percent within the next 72 months , cardiovascular deaths fell by 10 percent , " said Gold , citing a study published in 2002 .
The ST - segment changes Gold observed were not associated with symptoms in these patients , all of whom had experienced in - hospital procedures to examine or open up their coronary arteries .
Nevertheless , the findings expand the evidence that air pollution can affect heart health , either through inflaming the heart muscle or through reducing blood flow to the heart .
It suggests the need for greater vigilance by physicians and heart patients in the weeks after discharge from the hospital , researchers said .
The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend that some heart patients , particularly those who have had a heart attack , delay driving for two to three weeks after leaving the hospital and avoid driving in heavy traffic because of the stress it creates .
" Our study provides additional rationale to avoid or reduce heavy traffic exposure after discharge , even for those without a heart attack , since traffic exposure involves pollution exposure as well as stress , " she said .
The study 's 48 participants had been hospitalized for either a heart attack , unstable angina or worsening symptoms of stable coronary artery disease .
Their median age was 57 years , 81 percent were male , 40 percent had suffered a heart attack and 25 percent had diabetes .
Researchers visited the patients two to four weeks after their discharge , and then three more times at approximately three - month intervals .
At each visit , a portable electrocardiograph called a Holter monitor recorded the patients ' heart activity for 24 hours .
All participants were monitored on the first visit , and 35 had monitoring on more than one visit .
Researchers averaged monitor readings over each half - hour , providing 5,979 half - hour observations .
They then examined the relation of these ECG measurements with levels of several pollutants , including black carbon , produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels , and particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) of less than 2.5 micrometers ( about 1/10,000th of an inch ) in diameter .
Researchers obtained the PM2.5 and black carbon readings at a Harvard School of Public Health monitoring site , an average distance of 10.9 miles from the participants ' homes .
Among the study 's findings :
-- Increased levels of particular pollution – PM2.5 and black carbon ( a marker for traffic exhaust ) – were associated with ST - segment depression in the study participants .
-- Sulfur dioxide , a pollutant that can have non-traffic sources , also was associated with ST - segment depression .
--
No significant correlation was found between ST - segment depression and increased levels of carbon monoxide , but levels of this pollutant were low in this study .
-- Patients recovering from a heart attack had greater changes in ST segment depression on electrocardiograms compared to other participants .
The key question remains – how breathing air polluted by PM2.5 and black carbon might cause ST segment depression .
" Further research is needed to evaluate whether the pollution - related ST - segment depression that we see is related to increased heart muscle inflammation , reduced oxygen flow , oxidative stress , or increased risk of arrhythmias , " Gold said .
" We think that our findings , which are definitely subclinical , may represent a process that increases clinical risk for people with symptomatic coronary artery disease , " she said .

“ Have an exit strategy , ” Johnson remembers his grandfather telling him when he was a 22 - year - old NBA newcomer .
The advice took .
Johnson , who had majored in political science at Berkeley , passed the long hours of travel reading books and policy papers while his teammates played cards and video games .
After his first season with the Suns , he returned to Oak Park , the gritty neighborhood where he ’d grown up , to establish his exit strategy : a nonprofit education organization called St. Hope Academy , which began as a portable classroom within his alma mater of Sacramento High School .
Even as his NBA career progressed , Johnson became fluent in the language of policy entrepreneurs , salting his conversation with terms like holistic community development and personalized learning .
A born networker , he traded on his celebrity to meet business and political luminaries wherever he traveled .
When he retired from the Phoenix Suns , in 2000 , both the Republicans and the Democrats asked him to run for governor of Arizona .
Johnson demurred , choosing instead to put into practice what he ’d learned about the power of business to transform urban areas .
In 2003 , St. Hope took over Sacramento High , turning it into a charter school .
In keeping with the precepts of “ holistic ” development — essentially , that urban renewal requires a web of education , business , arts , and housing — his organization took over an adjacent property , refurbishing the handsome Guild Theater and adding a gallery , a bookstore , and , after Johnson placed a call to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz , a roomy coffeehouse that bustled with customers the afternoon we swept through on an impromptu tour .
Of particular excitement to Johnson , because they sprang up independently of St. Hope , are new row houses just down the block .
Johnson spotted the architect and , though we were running late , jogged over to say hi , beaming at what he saw : barbecuing on the sidewalk before us were half a dozen 30 - ish hipsters , urban pioneers who promised renewal .
Officially , Johnson ’s mayoral campaign centers on public safety , better schools , and economic development , particularly of Sacramento ’s riverfront , which he believes could rival those he visited as a ballplayer in San Antonio , Chicago , and Washington .
But his greatest appeal is that he exhibits that most useful of mayoral traits , an easygoing familiarity with the full menagerie of urban life , from black teenagers to white developers .
To this , he adds a quality as common to good politicians as it is rare among pro athletes : eager solicitude for the opinions of others .
Sometimes this has amusing consequences .
At evening ’s end , Johnson was the honored guest at a meeting of Hmong businessmen — a gathering over which the 6 - foot - 1 - inch Johnson towered , much as most NBA players once towered over him .
He talked briefly before opening the floor .
For an hour he charmed and bantered ( when necessary , through an interpreter ) , and he was getting ready to call it a night when he was hit with the kind of question every politician dreads , the kind you ca n’t possibly prepare for .
Traditional Hmong shamanism involves the sacrifice of live animals , typically in the home , a practice that had resulted in a felony arrest .
What was his position on animal sacrifice ?
Kim Kardashian Plays Nursemaid to Hospitalized Reggie Bush
New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush injured his knee in Sunday 's game against the Carolina Panthers .
Instead of heading to London with his team , he headed to a hospital to undergo knee surgery .
His lady love , Kim Kardashian has been at his bedside tending to his needs while he recuperates .
The Saints boarded a plane for a weekend game in Europe against the San Diego Chargers .
Kim had planned to accompany her man on this road trip ' across the pond ' until disaster struck .
She updated her blog this morning with the following message to her fans :
" I was supposed to be in London right now with Reggie but we had to cancel our trip .
All that matters is that Reggie is going to be okay !
He 's pretty bummed that the special birthday he planned in London could n't happen but as long as he is okay , I will have the best birthday ever !!!! "
We wish Reggie a speedy recover and send out best wishes to Kim as well .
Happy Birthday !

Barack Obama does not say much about his years in New York City .
The time he spent as an undergraduate at Columbia College and then working in Manhattan in the early 1980s surfaces only fleetingly in his memoir .
In the book , he casts himself as a solitary wanderer in the metropolis , the outsider searching for a way to “ make myself of some use . ”
He tells of underheated sublets , a night spent in an alley , a dead neighbor on the landing .
From their fire escape , he and an unnamed roommate watch “ white people from the better neighborhoods ” bring their dogs to defecate on the block .
He takes a job in an unidentified “ consulting house to multinational corporations , ” where he is “ a spy behind enemy lines , ” startled to find himself with a secretary , a suit and money in the bank .
He barely mentions Columbia , training ground for the elite , where he transferred in his junior year , majoring in political science and international relations and writing his thesis on Soviet nuclear disarmament .
He dismisses in one sentence his first community organizing job — work he went on to do in Chicago — though a former supervisor remembers him as “ a star performer . ”
Senator Obama , an Illinois Democrat now seeking the presidency , suggests in his book that his years in New York were a pivotal period :
He ran three miles a day , buckled down to work and “ stopped getting high , ” which he says he had started doing in high school .
Yet he declined repeated requests to talk about his New York years , release his Columbia transcript or identify even a single fellow student , co-worker , roommate or friend from those years .

Author of The Unthinkable : Who Survives When Disaster Strikes - and Why
The Asian tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history
If it seems like disasters are getting more common , it is because they are .
Over the past 50 years , human beings have moved into more places that were never meant to be inhabited by our species .
We have built large , vertical cities near water , stripping the earth of natural protection and leaving us more vulnerable to all kinds of trouble .
At the same time , we have learned to forecast storms days before they arrive , and we can ( with enough money ) build sophisticated tsunami warning systems in our seas .
But as we have built ever more impressive gadgets , we have done less and less to build better survivors .

Not just luck
That is a mistake .
Having covered the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks from New York City , Hurricane Katrina from New Orleans , and many disasters in between , I can tell you that ordinary people matter more than anyone else at the scene of a catastrophe .
Their behaviour makes a massive difference .
Luck is not as all - important as we expect .
And in major disasters like the 2004 tsunami in southeast Asia , regular people do the vast majority of lifesaving .
Our disaster personalities are not , in fact , anything like our normal personalities
After the 7 July 2005 terrorist attacks on London buses and subway trains , the official report on the response would find one " overarching , fundamental lesson " - emergency plans had been designed to meet the needs of emergency officials , not regular people .
On that day , the passengers had no way to let the train drivers know that there had been an explosion .
They also had trouble getting out - the train doors were not designed to be opened by passengers .
Finally , passengers could n't find first aid kits to treat the wounded .
It turned out that supplies were kept in subway supervisors offices , not on the trains .
The London suicide attacks killed 52 people and injured more than 770 When emergency plans are written , regular people need to be at the table .
When drills are held , regular people need to make up the majority of the participants .
And most of all , we need to understand what exactly happens to us in the worst of times .
What happens to our brains under extreme fear ?
Why do we lose some powers and gain others ?
And how can we learn to do better ?
Period of disbelief
Our disaster personalities are not , in fact , anything like our normal personalities .
Strong men can wilt , and neurotic women can suddenly become bold and purposeful .
Everything changes .
We know that in all kinds of disaster , from ship wrecks to burning buildings , the brain tends to go through three phases : denial , deliberation and the decisive moment .
The first phase may be the most important one to know about in advance .
Survivors of fires , terrorist attacks and shipwrecks have all told me how incredibly powerful this period of disbelief can be .
On the deck of the Estonia ferry , which sank in the Baltic Sea in 1994 , one man smoked a cigarette .
Others sat in groups , doing nothing , as the water surged onto the ship .
The most common response in most disasters is not panic , but rather the opposite .
Most of the people who died on 9/11 had no chance of surviving
Our first instinct is to normalize the situation - to come up with wildly creative and reassuring explanations for why smoke might be creeping across the ceiling or why oxygen masks might have dropped from the airplane ceiling .
In the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 , about 1,000 people took the time to shut down their computers before evacuating .
On average , people waited six minutes before beginning to leave .
Once they entered the stairwell , they descended at the rate of about one minute per floor - twice as long as engineers would have predicted .
There are reasonable explanations for why we respond to threats this way , most of them rooted in our evolution .
And we can dramatically improve our response and train our brains to do better .
But understanding how we actually behave is the first step .
Once we know we tend to move in slow motion , we can learn to push through that phase and get out faster .
Buildings and planes can be designed to help us understand what is really happening more quickly - and get to an exit .
It is time to move past the hackneyed disaster narrative - where we simply gape at the loss and then blame government or God alone for our suffering .
It is time to accept that regular people matter , and work intelligently to make ourselves more resilient .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Health regulators have approved the use of ionizing radiation for fresh spinach and lettuce , saying the technique already approved for other foods can help control harmful bacteria and other pathogens .

The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday the radiation treatment also would make the leafy greens last longer and give them greater “ shelf - life ” for retailers and consumers .
The approval comes two years after E. coli outbreaks linked to spinach and lettuce sold in grocery stores and served at various restaurants .
Outbreaks of the dangerous bacteria sickened dozens of consumers and led some to be hospitalized .
In severe cases , patients developed kidney failure .
Since then , other outbreaks have affected a variety of products , most recently Salmonella contamination in hot peppers from Mexico that surfaced earlier this summer .
“ In the aftermath of the recent outbreaks , FDA wanted to fast track an important tool to help industry improve the safety of fresh produce , ” Grocery Manufacturers Association ( GMA ) spokesman Brian Kennedy said .
But FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Kwisnek said the agency was making its decision now because it had finished reviewing all the necessary data .
Industry groups initially sought the agency ’s approval eight years ago to clear a wide variety of foods , including various meats and produce before amending their request to allow the agency to review certain foods first .
The FDA ’s review of the other foods is still ongoing .
Foods already approved for radiation treatment include meat , poultry , spices and molluscan shellfish such as oysters , mussels and clams , according to the agency .
About 76 million cases of E.coli and other types of food poisoning occur each year , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Patients stricken with a food - borne illness experience a wide variety of symptoms that can include abdominal cramps , vomiting , nausea and diarrhea .
IDEAL HABITAT
Spinach and lettuce are particularly susceptible to contaminants because their textured leaves can provide “ an ideal habitat ” for pests and because they are usually eaten raw , the FDA said .
The agency granted the production change in response to a request by two industry groups , the National Food Processors Association ( NFPA ) and The Food Irradiation Coalition .
The Grocery Manufacturers Association ( GMA ) , in a statement , said radiation offered another tool to help improve produce safety .
The group merged with the NFPA after the petition was filed , GMA ’s Kennedy said .
The FDA ’s ruling could impact a variety of produce companies , including Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc , Chiquita Brands International Inc and privately - held Dole Food Company Inc , among others .
Despite the approval , it was not immediately clear if food manufacturers or retailers would soon begin using the technology amid concerns about costs and consumer reactions .
Radiating food , including leafy greens , does not appear to be dangerous , the FDA said in its notice .
“ The overwhelming majority of studies showed no evidence of toxicity .
On those few occasions when adverse effects were reported , FDA finds that those effects cannot be attributed to irradiation , ” it said .
Spinach and lettuce that have been irradiated will have to carry a special “ radura ” logo and state the product has been “ treated with radiation ” or “ treated by irradiation , ” FDA ’s Kwisnek said .
But some consumer groups cautioned against thinking irradiation is the sole step needed to protect against contaminants in leafy greens and other produce .
Other measures still need to be adopted , including many at the farm level before foods are even processed , the Center for Science in the Public Interest said .
Farmers should be required to maintain a written food safety plan and the FDA should develop uniform standards for those plans and routinely inspect them , the nonprofit advocacy group said in a statement .

Here ’s the ‘ offending ’ interview in question …
October 21 , 2008
BAGHDAD ( AFP ) � Iraq 's cabinet on Tuesday called for changes to a planned security pact with Washington despite a warning from the US military chief that time is running out for Baghdad to approve the deal .
But officials in Washington defended the draft agreement , with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warning of " pretty dramatic " consequences of not having an accord governing the presence of US troops in Iraq .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's cabinet met Tuesday to discuss the deal that will provide the basis for a US military presence in Iraq beyond this year and decided to seek modifications .
" The cabinet unanimously sought amendments to the text of the pact so it can be acceptable nationally , " government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said after the meeting , which was also attended by US representatives .
" The cabinet called on the ministers to submit their suggestions to be included in the negotiations with the US , " he added .
The demand for changes , which were not specified , is expected to significantly delay the agreement , which still must be approved by the Iraqi parliament after endorsement by the cabinet .
Iraq 's Al - Sharqiya television reported that ministers from both the largest Sunni block -- the National Concord Front -- and the ruling Shiite grouping , the United Iraqi Alliance , wanted amendments .
The cabinet decision came just hours after the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Michael Mullen , bluntly warned that Iraq risked security losses of " significant consequence " unless it approved the deal .
Mullen also charged that US archfoe Iran was working hard to scuttle the Status of Forces Agreement , or SOFA , after months of fraught negotiations .
" We are clearly running out of time , " said Mullen , warning that when the current UN mandate governing the presence of foreign forces expires on December 31 , the Iraqi military " will not be ready to provide for their security " .
" And in that regard there is great potential for losses of significant consequence . "
The White House later sought to play down the dispute , saying it was not surprising the pact had encountered difficulties .
" We knew it was going to take a little while to get this done , " spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters in Washington .
But Defense Secretary Gates warned that there was little room for changes to the draft .
" The consequences of not having a SOFA and of not having a renewed UN authorization are pretty dramatic in terms of consequences for our actions , " Gates told news wire reporters , including AFP .
He said there is " great reluctance " to entertain new changes as the US government consults with Congress on the current draft .
" If they ( Baghdad or Congress ) were to come up with something we have n't thought of , or identify problems we missed some way , we would have to take that seriously , " Gates added .
" So I do n't think you slam the door shut .
But I would say it 's pretty far closed . "
Despite a series of US concessions , the pact remains hugely controversial in Iraq , with fierce opposition in some quarters , particularly the Shiite radical movement of anti-US cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Even before the cabinet decision , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari sought to dampen expectations of a swift approval .
" It is unlikely that the Iraqi parliament will approve the SOFA before the American presidential election on November 4 , " Dubai - based Al - Arabiya News Channel reported Zebari as saying on its website .
" Because of the differences among the political groups , we do n't believe the deal will be approved now .
Iraq still hopes to sign this deal before the end of this year , " he said .
Iraq 's Political Council for National Security examined the agreement on Sunday and Monday and then forwarded it to the cabinet .
Under the latest draft , the United States will withdraw its combat forces from Iraqi towns by June 2009 , with a complete pullout in 2011 -- eight years after the invasion that toppled now executed dictator Saddam Hussein .
In a US concession to assuage Baghdad 's concerns over sovereignty , Iraqi courts would have the authority to try US soldiers and civilians for crimes committed outside their bases and when off - duty .
The US concessions fall far short of the demands by Sadr and his followers for an immediate and full withdrawal of US troops .
Sunni political groups , a minority in mainly Shiite Iraq , are concerned about an early US departure .
But they too have expressed reservations about the pact by stressing the importance of respecting the nation 's sovereignty .
In an interview , Dr. Gut , who lives in Sweden , said : '' I think that depression is a normal mechanism .
It 's an attempt toward adaptation to a problem . ''
Dr. Nesse and Dr. Gut are not the first to ponder what evolutionary function depression -- and its close relative , sadness or low mood -- might serve .
Thinkers from Schopenhauer to Freud have offered their views .
Over the years , scientists have speculated variously that depression represents a plea for help , a strategy for manipulating others into providing resources , a signal of submission or yielding in conflict , or a way to conserve an organism 's energy and resources in hard times .
Other investigators see no point in viewing depression as anything other than a malfunction of brain chemicals .
Dr. Nesse , however , is one of a growing number of scientists who over the past decade have systematically tried to bring a Darwinian perspective to medicine , hoping to learn more about how evolution has shaped humans ' vulnerability to disease .
The approach is yielding a richer understanding of illness , and in particular , is helping scientists distinguish between diseases and medical conditions that developed as defenses against other more serious threats to survival .
Coughing , for example , is not a disease in itself but is the body 's attempt to rid itself of bacteria in the lungs .
Diarrhea and vomiting , though unpleasant , also serve as defenses , evolving as ways to evade danger , and thus to preserve fitness .
And the ability to feel pain is essential for an organism 's survival .
'' People who are born without any capacity to feel pain are usually dead by early adulthood , '' Dr. Nesse said .
Similarly , emotions like anxiety , fear and depression can be viewed as defensive strategies .
Such defenses make sense , Dr. Nesse noted , because they have a low cost , especially when compared with their potential for protection .
Vomiting , for instance , involves only the loss of few hundred calories , but might save an animal 's life if the substance ingested is poisonous .
In the same way , being frightened and anxious when no threat exists is a small price to pay for the readiness to fight or flee when true danger looms .
Yet these tactics also sometimes go awry , and illness results : chronic pain syndromes or panic attacks , for example .
Dr. Nesse believes the need to gain a deeper understanding of what purpose depression might serve is especially pressing at a time when the illness is so prevalent .
Surveys indicate that 10 percent of Americans suffer from clinical depression ; millions more endure a darkness that is not severe enough to earn a diagnosis but still interferes with their lives .
We have been running a poll for the past couple of weeks over at LispForum asking people to tell us which Common Lisp implementations they use most .
I do n't think it would surprise anybody that SBCL is leading the poll , but it might surprise people as to the magnitude .
Currently , with something like 97 votes in , SBCL has 53 % of the votes .
The next most popular implementation is CLISP with about 18 % .
This is followed by a tie between ClozureCL ( OpenMCL ) and Lispworks .
My takeaways here are the following :
What MPG Would Satisfy You ?
Recently I ’ve been doing a bit of soul - searching as far as fuel economy is concerned .
Being the co-founder of EcoModder and an active user on the forums , it ’s obvious that the interest is there .
But recently , I ’ve been wondering how there it really is .
Earlier this summer I swapped a new engine into my CRX , which quickly bumped up my mileage quite a bit .
Nowadays , with a little ecodriving , it ’s fairly easy to get 60 MPG , and I ’ve only failed in that pursuit once , due to a lot of center city Philadelphia driving .
Now that I ’m back at school and the only traveling I do is back and forth between here ( NH ) and home ( NJ ) , I ’ve gotten a little lazy .
It used to be that , in order to save some gas , you might see me cruising along on the interstate at a solid 55 - 60 mph ( conditions permitting ) , but these days I ’ll be flying down the road at up to 75 mph down hills that I usually would ’ve been content to coast down .
So what ’s changed ?
Now that I have an efficient car , I ’ve become satisfied with 60 mpg .
It ’s not costing me horrible amounts of money when I need to drive and I ’m really not using much gas , so I ’ve stopped trying to push the envelope .
Thinking about this , I wonder where everyone else ’s point of satisfaction is ?

This is why I like Joe Biden :
The above clip was from Biden 's speech in Liberty , Missouri yesterday .
And this is where years of political experience comes in handy .
Biden recognized that John McCain set his own trap last week when he suddenly began launching attacks at Barack Obama for his connection to University of Illinois - Chicago Professor Bill Ayers , but then failed to bring up the issue in the 2nd debate between Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain .
40 years ago , when young Barry Obama was just 8 years old , Bill Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground , a radical and violent leftist group .
The problem is that by the time Obama met him , he was a well respected University Professor who happened to live in Hyde Park , the same neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago that Barack Obama lives in .
Obama was unaware of Ayers ' history .
Even after the two met , their ties were very loose .
Ayers hosted a neighborhood coffee for Obama 's 1996 run for the Illinois State Senate and then he made a $ 200 donation to Obama 's re-election fund in April of 2001 .
The two served together on the board of the Woods Fund , an anti-poverty group , from 1999 to 2002 .
Since 2002 , according to the New York Times , there is little public evidence of their relationship .
Apparently , the last time the two had any contact what - so - ever with each other was back in 2005 when they bumped into each other on the street .
This is the best McCain can do - attack Obama for a guy he ran into on the street three years ago .
That might be a tough sell - especially coming from the a guy who split well over $ 1 million from Charles Keating with four other U.S. Senators .
Keating traded that cash for political favors from McCain and the rest of what is now known as the Keating Five .
So what 's worse ?
$ 200 from a guy a candidate barely knows , who has never been a consultant or even an influence on the candidate 's policy , or six figures from a guy who gave it to the candidate specifically for political favors that directly led to 21,000 people having their life savings wiped out ?
You 're playing with fire Mr. McCain .
Be careful .
And that brings us back to the trap that Joe Biden watched John McCain set for himself last week .
Once that trap was set , all the Senator from Delaware had to do was bait it , which is exactly what he did in that speech in Liberty , Missouri .
He challenged McCain to actually bring up Ayers to Obama 's face in the last debate and that puts McCain in a very tough position .
If McCain fails to bring it up Wednesday night at Hofstra he will have side - stepped the trap , but it will be easy for the Obama Campaign to question the legitimacy of the McCain / Palin claims that Obama 's relationship with Ayers should be cause for concern .
The question will be " if you think the issue is so important to the American people , Mr. McCain , why did you fail to bring it up in the final debate - the last real chance for the voters to hear the candidates , side - by - side , discussing the most important issues of the day ? "
On the other hand , if Sen.
McCain does take the bait , and falls into the trap , Obama will have plenty of ammunition with which to ridicule the Senator from Arizona for bringing up such loose ties to a man involved in an incident that occurred 40 years ago in the face of all of McCain 's failures in respect to his ethical judgment .
Not only can Obama bring up the Keating Five and the deregulation McCain supported for Mr. Keating , but he may also be able to throw Sarah Palin 's Troopergate back in his face .
We 'll find that out later today when an independent investigator presents his findings to a legislative hearing in Alaska .
And all of this is before we 've even discussed the shadiness of McCain 's current top campaign officials ... but that will take too long to get into right now , so we 'll save it for next time .
Stay tuned to The Stonecipher Report .
2,000 MW Wind Farm Will Send Power from Wyoming to Southern California
July 30th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
[ social_buttons ]
Add the name of Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz to the growing list of investors throwing their hats into the ring of a booming wind energy and transmission industry in the American west .
The Anschutz Corp. said Tuesday it has acquired the rights to a proposed $ 3 billion , 3,000 - megawatt transmission project that will bring electricity from Wyoming to Southern California , Las Vegas and Phoenix .
The 900 - mile TransWest Express Project will carry power from a 2,000 - megawatt wind farm Anschutz is developing in south - central Wyoming , a large portion of which will be built on a ranch he has owned for about 15 years .
A study by National Grid released this month concluded that wind - generated power produced in southern Wyoming is the most viable option for meeting the clean power demands of the desert Southwest .
Both the wind farm and the proposed transmission project still must get approval from state and federal agencies , which will include an environmental impact study and opportunities for public comment .
The permitting process will likely take 24 - 36 months to complete .
This is the fist venture into renewable energy for Anschutz , who made his fortune in oil , gas , real estate , telecommunications and entertainment .
Today ’s news comes in the wake of two major developments in US wind energy development : the well - publicized T. Boone Pickens push for a 4,000 MW wind farm and associated grid infrastructure in Texas , and the recent approval of a 909 megawatt wind farm in Oregon .

The Charlotte Observer
October 2 , 2008
On Friday , with its stock plunging 27 percent , Wachovia experienced a “ silent run ” on deposits , but the bigger worry for regulators was that other banks would n’t provide the Charlotte bank with necessary short - term funding when it opened for business Monday , sources familiar with the situation told the Observer .
With Wachovia already looking for a merger partner , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , in consultation with other regulators , required the bank to reach a sale to Citigroup on Monday morning .
The FDIC , for the first time , used legislative authority created in 1991 to help it deal with a “ very large complex bank failure ” on short notice .
It requires approval from heavy hitters – two - thirds of FDIC board members , two - thirds of Federal Reserve board members as well as the Treasury secretary , who must consult with the president .
“ When Wachovia opened Monday it would not have had a source of liquidity , ” a source familiar with the situation said .
“ It really could not have opened under those circumstances .
That ’s why ( the FDIC ) put together the assistance package . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The new details show the precarious situation Wachovia faced over the weekend as it rushed to find a suitor , even as Congress debated a possible bailout plan .
Intense negotiations in New York included a decision by Wells Fargo to pass on a deal Sunday and frequent consultations with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the bank ’s primary regulator , and the FDIC , sources said .
In the end , the FDIC , which insures customer deposits , forged the deal because it has “ the pocketbook , ” a source said .

My friend Miss Fipi
Lele tells me that the photo below was taken Friday — it ’s a shot of the London office of Lehman Brothers in Canary Wharf .
Note the gathering in the window on the upper right and the body language of everyone except the guy on the left in the khaki pants :
In my experience of working at small - to - medium - sized software companies , there are two reasons for the sort of impromptu all - hands gathering like the one pictured above , where everyone is called into the biggest room in the place and stands while one of the C - level people makes an announcement :
The company has done well and has either acquired another company or been acquired by another company , or
“ Game over , man . ”
Lehman filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy today , so the meeting is probably of the latter type .
This article says that they ’re in debt to the tune of 613 billion dollars to various banks in Tokyo , Hong Kong , New York , Singapore and Taipei .
Some quick thoughts :
Looking at khaki guy ’s clothes — and the fact that he ’s in khakis while everyone else is in “ regulation charcoal business pants ” — and body language , I think he ’s got a backup plan .
It ’s probably a good thing those windows do n’t open .
I ’m wondering what kind of impact that the implosion of yet another major financial house is going to have on me in both the short and long term .
I ’m reminded of the Simpsons episode in which Homer becomes the coach of the school football team : “ You ’re cut , you ’re cut , you ’re cut , you ’re cut … ”
episode in which Homer becomes the coach of the school football team : “ You ’re cut , you ’re cut , you ’re cut , you ’re cut … ”
Maybe the truly dangerous “ LHC ” is n’t the Large Hadron Collider , but the Lehman Holdings Collapse .
One wag who saw the photo posed an interesting rhetorical question : “ What happens when you put frat boys in charge of one of the world ’s largest banks ? ”
Having worked for at least one irresponsible frat boy , I think the question ’s got some merit .

PREMIER ballerina Darcey Bussell took centre stage at the launch of a series of prints of paintings of herself commissioned by a Gerrards Cross company to help raise funds for the Alzheimer 's Society .
The limited edition prints were unveiled at the Royal Opera House last month , produced from three original water colour portraits by Chalfont St Peter water colour artist Gordon King .
They were commissioned by Ever English Ltd and 1,000 limited edition prints have been produced of each portrait which will be sold either direct from the company or over the internet .
Ever English hopes to donate more than £ 50 from the sale of each print to the Alzheimer 's Society .
The Darcey Bussell collection was the first venture for Neil Buckley since he set up the company last year .
Mr Buckley , who already has an import business , decided he wanted to start up an export business and at the same time help a charity .
He has had personal experience of the effects of Alheimzer 's through his late father - in - law and chose to donate part of the proceeds to the charity .
Mr Buckley said : " I have known Gordon King for about 20 years .
I approached Darcey Bussell out of the blue and she was very willing to help from the start . "
He accompanied Mr King to the Royal Opera House to do the original sketches and photographs .
The launch also provided the latest project for website design company E-creation , also in Gerrards Cross , which Mr Buckley found through the Register of Accredited Service Providers supported by Thames Valley Business Link .
He said : " It was not only the quality of service , but the level of support that E- creation provided which was impressive . "
The prints , priced between £ 225 and £ 265 are being sold either direct from Ever English Ltd at 31 Howards Wood Drive , Gerrards Cross , Bucks SL9 7HR or via the internet at www.everenglish.com
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has blamed the Irish banks guarantee for an international financial crisis in which money flows from country to country depending on who is offering the best deal .
He said the Republic 's Finance Minister Brian Lenihan 's € 500bn scheme , covering 11 banks in southern Ireland , has resulted in a total loss of liquidity in the City of London as all the cash flowed to guaranteed banks in Ireland .
Mr Sarkozy said the resulting crisis was serious , but added that , in referring to the Irish guarantee , he was not making a value judgment .
While Ireland was first out of the traps to offer a rescue scheme for ailing banks , the move was quickly replicated across Europe and in the US , as governments offered various deals to protect their financial institutions .
" I believe the crisis calls upon us to reform the European institutions , " Mr Sarkozy said , adding that it was important to make " as rapid a response as possible " .
He said that as European President , he and others would " work on a road map to see how we can deal with the Irish problem " .
Last night a spokesman for the Republic 's Department of Finance defended the € 500bn package , saying : " The decision made by the Irish Government was the correct thing to do given the circumstances . "
The spokesman acknowledged the need to promote stability in Europe and said the Government was supporting President Sarkozy in his efforts to bring that about .
A director of the European Central Bank last night also backed the Irish scheme in the wake of Mr Sarkozy 's comments .
Jose Manuel Gonzalez Paramo told RTE that Ireland 's banks guarantee complies with the EU 's approach for dealing with market turmoil .
After the Government approved the € 500bn guarantee three weeks ago , other European governments were quick to follow suit with various rescue plans for their own financial institutions .
Germany approved a package worth up to €500bn , France will spend about €350bn and Spain has set aside € 100bn .
The bulk of this money will be used to guarantee lending between banks .
The cash injection move by France , Germany and Spain was echoed by Austria and Italy .
The UK government has said it will inject up to £ 37bn of taxpayers cash into Royal Bank of Scotland , Lloyds TSB and HBOS while the Irish deal is a guarantee package , which will cost the banks € 1bn and does not involve taxpayers ' money .
Mr Sarkozy vowed yesterday the European Union would work to enlist emerging Asian economic giants China and India , themselves potential investors in Europe via wealth funds or corporations , in a summit next month to reform the world 's financial system .

Voters in swing states across the United States began receiving a one - hour DVD of Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West over the weekend .
The video was produced and distributed by Clarion Fund , a non-profit organization connected with Zionist and pro-Israeli organizations .
The DVDs were delivered with leading newspapers mostly in swing states such as Ohio , Florida , and Michigan .
The film focuses on drawing parallels between " Islamo - fascists " and Nazis , and opens with a series of videos of terrorist acts .
It features interviews with counter - terrorism analysts , footage from Arabic TV , and interviews with former terrorists .
The film 's website states that the filmmakers " are against the Radical Islamists [ sic ] who want to impose their violent , oppressive world view , with little value for life and the manifold pleasures within " , but that they feel they share the same values and fears as most Muslims .
The goal of the film , they say , is to raise public awareness , link isolated terrorist events to global origins , correct media misinformation , recognize efforts for Muslim tolerance , and promote efforts to fight " the Radical Islamic threat " .
Obsession has drawn both criticism and praise in the U.S. " Obsession is without exaggeration one of the most important films of our time , " wrote CNN 's Glenn Beck .
The film received awards at numerous film festivals like the Liberty Film Festival .
But outraged Muslims have objected to the film and its distribution .
According to the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , which has received a large amount of calls over the matter , Muslims feel it is " an attempt to not only marginalize and demonize the American Muslim community , but also to sway the election by targeting swing states " .
The film has been criticized for misquoting sources , poor fact checking , and including biased witnesses and testimony .
Several of the analysts featured in the film have been criticized as being racist and anti-Islamic .
Daniel Pipes , one of the talking heads in the film , was reported as saying that Muslims in America present " true dangers to American Jews " .
Nonie Darwish , also featured in the film , has been widely criticized for his belief that " Islam is the devil " and thinks " Islam is cruel , anti-women , anti-religious freedom and anti-personal freedom in general . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Should the film have been distributed to private homes ?
Have you seen the film ?

Clarion Fund , which also sells a DVD titled The Third Jihad , states copies are being distributed to 28 million homes but there is no intent to sway voters .
The organization 's focus , however , is only on radical Islamic threats to national security , and the group also runs a website RadicalIslam.org which recently endorsed John McCain .
An investigation by Inter Press Service in 2007 revealed that Obsession 's production was ... closely tied to right - wing Zionists both in America and Israel .
Rabbi Ephram Shore , brother of Clarion Fund 's founder Raphael Shore , is the head of an Israeli group which was involved in the film .
Various weblinks on the group 's website focus on anti-Semitism and Israel .
The funds for the production of the movie were reported as having been borrowed , but there is no word on where the funds for the distribution came from .
A spokesman for CAIR , Ibrahim Hooper , commented that he " ca n't imagine that you can produce , package , distribute and advertise this product for less than 50 million dollars " .

After his virulently an anti-Zionist speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday drew reactions the world over , a group of Neturei Karta rabbis met in Manhattan on Wednesday with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3385131,00.html
Neturei Karta is a fringe ultra-Orthodox group formally created in 1935 , that opposes Zionism and calls for the dismantling of the State of Israel on the grounds that they believe Jews are forbidden to have their own state until the coming of the Messiah .

During the meeting members of the delegation presented the Iranian president with a $ 700 silver trophy as a sign of friendship .
Rabbi Yisroel David Weiss , who took part in the meeting , told Ynet the encounter was " very successful " and was conducted in a warm and friendly environment .
Not against Jews , against Zionists Rabbi Weiss said the delegation thanked Ahmadinejad for his positive treatment of Iran 's Jewish community .
" We know he is not an enemy to the Jews , he has a Jewish community in his country that he honors , defends and supports . "
The rabbis added that Ahmadinejad " is not against the Jews , but against the Zionist regime . "

The difference between Zionism and Judaism was discussed in the meeting as well .
Explaining the common thread between Neturei Karta and Ahmadinejad , Rabbi Weiss said , " The Iranian President understands the difference and understands that not everyone bears the Zionist outlook .
" Not everyone wants to see the destruction of Judaism and participate in the Zionist infidelity but rather solely to pray and hope for the end of the State of Israel , " he said .
According to the rabbi , the Iranian president does not deny the Jewish Holocaust , but rather resists what he calls Zionist invasion and occupation of the land of Israel and the suffering caused to the Palestinians .
" The Zionists use the Holocaust as an excuse for their crimes , " said Weiss .
Close ties According to him , there are also Jews who are loyal to the Torah and against Zionism for its denial of God .
" Ahmadinejad , like us , understands the difference between Judaism and Zionism , " claimed Rabbi Weiss who emphasized that the Iranian president is not looking for ways to bomb Israel .
" It is the complete opposite ; he wants peace and not to destroy the Jewish nation , that 's what he explained to us .
He is against the difficulties generated by the Zionist nation against the Palestinians , " he said .
The Neturei Karta representative responded to The Neturei Karta representative responded to President Shimon Peres ' comments , " Throughout the generations , God told us that the Torah is our protection .
http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3479700,00.html
" Due to the Zionist leadership 's denial of the Torah and diversion from its path , the warnings written in it are being ignored .
This is likely to bring the Jewish nation to catastrophic outcomes as we see today and this is what we are fighting against , " said Rabbi Weiss .

In my experience of building systems in Ruby over the last 7 years , I believe there is one main feature of Ruby that made these systems successful .
Before I get to that unique feature of Ruby I want to describe a few of the first systems I built in Ruby and what I learned from them .
The first system I developed in Ruby was a testing infrastructure for a distributed multi-agent system being developed and funded by DARPA .
DARPA is the research arm of the US Department of Defense .
This project 's grand challenge was to build a software system that could survive " in theater " .
The system had to continue functioning in a war - like situation with enemies attacking the software or the hardware the software is running on .
The main function of the software ( beyond surviving ) was real - time logistics planning .
Logistics includes routing supplies to people and places where its needed .
That may not sound very interesting but logistics happens to be the key function that makes large groups operate effectively .
What I built for DARPA was a testing framework that observed the events being generated by the software agents using XMPP and then sent commands to these agents using HTTP .
The core of the framework was a Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) which allowed us to script the multi-agent system .
Initially this scripting was limited to simple things , but that basic automation helped the program significantly .
In the first four months I wrote all the scripts .
During the next year the DSL was rewritten and then expanded to include all the forms of network and system attacks the program was tasked with creating .
What was really cool was the majority of the extensions to the DSL were written by other non-Ruby developers in the program .
The multi-agent system was written in Java , but each of the 80 people contributing to the attack - side of the program ended up learning enough Ruby to encode their attacks .
We also expanded the DSL to generate the logistics rules and from the rules the agent society definition .
This was a large deployment .
We had 300 dual core machines with 4GB of RAM and 10,000 agents running across them .
The Ruby script that was generated for a single agent society definition was over 1 million lines of code .
The events that Ruby handled per hour were well over 3 million messages of 1 - 10 k each .
By the end of the program , Ruby was used to generate the entire agent configuration , drive the simulation , generate the attacks , record the results , generate reports and summarize them for the Program Manager .
This development taught me three very important lessons about Ruby :
Ruby is an excellent language to encode domain specific logic in .
Its flexible syntax makes Ruby almost disappear and what 's left is domain terms .
Once the domain is encoded its very easy for domain experts to use the Ruby DSL .
These domain experts may not be able to write it , but they most definitely can read and validate it .
When people talk about a 10 x developer productivity increase , I believe this is the primary reason for it , the close communication between domain experts and those building the system .
Programmers can quickly learn Ruby and can be effective in it , especially if they learn it in the context of something they know .
Every person on our project that wrote Ruby enjoyed it .
Their enjoyment was the main motivator to them becoming more and more proficient in Ruby .
I believe any good programmer can be a good programmer in Ruby .
Ruby scales .
We pushed Ruby to unbelievable levels on this program and it exceeded our expectations .
The application under test was critical which made the testing framework even more critical .
There were places in our code where we had to drop into C to perform computationally intensive operations .
The ease of doing this is another key aspect of Ruby 's scalability .
The second system I developed in Ruby was a desktop - based functional prototype for a complex system that was being designed for the US Air Force .
The goal of this system was to create a unified view across the 18 different groups that coordinate the movement of military aircraft and provide mid-air refueling with tankers .
The team that hired me to do this was a Human Computer Interface research organization that had spent the prior 3 years traveling the world to interview and capture the requirements of all 18 groups .
They had written a very detailed user interface specification for the system .
They wanted to deliver this user interface specification along with a functional prototype to show the final implementors what they meant in the text & pictures of their design .
The primary challenge was time .
They had less than 2 months left to build the functional prototype after a failed 24 person - month Java effort .
I chose Ruby and Flash to build the prototype in .
I will not focus on the Flash side of what I did because the Ruby side of this , although non-visual , ended up being transformative to the project .
My first meeting with the research scientist ( who had become the domain expert ) occurred in Boston .
On the flight up , I had no idea where to start with the massive tome of information in the specification they had created .
After arriving in her office we sat down in front of my computer and I brought up a text editor .
I asked her to describe the the concepts in the domain .
As she described it I typed in what I knew was valid Ruby syntax .
As we encoded her domain knowledge we created a DSL on the fly .
After 5 hours of talking and typing we had produced a very elegant 400 line script that she could read as her domain and I could read as code .
On the flight back to DC , I wrote the code behind this syntax to enable the construction of the domain model objects ( I called this approach syntax - driven development . )
Over the next 4 weeks we iterated on the domain model .
I wrote scripts to parse flight plans and convert them to DSL code and flushed out more of the domain .
I sent snippets of the DSL to domain experts for review .
What amazed the team was the DSL encoding of the specification exposed numerous examples where the specification was incomplete or contradictory --- something that none of them had seen in their reviews of it .
The final 4 weeks were spent developing the Flash - based UI which was driven by the domain objects in Ruby .
In the end we met our goals .
The functional prototype was delivered along with the updated specification .
Although the user interface specification was main product delivered to the implementation team , the Ruby DSL was an important tool they could use to better understand the domain .
So , what did these two projects have in common ?
In both projects I used Ruby to implement the system through a language customized to the project domain .
These domain specific languages became effective mediums for team communications .
In my experience , this is the single most important feature of the Ruby language --- capturing the domain in a language the entire team can speak .
If you believe clear communications is an essential quality of highly effective teams , this feature is something that you should strive to exploit in your own Ruby projects .

After more than six years as a prisoner of the United States , former TV cameraman Sami al - Hajj is back at work with Al - Jazeera , the largest broadcaster in the Arab world , a thorn in the side of most Arab governments – and , by most indications , a target of deep hostility from the Bush administration .
Al - Hajj , 39 , was the longest - held journalist in U.S. custody at the time of his release in May , and the only one ever held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Military authorities repeatedly accused him of being a terrorist in league with al Qaeda , then released him without charges .
His case is emblematic of the poisoned relationship between the U.S. government and a television network with 40 million viewers in the Middle East .
Since 2001 , Bush administration officials have regularly denounced Al - Jazeera as an anti-American propaganda organ and a mouthpiece for terrorists , and have periodically urged its chief patron , the emir of Qatar , to rein it in .

COURTESY QUIKSILVERClay Marzo 's favorite board length is 6 feet 1 .
" But it does n't matter what board you put under his feet , " says Adam Klevin , the cinematographer for " Just Add Water , " a film about Marzo .
He always goes big and always finds the barrel .
Wired to waves
Autistic surfer Clay Marzo is a gifted tube rider
Professional surfer Clay Marzo is n't concerned about his next contest win or whether he 'll become world champion one day .
He 's entirely focused on what 's happening in the present , which has helped make him one of the most exciting and innovative surfers on the waves today .
Eight - time world champion Kelly Slater has said that nobody in Clay 's age bracket comes close to what the 19 - year - old accomplishes every time he paddles into a set .
And there 's a reason for that .
" He 's not capable of conforming , " says Clay 's mother , Jill Marzo .
" He 's just capable of being him .
And that 's the beautiful thing .
Nothing bothers him because he's in the moment .
For years I tried to change him to fit in , but I 've been forced to accept and live in the moment with him . "
Clay , who grew up in Lahaina , is the focus of a new Quiksilver documentary / surf film called " Just Add Water . "
More than a movie about a rising young star , however , it details Clay 's aptitude and unique personality , and his life with Asperger 's syndrome , an autism spectrum disorder that can make school and social situations challenging but also allows him to hyperfocus and exhibit exceptional talent in a specific arena .
Adam Klevin , the cinematographer for " Just Add Water , " notes that while most athletes ' skills decline with fatigue , Clay can handle four surf sessions -- up to eight hours -- in a day .
" And he never stops going bigger , " Klevin says of Clay , who is renowned for his ability to take off late and rack up " an amazing percentage of tube rides . "
It 's an intuitive rather than conscious pursuit , Klevin believes .

COURTESY QUIKSILVERLast year , Clay Marzo , 19 , was diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome , a high - functioning form of autism .
Indeed , " getting barreled " is what Clay says he likes best about surfing .
He 'd rather not wear a wet suit , and does so only when the water dips into the 50s .
" I can trunk it in 60 , " he says without an ounce of boasting .
He likes to travel " where the waves are firing " but also appreciates returning to his refuge on Maui .
He remembers everything and never lies .
And he does n't try to emulate anyone else .
" I look at ( Asperger 's ) as a gift , " says Jill .
" He 's wired a different way , and it 's something we 're just starting to understand .
His social cues are not the same as yours and mine , and never will be . "
With his pale blue eyes , tousled , sea - salt - drenched blond hair and lean frame , Clay remains happiest in the water and does n't speak unless he has something to say .
" People always wanted to find a label for Clay , " notes Jill , " but I knew intuitively that keeping him in the water was what he needed . "
As a child , Clay collected seashells and played at Puamana beach .
By age 2 he could ride a boogie board standing up , and at 3 or 4 switched to a surfboard .
Everyone in the family surfed , including his grandmother and older brother , Cheyne Magnusson , also a professional surfer .
" Clay was so natural in the water that I did n't even worry , " Jill says of those early days .
" He was incredibly in tune with it from a young age . "
Still , she greeted the movie idea with skepticism .
" I was really nervous , " she admits .
" I did n't want to expose it .
I worried that people would treat him differently or that he would be embarrassed by it . "
Instead , the film and an extensive article in Surfer Magazine yielded e-mails from others inspired by Clay 's unique pursuit of his passion .
That , she says , made the journey worthwhile .
When asked what makes his surfing remarkable , Clay shrugs .
" I do n't know .
The whole approach I have . "
The best part ?
It 's definitely all his own .
' Time to Say Goodbye ' Oliver Kahn Bids Farewell to Football
Legendary goalkeeper Oliver Kahn played the last match of his career on Tuesday night in a farewell match in Munich .
With his old club Bayern Munich holding the German national team to a draw , the night was less about the result than about emotions and the celebration of an extraordinary career .
Chemists have finally succeeded in breaking down a famously unalterable molecule – and persistent greenhouse gas – at room temperature .
The molecules , known as fluorocarbons , are found in plastics , clothing and refrigerants .
At their heart is a union of carbon and fluorine – a union that , thanks to their atomic configurations , is one of the strongest molecular unions known in nature .
Under standard conditions , fluorocarbons are impervious to acids and bases .
They do n't give or receive electrons , the very currency of molecular reconfiguration .
Breaking them down is possible only at temperatures approaching 2000 degrees Fahrenheit .
In some situations , that stability is a blessing : Teflon is made from fluorocarbons .
But so are the hydrofluorocarbon coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners – and when released , those become greenhouse gases that can circulate for thousands of years .
Though now found only in trace amounts in the atmosphere , scientists fear their accumulation .
" They 're not the major contributor to global warming , but per molecule they 're much more potent than carbon dioxide , " said Brandeis University chemist Oleg Ozerov .
" They 're so stable that , unless we decompose them , they 're pretty much here to stay . "
In a study published today in Science , Ozerov and fellow Brandeis chemist Christos Douvris discovered a chemical reaction by which fluorocarbons can finally be decomposed .
The process involves trialkylsilium – a powerful acid – and triethylsilylium hexachlorocarborane , a catalyst that speeds the reaction .
The acid bonds with a fluoride molecule from the fluorocarbon , in the process emitting a carbon atom .
The carbon bonds with the catalyst , emitting a silylium ion that bonds with another fluoride atom .
" It 's sort of a shuffle .
A merry - go - round , " said Robin Perutz , a
University of York chemist who was not involved in the study .
" The key is the efficiency of the catalyst .
This one goes around for many cycles : you do n't need much of it .
Previously you could do nothing useful with these molecules at room temperature . "
Ozerov cautioned that the process has yet to be scaled to industrial levels .
If that can be done , " it 's a good thing , " said Dave Hamilton , director of the Sierra Club 's Global Warming and Energy Program .
" It begins to solve a thorny global warming problem . "

These refrigerators are actually old and probably ran on chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs – a type of fluorocarbon that was outlawed after its ozone layer - eating effects were revealed .
Chlorofluorocarbons were replaced with hydrofluorocarbons , which turned out to be greenhouse gases ; it 's these that Ozerov and Douvris broke down .

The Canadian dollar suffered its biggest weekly decline in at least 38 years against its U.S. counterpart this week as the passage by Congress of the $ 700 billion ( U.S. ) rescue package failed to persuade investors that the worst of the financial crisis was over .
Canadian bond prices rose and yields fell as fears of a global recession had many in the market betting that central banks would soon be cutting interest rates to spur growth .
The loonie closed at $ 1.0815 to the U.S. dollar , or 92.46 , ( U.S. ) down from $ 1.0799 to the greenback , or 92.60 at Thursday 's close .
Canada 's currency ended the week down 4.5 per cent against the U.S. dollar , its biggest one - week drop since at least 1970 .
Early in the session it touched a 13 - month low , but regained some ground after the passage of the rescue package for the besieged U.S. financial sector .
As financial institutions in the United States and Europe have collapsed in response to bursting real estate bubbles and murky assets , lenders have responded by hoarding cash and U.S. dollars have become scarce , driving up their value .
Once the U.S. economic rescue package was passed , traders focused their attention back on world economies .
" We 're getting economic numbers in the U.S. which are dismal , and that , I think , removes any debate about whether there will be a recession in the U.S ... and there 's a significant risk of a global recession , " said David Watt , senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
U.S. payrolls plunged in September at the steepest rate in five years as employers cut 159,000 non-farm jobs from their payrolls , the U.S. Labor Department said yesterday .
Analysts had expected a loss of 100,000 jobs .
Weakening commodity prices have also weighed heavily on Canada 's dollar , with around half of Canadian exports made up of natural resources .
" Commodity price measures are not just back to levels of a year ago , but all the way back to levels prevailing in late 2005 , and the sell - off is taking no prisoners , " said Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets . "
" A darkening global growth outlook and a rejuvenated U.S. dollar – which had its best week in years – have both pounded on resource prices . "
Carlos Leitao , chief economist at Laurentian Bank of Canada , said the market expects central banks , the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada included , will start cutting rates in the near term to try to spur growth .
Bond yields , which move inversely to prices , fell to reflect those expectations of lower rates .
Early in the session , the Bank of Canada moved to increase confidence in the Canadian markets by upping the amount it plans to inject into markets through Purchase and Resale Agreements to $ 20 billion from a previously announced $ 8 billion to help improve liquidity in the financial system .
The two - year bond rose 20 cents to $ 100.52 ( Canadian ) to yield 2.500 per cent .
The 10 - year bond gained 50 cents to $ 105.40 to yield 3.582 per cent .
The yield spread between the two - year and the 10 - year bond rose to 115 basis points from 105 basis points .
The 30 - year bond added 85 cents to $ 115.15 for a yield of 4.095 per cent .
In the United States , the 30 - year Treasury yielded 4.094 per cent

Setup for a Stolen Election ?
AP Poll " Tightens " Race to a Point
Michael Collins
The Associated press came out with a remarkable poll Thursday .
It claimed that the presidential race had tightened from the consistent leads Obama has shown over the past weeks to become one of those " too close to call " national elections .
Their poll , conducted by German polling firm GfK , showed 44 % for Obama and 43 % for McCain .
How could this be ?
In the Real Clear Politics average of major national polls , Oct 24 , Obama 's average lead is 7.5 % .
The four national polls conducted on the same days as the AP poll show an average 9.2 % Obama lead .
The polls after the AP " tightening " effort shows an 8.7 % Obama lead .
Clearly the AP - GfK poll is an exception or outlier , as those are called .
Yet the AP presents this as news , not opinion .
What is AP Up To ?
AP acknowledges that its poll is different from the other national polls but claims it 's not " alone . "
It is n't .
There is exactly one other poll that agrees with AP out of 16 presented on the Real Clear Politics summary for Oct. 24 .
AP ignores the tentative nature of the poll and presents the story as " news . "
It begins drawing conclusions from the poll at the start of the article with " rumors " from unidentified sources ;
" The poll , which found Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent , supports what some Republicans and Democrats privately have said in recent days : that the race narrowed after the third debate as GOP - leaning voters drifted home to their party and McCain 's " Joe the plumber " analogy struck a chord . "
AP , Oct. 23 , 2008
Reviewing the internal details and questions of the poll analysis by GfK , there are no questions about Joe the Plumber .
Since this is the opening claim , mentioned again as central to the shift AP is selling us , it 's important to look at how the debate was viewed by the public .
CNN and CBS both did national polls the evening of the debate .
CNN reported that 58 % of those watching the debate thought Obama won , with only 31 % favoring McCain .
CBS polled uncommitted voters who judged Obama the winner over McCain by 53 % to 22 % .
This was the biggest margin for Obama for the series of three counters .
What was going on with the AP sample of voters ?

A Star That Bursts , Blinks and Disappears
Francis Reddy
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
" Twinkle , twinkle little star " goes the nursery rhyme .
Now , astronomers are reporting on a strange case where one of the littlest of stars " twinkled " with gamma rays , X - rays , and light -- and then vanished .
The story began on June 10 , 2007 .
That ’s when a spike of gamma- rays lasting less than five seconds washed over NASA 's Swift satellite .
But this high - energy flash was n't a gamma- ray burst -- the birth cry of a black hole far across the universe .
It was something much closer to home .
Swift immediately reported the event ’s position to astronomers all over the world .
Within a minute , robotic telescopes turned to a spot in the constellation Vulpecula .
Because Swift found an X - ray glow coming from this point , astronomers cataloged the object as " Swift J195509+261406 , " after its position in the sky and the discovering satellite .
( Well , they had to call it something ! ) During the next three days , the object brightened and faded in visible light .
Not once , not twice -- but 40 times !
Eleven days later , it flashed again , this time at infrared wavelengths .
Then , it disappeared from view .
" I love it when Swift enables a discovery like this , " says Neil Gehrels , the mission 's lead scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " The observatory is an astronomical robot built for gamma - ray burst studies , but it can also quickly point at other bizarre objects with bright flares .
" Astronomers think the object was a neutron star -- the crushed innards of a massive star that long ago exploded as a supernova -- about 15,000 light - years away .
Writing in the Sept. 25 issue of the science journal Nature , a team of 42 scientists concludes that Swift J195509+261406 is a special type of neutron star called a magnetar .
" We are dealing with an object that was hibernating for decades before entering a brief activity period , " explains Alberto J. Castro - Tirado , lead author of the paper .
" Magnetars remain quiet for decades .
" Although measuring only about 12 miles across -- about the size of a city -- neutron stars have the strongest magnetic fields in the cosmos .
Sometimes , those magnetic fields are super strong -- more than 100 times the strength of typical neutron stars .
Astronomers put these magnetic monsters in their own class : magnetars .
Only about a dozen magnetars are known , but scientists suspect our galaxy contains many more .
We just do n’t see them because they ’re quiet most of the time .
So what happened last year ?
Why did this previously unseen star begin behaving so badly ?
And why did it stop ?
Combine a magnetar 's pumped - up magnetic field with its rapid spin , and sooner or later something has to give .
Every now and then , the magnetar ’s rigid crust snaps under the strain .
This " starquake " releases pent - up magnetic energy , which creates bursts of light and radiation .
Once the star ’s crust and magnetic field settle down , the star goes dark and disappears from our view .
At least until the next quake .
Astronomers suspect that magnetars lose their punch as time passes , but Swift J195509+261406 provides the missing link between objects exhibiting regular activity and those that have settled into retirement -- and invisibility .
So twinkle , twinkle magnetar .
That 's how we 'll learn just where you are .

Open source project development is n't just about open code it's also about open development tools and open collaboration .
Linux vendor Ubuntu is aiming to make its Launchpad hosting platform and Bazaar ( bzr ) distributed version control system , the standard for a new generation of open source developers .
LaunchPad 2.0 was released today .
For the first generation of open source development , tools like CVS ( Concurrent Versions System ) , SVN ( subversion ) and SourceForge .net were the standards .
Ubuntu 's Launchpad 2.0 release which uses Ubuntu 's bzr ( pronounced Bazaar ) is taking a different tact than its peers by opening up the development process to encourage wider participation in the open source ecosystem .
The Ubuntu system could end up spurring a new wave of openness in open source development practices .
" Most people that come to Launchpad , experience it because of Ubuntu , but Launchpad is not just for Ubuntu , it 's an open collaboration platform for any open source project , " Launchpad project manager Christian " Kiko " Reis told InternetNews.com .
" It 's special because it really provides you with a place to showcase your project and because the barrier to participation is so low , it 's a great place to attract community participation . "
The bzr system that powers Launchpad is a distributed de-centralized version control system people can use to create branches of software and maintain local code histories .
In contrast CVS and SVN are centralized version control systems that require developers to work through a central repository .
" A decentralized version control system is all about lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging participation , " Reis explained .
" When you use CVS , you 're talking about a single repository which you have to request access to .
So if I 'm a developer and I find your software interesting and I want to build a branch of your code , I have to come and talk to you to give me permission . "
The Launchpad system is where bzr users can host their code branches , much like Sourceforge.net and Google Code are good place to host SVN code repositories .
Launchpad also provides workflow enhancements for bzr users to help merge code branches .
Ubuntu's Launchpad in combination with bzr enables code imports from existing CVS or SVN repositories to help ease migration .
Better integration
The Launchpad 2.0 release which is now online , provides a new user interface , new navigation system and better integration with external bug trackers .
" We wrote GPL plug-ins for Trac and bugzilla and we can do bidirectional synchronization with them so it 's much easier to talk regardless of what bug tracker you 're using , " Reis commented .
" Launchpad is a much more scalable code hosting platform for bzr now . "
Launchpad currently hosts 7,000 open source projects , among them is Sun 's MySQL database which moved to the system earlier this year .
" Launchpad is a great platform and we 're happy to be working with them and exposing our code to a broader audience of participants , " Zack Urlocker , vice - president of products , database group , Sun Microsystems told InternetNews.com .
Urlocker noted that MySQL had previously been using BitKeeper , which is also a distributed development tool .
" It 's [ BitKeeper ] a very innovative tool , but it was n't always easy for other people to access the code , " Urlocker commented .
" It 's been our goal to be more open and make it easier for our community to participate in development , so the combination of Bazaar with Launchpad has opened up quite a few possibilities for more participation in the community . "

Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Sarah Palin to Campaign in Florida
has been asked byto introduce her on Sunday at several campaign stump rallies in Florida .
The ABC co-host of The View , a staunch Republican , is revved up and excited to help Alaska 's governor in any way she can .
Palin is John McCain 's controversial VP pick who has been experiencing a tremendous media backlash concerning her $ 150,000 wardrobe expenses and her lack of experience .
SNL has had a heyday with the help of Tina Fey .
Check out all of the SNL videos in our related articles at the bottom of this post .
Hasselbeck made the announcement on Thursday 's show : " I am more than honored to be there , so I will be flying there to travel with her and meet some pretty interesting people , I have a feeling .
That 's an honor , I 'm excited to do it , and I 'll have some stories I 'm sure on Monday . "
This is not the first time Elisabeth has been rewarded for her Republican flag waving views .
She got a coveted invite to the White House from George W. Bush when Queen Elizabeth was in Washington D.C. for a State Dinner .
That drove the ladies of The View crazy and this new campaign stumping adventure is sure to get their tongue 's wagging .
Joy Behar , in particular , will be absolutely over the edge and will be ready with her bag of one - liners .
The comedian recently called Palin dumb .
Governor Palin can be sure that Elisabeth has ' got her back ' .
She 's still a cheerleader of Bush after all the country has been through , albeit not quite as loudly .
We can't wait to see Monday 's show .
The idea of the insurance plan , championed by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , was to reduce uncertainty and restore confidence without actually using taxpayer money .
The federal government would guarantee the underlying mortgages in a mortgage - backed security , much as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have done for years and as the Federal Housing Administration does , as well .
In theory , the cost of that insurance would be borne by the companies that hold the mortgages or mortgage - backed securities .
Treasury officials had already told Republican lawmakers they had considered an insurance approach , but rejected it .
The problem , from Mr. Paulson ’s standpoint , was that insuring against mortgage defaults would do little to increase liquidity , or the amount of money available for making loans .
By contrast , the Treasury plan would inject hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh , although borrowed , money into the marketplace .
But the insurance plan could pose other risks to taxpayers .
The government would be insuring the riskiest and most default - prone mortgages made during the housing bubble , including loans that required no down payment and no income verification by the borrowers .
The allure of insuring mortgages , rather than buying them as Mr. Paulson would , is that the government would not have to put up any taxpayer money .
But because the government would be guaranteeing nearly all mortgages in the country , since it already owns Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , taxpayers could face big losses if losses from defaults turn out to be higher than expected .
Many House Republicans , including Mr. Ryan , had come up with a far more detailed rival plan earlier in the week that included Republican policy evergreens like new tax breaks and more flexible regulation as well as the insurance idea .

Democratic Appointee Wants Fewer Safe Guards , Even as Diebold Admits Their Tabulator Software --- Used All Across the Country --- Loses Votes ...
Ellen Theisen Byon 8/22/2008 , 8:00 am PT
Guest Blogged by Ellen Theisen of VotersUnite.org
Many jurisdictions are realizing their voting systems are horribly flawed and they want to get them fixed before November .
But the new systems currently under test by the federal Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) have so many defects that the manufacturers have to keep repairing them before testing can continue .
Consequently the EAC has not certified anything yet .
Kudos to the EAC for this !
But Gracia Hillman , one of the EAC Commissioners , recommends a way around this “ roadblock ” for the jurisdictions using systems that are no good .
She suggests a contingency plan that would allow the jurisdictions to use new and different systems that are no good , but at least they would comply with their state laws .
Her ideas :
1 ) Emergency Certification of Voting System Modifications ; 2 ) Waiver of EAC Certification ;
Unbelievable .
The systems are so bad they ca n’t meet the federal standards , so to get around this “ roadblock , ” Commissioner Hillman proposes to bypass the testing process .
She wants the EAC to bless new , defective systems for the vendors to sell to replace the old , defective systems that are currently in use .
But that ’s what NASED ( National Association of State Election Directors ) did when it oversaw the voting system testing process , and the decade - long , widespread use of Premier / Diebold ’s vote - losing software is one of the results .
After ten years of use in election after election , all across the country , Premier / Diebold ’s vote - dropping software flaw has finally come to light — thanks to Butler County , Ohio ’s Elections Director Betty L. McGary and Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner ...
After the March 2008 primary , McGary discovered that the Premier / Diebold system had dropped votes .
Two memory cards with votes from touch - screen voting machines were not uploaded to the central tabulator on election night – even though the computer reported that all cards had been read .
Original reports indicated that a “ sharing violation ” had occurred in the GEMS central tabulation program when the computer tried to read two cards at the same time .
However , no error message appeared to warn the administrators .
The error in the totals was accidentally found later when officials were examining the database in an unrelated investigation .
Forty - four counties in Ohio use the same voting system .
A month later , Premier issued an advisory claiming that the error was caused by an incompatibility between the GEMS program and McAfee anti-virus software , which was also installed on the GEMS tabulation computer , and that the users had failed to understand the error messages reported by the system .
We have to ask :
Why is McAfee installed on a standalone system that is not ( supposed to be ) connected to the Internet and therefore cannot get the essential updates required for the anti-virus software to be of any value at all ?
If McAfee was installed on the system ( supposedly ) tested under NASED , why was n’t the incompatibility found during system testing ?
( this question will , of course , provoke gales of laughter among election integrity activists who know the ( un ) quality of the NASED testing process )
If McAfee was not installed on the system ( supposedly ) tested under NASED , then why was it installed afterward , thus voiding the NASED qualification ?
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , however , refused to depend on the vendor for a valid investigation — Kudos to her — and took matters into her own hands .
In August , IT ( Information Technology ) professionals from the Secretary of State 's office worked with Butler County and Premier / Diebold technicians to see if they could replicate the problem and figure out what was causing it .
A summary report released by the Secretary ’s office on August 21 , 2008 clarifies why it ’s such a very , very bad idea to trust vendors to investigate their own systems :
The testing revealed the following : -- Sharing violations occurred during multiple memory card upload tests , leading to dropped votes .
--
Sharing violations occurred with and without antivirus software enabled , leading to dropped votes .
--
Following strict processing protocols allowed users to identify and correct the errors , recovering the dropped votes .
After the state discovered that Premier / Diebold ’s first advisory was wrong , and that ten other counties had experienced vote - losses , too , the company issued an advisory admitting that there was an error in the logic of the source code .
Bearing in mind that the company ’s first advisory was not correct , here ’s their second explanation .
David Byrd , Premier ’s president , admits that the error occurs whether or not anti-virus software is installed on the system ( after Brunner discovered it ) .
Byrd claims the error occurs only when multiple memory cards are uploaded at once and the first card takes longer to process than the second .
He admits that the error affects version 1.20.2 of the GEMS software and earlier versions — in other words , all the versions that were qualified by NASED to meet the 1990 and / or 2002 federal Voting System Standards .
This raises several obvious questions :
Are there really no versions of GEMS in use today — or in use in previous years — that do not have this vote - counting defect ?
Have any elections tabulated with GEMS yielded accurate results ?
Will Premier / Diebold work pro bono with its customers to help them understand the problem and implement the procedures established by Ohio to recover lost votes , or will they just issue the advisory and call their job done ?
( again , I can hear gales of laughter from election integrity activists )
And the most important question :
What can we , as citizens , do to make sure our local officials are informed of the GEMS defect and the procedures that can be used to recover votes that GEMS loses ?
Here ’s one suggestion :
Do n’t use the vote - losing GEMS software to tabulate the votes .
Enter the individual precinct totals into a spreadsheet and / or add them the old - fashioned way .
Premier / Diebold has demonstrated once again that computers are n’t accurate .
They are obedient .
The GEMS tabulators in the eleven Ohio counties obeyed the logic error in the source code and dropped votes — just as the software told them to .
But do n’t think that Premier / Diebold is the only company to have a previously unpublicized vote - counting defect in its system .
No software is defect - free .
And no amount of testing can ensure that all the bugs have been caught .
If the NASED testing missed this glaring defect , what are the chances it caught all the other ones in all the other vendors ' systems ?
Shortcutting or bypassing the EAC certification process — as Commissioner Hillman suggests we do — is a serious step in the wrong direction .
It can only lead to more malfunctioning , mis-counting systems available for the vendors to sell to localities — at the expense of the taxpayers and democracy .
Rovian Politics Chose Sarah Palin By Paul Rogat Loeb
What does it say about John McCain that he picked not only the least experienced Vice Presidential nominee in America 's history , but someone he really does n't know ?
Departing so far from any normal concept of appropriate background , he should at least have had a sense of why this individual is so special .
Meeting Palin once at a Republican governors ' conference and having a single phone conversation on the eve of her selection just does n't pass muster - particularly for the oldest presidential candidate ever , who 's had four malignant melanomas .
What makes Palin such a cynical choice is that McCain does n't know her and does n't know what drives her .
Until she was selected by the Karl Rove types running his campaign ( like campaign manager and Rove protégé Steve Schmidt ) , McCain might not even have recognized her on the street .
Instead , she 's a category selection , made for the crassest reasons by the same kinds of political operatives who brought us George W. Bush .
Their motives are obvious : Palen is an energetic and attractive woman who just might pick up some disgruntled Hillary supporters .
She 's a westerner and a hunter who might appeal to rural voters .
She 's likely to energize a previously tepid base of hard - shell religious conservatives through her opposition to abortion even in cases of rape or incest :
Hard - right king - maker James Dobson just said that because of her he'd vote for McCain .
These attributes may indeed prove Palin 's worth as a vote - getter .
But except for an abortion position that seems a stunning denial of reality ( and a major affront to women ) , they have no relation to Palin 's fitness for the job .
McCain can't have any sense of what lies beneath the facile marketing categories - like who Palin actually is , what she could contribute to the Vice Presidential office , and what it would be like to work together .
He does n't know her and has had no chance to .
But because she fits the Rovian categories , none of that matters .
Echoing so much that the Republicans have done for eight years and more , it 's a choice likely to produce grave consequences , yet based overwhelmingly on political expediency .
Leave aside all the other troubling questions about Palin : her extreme abortion position ; her backing the infamous " Bridge to Nowhere " while campaigning for governor , then later claiming to disavow it ; her ties to Ted Stevens and Jack Abramoff ; her support for teaching creationism as science ; her Cheney - style vendetta of firing the Alaska public safety director who refused to fire her former brother - in - law from his job as a state trooper ( and nearly being recalled as mayor for firing the library director and police chief for not voting for her ) ; her laughing during an interview at the jokes of a radio shock jock who mocked one of her political opponents ( a cancer survivor ) for her weight , and called the woman a " bitch " and a " cancer . "
You can even leave aside that in a week where Hurricane Gustav threatens another Katrina and the Arctic ice cap separates from the adjacent land for the first time in human history , Palin insists that the jury is still out on whether humans are changing the weather of the planet .
In fact , leave aside Palin 's actual record , because John McCain barely knows it .
His vetters did n't even bother to go through the archives of her local newspaper or talk with the former public safety director she fired .
What choosing her shows most is a politics that once again subordinates any greater common good to a raw pursuit of power .
It echoes McCain praising Jerry Falwell after once calling him an " agent of intolerance . "
Or embracing Bush 's campaign and administration after Bush 's political hitmen defeated him in South Carolina with Swift Boat - type lies .
Or when instead of challenging Obama 's ideas , the McCain campaign tried to caricature him as one step up from Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Karl Rove 's minions may be smiling at the brazen gamesmanship of this pick ; but if Americans fall for it , we should know all too well what to expect .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - An al Qaeda leader has called for President George W. Bush and the Republicans to be “ humiliated , ” without endorsing a party in the upcoming U.S. presidential election , according to an Internet video posting .
“ O God , humiliate Bush and his party , O Lord of the Worlds , degrade and defy him , ” Abu Yahya al - Libi said at the end of sermon marking the Muslim feast of Eid al - Fitr , in a video posted on the Internet .
Libi , a top al Qaeda commander believed to be living in Afghanistan or Pakistan , called for God ’s wrath to be brought against Bush equating him with past tyrants in history .
The remarks were the first from a leading al Qaeda figure referring , albeit indirectly , to the U.S. elections .
Muslim clerics often end sermons by calling on God to guide and support Muslims and help defeat their enemies .
Terrorism monitor SITE Intelligence Group said in a report on Wednesday that militants on al Qaeda - linked websites have for months been debating the significance of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama or Republican John McCain .
Some posters have also argued over the merits of trying to attack the United States before the election or waiting until later , the report said .
But SITE said it did not expect al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or deputy Ayman al - Zawahri to openly favor a candidate .
“ To support a particular candidate would debase al - Qaeda ’s long - standing argument that the United States government is a corrupt institution no matter who is at the helm , ” SITE director Rita Katz said in the group ’s November newsletter .
In 2004 bin Laden issued his first video in more than a year just days before the U.S. elections .
It derided Bush and warned of possible new September 11 - style attacks .
Bin Laden made little mention of Bush ’s Democratic challenger , John Kerry , telling Americans : “ Your security is not in the hands of Kerry or Bush or al Qaeda .
Your security is in your own hands and each state which does not harm our security will remain safe . ”
Kerry has attributed his loss in part to the video ’s high - profile reminder of the terrorism issue .
In 2006 , after Democrats captured Congress , Zawahri issued an audio message saying all Americans remained al Qaeda ’s enemies regardless of party , SITE said .
SITE said militant postings on al Qaeda - linked websites typically discuss Obama in terms of his race , or his religion and foreign policy .
Some forecast a racial crisis dividing the United States if he wins .
Others say his planned phased withdrawal from Iraq would be a boon to al Qaeda ’s affiliate and give it a base for Middle East expansion .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain has been portrayed as likely to allow “ the continuation of Republican control and aggressive policies toward the Islamic world . ”

Photos Depict Abuse At Facilities In Afghanistan And Iraq
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – A federal court today ordered the Department of Defense to release photographs depicting the abuse of detainees by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the government 's appeal of a 2006 order directing the Defense Department to release the photos .
Today 's decision comes as part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit seeking information on the abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody overseas .
" This is a resounding victory for the public 's right to hold the government accountable , " said ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh , who argued before the court .
" These photographs demonstrate that the abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad was not aberrational and not confined to Abu Ghraib , but the result of policies adopted by high - ranking officials .
Their release is critical for bringing an end to the administration 's torture policies and for deterring further prisoner abuse . "
Since the ACLU 's Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request in 2003 , the government has refused to disclose these images by attempting to radically expand the exemptions allowed under the FOIA for withholding records .
The government claimed that the public disclosure of such evidence would generate outrage and would violate U.S. obligations towards detainees under the Geneva Conventions .
However , the appeals court today rejected the government 's attempt to use the FOIA as " an all - purpose damper on global controversy " and recognized the " significant public interest in the disclosure of these photographs " in light of government misconduct .
The court also recognized that releasing the photographs is likely to prevent " further abuse of prisoners . "
" This is yet another case in which the administration used national security as a pretext to suppress information relating to crimes that were endorsed , encouraged or tolerated by government officials , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The appeals court was correct to recognize both that the administration 's suppression of the photographs was without legal basis and that disclosure will further the purposes of the Geneva Conventions by deterring the abuse and torture of prisoners in the future . "
Today 's decision is available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36878lgl20080922.html
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
They are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Many of these documents are also compiled and analyzed in " Administration of Torture , " a book by Jaffer and Singh .
More information is available online at : www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture
In addition to Jaffer and Singh , attorneys on the case are Alexa Kolbi-Molinas and Judy Rabinovitz of the national ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons P.C. ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
Almost every bad thing a teenager does gets attributed to the ' crowd ' they hang out with - few parents confess to having the troublemaker kid .
Now an RTI International researcher says that goes for weight gain in kids too .
It is n't your fault for letting them eat junk food ; it 's their friends , for also being overweight .
The study , published in the September issue of Journal of Health Economics says that friends ' weight is correlated with an adolescent ’s own weight even after considering demographics , smoking status , birth weight , and household characteristics such as parental obesity .
Females were more impressionable than men , the study says - peer effect on weight was strongest among females and among adolescents who were at risk of becoming overweight .
" Our results may help explain the dramatic rise in obesity among adolescents in the past few decades , " said Justin Trogdon , Ph.D. a health economist at RTI and the paper 's lead author .
" Peers can influence all of the significant weight - related choices for teens , including eating patterns , diets and physical activity .
Peers also affect teens ’ perceptions of an acceptable weight . "
Whew .
That absolves the junk food culture being instilled in every cartoon they see from birth .
But are friends making teens fat or do teens seek out teens similar to themselves ?
It 's unclear , since the study also showed that teens with obese parents were more likely to be overweight themselves .
That means heavy girls should hang out with models , right ?
But models are the most oppressed demographic in America , with constant criticism for their lower weight .
" Research has also indicated that peers may help adolescents to lose weight , " Trogdon said .
" Better understanding peer influence on weight will help improve policies and prevention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent weight . "
The study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , a study that RTI helped conduct , that surveyed youths in grades 7 through 12 .
The researchers looked at students from 16 schools included in the data and defined peer groups based on friendships and grade level .
Yeah , I question that too ?
A 20 - pin with a seperate 4 - pin ATX connector is the same as a straight 24 - pin in my opinion .
You plug them in differently , but it has the same effect .
My motherboard and PSU allow both ways .
I can either plug the 4 - pin in next to the 20 - pin thus creating a 24 - pin ; or plug the 20 - pin in , placeing the 4 - pin in its spot next to the processor .
I 've done it both ways and have n't noticed any ill effects ?
Of course I have n't put it through rigorous and comprehensive testing , but I have n't noticed any decrease in my overclocking potentials .
CINCINNATI — New research from the University of Cincinnati ( UC ) implicates the primary chemical used to produce hard plastics — bisphenol A ( BPA ) — as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and its consequences .
In a laboratory study , using fresh human fat tissues , the UC team found that BPA suppresses a key hormone , adiponectin , which is responsible for regulating insulin sensitivity in the body and puts people at a substantially higher risk for metabolic syndrome .
Metabolic syndrome is a combination of risk factors that include lower responsiveness to insulin and higher blood levels of sugar and lipids .
According to the American Heart Association , about 25 percent of Americans have metabolic syndrome .
Left untreated , the disorder can lead to life - threatening health problems such as coronary artery disease , stroke and type 2 diabetes .
Nira Ben-Jonathan , PhD , and her team are the first to report scientific evidence on the health effects of BPA at environmentally relevant doses equal to " average " human exposure .
Previous studies have primarily focused on animal studies and high doses of BPA .
They report their findings in the Aug. 14 , 2008 , online edition of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
This scientific data comes just before a key Federal Drug Administration meeting about the safety of the chemical in consumer products scheduled for Sept. 16 , 2008 .
" People have serious concerns about the potential health effects of BPA .
As the scientific evidence continues to mount against the chemical , it should be given serious attention to minimize future harm , " says Ben-Jonathan , a professor of cancer and cell biology at UC who has studied BPA for more than 10 years .
" Experimenting with human tissue is the closest we can come to testing the effects of BPA in humans .
It 's a very exciting breakthrough because epidemiological studies looking at BPA effects on humans are difficult since most people have already been exposed to it , " she adds .
Scientists estimate that over 80 percent of people tested have measurable BPA in their bloodstream .
The UC study was designed to mimic a realistic human exposure ( between 0.1 and 10 nanomolar ) so that a more direct correlation between human exposure and health effects could be drawn .
To conduct this study , the UC team collected fresh fat tissue from Cincinnati patients undergoing several types of breast or abdominal surgery .
These samples included three types of fat tissue : breast , subcutaneous and visceral ( around the organs ) .
Tissue was immediately taken to the laboratory and incubated with different concentrations of BPA or estrogen for six hours to observe how the varied amounts of BPA affected adiponectin levels .
The effects of BPA were then compared to those of estradiol , a natural form of human estrogen .
They found that exposing human tissues to BPA levels within the range of common human exposure resulted in suppression of a hormone that protects people from metabolic syndrome .
" These results are especially powerful because we did n't use a single patient , a single tissue source or a single occurrence , " she adds .
" We used different fat tissues from multiple patients and got the same negative response to BPA . "

They left an enormous chaos and stole all of the hard - drives including our project data .
After arriving at the place on Tuesday morning , we only found a note from the scoundrels .
Our team started the investigation immediately .
This morning we traced Flap and Guido near the Franco - German border .
They 've stolen our company car , too , which led us to them .
Luckily , the game data is ours again .
Back at the mindFactory office :
After retrieving the game data this morning , we found out that the story is completely messed up .
At some points the story is n't clear for the player .
Consequently , we decided not to release the game as it is on the 21st of August .
This being the case , we decided to fix these errors .
As a result , your game experience will improve .
Since there 's not much time left until the release , we need your help hunting the bugs in Broken Sword 2.5 .
So , we are asking you for assistance .
Write an application as a beta tester between the 1st of August and the 21st of August .
Further explanations are below .
The beta testing is necessary and takes time .
The testing period ends on the 27th of September and shortly afterwards Broken Sword 2.5 will be published .
You can apply from the 1st of August in our forum ( and only there ) , therefore you need to have an account there .
So , create dxdiag .
txt file with the DirextX Diagnostic Tool , which should be installed on your computer ( from the start menu , choose run ; type " dxdiag " ; when the diagnostic tool launches , click " Save All Information " and save the dxdiag .
txt file wherever you like ) .
Then write a private message to a group named " Beta - Tester " ( go to your private messages , click " New message " and there will be a box , in which you can select a group " Beta - Tester " ; or click on the link ) with the information from the dxdiag .
txt file in the content .
That 's it .
On the 21st of August you will be informed ( by a PM ) whether you were accepted as a tester ( sorry , but we can't accept all of the applications ) .
We are terribly sorry to postpone the release date , but since we want to answer your hopes , we have no choice .
So , we would like to appologize to those who are so eagerly waiting for the new comic - style broken sword game and have already waited for so long .
Just wait a wee bit longer .

Show comments A DREAM COMES TRUE written on 04.13.2008 at 05:37 pm I close my eyes .
Many thoughts had flashed across my mind .
Some of them fade from my memory , others become sharper — like looking through a lens .
Seven years later I reopen my eyes .
Only one vision lasts all the others : the dream of Broken Sword 2.5 !
Besides lots of prosperous days , many deadlocks had to be broken .
Therefore I 'm proud of this highly motivated and creative team , who created a successor to Broken Sword 2 .
And it corresponds exactly to the wishes of the team .
One question is n't answered yet .
After months and years without an exact release date , we 're going to announce it today : Broken Sword 2.5 will be available on August 21st , 2008 .
Then you will be able to download the full version for free from this website .
It will come with German voices and English subtitles .
We 're working on English voices , too .
More information related on this will be available soon .
Count the remaining days with us !

This election has never been about John McCain — though his candidacy is sure to revive a debate about the worst presidential candidates of all time .
No , this is a referendum on Barack Obama .
And many Republicans are exuding the confidence of a hopelessly quixotic sports fan — a person who watches his atrocious team struggle for three quarters with the false expectation that some miraculous comeback is imminent in the fourth .
It rarely is .
McCain has consistently remained inconsistent , vacillating between promises and populism .
From his support of cap - and - trade to his actions during the bailout , McCain ’s positions seem entirely focused on winning the middle - of - the - road vote .
No modern Republican has ever won the presidency solely focused on the ambivalent squishy inattentive center .
These people do n’t care enough to name their political party , much less pay attention .
But he ’s a maverick .
One of McCain ’s central arguments has been his uncompromising valor in opposing the Bush administration .
Here ’s a newsbreak : Disagreeing with the Bush administration on a handful of issues ( often the wrong ones , in McCain ’s case ) does n’t make you a maverick , it makes you an average American .
And , sadly , the second debate proved that McCain would be incapable of making his party ’s philosophical or political case even if he genuinely tried .
When Obama claims , as he did during the second debate , that raising taxes on the rich is the equivalent of giving them a “ break , ” McCain , terrified of defending anyone in a Lexus , failed to make an assertive case that economic freedom helps everyone .
When Obama claimed he would lower income taxes for 95 percent of Americans even though nearly 40 percent of households do n’t pay a single cent in income taxes , McCain just smiled .
When Obama continued his absurd insistence that our financial mess was caused only by Bush - era “ deregulation , ” McCain struggled to place the blame where it belongs : on government meddling .
And when Obama contended his economic plan would be a “ net ” cut in spending , McCain should have spit the water out of his mouth like a character on a TV sitcom — because that ’s exactly what the senior senator from Arizona is starring in .
Those Republicans anticipating a fourth - quarter comeback during the debate were instead hit with a wet fish .
Did the putative Republican candidate just propose that the U.S. Treasury renegotiate millions of mortgages at a better price ?
Was McCain simply unable to articulate a more complex position ?
It sounded a lot like a comprehensive nationalization of the mortgage industry .
It sounded a lot like hundreds of billions of additional tax dollars .
Yep , he meant it .
It ’s called the American Homeownership Resurgence .
It will stabilize the economy .
And Obama will stop global warming .
And McCain will find bin Laden , even if he has to do it with his bare hands .
And . . . well , at this pace , we ’re about two debates away from being promised free lemonade and snicker doodles .
None of these promises have worked .
So now the McCain campaign will set its sights on Bill Ayers , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Tony Rezko and other members of the Legion of Doom .
All of them are legitimate topics for conversation , but with less than a month to go , the conversation reeks of desperation .
In fact , the entire campaign has been one big act of publicity stunts .
McCain ’s shining moment this campaign , as far as I can tell , was a funny ad comparing Obama to Paris Hilton .
What McCain ’s candidacy does tell us is that the Republican Party — even if it somehow miraculously pulls this one out — is in need of some creative destruction .
Not ideological purity but ideological renewal .
Because being a “ maverick ” is a political slogan , not a political philosophy .

The trailer for the upcomingmovie “ ” is currently playing in front of Eastwood ’s “ ” which will opens in US cinemas .
In “ Gran Torino ” Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski , an iron - willed veteran living in a changing world , who is forced by his immigrant neighbors to confront his own long - held prejudices .
Eastwood is producing , directing and even composing music for movies at an age when other filmmakers would be retired .
The screenplay was written by newcomer ( I Shot Myself ) with story assistance from first - timer .
Warner Brothers has scheduled a limited December 17th release for Gran Torino , which puts Eastwood and company into Oscar consideration again .
Thanks to the dozens of people who sent this along .
Sometime around the eighth or ninth email it dawned on me that people were n’t sending this so that I could read it , they were sending in the hopes that I would read and then comment on it .
Stardock president Brad Wardell wrote the following for Edge Magazine .
Do go and read the whole thing for context .
1. Gamers shall have the right to return games that do n’t work with their computers for a full refund .
I wish Stardock had the muscle to make this a reality in the retail world .
They can let retailers know that they will accept returned goods , but no store is going to want to establish a return policy of accepting returns of some games and not others , based on who the publisher is .
It ’s easier to just keep going with the “ all sales final ” deal customers have already gotten used to .
2. Gamers shall have the right to demand that games be released in a finished state .
This was one of the first “ rights ” we lost .
As the internet grew in popularity , publishers became increasingly likely to launch and patch .
Which means the presence of the internet was hurting us long before it was hurting them .
3 . Gamers shall have the right to expect meaningful updates after a game ’s release .
I can’t imagine demanding this as a right .
The deal I ’ve always wanted with publishers is this : I give you my money , and you give me a finished game .
The transaction is then concluded .
I should n’t need to connect to their server ( for a single - player game ) or pay more money , and assuming the game works as advertised they do n’t owe me anything .
Keeping the game working on future computers is my problem .
Having said that , any company that wants to give me free stuff after the fact ( which is how Stardock does business ) builds up goodwill and customer loyalty .
4. Gamers shall have the right to demand that download managers and updaters not force themselves to run or be forced to load in order to play a game .
Time elapsed between clicking on “ Steam ” and the point where “ My Games ” list appears : 45 seconds .
Steam has its good points , and it ’s pretty much the only way to get demos these days without needing to navigate the Fileplanet obstacle course .
But making the launcher a requirement for launching their games is a needless annoyance and a time sink .
Also , I ’ve always wanted an option to have Steam close automatically when I exit the game .
The standard question applies :
What if everyone had a mandatory “ launcher ” with their software that behaved the way Steam does ?
5 . Gamers shall have the right to expect that the minimum requirements for a game will mean that the game will adequately play on that computer .
The odd thing about this one is how many fanboys disagree .
My posts on The Witcher and Oblivion both drew a collection of ankle - biting idiots who thought that “ recommended ” means “ minimum ” and “ minimum ” means “ loser ” .
In addition to insisting that a machine with the “ minimum requirements ” deliver a playable experience , I would add that minimum requirements should be easy to grasp .
Stuff like this :
Video Card - Direct X 9.0 c compliant video card with 128MB RAM ( NVIDIA 6600 or better / ATI X1300 or better , excluding ATI X1550 ) .
… is just asinine .
You ’re expected to know the technical details of the graphics chipsets in your machine , and what level of Direct X they can handle , and understand how these clueless companies name their series .
It ’s insane .
Sadly , this one is largely the fault of the hardware companies , and I do n’t see what publishers can do about it .
Still , this is very bad for PC gaming , and is exacerbating the “ minimum requirements ” issue .
6 . Gamers shall have the right to expect that games wo n’t install hidden drivers or other potentially harmful software without their express consent .
Consumers have a right to expect that toaster manufacturers wo n’t break into their house at some point after bringing their new toaster home .
Only in the world of software is this sort of insanity tolerated .
7. Gamers shall have the right to re-download the latest versions of the games they own at any time .
Again , I consider this to be above and beyond normal customer service .
If I scratch one of my CD ’s , I do n’t expect the record company to provide another .
If they did , or offered me another as the cost of the disc , I ’d be grateful , but I do n’t consider this as a required part of the transaction .
8. Gamers shall have the right to not be treated as potential criminals by developers or publishers .
This is a subject which I have beaten into the ground , so I wo n’t belabor the point here .
9 . Gamers shall have the right to demand that a single - player game not force them to be connected to the Internet every time they wish to play .
Uh .
I would actually change “ every time they wish to play ” to “ ever ” .
As in , I get my game , and we ’re done .
If the game forces me to connect for permission to play , then I do n’t really own the game .
I rail against all DRM , but online activation is where I ’ve drawn the line .
It ’s prevented the purchase of many titles I ’ve wanted very badly , and will prevent the purchase of many more .
It ’s the one form of DRM that does n’t just make the software difficult to use , it changes the very nature of ownership , so that my purchase can be revoked or lost at any time due to forces beyond my control .
It does n’t matter how “ easy ” or “ convenient ” they make it , if I must connect to to play my game – even once – then I do n’t own it .
If you want to lure me into connecting by offering me free stuff ( as Stardock does ) then that ’s acceptable .
But the stuff in the box is mine , or the deal is off .
10 .
Gamers shall have the right that games which are installed to the hard drive shall not require a CD / DVD to remain in the drive to play .
You could make the case that this is just a specific example of # 8 above .
But this is an important one to a lot of people , especially those using laptops .
Hilarious new video from Jed Lewison :
And some of the comments on his site are equally hilarious :
私たちの入り口はスライドドアを使用しているので、防犯対策が心配であると多くの人が話しています。
確かに、スライドドアは開扉より防犯の影響を受けやすく、鳥の巣の侵入を許可するのは簡単です。
しかし、スライドドアには防犯が施されている。
入 り口のスライドドアの防犯についてもっと知っていれば、日常生活の安全にも大きく貢献しています。
次に、すぐに入り口のスライドドアの犯罪防止について説明しましょう。
スライドドアの犯罪防止対策は難しい…
スライドドアは、屋内のガラスからの光を取り入れやすい前面に物がある場合でも開口するなどの利点があります。
しかし、エントランスのスライドドアの防犯対策は、一般のオープンドアよりも困難になる傾向があります。
まず、理由を説明します。
ドアプレート間に隙間ができやすい
スライドドアは、2つのボードを上下にスライドさせることによって開閉することができるが、必然的にそれらの間に隙間が必然的に生じるため、スライドドアなどに比べて気密性が低くなる。
その結果、空のギャップから何らかのものを取り出すことが容易になります。
ガラスが使用されています
滑りはしばしばスライドドアに使用されます。
室内に光を取り入れるなど、ガラスも有益ですが、防犯上は不利になります。
それが鈍器で殴られた場合、それは簡単に亀裂を生じ、内部に入るでしょう。
実際、これらのスライドドアは空き地を容易にターゲットにしています。
このようにして、スライドドアは空間的および物理的に弱い傾向がある。
次の章では、埋め込まれた巣を持つスライドドアを実際に標的にする方法について説明します。
一緒に覚えておきたいことは何ですか？
空の猟犬の方法の中で最も一般的であると言われているものは、ロックを忘れることを目指しています。
ガラス割れとは、ロックされたキーを取り除いて内部に侵入する窓ガラスなどを壊す方法です。
近年では、洗練された音や音が殆どないような工夫や、植物帯のような大きな音でも面白くない場所を目指すなど、悪意のあるものになっています。
普通の戸建て住宅では、窓ガラスなどを対象とした行為ですが、スライドドアの場合はもう1つの窓のようなもので、獲物を簡単に食べることができます。
入り口のスライドドアの防犯は様々な要因で困難です。
しかし、手が全くないというわけではありません。
次に、入り口のスライドドアの防犯対策について紹介します。
ネバーギブアップ ！
スライドドアにも使用できる防犯対策
入り口のスライドドアの防犯対策として、以下のことが考えられる。
■破損しにくい防犯ガラスを取り付ける
ガラス自体を破壊しにくいものに交換することは非常に効果的です。
労働の負担を嫌う傾向があります。
ダブルグレージングの内部に樹脂層を設けた防犯用合わせガラスなど、破損しにくい素材に置き換えて侵入を断念することができます。
■ピックアップしにくいキーに切り替えます
ガラスをどれだけ強くしても、鍵を開くとあなたは侵略されます。
最近、キーをあまり変更しないと、簡単に選択できる古いタイプのキーを使用している可能性があります。
キーを変更してピッキングに強いスライドドアを作成することで、セキュリティをさらに向上させることができます。鍵交換に出張
■引き戸のキーを大きくする
キーを増やすことも効果的なセキュリティ対策です。
とにかく時間がかかることが嫌いなので、鍵を追加してもあきらめます。
このキーは同じキーにすることができます。
キーを作成していない限り、いくつかのキーを分けることとほぼ同じ効果が期待できます。
■取り外し可能なサムターンを使用
Samturnは、内側のキーを開閉するのに使用される金具です。
私はガラスを壊すときに私の内側の親指の回転からロックを解除しようとします。
親指の回転を外すだけで、悪い家に入る可能性を減らすことができます。
Sam Turn Guardで親指の回転を外から開くのが難しいことも効果的です。
2つのスライドドア用防犯アイテム
光学防犯フィルム透明ガラス用2枚BGF
4739
防犯フィルムは、ガラスをガラスに貼り付けることで衝撃に強くするセキュリティーグッズです。
ガラスに亀裂が入っても飛散することなく、ひび割れだけの形状を保ちます。
亀裂があっても、手を入れるための穴が開かない。
欠員対策には非常に有効です。
サイ（seiei）スーパーマドガチットブロンズ5×6.5〜9.5×3.4cm 2個セット
補助錠を取り付けてキーを開くことができても、侵入を防ぐことができます。
新しい鍵を取り付けするよりも簡単ですので、迅速な防犯を希望する方にお勧めです。
スライドドア2-654用のベスト545ドアチェーン
スライドドアのチェーンです。
通常のチェーンと同じように使用できるので、万一補助錠のようにキーを開けてもスライドドアが完全に開かないようにすることができます。
まとめ
スライドドアには、吸い込みや換気など様々なメリットがありますが、ガラスの使用による物理的な破壊には弱いです。
開いたドアと比べて空の鳥の中に侵入する方が簡単なので、開いたドアとは違った防犯手段が必要です。
玄関の引き戸の防犯性能を高めたい場合は、防犯用合板ガラスなどの破壊に強いガラスを貼るだけで埋設巣の侵入の可能性を下げることができます。
複数のキー 。
補助ロックとチェーンを追加することで、より強力な保護を構築することもできます。
スライドドアをしっかりと理解して安全な家を作りましょう。

WASHINGTON , May 27 ( Reuters ) - Groups that monitor Islamic
Web sites say al Qaeda will post a new video in the next 24 hours urging jihadists to use biological , chemical and nuclear weapons to attack the West , the FBI said on Tuesday .
Spokesman Richard Kolko said FBI sent out an alert to U.S. law enforcement agencies about the expected video .
" We got information the tape is coming , " said Kolko .
" We sent out an alert to law enforcement ( agencies ) to let them know the tape was coming . "
Kolko said the alert was a routine precaution sent to 1,800 U.S. law enforcement agencies .
According to an ABC
News report , the FBI bulletin said there is no evidence of any direct threat .
Kolko said the information about the al Qaeda call to jihadists was gleaned from organizations that monitor Islamic militant Web sites .
Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda are linked to the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington that killed around 3,000 people , the Oct. 12 , 2002 attack when 202 people died in blasts on the tourist island of Bali .

You ain't got the balls to be a fucking manager .
Fucking day off .
Do I want your opinion .
Do I have to listen to you ?

JK I can't trust any of you .
Niall Hickman
Joe , no one could believe that on your first day at your new club , the first - team players were not in .
No one could believe it in town .
Your first day in the office .
JK
My first day was with the coaches .
I made the decision that I wanted to get as much information out of them .
NH
But why Monday , no one could believe it ?
JK I 'm not going to tell you anything .
I do n't understand where you are coming from .
You are delighted that Newcastle are getting beat and are in the state they are ?
Delighted , are you ?
NH Certainly not .
No one wants to see them get beaten , why would we ?
JK I have done it before .
It is going to my fucking lawyers .
So are about three others .
If they can find something in it that is a court case it is going to court .
I am not fucking about .
I do n't talk to fucking anybody .
It is raking up stories .
You are fucking so fucking slimy you are raking up players that I got rid of .
Players that I had fallen out with .
You are not asking Robbie Earle , because he is sensible .
You are not asking Warren Barton ?
No .
Because he is fucking sensible .
Anyone who had played for me for 10 years at any level ... [ but ] you will find some cunt that ...
Other journalist
How long is your contract for Joe ?
JK None of your business .
SB Well it is actually , because we cover the club .
The club say you are here to the end of October , then you say six to eight games which would take it to the end of November .
We are trying to clarify these issues .
We are getting no straight answers from anyone .
How long are you here for .
It is a dead simple question .
And you do n't know ...
JK I was told the length of contract .
Then I was told that possibly the club could be sold in that time .
That is as far as I know .
That 's it finished .
I do n't know anything else .
But I have been ridiculed .
He 's trying to fucking hide , he 's trying to do this or that .
There follows an exchange regarding the circumstances under which Kinnear had met the owner Mike Ashley and executive director ( football ) Dennis Wise .
Steve Brenner ( football writer for the Sun )
We are all grown men and can come in here and sit around and talk about football , but coming in here and calling people cunts ?
JK Why ?
Because I am annoyed .
I am not accepting that .
If it is libellous , it is going to where I want it to go .
Newcastle press officer
What has been said in here is off the record and does n't go outside .
Journalist Well , is that what Joe thinks ?
JK Write what you like .
Makes no difference to me .
Do n't affect me I assure you .
It 'll be the last time I see you anyway .
Wo n't affect me .
See how we go at Everton and Chrissy [ Chris Hughton , assistant manager ] can do it , someone else can do it .
Do n't trust any of yous .
I will pick two local papers and speak to them and the rest can fuck off .
I ain't coming up here to have the piss taken out of me .
I have a million pages of crap that has been written about me .
I 'm ridiculed for no reason .
I 'm defenceless .
I can't get a point in , I can't say nothing , I can't do nothing , but I ai n't going to be negative .
Then , half of you , most of you are trying to get into the players .
I 'm not going to tell you what the players think of you , so then you try and get into them in some way or another , so I 've got a split camp or something like that , something like that .
It 's ongoing .
It just does n't stop .
Journalist
It 's only been a week .
JK Exactly .
It feels more like a year .
Journalist
It 's early days for you to be like this .
JK No , I 'm clearing the air .
And this is the last time I 'm going to speak to you .
You want to know why , I 'm telling you .
This is the last time .
You can do what you like .
Journalist
But this is n't going to do you or us any good .
JK I 'll speak to the supporters .
I 'm going to tell them what the story is .
I 'm going to tell them .
I do n't think they 'll interpret it any different , I do n't think they 'll mix it up , I do n't think they 'll miss out things .
I mean , one of them last week said to me ...
I was talking about in that press conference where you were there , I said something like " Well , that 's a load of bollocks ... "
Journalist " Bollocks to that " is what you said .
JK Bollocks to that .
And what goes after that ?
Journalist
That was it .
JK
No it was n't , no it was n't .
What was after it ?
I do n't know if it was your paper , but what went after it ?
Journalist I do n't know .
JK
It even had the cheek to say " bollocks to Newcastle " .
Journalist I did n't write that .
JK
That was my first fucking day .
What does that tell you ?
What does that tell you ?
Journalist
Where was that ?
Which paper said that ?
JK I 've got it .
I can't remember .
It was one of the Sundays , not a Saturday .
It was a Sunday .
Journalist
But you did n't say that to the Sundays , you said that to us .
That was during the Monday press conference .
JK I 'll bring it in and show it to you .
Why would I want to say that ?
Journalist
Are you saying that someone has reported you saying " bollocks to Newcastle ? "
JK Yes .
Lovely .
Journalist I do n't know who 's reported that .
JK I 'll tell you what , I 'll bring it in .
Journalist
That 's obviously going to damage you .
That 's not a good thing .
But I do n't think someone 's done that .
We have to have some sort of relationship with you .
JK
So have I .
But I have n't come in here for you lot to take the piss out of me .
And if I 'm not flavour of the month for you , it do n't fucking bother me .
I 've got a job to do .
And I 'm going to do it to the best of my ability .
I 'm not going to spend any more time listening to any crap or reading any crap .
Stick to the truth and the facts .
And do n't twist anything .
Journalist
You know , you know the game ...
JK
Of course I know , but I do n't have to like it .
Journalist Today we 'll print the absolute truth , that you think we 're cunts , we can all fuck off and we 're slimy .
Is that fair enough ?
JK Do it .
Fine .
Fucking print it .
Am I going to worry about it ?
Put in also that it 'll be the last time I see you .
Put that in as well .
Good .
Do it .
Much , much later after long discussions over whether Kinnear had promised Alan Shearer and Kevin Keegan would be returning to the club
Press officer
Let 's get on to football .
Let 's have an agreement that everything said so far , if anyone has got their tapes on , it 's wiped off and we 're not discussing it .
Journalist
But that 's what Joe has said he thinks of us .
Press officer I 'm saying do n't push it .
Let 's accept what 's been said and try and move on .
Journalist : Move on to not doing any more press conferences ?
PO : No , to doing something now .
Journalist : What , one press conference only ?
( Silence )
Journalist :
Any knocks ?
PO : Come on , let 's go football .
Journalist :
What are your plans for training in the next three days ?
How 's the training going ?
JK
It 's going very well .
No problems at all .
Journalist Enjoyed getting back in the swing of things ?
JK Absolutely .
I 've loved every moment of it .
What if you could take along your strong and speedy home Wi -Fi connection wherever you go ?
That ’s the idea behind a new service from Sprint called Xohm , which takes Wi -Fi to its logical extreme .
Fittingly , the technology behind it is called WiMax .
Although it is n’t widely deployed in the United States , a test run of the service in Baltimore , where it was recently introduced , suggests that it could one day become a solid option for getting things done online and even making phone calls while on the go .
Of course , there are plenty of reasons the technology could also become a historical footnote , not the least of which is that it wo n’t work everywhere in a given city , much less all over the country .
So - called mobile hot spot Internet services sold by cell carriers , including Sprint , have much greater range .
But for those living in an area Xohm covers  the service arrives in Washington and Chicago in the coming months , with Boston , Philadelphia , Dallas , Fort Worth and Providence , R.I. , to follow  the monthly outlay of $ 35 to $ 65 could be well worth it .
For $ 35 , subscribers get home broadband service that they can share among multiple computers ; $ 45 lets you connect at home or on the road with one laptop or other mobile device , and $ 65 broadens that to cover multiple devices .
The prospect of getting speedy wireless service outside your house while also tearing up your contract with your home Internet service may appeal to many , because that combination is not available with data services from cell carriers .
( CNN ) --
If you 're lying awake at night , feeling angry or fatigued , because of stress , you 're in the majority , according to a nationwide report released Tuesday .
Anxieties about the economy are not only affecting Wall Street , but also 8 out of 10 Americans .
As many as 80 percent of Americans are stressed about their personal finances and the economy , according to the annual survey conducted by the American Psychological Association .
Top sources of stress in previous years were personal finances , work and issues related to raising children , said Dr. Katherine Nordal , the association 's executive director for professional practice .
" This year , the jump was marked in that the No. 1 concern is both money and the economy , " she said .
" In my 30 years of experience , in the past , this was not the thing that would be high in complaint lists .
Most people are driven to counseling because of relationship problems with marriage and children , depression and anxiety .
But what we 're seeing today is that the economy and finances are viewed as significantly more stressful , by more than 8 out of 10 Americans . "
See how the numbers of stressed Americans grew this year »
Nearly 7,000 Americans responded to the survey between April and September this year .
Within five months , anxiety about the economy had jumped from 66 percent to 80 percent .
The poll was conducted before the passage of the $ 700 billion bailout bill last week and Monday 's stock market tumble .
Half of the respondents in the survey said they are increasingly stressed about their ability to provide for their family 's basic needs .
More than half , 56 percent , expressed concerns about job stability .
This has translated into less productivity at work , because of anxieties about salary , heavy workload and job security .
Women are more worried than men , in terms of their personal finances , the economy , work , housing costs and job stability , according to the survey .
" The declining state of the nation 's economy is taking a physical and emotional toll on people nationwide , and it is women who are bearing the brunt of financial stress , " according to the survey .
They are more stressed out because they 're less economically secure than men , said Barbara Gault , vice president and director of research at the Institute for Women 's Policy Research .
" Many women are one divorce away from poverty .
Women have more to worry about in terms of economic security and are more likely to be poor in old age than men , " she said .
Older Americans also cited money as a source of stress , more so than younger generations .
In the survey , 79 percent of the baby boomers and 73 percent of those who are 63 years and older identified money as a source of stress .
Mounting anxieties led 60 percent of poll respondents to report that they 're feeling angry and irritable , 53 percent reported feeling fatigued and 52 percent said they lie awake at night .

As many as 47 percent reported having headaches , 35 percent had upset stomachs and 34 percent experienced muscular tension because of stress .
" We have a significant number of people reporting physical signs and symptoms of stress : muscle tension , headache , difficulty falling asleep , " Nordal said .
" Stress warning signs should be ringing all over the place .
One of the interesting things is while the majority of Americans thought they 're managing stress well , many were reporting physical symptoms . "
To cope with stress , 48 percent of the respondents said they have overeaten or consumed fatty , unhealthy food .
Nordal said people need to pay attention to the warning signs of stress .
" It should be a wake - up call for folks , " she said .
" It 's like the check engine light on the dashboard .
If you do n't pay attention to it and take your car to the mechanic , you 're going to end up with a major engine malfunction .
In that same way , if you put your head in the sand and ignore the headache , the chest pains , the muscle tension , they will eventually catch up with you . "
All About Stress • National Economy
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - National City Corp , a U.S. Midwest regional bank hard hit by the credit crisis , on Tuesday announced plans to slash 4,000 jobs and said rising reserves for soured mortgage and real estate construction loans led to its fifth straight quarterly loss .
The job cuts amount to 14 percent of the bank ’s workforce and are expected to take place over three years .
They are part of an efficiency program designed to save $ 500 million to $ 600 million annually by 2011 .
Shares of National City fell 17 cents to $ 2.75 in premarket trading .
Investors have pummeled the bank ’s shares , which fell as low as $ 1.25 on September 29 , amid concern that mounting loan losses might cause National City to run short of capital , and perhaps even fail .
Core deposits fell $ 5.5 billion in the three months ended September 30 to $ 85.6 billion , in part because depositors withdrew balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits .
National City has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it has enough capital to make it through the current credit cycle without doing fire sales of any assets .
Chief Executive Peter Raskind said the bank would consider participating in U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s plan to inject $ 250 billion into the banking system .
“ We are not expecting any particular respite environmentally in the foreseeable future , ” Raskind said on a conference call .
Still , he added , “ We believe we ’ll emerge from this difficult environment as a much stronger organization . ”
National City ’s third - quarter net loss was $ 729 million , or $ 5.86 per share , and compared with a loss of $ 19 million , or 3 cents , a year earlier .
Results reflected a $ 4.4 billion preferred dividend paid in September as part of a $ 7 billion capital - raising completed in April from Corsair Capital LLC and other investors .
Excluding that item , the loss was 85 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates , compared with analysts ’ average forecast for a loss of 37 cents per share .
National City said that under a different accounting method , the quarterly loss would have been 37 cents per share .
National City set aside $ 1.18 billion for loan losses , up from $ 368 million a year earlier but down from $ 1.59 billion in the second quarter .
A majority of the increased reserve was tied to a $ 21 billion portfolio of home equity , subprime residential construction , automobile , marine and recreational vehicle loans that the bank is trying to exit .
The portfolio was $ 17 billion three months earlier .
National City has been burdened with lower - quality mortgages it kept when it sold its First Franklin Financial Corp subprime business to Merrill Lynch & Co in 2006 .
It has also been hurt by its acquisitions in 2006 and early 2007 of two Florida banks .
It ended September with a Tier - 1 capital ratio , which measures its ability to cover losses , of 10.98 percent .
Regulators say 6 percent reflects a “ well - capitalized ” bank .
Assets fell to $ 145 billion from $ 153.7 billion three months earlier .
“ National City continues to work down the liquidating portfolio and has more than adequate capital to absorb losses , ” wrote Keith Horowitz , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets .
Shares of National City closed Monday at $ 2.92 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The shares have fallen 82 percent this year , compared with a 35 percent drop in the KBW Bank Index .
SAN FRANCISCO -- Scientists at the University at Buffalo have shown that marijuana - like compounds called anandamides , found in the testis , uterus and oviduct , may play a role in regulating functions of human sperm and influence their ability to fertilize eggs .
The study , presented here today ( Dec. 15 , 1998 ) at the meeting of the American Society of Cell Biology , showed that human sperm contain receptors for cannabinoids -- chemical compounds such as THC , the active substance in marijuana smoke .
Further , the study showed for the first time that cannabinoids can affect three key fertilization processes :
Inhibition of acrosome reaction , the normal release of the sperm enzymes that enable sperm to penetrate the egg .
Regulation of very active sperm swimming patterns , called hyperactivation .
Prevention of sperm binding to the egg cover , or zona .
The findings could have significant implications for diagnosis of infertility and understanding basic human biology and molecular control , said Herbert Schuel , Ph.D. , professor of anatomy and cell biology at the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and co-author of the study .
" We 've known for 30 years that very heavy marijuana smoking has a drastic effect on sperm production within the testis , which can lead to higher rates of infertility , " Schuel said .
" Our new findings suggest that anandamides and THC in marijuana smoke may also affect sperm functions required for fertilization in the female reproductive tract .
" The additional load of cannabinoids in the systems of people who abuse marijuana floods the natural cannabinoid receptors and appears to have adverse consequences for reproduction in both males and females . "
Pioneering work by Schuel and colleagues previously had shown that sperm from the sea urchin have a recognition site , or receptor , for cannabinoids .
They also provided evidence that cannabinoids and anandamides can prevent sea-urchin sperm from fertilizing eggs by preventing the sperm acrosome reaction when they arrive at the egg surface .
Washing away the cannabinoids reversed the inhibitory effects .
The current research on human fertilization was carried out in collaboration with Lani J. Burkman , Ph.D. , director of the Andrology Section ( the study of male fertility / infertility ) in the UB medical school , and Alex Makriyannis , Ph.D. , professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Connecticut .
These researchers have found that human sperm contain functional cannabinoid receptors , allowing THC from marijuana , as well as natural cannabinoids ( anandamides ) , to bind to sperm .
During normal reproduction , fluids within the female reproductive tract prepare the sperm to fertilize the egg -- to swim vigorously and undergo the acrosome reaction when they arrive at the egg 's zona .
The researchers mimicked these processes in vitro by incubating the sperm in special media , which stimulate hyperactivated swimming and can produce premature acrosome reactions without the presence of an egg .
In 30 trials using modified fertility laboratory procedures , Schuel , Burkman and colleagues incubated pre-screened human sperm in this stimulating medium containing different concentrations of THC or AM - 356 , a synthetic equivalent of the natural anandamide .
Samples were removed at various intervals up to six hours and assessed for changes in the acrosome , motility and vigorous swimming patterns , and for sperm binding to nonviable zona .
Results showed that after six hours , sperm exposed to THC or AM - 356 had a 67 percent reduction in premature acrosome reactions , compared to controls .
This finding implies that anandamides normally may prevent such premature acrosome reactions within the female reproductive tract .
Motility studies showed that higher levels of AM - 356 inhibited hyperactivated swimming , while lower concentrations actually stimulated hyperactivation .
These results suggest that fluctuations in anandamide levels in the oviduct may regulate sperm swimming patterns and affect the optimal timing for the sperm to meet the egg .
In the zona experiments , AM - 356 inhibited sperm binding by 75 percent , and provided the first evidence that anandamides and cannabinoids can directly affect the fertilizing capacity of human sperm .

Gladwell ’s article , titled Late bloomers :
Why do we equate genius with precocity ? , makes one major mistake in not addressing the questions researchers have about the notion of genius .
Entire books have been written with the premise that there really is no such thing as a genius in the sense most people use it , and that the distinctions of ‘ prodigy ’ and ‘ genius ’ are so abused and misunderstood as to be useless .
This essay uses the idea of ‘ the young genius ’ as a point of leverage for late bloomers , suggesting that you are either one or the other ( this is the core thesis of economics professor David Galenson ’s book , Old Masters and Young Geniuses , whom Gladwell quotes in the article ) .
Dualism of this kind is dangerous and nearly always misleading .
It brings to mind that old joke : there are two kinds of people in the world , those that think there are two kinds of people in the world , and those that do n’t .
The more I ’ve studied creative thinking the more convinced I am these sweeping categorizations are 1 ) supported by selective research 2 ) not the best tools for those who want to follow creative paths themselves .
Gladwell wrote :
Picasso was the incandescent prodigy .
His career as a serious artist began with a masterpiece , Evocation : The Burial of Casagemas produced at age twenty .
In short order , he painted many of the greatest works of his career , including Les Demoiselles at the age of twenty - six .
Picasso fit our usual ideas about genius perfectly .
But what are those ideas ?
He does n’t say .
I think most people imagine young Pablo , if he were a genius , learning to paint largely on his own .
I think it ’d be a surprise to learn his father was a painter , and taught Picasso to draw and paint from a very young age , sent him to an excellent art school as a youth , and encouraged his trips to Paris , where he quickly made an amazing assortment of connections in the art scene before he was 25 .
Similar family and community support can be found in the story of Mozart ( his father was also a musician who trained him early ) .
Who your parents were is hugely significant in the history of prodigies and geniuses .
Another fact that does n’t usually fit our idea of genius : at the time Picasso painted Evocation , he was basically starving in Paris , in a situation similar to Van Gogh ’s a few decades earlier , faced with the choice on many mornings of buying food or buying paint .
Picasso had been working seriously , by most definitions , for years before Evocation was finished .
We do n’t think of people with prodigious , gifted talents starving and struggling , but there he was .
Another counterpoint is that Picasso had a ridiculously vibrant painting career that spanned decades – one of his greatest works , Guernica , was made at the age of 56 .
The passage from Gladwell hints that his 20s were his best work , but that ’s not true .
It was an intense time of productivity , but not the only productive time in his life .
Gladwell continues :
Prodigies like Picasso , Galenson argues , rarely engage in that kind of open - ended exploration .
They tend to be â€œconceptual , â€ Galenson says , in the sense that they start with a clear idea of where they want to go , and then they execute it .
â€ œI can hardly understand the importance given to the word â€˜research , â€™ â€ Picasso once said in an interview with the artist Marius de Zayas .
â€ œIn my opinion , to search means nothing in painting .
To find is the thing.â€ 
He continued , â€ œThe several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution or as steps toward an unknown ideal of painting .
. . .
I have never made trials or experiments.â€ 
This is an outright contradiction of Picasso ’s performance in the documentary The Mystery of Picasso , where he spends 70 minutes revealing his creative process as a series of experiments , risks and gambles .
Over the course of an amazing hour we see him take risks , make mistakes , and continually reinvent and change individual paintings .
It ’s a rare and amazing thing for any artist to expose themselves in this way , much less the difficult and reclusive Picasso , but he seems , on camera to take deep pride in his creative experimentation .
Nothing can stop Picasso from having contradicted himself , but if he did , both ends of the contradiction have value in this discussion .
More to my point , there is a huge inventory of creators who have been called geniuses who mention experimentation as a critical to their creative process .
They include Frank Lloyd Wright , Hemingway , David Byrne , Miles Davis , Paul Simon , and on it goes .
Finally , Gladwell offers :
This is the final lesson of the late bloomer : his or her success is highly contingent on the efforts of others .
In biographies of CÃ©zanne , Louis - Auguste invariably comes across as a kind of grumpy philistine , who didnâ€™t appreciate his sonâ€™s genius .
But Louis - Auguste didnâ€™t have to support CÃ©zanne all those years .
He would have been within his rights to make his son get a real job , just as Sharie might well have said no to her husbandâ€™s repeated trips to the chaos of Haiti .
But what is not mentioned is the amazing social network that enabled and supported young Picasso to do what he did .
Dependence on the effort of others is not a factor exclusive to late bloomers .
On his first trip to Paris , he quickly met Max Jacob , who taught him French and French culture – they ’d share a room for years .
He had many friends in the art scene in those early years , including Andre Breton ( founder of surrealism ) , Gertrude Stein , and Henry Matisse .
Not a bad crowd to get advice from for an artist in his 20s .
He also befriended artist George Braque , and through collaboration they would develop a little thing called cubism together .

Update : Video from The Young Turks !
Voters are rightfully upset in West Virginia when they pushed the screen for Obama it changed to McCain .
Shelba Ketchum , a 69 - year - old retired nurse had this to say to reporters .
“ I pushed buttons and they all came up Republican , ” she said .
“ I hit Obama and it switched to McCain .
I am really concerned about that .
If McCain wins , there was something wrong with the machines .
“ I asked them for a printout of my votes , ” Ketchum said .
“ But they said it was in the machine and I could not get it .
I did not feel right when I left the courthouse .
My son felt the same way .
“ I heard from some other people they also had trouble .
But no one in there knew how to fix it , ” said Ketchum , who is not related to Menis Ketchum , a Democratic Supreme Court candidate .
Democracy
Now notes , these problems only seem to be in two counties in West Virginia .
In West Virginia , voters in at least two counties using touchscreen voting machines have claimed their votes were switched from Democrat to Republican .
Six voters reported having this problem in Jackson and Putnam Counties .
In both counties , Republicans are responsible for overseeing elections .
Election officials blamed voters for not being more careful .
Both counties use machines made by Election Systems & Software .
: : : : : : : : : :
The Charleston Gazette has comments from other voters who experienced problems .
Ketchum ’s son , Chris , said he had the same problem .
And Bobbi Oates of Scott Depot said her vote for incumbent Democratic Sen. John D. Rockefeller was switched to GOP opponent Jay Wolfe .
“ I touched the one I wanted , Rockefeller , and the machine put a checkmark on the Republican instead , ” Oates said of her experience Thursday .
She said she caught the mistake , called over a worker in the county clerk ’s office and was able to correct her vote .
But she worries other voters may not catch such a mistake .
When asked if she is sure she touched the box for Rockefeller , she said , “ I ’m absolutely positive . ”
As Democracy Now noted , the only two counties so far with problems are ones run by Republicans .
Hopefully , they will get this problem fixed right away .
I ’m just glad the voters caught the malfunction .
If I hear anymore on the West Virginia voting irregularities , I will post an update .
Dear comrades and friends ,
You will be aware of the US - backed " civic coup " underway in the Bolivia , and the threats this poses to democracy and all nations ' right to political , economic and social sovereignty .
We urge you / your organisation to sign the open petition we have initiated in support of President Evo Morales and the Bolivian people , and to circulate it widely among left and progressive individuals and activists .
We hope you may also be able to use the petition to bring pressure on the government of your own country to publicly state its support for Bolivia 's right to freedom from imperialist intervention .
The petition is at :

The oligarchy has pushed for “ autonomy ” from the national government in a manoeuvre aimed to protect its privileges from the national government ’s pro-people measures , and now appears to be attempting to impose its domination of the half moon by force .
With a sizeable white middle class , compared the largely indigenous west , the oligarchy in the east has worked overtime to whip up a racist frenzy against a national government headed by Bolivia ’s first ever indigenous president and the largely indigenous social movements that back it .
The violence by armed fascist gangs , backed by local authorities , spread in the following days throughout the rest of the so - called “ half - moon ” — the four eastern departments of Santa Cruz , Pando , Beni and Tarija .
The half moon is home to much of Bolivia ’s natural resources and the main base of opposition to the left - wing government of President Evo Morales from the Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) , who on August 10 won a recall referendum on his presidency with 67 % of the vote .
By Federico Fuentes and Stuart Munckton September 13 , 2008 -- “ [ Today ] a civil - prefectural coup against the unity of the country and democracy has been initiated ” , Bolivian minister of government Alfredo Rada declared on September 9 , as a growing wave of violence by small gangs of fascist youth engulfed the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra .
Reign of terror
Incited by the Santa Cruz Civic Committee , which groups together sectors of the oligarchy , and with the collaboration of the departmental prefects in the east and the US embassy , on September 9 the fascist shock troops of the Santa Cruz Youth Union ( UJC ) laid siege to public institutions , NGOs , community radio stations and the offices of the state TV channel , in some cases attempting to burn them down .
That same day , the head of the parliamentary bloc of the right - wing Podemos party and large landowner , Antonio Franco , “ applauded ” the violent takeovers , while Podemos deputy for Santa Cruz , Oscar Urenda , issued an open call to arms .
“ If we are going to talk about confrontation , then lets talk about confrontation , if we are going to talk about war , there will be war , but they are not going to able to impose things on us ” , he proclaimed .
“ We are strong enough to split this country and if I have to grab a log , a gun , I will do it , I ’m going to defend my territory . ”
An eyewitness account from September 12 published on Marxist.com writes : “ What started on September 9th as vandalism against public institutions has developed into a fascist orgy of violence which threatens civil war . ”
The writer states : “ The list of occupied institutions is long .
Everything from tax offices , administration of land , immigration authorities to the department of forestry was brutally destroyed .
The national administration of land had its entire inventory destroyed and burned , and the same happened to the nationalized telecom company ENTEL .
ENTEL had its entire main building smashed and the fascist hordes stole everything of value . ”
The writer reported a “ consistent attack on all social organizations and government supporters .
In Santa Cruz , the human rights organization Cejis , is ravaged and their entire inventory is burned and destroyed .
The same happens to CIDOB , the indigenous people ’s main organization in Eastern Bolivia .
All left wing leaders are hunted and many have had to go underground . ”
“ In … Tarija , the fascist gangs attack the peasants ’ marketplace .
Molotov cocktails are thrown at all the stalls …
One right wing leader declares Tarija to be independent and declares civil war in the region . ”
According to a September 12 Reuters report , the government has accused the fascists of “ a real massacre ” against government supporters in Pando with at least 15 people recorded killed .
The national government is seeking the arrest of Pando prefect , Leopoldo Fernandez , who is alleged to have organised the killings .
Fernandez has fled to Brazil .
According to a September 10 AP report , opposition protesters blew up a pipeline in Tariji , reducing the flow of gas to Brazil by half at one point .
The protests also interrupted the flow of gas to Argentina .
Santos Ramirez , president of the state oil company , YPFB , called the explosion “ a terrorist attack ” .
In response , additional troops were immediately ordered to the eastern departments to secure gas and oil installations .
Gas exports to Argentina and Brazil were returning to normal by September 12 , according to a Reuters report that day .
Counter - offensive
The attempt to seize power through brute force in the half moon is clear , but it has been met by a counter - offensive by the government and the powerful social movements that support the process of change .
The eyewitness account provides one example of the heroic actions of supporters of the government in the Plan 3000 working class neighbourhood : “ The workers have rallied to a massive defence against the 400 young fascists who attack the marketplace with clubs , Molotov cocktails and hand weapons .
Rapidly , thousands rally for the defence which develops into extreme violence with many wounded .
About 3 o’clock at night , the fascists have been driven out , but the inhabitants keep the entrenchment defended . ”
In the lead - up to the current wave of violence , Morales declared that his government would ensure that the institutions and security of the state were respected and called for the “ unity of the people and the Armed Forces to defend the process of change ” , according to the September 9 Argentine daily Clarin .
The article reported that phone calls had poured into the state radio station asking Morales to decree a state of emergency .
Minister of the presidency Juan Ramon Quintana , however , stated on September 9 that the government would not declare a state of emergency , arguing that the opposition wanted to provoke repression in order to have a banner around which to mobilise wider sections of the population against the government .
The commander of the army ’s eighth division , General Marco Bracamonte , declared that the military would prevent any further takeover of oil and gas installations and defend the security of the state .
On September 10 , the Six Federations of Coca Growers of the Tropics of Cochabamba , the union organisation from which Morales emerged and still remains president of , along with peasant organisations in Santa Cruz , began to cut off Santa Cruz ’s road access .
The Chapare coca -growing region in Cochabamba — a MAS stronghold — is strategically located with the main highway connecting Santa Cruz to Bolivia ’s west running through it .
Other social organisations also began to block road access to the other eastern departments .
A September 11 Prensa Latina article reported on the pledge to continue and strengthen the blockade of Santa Cruz by the National Coordinator for Change ( CONALCAM ) , which unites many of the social movements that support the process of change led by Morales .
Permanent mobilisation
Fidel Surco , president of the Confederation of Colonisers — an organisation of indigenous campesinos — announced that CONALCAM had called for “ permanent mobilisations ” until Congress ratifies a referendum on adopting the new draft constitution scheduled for December , according to Prensa Latina .
The draft constitution , which would expand the rights of indigenous people , enshrine greater state control over natural resources and open the way for redistribution of large land holdings to impoverished campesinos , is a key source of conflict .
A key demand of the right - wing forces in the half moon is to withdraw plans for a referendum on adopting the text .
On September 10 , Morales announced the expulsion from Bolivia of the US ambassador , Philip Goldberg , for his role in backing the coup .
Goldberg had publicly urged the US to intervene on the side of the ‘ half moon authorities behind the violence .
Golberg was given 72 hours to leave the country .
On September 11 , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gave the US ambassador in Caracas 72 hours to leave , in solidarity with Bolivia .
On September 12 , ABN reported that Honduras had suspended recognition of the US ’s ambassador to it in solidarity with Venezuela and Bolivia .
The US responded be expelling the Venezuelan and Bolivian ambassadors from its territory
On September 11 , Chavez offered Venezuelan military assistance in defence of democracy to Bolivia .
“ If any or our governments is overthrown , we will have a green light to perform military operations of any type to give the power back to the people in those countries ” , Chavez insisted according to a September 1 Xinhua report .
Struggle for power
The “ civic coup ” that has been unleashed comes on the back of three weeks of small but violent demonstrations , generally limited to the inner city areas of the capitals of the half moon departments .
Protesters assaulted indigenous people , social movement leaders , MAS councillors , police officers and soldiers as well as initiating road blocks , occupying airports and state institutions and even physically taking over military airplanes .
The protests have focused on the issue of the revenue from the “ direct tax on hydrocarbons ” .
More of the revenue from natural gas used to be directed towards the departmental authorities , but the Morales government is seeking to redirect revenue towards anti-poverty social programs , such as a new universal old - aged pension .
With moves towards nationalisation of Bolivia ’s sizeable gas reserves — opposed by the opposition parties who , when in power , sought to privatise the industry — royalties from hydrocarbons have skyrocketed .
As a result , even with the government ’s redistribution policies , revenue to departments has still significantly increased .
Five of the nine departments are controlled by prefects openly hostile to the national government ( the half moon plus Chuquisaca ) and these authorities have used the increased funds to help organise violent destabilisation measures against the national government .
Since Morales ’s crushing 67.4 % victory in the recall referendum , his government has announced its intention for a referendum on the new constitution drafted by an elected constituent assembly .
While Morales issued a decree to hold the referendum on December 7 , the National Electoral Court ruled that it would not hold the consultation as such a referendum had to be approved by parliament .
Oscar Ortiz , president of the Podemos - controlled Senate threatend on September 10 to intensify the violent protests if MAS insisted on its campaign to approve the new constitution , which would declare Bolivia a “ plurinational state ” .
Behind the half moon prefects and civic committees stand large agribusiness interests and gas transnationals who see their interests threaten by the advance of the self - proclaimed “ democratic and cultural revolution ” led by Morales .
Fearing the consolidation of the process of change , the rich elites have stepped up their attempts to oust the Morales government .
US role
The government has accused Santa Cruz Civic Committee president Branco Marinkovic , who only hours before had returned from a visit to Miami , of being the instigator of the plan to set the country alight .
Marinkovic , who has helped direct the UJC violence , is accused of acting “ with the financial support and advise by ex-minister Carlos Sanchez Berzain , who is accused of genocide in Bolivia ” , reported ABI on September 9 .
Berzain is wanted in Bolivia on various charges relating to the deaths of more than 60 people in a massacre in 2003 that attempted to crush an uprising against plans to privatise Bolivia ’s gas industry , when he was justice minister .
While Bolivia has asked the US to extradite both Berzain and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada ( president in 2003 ) , the Bush administration has refused to collaborate .
Instead , Berzain was granted asylum in the US in July .
Further evidence of the role of the US in the current coup was demonstrated in a brazen display of imperial arrogance when Goldberg declared that “ Washington should interfere in [ Bolivia ’s ] internal affairs ” and “ called on the Bolivian government of President Evo Morales to pay attention to the demands of the opposition ” .
Golberg merely confirmed what the MAS government has long asserted : Washington is directly involved in the plot to overthrow Morales , including via increased funding to opposition parties , “ civil society ” organisations and pro-autonomy groups .
On August 25 , Goldberg secretly met with Santa Cruz prefect Ruben Costas , only nine days after Costas had announced plans to violate the national law by implementing a series of “ autonomy ” measures aimed at undermining the national government .
Morales declared the decision to expel Goldberg to be a homage to the historic struggle of the Bolivian people against imperialism — adding that only the people organised can defend democracy .
According to a September 12 AP report , Morales decreed a state of emergency in Pando , sending fresh troops to secure control .
The carrying of weapons is banned under the decree “ to safeguard lives and the collective good ” , according to Rada .
The decree came after the authorities in the half moon finally agreed to national government requests to enter into talks to resolve the crisis .
It is clear that the talks will centre on the question of the referendum on the new constitution , with the secretary for autonomy in Santa Cruz stating : “ We all agree that we have to look for a point of compromise . ”
Speaking in Cochabamba , Morales stated that opponents “ have every right to reject the new constitution , but through the vote and not through violence ” .
However the current crisis resolves itself , the battle between poor , mostly indigenous oppressed majority and the racist , US - backed oligarchy is a central part of the continent - wide struggle against US domination and neoliberalism .
Supporters of social justice around the world need to raise their voices against US intervention and fascism in Bolivia , and for democracy .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Despite already receiving regulatory clearance , Electronics Arts Inc. suddenly dropped its $ 2 billion bid for fellow video - game publisher Take - Two Interactive Software Inc. on Sunday .
In a press release , Electronic Arts ERTS said it decided to drop the bid after a management presentation from Take - Two TTWO , - 1.86 % and a review of the company 's due diligence .
No reason was given for the move .
The statement read , " EA has decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take - Two and has terminated discussions with Take - Two . "
Electronic Arts and Take - Two confirmed they had begun formal discussions to merge in late August and shortly after the Federal Trade Commission said it would not stand in the way of such a marriage .
The two started their merger dance earlier this year when Electronic Arts , the publisher of " Madden NFL " and " The Sims " series , offered $ 26 a share for Take - Two , known primarily for its " Grand Theft Auto " series of video games .
Take - Two rejected the proposal as undervaluing its business but said it was open to discussing a potential deal .
EA later lowered its bid price slightly to $ 25.74 , after Take - Two implemented a management compensation plan that EA claimed lowered the value of the company .
In August , after the FTC paved the way for the deal to go through , EA indicated it was n't fully ready to go ahead with the deal .
But analysts had expected it to go through , particularly after the success of " Grand Theft Auto IV , " the latest in Take - Two 's series .
In its own statement Sunday , Take - Two said it remains focused on creating value for its shareholders and hinted that it is talking with other potential suitors , though none have yet made a competing bid .
" This has been our goal since EA launched its conditional and unsolicited bid six months ago , a bid which was repeatedly rejected by our stockholders , " Take - Two chairman Strauss Zelnick said in the statement .
" As part of that commitment , we remain actively engaged in discussions with other parties in the context of our formal process to consider strategic alternatives . "
At the close Friday , Take - Two shares were up 1.1 % to $ 21.89 , roughly $ 4 below the last share price offer .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush used a prime - time TV address on Wednesday night to press his case for a $ 700 billion bailout of the nation 's shaky financial system .
Bush 's proposal - to allow the Treasury to buy troubled assets threatening the health of financial institutions - aims to restore confidence to the credit markets .
In the past week , short - term borrowing that businesses rely on to make payroll and cover other operating expenses has shown signs of freezing .
Further problems in the credit markets could cause the U.S. economy to seize up - threatening Wall Street and Main Street alike with a loss of jobs and a severe economic downturn .
" We are in the midst of a serious financial crisis , " Bush said .
" Our entire economy is in danger . "
( Read his entire address . )
" I propose that the federal government reduce the risk posed by the troubled assets and supply urgently needed money so banks and other financial institutions can avoid collapse and resume lending . "
In recent days lawmakers , economists and administration officials have used the words " crisis , " " calamity " and " meltdown " to describe the possible ramifications if no action is taken .
" The market is not functioning properly , " Bush said .
There is a widespread loss of confidence .
America could slip into a financial panic . "
Sweeping move into the markets
His proposal , first unveiled six days ago , would amount to the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression .
The high - stakes debate over it gained rapid momentum on Wednesday .
Bush has called a White House meeting for Thursday afternoon to discuss the bailout .
Congressional leaders and presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama are expected to attend .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have spent the past week lobbying for the Bush 's proposal .
They have met with lawmakers privately and been grilled on Capitol Hill on successive days .
Democrats have criticized the president for not speaking out sooner , complaining that their constituents are angry about how much money is being requested and do n't really understand how Wall Street 's problems would affect them .
" One measure of the gravity of an issue is presidential involvement , " said House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , on Wednesday .
" The absence of any presidential speech was hurting . "
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle , while acknowledging the need to take action , objected to the Treasury 's proposal both for its size and for its lack of taxpayer protections .
Paulson has contended the taxpayer risk is far greater by not doing something and letting the economy hit the skids .
Three pages , $ 700 billion
The spare , three - page proposal sent by the Treasury to lawmakers requested the authority to buy up to $ 700 billion in troubled assets .
Democrats want to add provisions that provide oversight ; curb executive pay at companies that sell assets to the Treasury ; let the government have the option of taking an equity stake in companies that participate ; and require the government to encourage foreclosure prevention for the troubled loans it purchases .
After asking for a " clean " bill earlier in the week , Bush said , " any rescue plan ... should make certain that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars . "
Democrats would also like to add a provision that would amend the bankruptcy law to let judges modify filers ' mortgages on primary residences , a move the lending industry has strongly opposed and which is one of the most controversial measures in the negotiations with Republicans and the administration .
Bush acknowledged the anger that Americans have expressed about his bailout plan .
" I understand the frustration of responsible Americans who pay their mortgage on time , file their tax returns every April 15 and are reluctant to pay the excess costs on Wall Street , " he said .
But , he added , " given the situation we 're facing , not passing a bill now would cost these Americans much more later . "
By investing taxpayer money in assets with underlying value , even if the market is n't yet sure what that value is currently , the government may make " much , if not all " of the money back when it resells the assets after the markets return to normal , Bush said .
Lawmakers , who were scheduled to recess for the year on Sept. 26 , did not welcome the pressure to hurry and make a decision within a week of when the bailout proposal was first presented to them .
Given that the negotiations are still going on , it 's very possible both the House and Senate will meet next week to vote on the bill .
For decades scientists have been mystified by the strangely - shaped skulls of the duck - billed , crested dinosaurs known as lambeosaurus .
Their nasal passages are extremely long and twisty , looping up over the tops of their skulls .
Originally it was believed that these were just super - noses providing a keen sense of smell .
But today a group of Canadian and U.S. researchers present their latest findings about the lembeosaurus at the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology in Ohio — it turns out the nasal passages may have been used for fairly complicated communication between dinosaurs .

This insight came after researchers used CT scans to look at the structure of the crests on top of lambeosaurus ' head .
It turns out these crests are connected to the nasal cavities , and that the crests might have emitted what researchers describe as " eerie bellowing calls . "
CT scans of the brain cavity in the skull suggest that the dinosaurs ' brains were highly developed , and their inner ear structure was perfect for picking up the low frequencies produced by the crest .
Paleontologist Lawrence Witmer , a member of the research team , said :
We were surprised to see just how large the centers of the brain associated with higher cognitive functions were .
We suspected that the crested duck - billed dinosaurs used both vocal and visual displays , but now we see that they had the brain power and hearing to pull off these behaviors .

Nobody is saying that lambeosaurus had language .
And yet their sophisticated brains , coupled with a highly - specialized organ for communication , does suggest a potential for speech .
So humans might not be the first chatty species on the planet , after all .

Basic Guide to Understanding EQ
By Kendall Scott Using equalization may be second nature for the experienced , but it can be a veritable minefield for those new to the details of the concept .
Perhaps you have a rudimentary idea of basic EQ from your home sound system , or from making simple adjustments on the audio mixer that you may have in your recording / editing setup .
Learning to use EQ means experimenting to discover which adjustments work and do not work for a given situation .
By using your ears and making intuitive adjustments you may eventually achieve desired results , but if you have a good understanding of the nuts and bolts you will be able to focus and zero in on the sound you are seeking , with speed and purpose .
Maybe you are getting your ears acclimated by making your own home recordings , or perhaps you are trying to come to grips with your first software recording / editing package .
No matter what the situation , knowing the basics will help you hear in equalization an indispensable tool for adjusting , mending , or sweetening your audio tracks .
Enjoying a live performance or presentation is completely different from a recorded experience .
In a live setting , the sound of instruments and voices interacts with the listening space and creates a psychoacoustic event that can never be exactly recreated because it is a human experience .
A recording is a reproduction of an event , and in order to provide the listener with an appropriate experience that approximates a three - dimensional listening environment with only two speakers , good recording techniques are paramount .
Getting all of your audio sources to sit well together is the mixer 's art , and EQ is one of the most important tools of the trade for music , film , and live sound .
Basic Components
In its most basic form , think of EQ as a set of filters that can alter the incoming signal .
A filter is a device that allows you to selectively alter what passes through it , so think of a filter as a shaping tool .
An audio filter lets you alter some frequencies while leaving others untouched .
There are many types of filters that can be used for audio , but three basic types are : Low - pass Band- pass High - pass
A low - pass filter lets low frequencies pass through it while attenuating higher frequencies above a desired cutoff point .
A band - pass filter may be thought of as a low - pass filter and high - pass filter working together to allow only a selected center region of frequencies to pass between two selected points .
Telephone speech , for example , is limited to a narrow range from between 300 Hz to 3200 Hz reasons of intelligibility .
By dialing these numbers into your band - pass EQ you can approximate the sound of a voice on a phone line .
A high - pass filter lets high frequencies pass through it while attenuating lower frequencies below a desired cutoff point .
A microphone roll - off switch acts as a high - pass filter to remove unwanted low - frequency noises , such as handling and plosives .
These filters work by attenuating a selected portion of the original source .
Some of the more interesting types of filters that will allow you to both boost and attenuate your signal are : High Shelving Low Shelving
Shelving filters cut or boost all frequencies equally above or below a desired cutoff point .
You can see in the high shelving illustration that all frequencies above the cutoff may be cut or boosted without altering any frequencies below this point .
The exact opposite holds true for the low shelving filter .
Shelving filters are excellent tools for getting your audio tracks to sit well together while mixing .
If the piano and bass guitar tracks seem to be clashing because of overlapping frequencies in your mix , you may want to separate them sonically by applying a high - shelving filter to the bass and a low - shelving filter to the piano to keep them out of each other 's way .
By doing a little research to find out the frequency ranges of your instruments , you will be able to carve a comfortable niche for every element in your mix .
Overlap Minimized Overlap
A peaking filter may be used to apply boost or cut to a specific frequency area .
This is great for dialing - in very focused adjustments , such as adding more crack to a snare drum , or adding some presence to a vocal track .
Peaking Filter
Getting Familiar with Peaking Filters
If you own an equalizer with continuously adjustable frequency selection , apply some positive or negative gain from the EQ and try slowly sweeping through its entire range .
Listen closely to your audio source to see if you can define what changes are occurring at different points along your sweep .
Where does a hi-hat cymbal become overly bright and where does it become muffled or dull ?
On the other hand , what is the right frequency to make it cut through to be heard or add more " stick " to the sound .
Can you locate that 60 Hz hum on your miked guitar or vocal track and effectively reduce it ?
In software it may be as easy as dragging your frequency marker across the display .
On a hardware unit , such as a mixer with a sweepable mid-section , you will have to first apply gain with one control and then adjust your frequency with another .
Putting It All Together
These are the basic building blocks of both hardware and software equalizers , and they can be combined in a variety of ways to make extremely powerful sound - shaping tools .
At its heart , a graphic EQ is a collection of peaking filters that allow you to reach for the frequency that you want to adjust , easily .
Each filter is tuned to affect a specific frequency , and its amount of positive or negative gain is measured in decibels .
Even though you are choosing a specific frequency to adjust , the limitations of most filter circuits produce results that will have an effect on neighboring frequencies as well .
The acuteness of the attenuation is measured in dB per octave .
An octave is simply a doubling of a frequency , and as the amount of attenuation per octave is increased , so does the ability to pinpoint the selected frequency .
Fully - parametric EQ is a very powerful tool that allows for the adjustment of three signal parameters :
1 ) The amount of negative / positive gain 2 ) The frequency at which the negative / positive gain will occur 3 ) The width of the frequency range being effected Like a graphic EQ , a parametric lets you choose the frequency you want to adjust and the amount of boost or attenuation you want to apply .
But , the parametric goes one step further in allowing you to adjust how wide of an effective spread there will be to either side of the selected frequency .
This value , labeled Q , Resonance , or Bandwidth on different units allows for some very strong tone - shaping that can drastically change the overall character of the original source .
Gain -
A little bit goes a long way Remember that by adding gain to any of your selected frequency areas , you are also increasing the output of the EQ , so boost your signal judiciously .
Hardware , Software , and In - between Equalizers may be as simple as a single tone control or they may be as complex as you can imagine .
Good quality hardware units have been designed to behave in a very " musical " manner , making it easier for you to dial in the sound you want .
Beware of units that may do more harm than good by adding noise to your signal path , ultimately degrading your results .
Almost all audio recording / editing software will come with some form of EQ .
To add to this , there are hundreds of specialized software EQ's that offer many combinations of features that are either unavailable or very expensive to incorporate on a hardware unit .
Software also provides the option of dynamic EQ where changes can be automated over time , and settings can be stored with your session .
There are even digital rackmount units that offer the benefits of both hardware and software .
Whether you encounter an EQ section on a large console or in your digital audio workstation , these symbols and concepts are a universal key to getting to the heart of any equalizer you may use in the future .

When the new iPhone 3G went on sale last week , I was sorely tempted to wait in line for one .
( I did n't - no patience . )
One of the features of Apple 's device that appeals to me is the new MobileMe service , where you can " access and manage your email , contacts , calendar , photos , and files at me.com , " according to Apple .
More companies , among them Microsoft and Google , already allow people to store information and use common services online - or " in the cloud " - leading analysts to refer to the entire trend as " cloud computing " .
This iteration of " cloud computing " puts your personal data on an accessible server held by a third party , which you replicate on multiple machines and access from virtually anywhere .
Putting aside the security , data storage , data retention , data destruction and other pesky issues associated with doing business in the cloud , one fundamental issue remains :
Your data is being hosted , stored and transmitted through a third party .
As far as the law is concerned then , that third party has control of your data and may therefore be subject to a subpoena for your data , often without your knowledge or ability to object .
On July 11 , 2008 , Steven Warshak , the president of a nutrition supplement company , learned the hard way ( pdf ) about the dangers of using web - based email .
On May 6 , 2005 , the government got such an order for the contents of his emails .
Generally , the internet service provider ( ISP ) is required to give the subscriber notice of the subpoena , but the statute allows a delay of up to 90 days if the government just asks for the data and the court finds that " there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of the court order may have an adverse result " , like endangering the life or physical safety of an individual , flight from prosecution , destruction of or tampering with evidence , intimidation of potential witnesses , or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial .
Using this provision the government got an order allowing it to delay telling Warshak of its access for 90 days , until early July 2006 .
July came and went , as did August , September , October , November , December , January , February , March , April and May of 2007 before the government finally got around to telling Warshak that it had been reading his mail .
Warshak , like many others , used web - based or third - party provided email services like Yahoo ! mail and NuVox communications .
Thus , his inbox and outbox were literally out of his hands .
If Warshak had used an internal email service that he controlled and the government wanted to get access to the contents of his email , they would have had to do it the old - fashioned way : Obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause , issued by a neutral and detached magistrate , specifying the place to be searched and the items to be seized .
In fact , those are the precise words of the Fourth Amendment .
Now the government could have issued a grand jury subpoena to Warshak ordering him to pony up his emails .
Warshak could then have challenged the scope and breadth of the subpoena , argued that it called for production of irrelevant or privileged materials , challenged the jurisdiction of the grand jury to issue the subpoena , or raised a series of other defenses to the subpoena itself .
But the government did n't want Warshak to know it was investigating him and his company .
It wanted to be able to read his emails without him knowing about it .
So it used a statute called the Stored Communications
Act , which allows the government to require an ISP to hand over the contents of your emails that have been in storage for more than 180 days even without a warrant , as long as it has a court order showing " reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication , or the records or other information sought , are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation " .
Example test pairs presented during the memory study for all three conditions .
The number of observers reporting the correct item is shown for each of the depicted pairs .
If human memory were truly digital , it would have just received an upgrade from something like the capacity of a floppy disk to that of a flash drive .
A new study found the brain can remember a lot more than previously believed .
In a recent experiment , people who viewed pictures of thousands of objects over five hours were able to remember astonishing details afterward about most of the objects .
Though previous studies have never measured such astounding feats of memory , it may be simply because no one really tried .
" People had never tested whether people could remember this much detail about this many objects , " said researcher Timothy Brady , a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT .
" Nobody actually pushed it this far . "
When they did push the human brain to its limits , the scientists found that under the right circumstances , it can store minute visual details far beyond what had been imagined .
Those circumstances include looking at images of objects that are familiar , such as remote controls , dollar bills and loaves of bread , as opposed to abstract artworks .
Another factor that seemed to help was motivation to do well :
The participant who scored highest won a small prize of money ( the researchers refused to say exactly how much ) .
" You have to try , " said MIT co-author Talia Konkle .
" You have to want to do it . "
The study , funded by the National Science Foundation , National Institutes of Health , a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship , and a National Research Service Award , was detailed in the Sept. 8 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In the experiment , 14 people ranging from age 18 to 40 viewed nearly 3,000 images , one at a time , for three seconds each .
Afterwards , they were shown pairs of images and asked to select the exact image they had seen earlier .
The test pairs fell into three categories : two completely different objects , an object and a different example of the same type of object ( such as two different remote controls ) , and an object along with a slightly altered version of the same object ( such as a cup full and another cup half - full ) .
Stunningly , participants on average chose the correct image 92 percent , 88 percent and 87 percent of the time , in each of the three pairing categories respectively .
Though 14 subjects may not sound like a huge sample , the fact that they each recalled the objects with very similar rates of success suggests the results are not a fluke .
" To give just one example , this means that after having seen thousands of objects , subjects did n’t just remember which cabinet they had seen , but also that the cabinet door was slightly open , " Brady said .
Even the researchers did n't expect quite such high recall rates .
" We had the intuition that it might be possible , but we were surprised by the magnitude of the effect , " said study leader Aude Oliva , also of MIT .
" These numbers , higher than 85 and 90 percent , impressed us and also impressed a lot of people who heard about the work . "
So now that we know the brain 's memory is so fantastic , are we all out of excuses for forgetting friends ' birthdays ?
Luckily not , Brady said .
" To some extent it 's about attention , actively encoding specific details into memory , " he told LiveScience .
" If we tried really hard we actually could remember when someone 's birthday was : if you say to yourself , ' The birthday is on this day and that relates to these other things that I remember . ' "
Basically , he said , we can remember most things we put our minds to , if we invest enough attention and effort into trying to store them in the first place .
The meeting , scheduled to be held as early as Tuesday of this week at the headquarters of the New York Fed , is expected to clear the way for the creation of a new clearing house , or exchange , where CDSs can be traded with more transparency and with a degree of government oversight .
At the moment CDSs are traded in the over - the - counter market , where traders buy and sell the securities among themselves .
The effort by the Fed is designed to create a centralized market place where CDSs can be traded .
People close to the talks say that the new exchange could be up and running in a matter of weeks .
Women 's voices get higher in pitch at most fertile point of monthly cycle , say researchers
A woman 's voice tends to rise in pitch at the time of the month when she is most fertile
Whisper it softly - if you do n't want to send all the eligible bachelors running for the hills .
Women speak in a higher tone of voice when at their most fertile , making them more attractive to the opposite sex , scientists have found .
Recordings made when fertility was low and again nearer ovulation showed that women 's voices took on more feminine qualities as they neared their optimum time for conceiving .
Researchers made voice recordings of 69 female undergraduates and found that they spoke in a higher pitch when nearer to the time when an egg is released .
But the difference was apparent only when women spoke a simple introductory sentence such as 'hi , I 'm a student at UCLA ' - and not for simple vowel sounds .
Dr Greg Bryant , from the University of California team that carried out the research , said : ' Our study shows women change their voice in relation to fertility - and possibly only in social communication contexts . '
He said the difference in pitch was the greatest on the two highest fertility days just before ovulation .
Dr Bryant added : ' It is feasible these changes in vocal femininity occur primarily or exclusively during social communicative tasks - raising the intriguing possibility cues of ovulation appear more during social interactions and could serve a communicative function . '
Previous research found men pick up on other , less subtle clues to a woman 's fertility , such as scent and flirtatious behaviour .
There is increasing evidence that women 's behaviour changes in subtle ways throughout the monthly cycle , and that men find women most attractive around the time of ovulation .
A study last year found that the earnings of lap dancers in America increased dramatically when they were most fertile - and dropped at other times of the month .
Around ovulation they earned around £ 34 a night in tips , compared to £ 25 when they were not fertile .
Other studies have shown that women are more flirtatious in the middle of their cycle , and more interested in sex .
Unlike many mammals , there are no obvious outward signs when women are fertile .
Evolutionary biologists argue that women evolved " hidden ovulation " in prehistoric times as a way of tricking men into staying around for much longer .
However , the recent studies suggest that men are still able to detect when their partners are most fertile using changes in behaviour , voice , appearance or scent .
Earlier this year a study at the State University of New York found that men and women preferred female voices during the most fertile period of the month .
I got up this morning with a truck in our shared driveway with the bailiff from the Cuyahoga County Sheriff ’s department telling Jordan that they were evicting our neighbor .
Our neighbor is a tenant and payed her rent to a landlord who stopped paying his mortgage .
She , a single parent , and her two daughters were not home .
She told us that she had until October 13th to move , and had recently put a deposit down on an apartment .
The house is owned by
Citibank .
We explained this to the bailiff and he said that he did n’t care and that his orders were to evict her .
He called the police on me for disturbing the peace .
Fortunately , one of her daughters came home and was able to call the mother .
The bailiff promised that he would wait until she got there .
Jordan tried to call Judge Montgomery ’s office , but was only allowed to leave a message , Citibank said that it was out of their hands and that
evidently the bank ’s lawyer , a Mr. Ginsberg , changed his mind and could n’t wait 4 days until the 13th .
I just heard back from Jordan that they are going ahead with the eviction .
It is criminal that banks like Citibank just received a 700 billion dollar bailout bill , while my neighbor , a tenant , gets kicked to the curb .
Yesterday , the sheriff of Chicago and Cooks County said that he will stop evictions on foreclosed properties .
He is doing this because many people being evicted were tenants that were paying their rent , but did not know that their homes were being foreclosed on .
It is time for the sheriffs here to do the same , I am urging all of you to call and fax your sheriff ’s department and urge them to stop the evictions .

Updated : After several calls with the Cuyahoga County Sheriff ’s Department , I was told that they do not evict tenants that are caught in a foreclosure .
( The woman that I talked while the sheriff ’s department does evict people , they found it wrong to evict tenants that are caught between absent landlords and the banks . )
Evictions of tenants by banks of foreclosed homes are being done by municipal courts .
Here is the phone number of Judge K. J. Montgomery who presided over this case and is allowing evictions of tenants to happen : ( 216 ) 491-1326 .
Last Friday
I made a $ 5 bet about the presidential election with a colleague over one of the sillier questions in this climate of exceedingly silly media overload : Will Oprah Winfrey back down and invite Sarah Palin on her TV show before Nov. 4 ?
My money says yes , based on the gut assumption that viewer backlash will convince Barack Obama supporter Winfrey to issue an awkward mea culpa and ask all four candidates to honor her with their presence .
My co-worker was game , wagering that Winfrey wo n’t back down , placing integrity over ratings ( and magazine circulation ) .
In truth , both of us felt unsure about the outcome , and a little embarrassed we were even talking about it .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Peggy Noonan wrote on Sept. 6 , quite breathlessly in my opinion , that , “ It is starting to look to me like a nation - defining election …
This campaign is about to become : epic . ”
Actually , the election might indeed be “ epic , ” remembered not for anything of real substance , but instead the indescribable banality of the entire process .
Does anyone recall the flap du jour back in July when The New Yorker and its editor David Remnick were put on the defensive because of the satiric cover drawing the weekly ran depicting Obama as a Muslim and his wife Michelle in Angela Davis - like garb ?
It ’s fuzzy to me as well , which , at first blush , is a little strange since I wrote a piece about the controversy for The Journal .
Yet consider how much has happened in this contest since the shank of summer , especially during the two national conventions , and not much of it of relevance to who ’s going to lead the country for at least the next four years .
Republicans derided Obama for having the temerity to give his acceptance speech before 80,000 people at Denver ’s Invesco Field with a backdrop that was ridiculed for its resemblance to either the White House , or more ludicrously , to Greek temples .
As political theater , it worked .
Yet this grand and fleeting stagecraft has little to do with how Obama will navigate the flagging economy or international threats should he become president in January , and is n’t really worthy of derogatory GOP commentary .
Television anchors wondered whether , after John McCain ’s predictably dull , and content - lite speech if the balloon - drop would malfunction .
Americans , at least those who tuned into the GOP festivities last week — and , amazingly , millions did , drawing ratings that equaled the Obama show — were introduced to the concept of “ hockey moms ” ( until now , apparently a neglected constituency ) and mooseburgers .
The Washington Post ’s hyper media stenographer , Howard Kurtz , captured a dilly of a quote from Fox News ’ Brit Hume , who said , in disgust , while killing time on air , how “ atrocious ” it was that baby pictures of McCain were included in the now - mandatory pre-speech video extolling a candidate ’s “ personal story . ”
Bill Clinton , who had further tarnished his presidential “ legacy , ” such as it is , earlier this year by running off at the mouth about Obama ’s inferiority compared to his wife Hillary ( notably injecting a malodorous string of fairly blatant racist innuendoes ) , redeemed himself in the eyes of at least Democratic - leaning pundits and reporters by giving a speech that was a vigorous endorsement of Obama .
Never mind that in typical Clintonian fashion his rhetoric — at least delivered in complete sentences , unlike his Oval Office successor — sounded significant as he spoke but was not memorable just an hour later .
Still , as The New Yorker ’s Hendrik Hertzberg wrote last week in his report from the Denver convention , “ the big dog ” more than behaved himself , and quoted a Hillary delegate as saying his address was “ a cleansing , a healing that allows the page to be turned , ” and “ there was joy in the house . ”
Not to outdone , Al Gore compared Obama to Abraham Lincoln , a stretch that I ’m not entirely sure even Oprah could make with a straight face .
But what the hell , Gore is now America ’s wild card ( or joker ) , since he ’s developed as many personas over the years as Bob Dylan or David Bowie .
The mass media disgraced itself — again — by its immediate and very nasty condemnation of McCain ’s pick of Palin , concentrating on her 17 - year - old ’s pregnancy , and as Newsweek ’s Eleanor Clift said , “ laughing ” at McCain ’s flagrant cynicism in choosing as his running mate a one - term governor from the forgotten state of Alaska .
The New Republic ’s Martin Peretz , largely a pariah at the magazine he once owned , contributed this deep thought about Palin ’s speech : “ If Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi had been decked out like soccer mom Sarah last night the G.O.P. would have called them tramps …
I give her her due : she is pretty like a cosmetics saleswoman at Macy’s . ”
The New York Times , last Monday , ran a front - page story about Palin ’s baby Trig , born last spring , that even 16 years ago would ’ve been buried — if it ran at all — inside the paper .
“ In just a few months , [ Palin ] has gone from hiding her pregnancy from those closest to her to toting her infant on stage at the Republican National Convention . ”
Now , imagine the media ’s reaction if Palin had n’t included the baby , born with Down syndrome , with the rest of the family after her acceptance speech .
In fairness , McCain ’s campaign has so far muzzled Palin , keeping her away from the press , but this story , “ Fusing Politics and Motherhood in New Way , ” has no place on the front page of the Times .
On the other side of media divide , GOP enthusiasts , after their own shock at McCain ’s risky pick , declared Palin the “ new face ” of the Republican party , and praised the Arizona senator for his prescience in , in baseball parlance , paying attention to , and developing , future major league talent .
Let ’s see : there ’s Palin , Bobby Jindal , Eric Cantor , and … well , I ’ve run out of names .
At least one conservative blogger even alluded to The Mary Tyler Moore Show ( since the convocation was in St. Paul ) , saying that like the fictional Mary Richards , Palin was “ going to make it after all . ”
I support McCain , but stuff like this makes me reach for the barf bucket .
In the days that followed , there was a bout of indignation from some Republicans that after Obama ’s convention concluded , allegedly thousands of American flags were chucked in the trash before an Invesco Field worker rescued them .
Give the Obama campaign demerits for not saving the flags for future use , but to imply that the Democratic candidate is unpatriotic is absurd and further sullies any real debate about the very real differences between Obama and McCain .
Over the weekend , we learned that Obama will not be “ bullied , ” “ smeared ” or “ lied about , ” a fairly pedestrian rallying cry he gave at fundraiser in New Jersey where , as the Associated Press put it , “ rock legend ” Jon Bon Jovi hosted a dinner for his candidate of choice .
There was also news that McCain and Obama will appear together at the site of the demolished World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and will refrain , on that day , from airing negative advertisements about each other .
That ’s swell , but as a former Lower Manhattan resident , I ’d be far more impressed if the opponent issued a joint condemnation of the federal and New York bureaucracies for the gross incompetence in failing — after seven years !— to rebuild Ground Zero .
This campaign , unless it ’s radically altered , will not be remembered as one of ideas .
Yes , both Obama and McCain have sketched out rote platforms and proposals that are intended to turn out their respective voters , but I have n’t a clue as to how either one will carry out their promises .
At the upcoming debates I ’d welcome one of the moderators asking each of the candidates about their plans for immigration reform .
Obama ’s been largely AWOL on this issue , knowing it ’s hot turf for the nativist crowd and best to avoid it .
For his part , McCain , who once staked a sensible and humane position , has retreated , and one hopes that privately he ’s ashamed about this .
I ’d also like to know how Obama is going to increase revenues to pay for his version of healthcare and education by merely hiking taxes of those who earn more than $ 200,000 a year .
The questions may come up but both men will bob and weave , to no one ’s satisfaction except their respective strategists .
As I wrote in this space several weeks ago , there could be an event that elevates the discourse — say Russia invades the Ukraine ( good for McCain ) or General Motors files for bankruptcy ( a boost for Obama ) — but presently , amidst all the media clutter , the election will be decided by one factor alone .
Will Americans opt for an older white man ( who , due to circumstances beyond his control , looks closer to 80 than 72 ) or a middle - aged African - American .
Maybe that ’s a jaded oversimplification , maybe not , but it ’s clear that the 2008 presidential election will be covered in black and white .
October 1 , 2008 , Providence , RI --- Do females intrinsically have lessability than males to excel in mathematics at the very highest level ?
Conventional wisdom seems to say yes .
Harvard University presidentLawrence Summers also seemed to give credence to this notion in 2005 when he suggested that it might account in part for the very smallnumber of women professors in elite university math departments .
But a new study proclaims a resounding " no " , providing a fact - basedcase to back up this conclusion .
The study , " Cross - Cultural Analysisof Students with Exceptional Talent in Mathematical Problem Solving , " appearing in the November 2008 issue of the Notices of the AmericanMathematical Society , brings together decades of data from severalextremely high - level mathematics competitions for young people .
Thesedata show that there exist many females with profound intrinsicability in mathematics .
What is more , whether this ability isidentified and nurtured is highly dependent on socio-cultural , educational , or other environmental factors .
In the United States , these factors keep many boys as well as most girls from developingtheir mathematical talents to the fullest .
Girl Math Whizzes Found in Cultures that Value Math
The main part of the study examines participation in the InternationalMathematical Olympiad ( IMO ) , a highly challenging , nine - hour , six - problem essay style examination taken by some of the mostmathematically gifted pre-college students the world over .
In recentyears as many as 95 countries have sent 6 - member teams to compete inthe IMO .
The study found that there have been numerous girls who haveexcelled in the IMO ; however , the frequency with which girls ofmedal - winning ability are identified varies greatly from country tocountry .
Even some relatively small countries , such as Bulgaria and Romania , can field highly successful IMO teams .
" [ W ] hat most of thesecountries [ that excel in the IMO ] have in common are rigorous nationalmathematics curricula along with cultures and educational systems thatvalue , encourage , and support students who excel in mathematics , " thestudy says .
Since 1974 , the highly - ranked Bulgarian , EastGerman / German , and USSR / Russian IMO teams have included 9 , 10 , and 13 different girls , respectively .
By contrast , during that same timeperiod , the US teams included just 3 girls .
While only a few studentsper year typically achieve a perfect score of 42 points in thisextremely difficult exam , multiple girls have been among them , including Evgenia Malinnikova of the USSR who missed by only one pointachieving a perfect 42 three years in a row .
One of the study 's findings is that many of the students from the United States who participate in the IMO are immigrants or children ofimmigrants from countries where education in mathematics is valued andmathematical talent is nurtured .
A similar pattern holds for datafrom other highly challenging math competitions , including the USAMathematical Olympiad and the Putnam Mathematical Competition forundergraduate students , also analyzed in the study .
In particular , Asian - American and white girls who are immigrants from Eastern Europeare well represented in proportion to their percentages of the US andCanadian populations among the very top students identified in thesemath competitions .
It is only US - and Canadian - born white andhistorically underrepresented minority girls who areunderrepresented --- underrepresented by 50 - fold or more relative toAsian girls educated in the same school systems , the study concludes .
The study found that , when raised under some conditions , girlsconstitute 11 % to 24 % of the children identified as having profoundmathematical ability .
Raised under other conditions , girls were30 - fold or more underrepresented .
The 8:1 to 3:1 ratio of boys togirls is likely an underestimate .
In a truly gender - neutral society , the real ratio could well be close to 1:1 ; however , we currently lackways to measure it , the study suggests .
US Culture Discourages Girls --- and Boys
Study co-author Titu Andreescu of the University of Texas at Dallasbelieves , " Innate math aptitude is probably fairly evenly distributedthroughout the world , regardless of race or gender .
The hugedifferences observed in achievement levels are most likely due tosocio- cultural attributes specific to each country . "
Some countriesroutinely identify and nurture both boys and girls with profoundmathematical ability to become world - class mathematical problemsolvers , while others , including the USA , only rarely identify girlsof this caliber .
In addition , social pressures conspire to discouragegirls from pursuing math .
" [ I ] t is deemed uncool within the socialcontext of USA middle and high schools to do mathematics for fun ; doing so can lead to social ostracism , " the reportsays .
" Consequently , gifted girls , even more so than boys , usuallycamouflage their mathematical talent to fit in well with their peers . "
The study also looks at the representation of women among the facultyin five of the very top US research university mathematicsdepartments .
Just 20 % of the women in these elite departments wereborn in the United States .
Of the 80 % born elsewhere , many areimmigrants from countries in which girls are frequently members of IMOteams .
The study found a similar race / ethnicity / birth country / genderprofile among US participants in the IMO and its training camp asamong the faculties of these outstanding math departments .
" Thus , weconclude that the mathematics faculty being hired by these veryhighest - ranked research universities reflects the pool of IMOmedal - caliber students of mathematics coming through the pipeline , " the study says .
" The U.S. culture that is discouraging girls is also discouragingboys , " says Janet Mertz , a University of Wisconsin - Madison professorof oncology and lead author of the study .
" The situation is becomingurgent .
The data show that a majority of the top young mathematiciansin this country , male as well as female , were not born here .
" Co-author Joseph A. Gallian , professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota Duluth , says , " Just as there is concern aboutthe US relying on foreign countries for our oil and manufacturedgoods , we should also be concerned about relying on others to fill ourneeds for mathematicians , engineers , and scientists . "
" [ T ] he myth that females cannot excel in mathematics must be put torest , " the report emphasizes .
" Teachers , guidance counselors , parents , principals , university presidents , the lay public , and , mostimportantly , girls themselves need to be informed about the fact thatfemales can excel in mathematics , even at the very highest level . "

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has moved to reassure savers in German financial institutions that their deposits are safe .
The step came as one of Germany 's biggest lenders , Hypo Real Estate , struggled to stay afloat .
But BBC business editor Robert Peston says it is unclear if this is a 100 % government guarantee of all savings deposits .
Ms Merkel also said she would pull out all the stops to save Hypo Real Estate .
The bank is in trouble after a 35bn euro ( $ 48 bn ; £ 27 bn ) rescue plan collapsed .
Hypo Real Estate has said it will study alternative measures to fund its business .
European governments are as dazed and confused by the mayhem in the global banking system as most of the rest of us
Robert Peston
BBC business editor
Peston 's view : Lost in translation
Send us your comments Iceland shores up economy
The BBC business editor says the biggest worry is now in Iceland , where the government is trying to shore up the entire banking system before markets open on Monday .
Ms Merkel 's comments came after Europe 's major economies agreed to co-ordinate their response to the crisis .
She was speaking followed an emergency meeting with the central bank and financial regulator .
" We tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
The federal government assures it , " Ms Merkel said .
" We will not allow the distress of one financial institution to distress the entire system .
For that reason , we are working hard to secure Hypo Real Estate . "
Ms Merkel has previously been strongly critical of the Irish and Greek governments ' decisions to take independent action to protect all savings deposits .
Our business editor says that if the German government is making a firm commitment to guarantee all deposits , the leaders of other EU states - including the UK - would have to follow suit .
' Appalled '
The problems of Hypo Real Estate will put further strain on other financial institutions , which are struggling against a crisis of confidence in the global financial system .
Ms Merkel also said that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for " irresponsible behaviour " .
Hypo's problems should have been revealed earlier , a minister says Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said he was " appalled " that the problems at Hypo had not been revealed earlier .
Hypo Real Estate relies heavily on borrowing from other banks to fund its business and has suffered badly as banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to each other .
Just last week , the firm announced that it had succeeded in securing a credit facility worth 35bn euros ( $ 48 bn ; £ 27bn ) , stitched together by the government .
Under the deal , the government was going to provide the lion 's share of the loan , with a consortium of banks providing 8.5 bn euros ( $ 11.6bn ; £ 6.6bn ) .
It was designed to make sure that Hypo Real Estate had sufficient short and medium - term funding to make sure it could function while the international money markets remained in a deep freeze .
But Hypo Real Estate said the banks had withdrawn support for the loan , putting the whole rescue package at risk .
On Saturday , leaders of the major European economies met in Paris for talks hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Britain , Germany , Italy and France all agreed to work together to support financial institutions - but stopped short of agreeing a US - style bank bail - out plan .
They decided instead to seek a relaxation of the EU rules governing the amount of money individual states can borrow .
The leaders also issued a joint call for a G8 summit " as soon as possible " to review the rules governing financial markets .

( CNN ) --
At well over 100 years old and showing no interest in sex for over four decades , Henry is on his way to becoming a dad .
Henry , the oldest tuatara to mate at Southland Museum , enjoys a cold shower in his home in New Zealand .
Henry is a tuatara , a rare lizard - like creature that descended from dinosaurs .
The tuatara has been endangered since the 1890s , and it 's only found on a handful of New Zealand 's offshore islands .
At about 110 years old , Henry is the oldest tuatara ever to mate at Southland Museum on the country 's South Island .
" I had given up on old Henry , " said curator Lindsay Hazley .
He kept Henry in " solitary confinement " because the animal not only showed no interest in females but attacked them when they were looking to mate .
The beginning of Henry 's libido rebound came in 2002 , when veterinarians realized that a lump in the animal 's nether regions was a cancerous tumor .
They removed it and , over the next few years , his attitude began to change .
" I say that he had a personality transplant at the same time , " Hazley said Thursday .
" If I had a tumor underneath my [ genitals ] , when girls were passing by , I 'd be a very grumpy boy too . "
In March , Henry mated with Mildred , whose age is estimated between 70 and 80 .
Last month , she laid 12 fertile eggs , 11 of which remain healthy .
Healthy hatchlings would be a boost for the tuatara , who are the only living descendants of the order Sphenodontian , which flourished 200 million years ago .
They max out at about 32 inches from head to tail -- much smaller than their ancestors -- but the spiny ridges along their back suggest their prehistoric parentage .
The word " tuatara " is derived from a Maori word meaning " spiny back . "
In Maori legend , they are messengers of Whiro , the god of death and disaster , and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five - cent coin that was phased out in 2006 .
Hazley estimated that as many as 40,000 tuataras live on one of New Zealand 's tiny , outlying islands , with much smaller populations on several others .
There are 51 at Southland Museum , where Hazley , who has cared for tuataras for the past 35 years , has been breeding them .
He said he hopes Henry and Mildred 's hatchlings will be the latest success .

" I 'm excited , but I do n't want to get too excited because Mother Nature 's always got the power to ground you , " he said .
" I really do n't like counting the chickens before they hatch , but each day that goes by , I 'm becoming more confident they 're going to be fine . "
As for Henry , his best years as a ladies ' man may be ahead of him .
At 110 years old , he 's just hitting middle age for a species that can live well past 200 .
" I think he 'll be at these girls long after I 'm gone , " Hazley said .

Cancer cells in a handout photo from the National Cancer Institute .
REUTERS / Handout
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. researchers have found a way to switch on a cell - killing protein in the body , a finding that could lead to new ways to treat diseases like cancer in which cells grow out of control .
The body naturally activates this protein , called BAX , to kill off unwanted or defective cells in a process of programed cell suicide called apoptosis .
Researchers at Harvard ’s Dana - Farber Cancer Institute now think they have found a way to trigger this process .
“ We identified a switch that turns BAX on , and we believe this discovery can be used to develop drugs that turn on or turn off cell death in human disease , ” said Dana - Farber ’s Dr. Loren Walensky , who reported his findings on Wednesday in the journal Nature .
Walensky said his team was able to activate this switch by making a carefully shaped peptide -- a small chain of amino acids -- that fit perfectly into the trigger mechanism .
When this peptide attached correctly , the BAX protein started killing off cells by poking holes in the membranes of mitochondria , which make energy in cells .
Walensky , who is co-founder of Aileron Therapeutics , a biotech company in Cambridge , Massachusetts , thinks this mechanism may be useful in drug development .
“ Because BAX lies at the crossroads of the cell ’s decision to live or die , drugs that directly activate BAX could kill diseased cells like in cancer and BAX - blocking drugs could potentially prevent unwanted cell death , such as in heart attack , stroke , and neurodegeneration , ” Walensky said in a statement .
Aileron is testing a cancer drug that targets this trigger and hopes to begin human trials within a year .
Imagine the impact of the second world war .
This , according to former World Bank chief economist Nicolas Stern , captures the scale of the economic impact of climate change , left unchecked .
The social and environmental effects are predicted to be similarly catastrophic .
Given the widely accepted need for rapid and deep cuts in CO2 emissions , the response to E.ON 's application to build the UK 's first coal - fired power station in 30 years , at Kingsnorth in Kent , and news that business secretary John Hutton seems minded to give it the go - ahead , has been bewilderment and anger .
A new high point of opposition starts this weekend as the Camp for Climate Action embarks on an eight - day protest to press the government and E.ON to abandon the scheme .
This is no fringe issue : they will be taking action to stop a proposal potentially so destructive that increasing numbers of scientists are speaking out against it .
Over recent years scientists have become increasingly vocal about the need to take action to cut CO2 emissions .
In 2005 , the science academies of the G8 countries along with Brazil , China and India - three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world - signed a joint statement to push political leaders to tackle climate change as an urgent priority .
By 2008 , this group was calling for a rapid , planned transition to a low - carbon economy .
Opposing plans for new coal - fired power plants in developed countries has become an international frontline of climate change politics .
Jim Hanson , senior climate change scientist at Nasa , wrote to Gordon Brown last year calling for a ban on new coal , stating that Brown 's decision on Kingsnorth has " the potential to influence the future of the planet " .
This is because coal is one of the most polluting and carbon - intensive forms of fossil fuels - producing twice the carbon emissions per unit of electricity as gas .
Coal is the cause of fully half of the fossil fuel - caused increase of CO2 in the air today , and there is plenty left to burn .
If we do n't limit the use of coal , avoiding catastrophic climate change will become impossible .
However , Paul Golby of E.ON , in these pages yesterday , dismissed anyone opposed to his company 's plans to annually emit at least 6 m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere - more than the total emissions of Costa Rica or Cameroon - as naively ignorant of power generation realities .
He has tried to scare the public into thinking that new coal is necessary to keep the lights on .
Yet the independent energy consultancy Pöyry , in a report out today ( ilexenergy.com ) , gives the hard numbers showing projected demand can be met , while respecting strict emissions limits and energy security concerns , using renewables and not resorting to new coal .
Meanwhile Cambridge professor of physics David MacKay 's book Without Hot Air presents five different plans of how we can meet the UK 's energy needs and radically reduce emissions .
Of course there are no easy answers , but for Golby to deny that there are no answers other than business as usual is dangerously untrue .
Let 's be clear .
Either coal usage must stop , or the CO2 released from any coal burned must be kept out of the atmosphere , by burying it under the sea , using an unproven technique known as carbon capture and storage .
The Royal Society has made a clear proposal that all new coal plants must capture 90 % of their CO2 emissions by 2020 , or have their operating permits revoked .
If agreed , this would send a clear signal that if carbon capture and storage works , coal use is acceptable , otherwise it is not .
However , last month , when E.ON and energy minister Malcolm Wicks were before parliament 's environmental audit committee , both evaded accepting the Royal Society proposals ' impeccable logic .
E.ON 's preference is to use the carbon market to reduce emissions .
This wo n't deliver real cuts , as its own business case shows : Golby believes E.ON can participate in the European scheme , provide competitively priced electricity and turn in a good profit for 20 - 40 years by burning the dirtiest fuel .
Such delusions must be exposed : it is not possible to keep releasing large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere and avoid the social , environmental and economic consequences of climate change .
The Climate Camp is creating space for serious debate about the kind of world we want to live in .
More than that , the campers give shape to a force that can perhaps override the profits - now catastrophe - later logic of the government and E.ON : they form a broad - based movement of people committed to a socially just transition to a low - carbon society .
I certainly do n't want to live in E.ON 's world , where business as usual trumps avoiding dangerous climate change .
So I 'll be joining the campers in Kent .
Anyone else with concerns about the future should do the same .

In the 1960 ’s the pill was revolutionary , giving women the ability to control their fertility and advancing their equality in the workplace and in society .
But when the pill came onto the market , women were not fully informed of the side effects and risks .
Sixty years later , any conversation around the drawbacks of hormonal birth control remains politicized and suppressed .
Today , over half the women prescribed hormonal birth control are on it for non-contraceptive reasons like acne , irregular or painful periods , PCOS and endometriosis .
Hormonal birth control has been linked to depression , autoimmune disease , cervical cancer , fatal blood clots and other chronic conditions ; yet it is still prescribed to healthy women as a panacea for every hormonal and reproductive issue .
​
With pharmaceutical companies making billions on blockbuster products and reproductive rights under attack , exposing the downside of hormonal birth control is controversial .
Yet , as the scientific research grows , there is a rising consciousness around the mental and physical impacts of these medications and the landscape is shifting : A Danish study found an 80 % increase in the risk of depression for teenagers on hormonal contraception .
Younger generations want to avoid endocrine - disrupting chemicals and are scrutinizing everything they put in their bodies .
Femme - tech and fertility awareness methods are becoming mainstream and hormonal health coaches are reframing natural menstrual cycles as more empowering than suppressing ovulation .

GIBSON : [ H ] istory shows that when you drop the capital gains tax , the revenues go up .
While much of the well - deserved criticism of ABC's Democratic debate on Wednesday night centered around the dwelling on gotcha questions and smears instead of substantiative issues , when they finally did get around to a question that could have been considered a real issue , Charlie Gibson , who has a history of sandbagging Democrats with right - wing disinformation about Bush 's tax cuts , once again loaded up a question , disadvantaging the candidate and misled the millions of people watching :
As Jason Furman explains here , and as Len Burman explains here , the best evidence suggests otherwise .
Cutting these taxes may lead to a temporary spike in revenue , because people sell stock to realize gains while rates are low .
But over the long term , the biggest owners of stock — the wealthiest Americans — will mostly save what they will save , regardless of fluctuations in the rate .
The Congressional Budget Office notes that “ the potentially large difference between the long - and short - term sensitivity of realizations to tax rates can mislead observers into assuming a greater permanent responsiveness than actually exists . ”
As Barack Obama correctly alluded to , an article that same day reported that " the top 50 hedge fund managers earned a combined $ 29 billion in 2007 .
Five managers earned more than $ 1 billion . "
One of the main reasons they are doing so well while the economy is teetering is that the income derived from stocks is currently being taxed at less than half of the rate of what people who actually work for a living have to pay on their salaries .
Salary in the highest tax bracket is taxed at 35 percent , but profits from stocks held long enough to be called " long - term capital gains " are taxed at 15 percent .
A hedge fund manager making $ 100 million in a year would pay $ 15 million to the government if he is able to take his income as capital gains , not the $ 35 million he would have to pay if the income was considered salary .
Full debate transcript here .
Certain regional stereotypes have long since become cliches :
The stressed - out New Yorker .
The laid - back Californian .
But the conscientious Floridian ?
The neurotic Kentuckian ?
You bet -- at least , according to new research on the geography of personality .
Based on more than 600,000 questionnaires and published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science , the study maps regional clusters of personality traits , then overlays state - by - state data on crime , health and economic development in search of correlations .
Even after controlling for variables such as race , income and education levels , a state 's dominant personality turns out to be strongly linked to certain outcomes .
Amiable states , like Minnesota , tend to be lower in crime .
Dutiful states -- an eclectic bunch that includes New Mexico , North Carolina and Utah -- produce a disproportionate share of mathematicians .
States that rank high in openness to new ideas are quite creative , as measured by per-capita patent production .
But they 're also high - crime and a bit aloof .
Apparently , Californians do n't much like socializing , the research suggests .
As for high - anxiety states , that group includes not just Type A New York and New Jersey , but also states stressed by poverty , such as West Virginia and Mississippi .
As a group , these neurotic states tend to have higher rates of heart disease and lower life expectancy .

The 38th annual Midwest Marijuana Harvest Festival attracted a large crowd this past weekend in downtown Madison to celebrate a common cause : their support for the legalization of marijuana .
The festival began Friday at the Cardinal Bar with a medical cannabis benefit and continued through Sunday in Library Mall , with speakers , vendors , informational tables , displays and food carts .
The festival ended Sunday with a parade to the Capitol , and a rally and concert at the Capitol Square .
This year 's theme was " Vote , " so organizers and attendees recognized the importance of getting one 's voice heard .
Agua Das , of Hemp Sources , the inventor of hemp ice cream and a six - time attendee of the festival , said he thinks " hemp makes sense " and supports legalization .
" I 'm pro-hemp and I vote .
I 'm looking for candidates who will support the hemp agriculture bill , " Das said .
Eric Miller , an advocate for the Students for Nader campaign , promotes Nader because he supports legalizing hemp .
Miller believes that hemp makes economic sense because it is an easy plant to grow and is good for the environment .
Miller said there are consequences of marijuana use that directly tie to our governmental policies .
" There are more people in jail in Dane County than any other county in Wisconsin , " Miller said .
" There are more people in jail in this country than any other industrialized nation , and that is not acceptable . "
Doug Daudensdeck , a volunteer from Minnesota 's national organization that works with marijuana laws , set up a stand at the festival passing out informational packets , buttons and signs promoting marijuana education .
" [ Marijuana ] should be legal because it is a freedom of choice , " he said .
Madison Police Department officers patrolling the area said the festival was a peaceful and positive gathering ; as long as the attendees were not causing problems , they had bigger things to worry about .
Das explained the event perfectly .
" This festival is not about dope , it is about hope . "

Maher : ' They hate us for our airstrikes ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday September 18 , 2008
Print This Email This During an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on Wednesday , comedian and political commentator Bill Maher took issue with the infamous George W. Bush assertion that terrorism is somehow caused by a hatred of Americans ' freedom .
" They do n't hate us for our freedom , " said Maher with a laugh .
" They hate us for our airstrikes .
In Afghanistan , that seems to be the problem .
It 's that , we keep killing people with our airstrikes , and then those people tend to have a grudge against us , and they will join the Taliban , or be sympathetic to the Taliban . "
Maher likened a plan to send two more combat brigades to Afghanistan as killing flies " with a fly swatter made of raw meat . "
Maddow noted that in 2004 , Sen .
John McCain had claimed the appearance of an Osama bin Laden video tape near election time was good news for the GOP .
" Why is it that terrorism , war , the continuing existence of Osama bin Laden ...
Why is this politically advantageous for Republicans ? " she asked .
" John Kerry said the same thing , " said Maher . " ...
It 's perverse to think that people , the American people , would use this logic of , ' Oh , let 's reelect the guy who did n't get him the first time . '
But that seems to be what happens in this country .
" I keep going back to this cynical view I have , and people jump down my throat , but the underlying problem we have in this country is that the people are too stupid to be governed . "

ROMANS : It 's about as dire a President can get on the economy .
PRES .
BUSH : We 're facing a choice between action and the real prospect of economic hardship for millions of Americans .
ROMANS : This from an administration that for months said the economy was vibrant , the financial system strong .
The President did n't acknowledge ' storm clouds ' until last December , By then , it was raining .
Today , reading a report of a recent RAND study , I came across a claim that I have seen at least a thousand times : “ the cost of health care has increased rapidly , thanks largely to the pace of technological innovation . ”
This claim has been made so often that it has become almost a ritual incantation for those who comment on health - care costs .
The claim , however , is completely false .
Suppose we inserted a different referent in the statement , claiming , for example , that “ the cost of communcation services ( or computing power or consumer electronic products ) has increased rapidly , thanks largely to the pace of technological innovation . ”
No one would accept such a claim , because we all know that technological innovation has drastically reduced the cost of these goods .
For the same price ( adjusted for inflation ) that I paid for a simple calculator in 1970 , I can now purchase a computer with thousands of times more computational power , owing to technological progress during the past several decades .
Let ’s be clear : technology refers to the knowledge used to transform resource inputs into product or service outputs .
Technological progress means the acquisition of new knowledge that allows us to produce given outputs with fewer inputs or to produce entirely new outputs .
Cost - reducing technological change , like any other source of cost reduction , has the effect of lowering prices in free , rivalrous markets .
Health - care markets , however , are anything but free , rivalrous markets .
Instead , they are pervaded by countless government regulations , requirements , prohibitions , and other impediments to competition .
A large share of the payments for health - care services is made by governments or by private payers whose own payment arrangements are constrained by tax rules and other regulations .
When new health - care technology is developed , potential users may not be allowed to adopt it as they wish or to buy and sell freely the services whose production it enhances .
Many of the medical procedures , tests , instruments , and so forth that are available today did not even exist a few years ago .
When people avail themselves of these innovations , they are not obtaining the same service at greater expense ; they are obtaining a different ( presumably superior ) service , whose price is not readily comparable to the price paid previously for another type of service .
A CAT scan or an MRI is not an X -ray .
The newer types of images may cost more , but they provide more information to the user .
Many medicines now in use are new products , not readily comparable with ( presumably less effective ) medicines used previously .
Health - care costs rise rapidly in our system because of the raft of government interventions in the relevant industries , especially those that involve setting the terms of reimbursement for services provided to patients .
Other things being equal , the effect of technological change has been , as it always is , to lessen the costs of providing health - care services .
But other things have decidedly NOT remained equal , in part because the process of technological change itself has transformed the very nature of what is involved in “ health care . ”
Let ’s not blame technological progress , which is generally a benign and often a marvelously beneficial thing , for the baneful effects of government interventions in health - care industries .
Auburn offensive coordinator Tony Franklin was relieved of his duties Wednesday halfway through his first season of directing a spread offense that never caught fire .
Franklin is no longer on the coaching staff , said an Auburn official .
Head coach Tommy Tuberville told the team 3:30 of the dismissal .
" After evaluating where we are at this point of the season offensively , I felt it was in the best interest of the Auburn football program to make this change , " Tuberville said .
" I 'm not satisfied with where we are and I am personally going to take a larger role with the offense the remainder of the season .
We are going to work harder than ever to make sure we consistently improve as we move forward . "
Tuberville said he 'll decide in the next day or so who will call the plays in Saturday 's game against Arkansas .
Auburn is 104th in the nation in total offense .
Hired weeks before the Chick - fil - A Bowl last December , Franklin signed a two - year contract on Aug. 11 worth $ 280,000 annually , guaranteed through 2009 .
Franklin made a splash in the bowl game when Auburn ran a season - high 90 plays and a season - high 423 yards .
But the Tigers struggled in SEC games , scoring just five touchdowns in four games .
The Auburn - Arkansas is a classic matchup : Auburn is 103rd in the nation in scoring offense .
Arkansas is 112th in the nation in scoring defense .
Wrong Number ?
It was another boring Wednesday night , and I was sitting in my room watching television ( in the hopes that I would be entertained ) when the phone rang .
" Hello ? "
A girl 's voice came over the line .
" Can I speak to Ben , please ? "
I live by myself , and my name definitely is not Ben .
It was probably a wrong number .
Of course , it was also a dull evening , even for Indiana .
" I 'm sorry , he 's not in right now .
Can I take a message ? "
" Do you know what time he 'll be back ? " she responded .
" I think he said he'd be home around 10:00 . "
Silence on the other end ... a confused silence .
I had a live one .
" Is this Steve ? "
My name is n't Steve , either .
This was definitely a wrong number .
" Yes , it is .
Do you want to leave a message for Ben ? "
" Well ... he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him ... " she said in a slightly irritated voice .
I must have sounded a lot more like Steve than I had thought .
I replied , " Well , he went out with Karen about an hour ago , and said that he would be back at 10:00 . "
A shocked voice now : " Who 's Karen ? ! "
" The girl he went out with . " ( I 've seen Fletch several times ) .
" I know that !
I mean .... who is she ? "
( She must have seen Fletch , too .... Or is that Fletch Too ?
Whatever ..)
" I do n't know her last name .
Look , do you want me to leave a message for Ben ? "
" Yes ... please do .
Tell him to call me when he gets home . "
She was sounding pretty irate at this point , and I could hear her temper flaring .
Now would be a good time to call an end to the charade .
" I sure will .
Is this Jennifer ? "
She exploded this time .
" WHO'S JENNIFER ? ! "
Apparently she was n't .
" Well ... he's going out with Jennifer at 10:00 .
I thought you were her .
Sorry ... it was an honest mistake . "
" Ben 's the one that 's made the mistake !
Tell him that ALICE called him and that she 's VERY UPSET and that I would LIKE HIM to CALL ME as SOON AS HE GETS HOME . "
I smiled and said , " Okay , I will ... but Becky is n't going to like this ... "
" BECKY ?!?!? "

Letters From The Earth
by Mark Twain
© Harper & Row , 1962 , 1974
originally written in 1909 , according to Mark Twain A to Z and Mark Twain 's Last Days
( hand - typed from the Perennial Edition [ paperback ] by Cliff Walker )
Letters from the Earth
The Creator sat upon the throne , thinking .
Behind him stretched the illimitable continent of heaven , steeped in a glory of light and color ; before him rose the black night of Space , like a wall .
His mighty bulk towered rugged and mountain - like into the zenith , and His divine head blazed there like a distant sun .
At His feet stood three colossal figures , diminished to extinction , almost , by contrast -- archangels -- their heads level with His ankle - bone .
When the Creator had finished thinking , He said , " I have thought .
Behold ! "
He lifted His hand , and from it burst a fountain - spray of fire , a million stupendous suns , which clove the blackness and soared , away and away and away , diminishing in magnitude and intensity as they pierced the far frontiers of Space , until at last they were but as diamond nailheads sparkling under the domed vast roof of the universe .
At the end of an hour the Grand Council was dismissed .
They left the Presence impressed and thoughtful , and retired to a private place , where they might talk with freedom .
None of the three seemed to want to begin , though all wanted somebody to do it .
Each was burning to discuss the great event , but would prefer not to commit himself till he should know how the others regarded it .
So there was some aimless and halting conversation about matters of no consequence , and this dragged tediously along , arriving nowhere , until at last the archangel Satan gathered his courage together -- of which he had a very good supply -- and broke ground .
He said : " We know what we are here to talk about , my lords , and we may as well put pretense aside , and begin .
If this is the opinion of the Council -- "
" It is , it is ! " said Gabriel and Michael , gratefully interrupting .
" Very well , then , let us proceed .
We have witnessed a wonderful thing ; as to that , we are necessarily agreed .
As to the value of it -- if it has any -- that is a matter which does not personally concern us .
We can have as many opinions about it as we like , and that is our limit .
We have no vote .
I think Space was well enough , just as it was , and useful , too .
Cold and dark -- a restful place , now and then , after a season of the overdelicate climate and trying splendors of heaven .
But these are details of no considerable moment ; the new feature , the immense feature , is -- what , gentlemen ? "
" The invention and introduction of automatic , unsupervised , self - regulating law for the government of those myriads of whirling and racing suns and worlds ! "
" That is it ! " said Satan .
" You perceive that it is a stupendous idea .
Nothing approaching it has been evolved from the Master Intellect before .
Law -- Automatic Law -- exact and unvarying Law -- requiring no watching , no correcting , no readjusting while the eternities endure !
He said those countless vast bodies would plunge through the wastes of Space ages and ages , at unimaginable speed , around stupendous orbits , yet never collide , and never lengthen nor shorten their orbital periods by so much as the hundredth part of a second in two thousand years !
That is the new miracle , and the greatest of all -- Automatic Law !
And
He gave it a name -- the LAW OF NATURE -- and said Natural Law is the LAW OF GOD -- interchangeable names for one and the same thing . "
" Yes , " said Michael , " and He said He would establish Natural Law -- the Law of God -- throughout His dominions , and its authority should be supreme and inviolable . "
" Also , " said Gabriel , " He said He would by and by create animals , and place them , likewise , under the authority of that Law . "
" Yes , " said Satan , " I heard Him , but did not understand .
What is animals , Gabriel ? "
" Ah , how should I know ?
How should any of us know ?
It is a new word . "
[ Interval of three centuries , celestial time -- the equivalent of a hundred million years , earthly time .
Enter a Messenger - Angel . ]
" My lords , He is making animals .
Will it please you to come and see ? "
They went , they saw , and were perplexed .
Deeply perplexed -- and the Creator noticed it , and said , " Ask . I will answer . "
" Divine One , " said Satan , making obeisance , " what are they for ? "
" They are an experiment in Morals and Conduct .
Observe them , and be instructed . "
There were thousands of them .
They were full of activities .
Busy , all busy -- mainly in persecuting each other .
Satan remarked -- after examining one of them through a powerful microscope : " This large beast is killing weaker animals , Divine One . "
" The tiger -- yes .
The law of his nature is ferocity .
The law of his nature is the Law of God .
He can not disobey it . "
" Then in obeying it he commits no offense , Divine One ? "
" No , he is blameless . "
" This other creature , here , is timid , Divine One , and suffers death without resisting . "
" The rabbit -- yes .
He is without courage .
It is the law of his nature -- the Law of God .
He must obey it . "
" Then he can not honorably be required to go counter to his nature and resist , Divine One ? "
" No .
No creature can be honorably required to go counter to the law of his nature -- the Law of God . "
After a long time and many questions , Satan said , " The spider kills the fly , and eats it ; the bird kills the spider and eats it ; the wildcat kills the goose ; the -- well , they all kill each other .
It is murder all along the line .
Here are countless multitudes of creatures , and they all kill , kill , kill , they are all murderers .
And they are not to blame , Divine One ? "
" They are not to blame .
It is the law of their nature .
And always the law of nature is the Law of God. Now -- observe -- behold !
A new creature -- and the masterpiece -- Man ! "
Men , women , children , they came swarming in flocks , in droves , in millions .
" What shall you do with them , Divine One ? "
" Put into each individual , in differing shades and degrees , all the various Moral Qualities , in mass , that have been distributed , a single distinguishing characteristic at a time , among the nonspeaking animal world -- courage , cowardice , ferocity , gentleness , fairness , justice , cunning , treachery , magnanimity , cruelty , malice , malignity , lust , mercy , pity , purity , selfishness , sweetness , honor , love , hate , baseness , nobility , loyalty , falsity , veracity , untruthfulness -- each human being shall have all of these in him , and they will constitute his nature .
In some , there will be high and fine characteristics which will submerge the evil ones , and those will be called good men ; in others the evil characteristics will have dominion , and those will be called bad men .
Observe -- behold -- they vanish ! "
" Whither are they gone , Divine One ? "
" To the earth -- they and all their fellow animals . "
" What is the earth ? "
" A small globe I made , a time , two times and a half ago .
You saw it , but did not notice it in the explosion of worlds and suns that sprayed from my hand .
Man is an experiment , the other animals are another experiment .
Time will show whether they were worth the trouble .
The exhibition is over ; you may take your leave , my lords . "
Several days passed by .
This stands for a long stretch of ( our ) time , since in heaven a day is as a thousand years .
Satan had been making admiring remarks about certain of the Creator 's sparkling industries -- remarks which , being read between the lines , were sarcasms .
He had made them confidentially to his safe friends the other archangels , but they had been overheard by some ordinary angels and reported at Headquarters .
He was ordered into banishment for a day -- the celestial day .
It was a punishment he was used to , on account of his too flexible tongue .
Formerly he had been deported into Space , there being nowhither else to send him , and had flapped tediously around there in the eternal night and the Arctic chill ; but now it occurred to him to push on and hunt up the earth and see how the Human Race experiment was coming along .
By and by he wrote home -- very privately -- to St. Michael and St. Gabriel about it .
Satan's Letter
This is a strange place , and extraordinary place , and interesting .
There is nothing resembling it at home .
The people are all insane , the other animals are all insane , the earth is insane , Nature itself is insane .
Man is a marvelous curiosity .
When he is at his very very best he is a sort of low grade nickel - plated angel ; at is worst he is unspeakable , unimaginable ; and first and last and all the time he is a sarcasm .
Yet he blandly and in all sincerity calls himself the " noblest work of God . "
This is the truth I am telling you .
And this is not a new idea with him , he has talked it through all the ages , and believed it .
Believed it , and found nobody among all his race to laugh at it .
Moreover -- if I may put another strain upon you -- he thinks he is the Creator 's pet .
He believes the Creator is proud of him ; he even believes the Creator loves him ; has a passion for him ; sits up nights to admire him ; yes , and watch over him and keep him out of trouble .
He prays to Him , and thinks He listens .
Is n't it a quaint idea ?
Fills his prayers with crude and bald and florid flatteries of Him , and thinks
He sits and purrs over these extravagancies and enjoys them .
He prays for help , and favor , and protection , every day ; and does it with hopefulness and confidence , too , although no prayer of his has ever been answered .
The daily affront , the daily defeat , do not discourage him , he goes on praying just the same .
There is something almost fine about this perseverance .
I must put one more strain upon you : he thinks he is going to heaven !
He has salaried teachers who tell him that .
They also tell him there is a hell , of everlasting fire , and that he will go to it if he does n't keep the Commandments .
What are Commandments ?
They are a curiosity .
I will tell you about them by and by .
Letter II
" I have told you nothing about man that is not true . "
You must pardon me if I repeat that remark now and then in these letters ; I want you to take seriously the things I am telling you , and I feel that if I were in your place and you in mine , I should need that reminder from time to time , to keep my credulity from flagging .
For there is nothing about man that is not strange to an immortal .
He looks at nothing as we look at it , his sense of proportion is quite different from ours , and his sense of values is so widely divergent from ours , that with all our large intellectual powers it is not likely that even the most gifted among us would ever be quite able to understand it .
For instance , take this sample : he has imagined a heaven , and has left entirely out of it the supremest of all his delights , the one ecstasy that stands first and foremost in the heart of every individual of his race -- and of ours -- sexual intercourse !
It is as if a lost and perishing person in a roasting desert should be told by a rescuer he might choose and have all longed - for things but one , and he should elect to leave out water !
His heaven is like himself : strange , interesting , astonishing , grotesque .
I give you my word , it has not a single feature in it that he actually values .
It consists -- utterly and entirely -- of diversions which he cares next to nothing about , here in the earth , yet is quite sure he will like them in heaven .
Is n't it curious ?
Is n't it interesting ?
You must not think I am exaggerating , for it is not so .
I will give you details .
Most men do not sing , most men cannot sing , most men will not stay when others are singing if it be continued more than two hours .
Note that .
Only about two men in a hundred can play upon a musical instrument , and not four in a hundred have any wish to learn how .
Set that down .
Many men pray , not many of them like to do it .
A few pray long , the others make a short cut .
More men go to church than want to .
To forty - nine men in fifty the Sabbath Day is a dreary , dreary bore .
Of all the men in a church on a Sunday , two - thirds are tired when the service is half over , and the rest before it is finished .
The gladdest moment for all of them is when the preacher uplifts his hands for the benediction .
You can hear the soft rustle of relief that sweeps the house , and you recognize that it is eloquent with gratitude .
All nations look down upon all other nations .
All nations dislike all other nations .
All white nations despise all colored nations , of whatever hue , and oppress them when they can .
White men will not associate with " niggers , " nor marry them .
They will not allow them in their schools and churches .
All the world hates the Jew , and will not endure him except when he is rich .
I ask you to note all those particulars .
Further .
All sane people detest noise .
All people , sane or insane , like to have variety in their life .
Monotony quickly wearies them .
Every man , according to the mental equipment that has fallen to his share , exercises his intellect constantly , ceaselessly , and this exercise makes up a vast and valued and essential part of his life .
The lowest intellect , like the highest , possesses a skill of some kind and takes a keen pleasure in testing it , proving it , perfecting it .
The urchin who is his comrade 's superior in games is as diligent and as enthusiastic in his practice as are the sculptor , the painter , the pianist , the mathematician and the rest .
Not one of them could be happy if his talent were put under an interdict .
Now then , you have the facts .
You know what the human race enjoys and what it does n't enjoy .
It has invented a heaven out of its own head , all by itself : guess what it is like !
In fifteen hundred eternities you could n't do it .
The ablest mind known to you or me in fifty million aeons could n't do it .
Very well , I will tell you about it .
1 . First of all , I recall to your attention the extraordinary fact with which I began .
To wit , that the human being , like the immortals , naturally places sexual intercourse far and away above all other joys -- yet he has left it out of his heaven !
The very thought of it excites him ; opportunity sets him wild ; in this state he will risk life , reputation , everything -- even his queer heaven itself -- to make good that opportunity and ride it to the overwhelming climax .
From youth to middle age all men and all women prize copulation above all other pleasures combined , yet it is actually as I have said : it is not in their heaven ; prayer takes its place .
They prize it thus highly ; yet , like all their so - called " boons , " it is a poor thing .
At its very best and longest the act is brief beyond imagination -- the imagination of an immortal , I mean .
In the matter of repetition the man is limited -- oh , quite beyond immortal conception .
We who continue the act and its supremest ecstasies unbroken and without withdrawal for centuries , will never be able to understand or adequately pity the awful poverty of these people in that rich gift which , possessed as we possess it , makes all other possessions trivial and not worth the trouble of invoicing .
2 . In man 's heaven everybody sings !
The man who did not sing on earth sings there ; the man who could not sing on earth is able to do it there .
The universal singing is not casual , not occasional , not relieved by intervals of quiet ; it goes on , all day long , and every day , during a stretch of twelve hours .
And everybody stays ; whereas in the earth the place would be empty in two hours .
The singing is of hymns alone .
Nay , it is of one hymn alone .
The words are always the same , in number they are only about a dozen , there is no rhyme , there is no poetry : " Hosannah , hosannah , hosannah , Lord God of Sabaoth , ' rah ! ' rah ! ' rah !
siss ! -- boom ! ... a - a-ah ! "
3 . Meantime , every person is playing on a harp -- those millions and millions ! -- whereas not more than twenty in the thousand of them could play an instrument in the earth , or ever wanted to .
Consider the deafening hurricane of sound -- millions and millions of voices screaming at once and millions and millions of harps gritting their teeth at the same time !
I ask you : is it hideous , is it odious , is it horrible ?
Consider further : it is a praise service ; a service of compliment , of flattery , of adulation !
Do you ask who it is that is willing to endure this strange compliment , this insane compliment ; and who not only endures it , but likes it , enjoys it , requires if , commands it ?
Hold your breath !
It is God !
This race 's god , I mean .
He sits on his throne , attended by his four and twenty elders and some other dignitaries pertaining to his court , and looks out over his miles and miles of tempestuous worshipers , and smiles , and purrs , and nods his satisfaction northward , eastward , southward ; as quaint and nave a spectacle as has yet been imagined in this universe , I take it .
It is easy to see that the inventor of the heavens did not originate the idea , but copied it from the show - ceremonies of some sorry little sovereign State up in the back settlements of the Orient somewhere .
All sane white people hate noise ; yet they have tranquilly accepted this kind of heaven -- without thinking , without reflection , without examination -- and they actually want to go to it !
Profoundly devout old gray - headed men put in a large part of their time dreaming of the happy day when they will lay down the cares of this life and enter into the joys of that place .
Yet you can see how unreal it is to them , and how little it takes a grip upon them as being fact , for they make no practical preparation for the great change : you never see one of them with a harp , you never hear one of them sing .
As you have seen , that singular show is a service of praise : praise by hymn , praise by prostration .
It takes the place of " church . "
Now then , in the earth these people cannot stand much church -- an hour and a quarter is the limit , and they draw the line at once a week .
That is to say , Sunday .
One day in seven ; and even then they do not look forward to it with longing .
And so -- consider what their heaven provides for them : " church " that lasts forever , and a Sabbath that has no end !
They quickly weary of this brief hebdomadal Sabbath here , yet they long for that eternal one ; they dream of it , they talk about it , they think they think they are going to enjoy it -- with all their simple hearts they think they think they are going to be happy in it !
It is because they do not think at all ; they only think they think .
Whereas they can't think ; not two human beings in ten thousand have anything to think with .
And as to imagination -- oh , well , look at their heaven !
They accept it , they approve it , they admire it .
That gives you their intellectual measure .
4 . The inventor of their heaven empties into it all the nations of the earth , in one common jumble .
All are on an equality absolute , no one of them ranking another ; they have to be " brothers " ; they have to mix together , pray together , harp together , Hosannah together -- whites , niggers , Jews , everybody -- there 's no distinction .
Here in the earth all nations hate each other , and every one of them hates the Jew .
Yet every pious person adores that heaven and wants to get into it .
He really does .
And when he is in a holy rapture he thinks he thinks that if he were only there he would take all the populace to his heart , and hug , and hug , and hug !
He is a marvel -- man is !
I would I knew who invented him .
5 . Every man in the earth possesses some share of intellect , large or small ; and be it large or be it small he takes pride in it .
Also his heart swells at mention of the names of the majestic intellectual chiefs of his race , and he loves the tale of their splendid achievements .
For he is of their blood , and in honoring themselves they have honored him .
Lo , what the mind of man can do !
he cries , and calls the roll of the illustrious of all ages ; and points to the imperishable literatures they have given to the world , and the mechanical wonders they have invented , and the glories wherewith they have clothed science and the arts ; and to them he uncovers as to kings , and gives to them the profoundest homage , and the sincerest , his exultant heart can furnish -- thus exalting intellect above all things else in the world , and enthroning it there under the arching skies in a supremacy unapproachable .
And then he contrived a heaven that has n't a rag of intellectuality in it anywhere !
Is it odd , is it curious , is it puzzling ?
It is exactly as I have said , incredible as it may sound .
This sincere adorer of intellect and prodigal rewarder of its mighty services here in the earth has invented a religion and a heaven which pay no compliments to intellect , offer it no distinctions , fling it no largess : in fact , never even mention it .
By this time you will have noticed that the human being 's heaven has been thought out and constructed upon an absolute definite plan ; and that this plan is , that it shall contain , in labored detail , each and every imaginable thing that is repulsive to a man , and not a single thing he likes !
Very well , the further we proceed the more will this curious fact be apparent .
Make a note of it : in man 's heaven there are no exercises for the intellect , nothing for it to live upon .
It would rot there in a year -- rot and stink .
Rot and stink -- and at that stage become holy .
A blessed thing : for only the holy can stand the joys of that bedlam .
Letter III
You have noticed that the human being is a curiosity .
In times past he has had ( and worn out and flung away ) hundreds and hundreds of religions ; today he has hundreds and hundreds of religions , and launches not fewer than three new ones every year .
I could enlarge that number and still be within the facts .
One of his principle religions is called the Christian .
A sketch of it will interest you .
It sets forth in detail in a book containing two million words , called the Old and New Testaments .
Also it has another name -- The Word of God .
For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God -- the one I have been speaking of .
It is full of interest .
It has noble poetry in it ; and some clever fables ; and some blood - drenched history ; and some good morals ; and a wealth of obscenity ; and upwards of a thousand lies .
This Bible is built mainly out of the fragments of older Bibles that had their day and crumbled to ruin .
So it noticeably lacks in originality , necessarily .
Its three or four most imposing and impressive events all happened in earlier Bibles ; all its best precepts and rules of conduct came also from those Bibles ; there are only two new things in it : hell , for one , and that singular heaven I have told you about .
What shall we do ?
If we believe , with these people , that their God invented these cruel things , we slander him ; if we believe that these people invented them themselves , we slander them .
It is an unpleasant dilemma in either case , for neither of these parties has done us any harm .
For the sake of tranquility , let us take a side .
Let us join forces with the people and put the whole ungracious burden upon him -- heaven , hell , Bible and all .
It does not seem right , it does not seem fair ; and yet when you consider that heaven , and how crushingly charged it is with everything that is repulsive to a human being , how can we believe a human being invented it ?
And when I come to tell you about hell , the stain will be greater still , and you will be likely to say , No , a man would not provide that place , for either himself or anybody else ; he simply could n't .
That innocent Bible tells about the Creation .
Of what -- the universe ?
Yes , the universe .
In six days !
God did it .
He did not call it the universe -- that name is modern .
His whole attention was upon this world .
He constructed it in five days -- and then ?
It took him only one day to make twenty million suns and eighty million planets !
What were they for -- according to this idea ?
To furnish light for this little toy - world .
That was his whole purpose ; he had no other .
One of the twenty million suns ( the smallest one ) was to light it in the daytime , the rest were to help one of the universe 's countless moons modify the darkness of its nights .
It is quite manifest that he believed his fresh - made skies were diamond - sown with those myriads of twinkling stars the moment his first - day 's sun sank below the horizon ; whereas , in fact , not a single star winked in that black vault until three years and a half after that memorable week 's formidable industries had been completed .[**] then one star appeared , all solitary and alone , and began to blink .
Three years later another one appeared .
The two blinked together for more than four years before a third joined them .
At the end of the first hundred years there were not yet twenty - five stars twinkling in the wide wastes of those gloomy skies .
At the end of a thousand years not enough stars were yet visible to make a show .
At the end of a million years only half of the present array had sent their light over the telescopic frontiers , and it took another million for the rest to follow suit , as the vulgar phrase goes .
There being at that time no telescope , their advent was not observed .
For three hundred years , now , the Christian astronomer has known that his Deity did n't make the stars in those tremendous six days ; but the Christian astronomer does not enlarge upon that detail .
Neither does the priest .
In his Book , God is eloquent in his praises of his mighty works , and calls them by the largest names he can find -- thus indicating that he has a strong and just admiration of magnitudes ; yet he made those millions of prodigious suns to light this wee little orb , instead of appointing this orb's little sun to dance attendance upon them .
He mentions Arcturus in his book -- you remember Arcturus ; we went there once .
It is one of the earth 's night lamps ! -- that giant globe which is fifty thousand times as large as the earth 's sun , and compares with it as a melon compares with a cathedral .
However , the Sunday school still teaches the child that Arcturus was created to help light this earth , and the child grows up and continues to believe it long after he has found out that the probabilities are against it being so .
According to the Book and its servants the universe is only six thousand years old .
It is only within the last hundred years that studious , inquiring minds have found out that it is nearer a hundred million .
During the Six Days , God created man and the other animals .
He made a man and a woman and placed them in a pleasant garden , along with the other creatures .
they all lived together there in harmony and contentment and blooming youth for some time ; then trouble came .
God had warned the man and the woman that they must not eat of the fruit of a certain tree .
And he added a most strange remark : he said that if they ate of it they should surely die .
Strange , for the reason that inasmuch as they had never seen a sample death they could not possibly know what he meant .
Neither would he nor any other god have been able to make those ignorant children understand what was meant , without furnishing a sample .
The mere word could have no meaning for them , any more than it would have for an infant of days .
Presently a serpent sought them out privately , and came to them walking upright , which was the way of serpents in those days .
The serpent said the forbidden fruit would store their vacant minds with knowledge .
So they ate it , which was quite natural , for man is so made that he eagerly wants to know ; whereas the priest , like God , whose imitator and representative he is , has made it his business from the beginning to keep him from knowing any useful thing .
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit , and at once a great light streamed into their dim heads .
They had acquired knowledge .
What knowledge -- useful knowledge ?
No -- merely knowledge that there was such a thing as good , and such a thing as evil , and how to do evil .
they could n't do it before .
Therefore all their acts up to this time had been without stain , without blame , without offense .
But now they could do evil -- and suffer for it ; now they had acquired what the Church calls an invaluable possession , the Moral Sense ; that sense which differentiates man from the beast and sets him above the beast .
Instead of below the beast -- where one would suppose his proper place would be , since he is always foul - minded and guilty and the beast always clean - minded and innocent .
It is like valuing a watch that must go wrong , above a watch that can't .
The Church still prizes the Moral Sense as man 's noblest asset today , although the Church knows God had a distinctly poor opinion of it and did what he could in his clumsy way to keep his happy Children of the Garden from acquiring it .
Very well , Adam and Eve now knew what evil was , and how to do it .
They knew how to do various kinds of wrong things , and among them one principal one -- the one God had his mind on principally .
That one was the art and mystery of sexual intercourse .
To them it was a magnificent discovery , and they stopped idling around and turned their entire attention to it , poor exultant young things !
In the midst of one of these celebrations they heard God walking among the bushes , which was an afternoon custom of his , and they were smitten with fright .
Why ?
Because they were naked .
They had not known it before .
They had not minded it before ; neither had God .
In that memorable moment immodesty was born ; and some people have valued it ever since , though it would certainly puzzle them to explain why .
Adam and Eve entered the world naked and unashamed -- naked and pure - minded ; and no descendant of theirs has ever entered it otherwise .
All have entered it naked , unashamed , and clean in mind .
They have entered it modest .
They had to acquire immodesty and the soiled mind ; there was no other way to get it .
A Christian mother 's first duty is to soil her child 's mind , and she does not neglect it .
Her lad grows up to be a missionary , and goes to the innocent savage and to the civilized Japanese , and soils their minds .
Whereupon they adopt immodesty , they conceal their bodies , they stop bathing naked together .
The convention miscalled modesty has no standard , and cannot have one , because it is opposed to nature and reason , and is therefore an artificiality and subject to anybody 's whim , anybody 's diseased caprice .
And so , in India the refined lady covers her face and breasts and leaves her legs naked from the hips down , while the refined European lady covers her legs and exposes her face and her breasts .
In lands inhabited by the innocent savage the refined European lady soon gets used to full - grown native stark - nakedness , and ceases to be offended by it .
A highly cultivated French count and countess -- unrelated to each other -- who were marooned in their nightclothes , by shipwreck , upon an uninhabited island in the eighteenth century , were soon naked .
Also ashamed -- for a week .
After that their nakedness did not trouble them , and they soon ceased to think about it .
You have never seen a person with clothes on .
Oh , well , you have n't lost anything .
To proceed with the Biblical curiosities .
Naturally you will think the threat to punish Adam and Eve for disobeying was of course not carried out , since they did not create themselves , nor their natures nor their impulses nor their weaknesses , and hence were not properly subject to anyone 's commands , and not responsible to anybody for their acts .
It will surprise you to know that the threat was carried out .
Adam and Eve were punished , and that crime finds apologists unto this day .
The sentence of death was executed .
As you perceive , the only person responsible for the couple 's offense escaped ; and not only escaped but became the executioner of the innocent .
In your country and mine we should have the privilege of making fun of this kind of morality , but it would be unkind to do it here .
Many of these people have the reasoning faculty , but no one uses it in religious matters .
The best minds will tell you that when a man has begotten a child he is morally bound to tenderly care for it , protect it from hurt , shield it from disease , clothe it , feed it , bear with its waywardness , lay no hand upon it save in kindness and for its own good , and never in any case inflict upon it a wanton cruelty .
God 's treatment of his earthly children , every day and every night , is the exact opposite of all that , yet those best minds warmly justify these crimes , condone them , excuse them , and indignantly refuse to regard them as crimes at all , when he commits them .
Your country and mine is an interesting one , but there is nothing there that is half so interesting as the human mind .
Very well , God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden , and eventually assassinated them .
All for disobeying a command which he had no right to utter .
But he did not stop there , as you will see .
He has one code of morals for himself , and quite another for his children .
He requires his children to deal justly -- and gently -- with offenders , and forgive them seventy - and - seven times ; whereas he deals neither justly nor gently with anyone , and he did not forgive the ignorant and thoughtless first pair of juveniles even their first small offense and say , " You may go free this time , and I will give you another chance . "
On the contrary !
He elected to punish their children , all through the ages to the end of time , for a trifling offense committed by others before they were born .
He is punishing them yet .
In mild ways ?
No , in atrocious ones .
You would not suppose that this kind of Being gets many compliments .
Undeceive yourself : the world calls him the All - Just , the All - Righteous , the All - Good , the All - Merciful , the All - Forgiving , the All - Truthful , the All - Loving , the Source of All Morality .
These sarcasms are uttered daily , all over the world .
But not as conscious sarcasms .
No , they are meant seriously : they are uttered without a smile .
Letter IV
So the First Pair went forth from the Garden under a curse -- a permanent one .
They had lost every pleasure they had possessed before " The Fall " ; and yet they were rich , for they had gained one worth all the rest : they knew the Supreme Art .
They practiced it diligently and were filled with contentment .
The Deity ordered them to practice it .
They obeyed , this time .
But it was just as well it was not forbidden , for they would have practiced it anyhow , if a thousand Deities had forbidden it .
Results followed .
By the name of Cain and Abel .
And these had some sisters ; and knew what to do with them .
And so there were some more results : Cain and Abel begot some nephews and nieces .
These , in their turn , begot some second cousins .
At this point classification of relationships began to get difficult , and the attempt to keep it up was abandoned .
The pleasant labor of populating the world went on from age to age , and with prime efficiency ; for in those happy days the sexes were still competent for the Supreme
Art when by rights they ought to have been dead eight hundred years .
The sweeter sex , the dearer sex , the lovelier sex was manifestly at its very best , then , for it was even able to attract gods .
Real gods .
They came down out of heaven and had wonderful times with those hot young blossoms .
The Bible tells about it .
By help of those visiting foreigners the population grew and grew until it numbered several millions .
But it was a disappointment to the Deity .
He was dissatisfied with its morals ; which in some respects were not any better than his own .
Indeed they were an unflatteringly close imitation of his own .
They were a very bad people , and as he knew of no way to reform them , he wisely concluded to abolish them .
This is the only really enlightened and superior idea his Bible has credited him with , and it would have made his reputation for all time if he could only have kept to it and carried it out .
But he was always unstable -- except in his advertisements -- and his good resolution broke down .
He took a pride in man ; man was his finest invention ; man was his pet , after the housefly , and he could not bear to lose him wholly ; so he finally decided to save a sample of him and drown the rest .
Nothing could be more characteristic of him .
He created all those infamous people , and he alone was responsible for their conduct .
Not one of them deserved death , yet it was certainly good policy to extinguish them ; especially since in creating them the master crime had already been committed , and to allow them to go on procreating would be a distinct addition to the crime .
But at the same time there could be no justice , no fairness , in any favoritism -- all should be drowned or none .
No , he would not have it so ; he would save half a dozen and try the race over again .
He was not able to foresee that it would go rotten again , for he is only the Far - Sighted One in his advertisements .
He saved out Noah and his family , and arranged to exterminate the rest .
He planned an Ark , and Noah built it .
Neither of them had ever built an Ark before , nor knew anything about Arks ; and so something out of the common was to be expected .
It happened .
Noah was a farmer , and although he knew what was required of the Ark he was quite incompetent to say whether this one would be large enough to meet the requirements or not ( which it was n't ) , so he ventured no advice .
The Deity did not know it was n't large enough , but took the chances and made no adequate measurements .
In the end the ship fell far short of the necessities , and to this day the world still suffers for it .
Noah built the Ark .
He built it the best he could , but left out most of the essentials .
It had no rudder , it had no sails , it had no compass , it had no pumps , it had no charts , no lead - lines , no anchors , no log , no light , no ventilation , and as for cargo room -- which was the main thing -- the less said about that the better .
It was to be at sea eleven months , and would need fresh water enough to fill two Arks of its size -- yet the additional Ark was not provided .
Water from outside could not be utilized : half of it would be salt water , and men and land animals could not drink it .
For not only was a sample of man to be saved , but business samples of the other animals , too .
You must understand that when Adam ate the apple in the Garden and learned how to multiply and replenish , the other animals learned the Art , too , by watching Adam .
It was cunning of them , it was neat ; for they got all that was worth having out of the apple without tasting it and afflicting themselves with the disastrous Moral Sense , the parent of all immoralities .
Letter V
Noah began to collect animals .
There was to be one couple of each and every sort of creature that walked or crawled , or swam or flew , in the world of animated nature .
We have to guess at how long it took to collect the creatures and how much it cost , for there is no record of these details .
When Symmachus made preparation to introduce his young son to grown - up life in imperial Rome , he sent men to Asia , Africa and everywhere to collect wild animals for the arena - fights .
It took the men three years to accumulate the animals and fetch them to Rome .
Merely quadrupeds and alligators , you understand -- no birds , no snakes , no frogs , no worms , no lice , no rats , no fleas , no ticks , no caterpillars , no spiders , no houseflies , no mosquitoes -- nothing but just plain simple quadrupeds and alligators : and no quadrupeds except fighting ones .
Yet it was as I have said : it took three years to collect them , and the cost of animals and transportation and the men's wages footed up $ 4,500,000 .
How many animals ?
We do not know .
But it was under five thousand , for that was the largest number ever gathered for those Roman shows , and it was Titus , not Symmachus , who made that collection .
Those were mere baby museums , compared to Noah 's contract .
Of birds and beasts and fresh - water creatures he had to collect 146,000 kinds ; and of insects upwards of two million species .
Thousands and thousands of those things are very difficult to catch , and if Noah had not given up and resigned , he would be on the job yet , as Leviticus used to say .
However , I do not mean that he withdrew .
No , he did not do that .
He gathered as many creatures as he had room for , and then stopped .
If he had known all the requirements in the beginning , he would have been aware that what was needed was a fleet of Arks .
But he did not know how many kinds of creatures there were , neither did his Chief .
So he had no Kangaroo , and no ' possom , and no Gila monster , and no ornithorhynchus , and lacked a multitude of other indispensable blessings which a loving Creator had provided for man and forgotten about , they having long ago wandered to a side of this world which he had never seen and with whose affairs he was not acquainted .
And so everyone of them came within a hair of getting drowned .
They only escaped by an accident .
There was not water enough to go around .
Only enough was provided to flood one small corner of the globe -- the rest of the globe was not then known , and was supposed to be nonexistent .
However , the thing that really and finally and definitely determined Noah to stop with enough species for purely business purposes and let the rest become extinct , was an incident of the last days : an excited stranger arrived with some most alarming news .
He said he had been camping among some mountains and valleys about six hundred miles away , and he had seen a wonderful thing there : he stood upon a precipice overlooking a wide valley , and up the valley he was a billowy black sea of strange animal life coming .
Presently the creatures passed by , struggling , fighting , scrambling , screeching , snorting -- horrible vast masses of tumultuous flesh !
Sloths as big as an elephant ; frogs as big as a cow ; a megatherium and his harem huge beyond belief ; saurians and saurians and saurians , group after group , family after family , species after species -- a hundred feet long , thirty feet high , and twice as quarrelsome ; one of them hit a perfectly blameless Durham bull a thump with its tail and sent it whizzing three hundred feet into the air and it fell at the man 's feet with a sigh and was no more .
The man said that these prodigious animals had heard about the Ark and were coming .
Coming to get saved from the flood .
And not coming in pairs , they were all coming : they did not know the passengers were restricted to pairs , the man said , and would n't care a rap for the regulations , anyway -- they would sail in that Ark or know the reason why .
The man said the Ark would not hold the half of them ; and moreover they were coming hungry , and would eat up everything there was , including the menagerie and the family .
All these facts were suppressed , in the Biblical account .
You find not a hint of them there .
The whole thing is hushed up .
Not even the names of those vast creatures are mentioned .
It shows you that when people have left a reproachful vacancy in a contract they can be as shady about it in Bibles as elsewhere .
Those powerful animals would be of inestimable value to man now , when transportation is so hard pressed and expensive , but they are all lost to him .
All lost , and by Noah 's fault .
They all got drowned .
Some of them as much as eight million years ago .
Very well , the stranger told his tale , and Noah saw that he must get away before the monsters arrived .
He would have sailed at once , but the upholsterers and decorators of the housefly 's drawing room still had some finishing touches to put on , and that lost him a day .
Another day was lost in getting the flies aboard , there being sixty - eight billions of them and the Deity still afraid there might not be enough .
Another day was lost in stowing forty tons of selected filth for the flies ' sustenance .
Then at last , Noah sailed ; and none too soon , for the Ark was only just sinking out of sight on the horizon when the monsters arrived , and added their lamentations to those of the multitude of weeping fathers and mothers and frightened little children who were clinging to the wave - washed rocks in the pouring rain and lifting imploring prayers to an All - Just and All - Forgiving and All - Pitying Being who had never answered a prayer since those crags were builded , grain by grain , out of the sands , and would still not have answered one when the ages should have crumbled them to sand again .
Letter VI
On the third day , about noon , it was found that a fly and been left behind .
The return voyage turned out to be long and difficult , on account of the lack of chart and compass , and because of the changed aspects of all coasts , the steadily rising water having submerged some of the lower landmarks and given to higher ones an unfamiliar look ; but after sixteen days of earnest and faithful seeking , the fly was found at last , and received on board with hymns of praise and gratitude , the Family standing meanwhile uncovered , our of reverence for its divine origin .
It was weary and worn , and had suffered somewhat from the weather , but was otherwise in good estate .
Men and their families had died of hunger on barren mountain tops , but it had not lacked for food , the multitudinous corpses furnishing it in rank and rotten richness .
Thus was the sacred bird providentially preserved .
Providentially .
That is the word .
For the fly had not been left behind by accident .
No , the hand of Providence was in it .
There are no accidents .
All things that happen , happen for a purpose .
They are foreseen from the beginning of time , they are ordained from the beginning of time .
From the dawn of Creation the Lord had foreseen that Noah , being alarmed and confused by the invasion of the prodigious brevet fossils , would prematurely fly to sea unprovided with a certain invaluable disease .
He would have all the other diseases , and could distribute them among the new races of men as they appeared in the world , but he would lack one of the very best -- typhoid fever ; a malady which , when the circumstances are especially favorable , is able to utterly wreck a patient without killing him ; for it can restore him to his feet with a long life in him , and yet deaf , dumb , blind , crippled , and idiotic .
The housefly is its main disseminator , and is more competent and more calamitously effective than all the other distributors of the dreaded scourge put together .
And so , by foreordination from the beginning of time , this fly was left behind to seek out a typhoid corpse and feed upon its corruptions and gaum its legs with germs and transmit them to the re-peopled world for permanent business .
From that one housefly , in the ages that have since elapsed , billions of sickbeds have been stocked , billions of wrecked bodies sent tottering about the earth , and billions of cemeteries recruited with the dead .
It is most difficult to understand the disposition of the Bible God , it is such a confusion of contradictions ; of watery instabilities and iron firmness ; of goody - goody abstract morals made out of words , and concreted hell - born ones made out of acts ; of fleeting kindness repented of in permanent malignities .
However , when after much puzzling you get at the key to his disposition , you do at last arrive at a sort of understanding of it .
With a most quaint and juvenile and astonishing frankness he has furnished that key himself .
It is jealousy !
I expect that to take your breath away .
You are aware -- for I have already told you in an earlier letter -- that among human beings jealousy ranks distinctly as a weakness ; a trade - mark of small minds ; a property of all small minds , yet a property which even the smallest is ashamed of ; and when accused of its possession will lyingly deny it and resent the accusation as an insult .
Jealousy .
Do not forget it , keep it in mind .
It is the key .
With it you will come to partly understand God as we go along ; without it nobody can understand him .
As I have said , he has openly held up this treasonous key himself , for all to see .
He says , naïvely , outspokenly , and without suggestion of embarrassment : " I the Lord thy God am a jealous God . "
You see , it is only another way of saying , " I the Lord thy God am a small God ; a small God , and fretful about small things . "
He was giving a warning : he could not bear the thought of any other God getting some of the Sunday compliments of this comical little human race -- he wanted all of them for himself .
He valued them .
To him they were riches ; just as tin money is to a Zulu .
But wait -- I am not fair ; I am misrepresenting him ; prejudice is beguiling me into saying what is not true .
He did not say he wanted all of the adulations ; he said nothing about not being willing to share them with his fellow gods ; what he said was , " Thou shalt have no other gods before me . "
It is a quite different thing , and puts him in a much better light -- I confess it .
There was an abundance of gods , the woods were full of them , as the saying is , and all he demanded was that he should be ranked as high as the others -- not above any of them , but not below any of them .
He was willing that they should fertilize earthly virgins , but not on any better terms than he could have for himself in his turn .
He wanted to be held their equal .
This he insisted upon , in the clearest language : he would have no other gods before him .
They could march abreast with him , but none of them could head the procession , and he did not claim the right to head it himself .
Do you think he was able to stick to that upright and creditable position ?
No .
He could keep to a bad resolution forever , but he could n't keep to a good one a month .
By and by he threw aside and calmly claimed to be the only God in the entire universe .
As I was saying , jealousy is the key ; all through his history it is present and prominent .
It is the blood and bone of his disposition , it is the basis of his character .
How small a thing can wreck his composure and disorder his judgement if it touches the raw of his jealousy !
And nothing warms up this trait so quickly and so surely and so exaggeratedly as a suspicion that some competition with the god-Trust is impending .
The fear that if Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge they would " be as gods " so fired his jealousy that his reason was affected , and he could not treat those poor creatures either fairly or charitably , or even refrain from dealing cruelly and criminally with their blameless posterity .
To this day his reason has never recovered from that shock ; a wild nightmare of vengefulness has possessed him ever since , and he has almost bankrupted his native ingenuities in inventing pains and miseries and humiliations and heartbreaks wherewith to embitter the brief lives of Adam 's descendants .
Think of the diseases he has contrived for them !
They are multitudinous ; no book can name them all .
And each one is a trap , set for an innocent victim .
The human being is a machine .
An automatic machine .
It is composed of thousands of complex and delicate mechanisms , which perform their functions harmoniously and perfectly , in accordance with laws devised for their governance , and over which the man himself has no authority , no mastership , no control .
For each one of these thousands of mechanisms the Creator has planned an enemy , whose office is to harass it , pester it , persecute it , damage it , afflict it with pains , and miseries , and ultimate destruction .
Not one has been overlooked .
From cradle to grave these enemies are always at work ; they know no rest , night or day .
They are an army : an organized army ; a besieging army ; an assaulting army ; an army that is alert , watchful , eager , merciless ; an army that never relents , never grants a truce .
It moves by squad , by company , by battalion , by regiment , by brigade , by division , by army corps ; upon occasion it masses its parts and moves upon mankind with its whole strength .
It is the Creator 's Grand Army , and he is the Commander - in - Chief .
Along its battlefront its grisly banners wave their legends in the face of the sun : Disaster , Disease , and the rest .
Disease !
That is the main force , the diligent force , the devastating force !
It attacks the infant the moment it is born ; it furnishes it one malady after another : croup , measles , mumps , bowel troubles , teething pains , scarlet fever , and other childhood specialties .
It chases the child into youth and furnishes it some specialties for that time of life .
It chases the youth into maturity , maturity into age , age into the grave .
With these facts before you will you now try to guess man 's chiefest pet name for this ferocious Commander - in - Chief ?
I will save you the trouble -- but you must not laugh .
It is Our Father in Heaven !
It is curious -- the way the human mind works .
The Christian begins with this straight proposition , this definite proposition , this inflexible and uncompromising proposition : God is all - knowing , and all - powerful .
This being the case , nothing can happen without his knowing beforehand that it is going to happen ; nothing happens without his permission ; nothing can happen that he chooses to prevent .
That is definite enough , is n't it ?
It makes the Creator distinctly responsible for everything that happens , does n't it ?
The Christian concedes it in that italicized sentence .
Concedes it with feeling , with enthusiasm .
Then , having thus made the Creator responsible for all those pains and diseases and miseries above enumerated , and which he could have prevented , the gifted Christian blandly calls him Our Father !
It is as I tell you .
He equips the Creator with every trait that goes to the making of a fiend , and then arrives at the conclusion that a fiend and a father are the same thing !
Yet he would deny that a malevolent lunatic and a Sunday school superintendent are essentially the same .
What do you think of the human mind ?
I mean , in case you think there is a human mind .
Letter VII
Noah and his family were saved -- if that could be called an advantage .
I throw in the if for the reason that there has never been an intelligent person of the age of sixty who would consent to live his life over again .
His or anyone else 's .
The Family were saved , yes , but they were not comfortable , for they were full of microbes .
Full to the eyebrows ; fat with them , obese with them , distended like balloons .
It was a disagreeable condition , but it could not be helped , because enough microbes had to be saved to supply the future races of men with desolating diseases , and there were but eight persons on board to serve as hotels for them .
The microbes were by far the most important part of the Ark 's cargo , and the part the Creator was most anxious about and most infatuated with .
They had to have good nourishment and pleasant accommodations .
There were typhoid germs , and cholera germs , and hydrophobia germs , and lockjaw germs , and consumption germs , and black - plague germs , and some hundreds of other aristocrats , specially precious creations , golden bearers of God 's love to man , blessed gifts of the infatuated Father to his children -- all of which had to be sumptuously housed and richly entertained ; these were located in the choicest places the interiors of the Family could furnish : in the lungs , in the heart , in the brain , in the kidneys , in the blood , in the guts .
In the guts particularly .
The great intestine was the favorite resort .
There they gathered , by countless billions , and worked , and fed , and squirmed , and sang hymns of praise and thanksgiving ; and at night when it was quiet you could hear the soft murmur of it .
The large intestine was in effect their heaven .
They stuffed it solid ; they made it as rigid as a coil of gaspipe .
They took pride in this .
Their principal hymn made gratified reference to it :
Constipation , O Constipation ,
The Joyful sound proclaim
Till man 's remotest entrail
Shall praise its Maker 's name
The discomforts furnished by the Ark were many and various .
The family had to live right in the presence of the multitudinous animals , and breathe the distressing stench they make and be deafened day and night with the thunder - crash of noise their roarings and screechings produced ; and in additions to these intolerable discomforts it was a peculiarly trying place for the ladies , for they could look in no direction without seeing some thousands of the creatures engaged in multiplying and replenishing .
And then , there were the flies .
They swarmed everywhere , and persecuted the Family all day long .
They were the first animals up , in the morning , and the last ones down , at night .
But they must not be killed , they must not be injured , they were sacred , their origin was divine , they were the special pets of the Creator , his darlings .
By and by the other creatures would be distributed here and there about the earth -- scattered : the tigers to India , the lions and the elephants to the vacant desert and the secret places of the jungle , the birds to the boundless regions of empty space , the insects to one or another climate , according to nature and requirement ; but the fly ?
He is of no nationality ; all the climates are his home , all the globe is his province , all creatures that breathe are his prey , and unto them all he is a scourge and a hell .
To man he is a divine ambassador , a minister plenipotentiary , the Creator 's special representative .
He infests him in his cradle ; clings in bunches to his gummy eyelids ; buzzes and bites and harries him , robbing him of his sleep and his weary mother of her strength in those long vigils which she devotes to protecting her child from this pest 's persecutions .
The fly harries the sick man in his home , in the hospital , even on his deathbed at his last gasp .
Pesters him at his meals ; previously hunts up patients suffering from loathsome and deadly diseases ; wades in their sores , gaums its legs with a million death - dealing germs ; then comes to that healthy man 's table and wipes these things off on the butter and discharges a bowel - load of typhoid germs and excrement on his batter - cakes .
The housefly wrecks more human constitutions and destroys more human lives than all God 's multitude of misery - messengers and death - agents put together .
Shem was full of hookworms .
It is wonderful , the thorough and comprehensive study which the Creator devoted to the great work of making man miserable .
I have said he devised a special affliction - agent for each and every detail of man 's structure , overlooking not a single one , and I said the truth .
Many poor people have to go barefoot , because they cannot afford shoes .
The Creator saw his opportunity .
I will remark , in passing , that he always has his eye on the poor .
Nine - tenths of his disease - inventions were intended for the poor , and they get them .
The well - to - do get only what is left over .
Do not suspect me of speaking unheedfully , for it is not so : the vast bulk of the Creator 's affliction - inventions are specially designed for the persecution of the poor .
You could guess this by the fact that one of the pulpit 's finest and commonest names for the Creator is " The Friend of the Poor . "
Under no circumstances does the pulpit ever pay the Creator a compliment that has a vestige of truth in it .
The poor 's most implacable and unwearying enemy is their Father in Heaven .
The poor 's only real friend is their fellow man .
He is sorry for them , he pities them , and he shows it by his deeds .
He does much to relieve their distresses ; and in every case their Father in Heaven gets the credit of it .
Just so with diseases .
If science exterminates a disease which has been working for God , it is God that gets the credit , and all the pulpits break into grateful advertising - raptures and call attention to how good he is !
Yes , he has done it .
Perhaps he has waited a thousand years before doing it .
That is nothing ; the pulpit says he was thinking about it all the time .
When exasperated men rise up and sweep away an age - long tyranny and set a nation free , the first thing the delighted pulpit does is to advertise it as God 's work , and invite the people to get down on their knees and pour out their thanks to him for it .
And the pulpit says with admiring emotion , " Let tyrants understand that the Eye that never sleeps is upon them ; and let them remember that the Lord our God will not always be patient , but will loose the whirlwinds of his wrath upon them in his appointed day . "
They forget to mention that he is the slowest mover in the universe ; that his Eye that never sleeps , might as well , since it takes it a century to see what any other eye would see in a week ; that in all history there is not an instance where he thought of a noble deed first , but always thought of it just a little after somebody else had thought of it and done it .
He arrives then , and annexes the dividend .
Very well , six thousand years ago Shem was full of hookworms .
Microscopic in size , invisible to the unaided eye .
All of the Creator 's specially deadly disease - producers are invisible .
It is an ingenious idea .
For thousands of years it kept man from getting at the roots of his maladies , and defeated his attempts to master them .
It is only very recently that science has succeeded in exposing some of these treacheries .
The very latest of these blessed triumphs of science is the discovery and identification of the ambuscaded assassin which goes by the name of the hookworm .
Its special prey is the barefooted poor .
It lies in wait in warm regions and sandy places and digs its way into their unprotected feet .
The hookworm was discovered two or three years ago by a physician , who had been patiently studying its victims for a long time .
The disease induced by the hookworm had been doing its evil work here and there in the earth ever since Shem landed on Ararat , but it was never suspected to be a disease at all .
The people who had it were merely supposed to be lazy , and were therefore despised and made fun of , when they should have been pitied .
The hookworm is a peculiarly sneaking and underhanded invention , and has done its surreptitious work unmolested for ages ; but that physician and his helpers will exterminate it now .
God is back of this .
He has been thinking about it for six thousand years , and making up his mind .
The idea of exterminating the hookworm was his .
He came very near doing it before Dr. Charles Wardell Stiles did .
But he is in time to get the credit of it .
He always is .
It is going to cost a million dollars .
He was probably just in the act of contributing that sum when a man pushed in ahead of him -- as usual .
Mr. Rockefeller .
He furnishes the million , but the credit will go elsewhere -- as usual .
This morning 's journal tells us something about the hookworm 's operations :
The hookworm parasites often so lower the vitality of those who are affected as to retard their physical and mental development , render them more susceptible to other diseases , make labor less efficient , and in the sections where the malady is most prevalent greatly increase the death rate from consumption , pneumonia , typhoid fever and malaria .
It has been shown that the lowered vitality of multitudes , long attributed to malaria and climate and seriously affecting economic development , is in fact due in some districts to this parasite .
The disease is by no means confined to any one class ; it takes its toll of suffering and death from the highly intelligent and well to do as well as from the less fortunate .
It is a conservative estimate that two millions of our people are affected by this parasite .
The disease is more common and more serious in children of school age than in other persons .
Widespread and serious as the infection is , there is still a most encouraging outlook .
The disease can be easily recognized , readily and effectively treated and by simple and proper sanitary precautions successfully prevented [ with God 's help ] .
The poor children are under the Eye that never sleeps , you see .
They have had that ill luck in all the ages .
They and " the Lord 's poor " -- as the sarcastic phrase goes -- have never been able to get away from that Eye 's attentions .
Yes , the poor , the humble , the ignorant -- they are the ones that catch it .
Take the " Sleeping Sickness , " of Africa .
This atrocious cruelty has for its victims a race of ignorant and unoffending blacks whom God placed in a remote wilderness , and bent his parental Eye upon them -- the one that never sleeps when there is a chance to breed sorrow for somebody .
He arranged for these people before the Flood .
The chosen agent was a fly , related to the tsetse ; the tsetse is a fly which has command of the Zambezi country and stings cattle and horses to death , thus rendering that region uninhabitable by man .
The tsetse 's awful relative deposits a microbe which produces the Sleeping Sickness .
Ham was full of these microbes , and when the voyage was over he discharged them in Africa and the havoc began , never to find amelioration until six thousand years should go by and science should pry into the mystery and hunt out the cause of the disease .
The pious nations are now thanking God , and praising him for coming to the rescue of his poor blacks .
The pulpit says the praise is due to him .
He is surely a curious Being .
He commits a fearful crime , continues that crime unbroken for six thousand years , and is then entitled to praise because he suggests to somebody else to modify its severities .
He is called patient , and he certainly must be patient , or he would have sunk the pulpit in perdition ages ago for the ghastly compliments it pays him .
Science has this to say about the Sleeping Sickness , otherwise called the Negro Lethargy :
It is characterized by periods of sleep recurring at intervals .
The disease lasts from four months to four years , and is always fatal .
The victim appears at first languid , weak , pallid , and stupid .
His eyelids become puffy , an eruption appears on his skin .
He falls asleep while talking , eating , or working .
As the disease progresses he is fed with difficulty and becomes much emaciated .
The failure of nutrition and the appearance of bedsores are followed by convulsions and death .
Some patients become insane .
It is he whom Church and people call Our Father in Heaven who has invented the fly and sent him to inflict this dreary long misery and melancholy and wretchedness , and decay of body and mind , upon a poor savage who has done that Great Criminal no harm .
There is n't a man in the world who does n't pity that poor black sufferer , and there is n't a man that would n't make him whole if he could .
To find the one person who has no pity for him you must go to heaven ; to find the one person who is able to heal him and could n't be persuaded to do it , you must go to the same place .
There is only one father cruel enough to afflict his child with that horrible disease -- only one .
Not all the eternities can produce another one .
Do you like reproachful poetical indignations warmly expressed ?
Here is one , hot from the heart of a slave :
Man 's inhumanity to man
Makes countless thousands mourn !
I will tell you a pleasant tale which has in it a touch of pathos .
A man got religion , and asked the priest what he must do to be worthy of his new estate .
The priest said , " Imitate our Father in Heaven , learn to be like him . "
The man studied his Bible diligently and thoroughly and understandingly , and then with prayers for heavenly guidance instituted his imitations .
He tricked his wife into falling downstairs , and she broke her back and became a paralytic for life ; he betrayed his brother into the hands of a sharper , who robbed him of his all and landed him in the almshouse ; he inoculated one son with hookworms , another with the sleeping sickness , another with gonorrhea ; he furnished one daughter with scarlet fever and ushered her into her teens deaf , dumb , and blind for life ; and after helping a rascal seduce the remaining one , he closed his doors against her and she died in a brothel cursing him .
Then he reported to the priest , who said that that was no way to imitate his Father in Heaven .
The convert asked wherein he had failed , but the priest changed the subject and inquired what kind of weather he was having , up his way .
Letter VIII
Man is without any doubt the most interesting fool there is .
Also the most eccentric .
He has n't a single written law , in his Bible or out of it , which has any but just one purpose and intention -- to limit or defeat the law of God .
He can seldom take a plain fact and get any but a wrong meaning out of it .
He cannot help this ; it is the way the confusion he calls his mind is constructed .
Consider the things he concedes , and the curious conclusions he draws from them .
For instance , he concedes that God made man .
Made him without man 's desire of privity .
This seems to plainly and indisputably make God , and God alone , responsible for man 's acts .
But man denies this .
He concedes that God has made the angels perfect , without blemish , and immune from pain and death , and that he could have been similarly kind to man if he had wanted to , but denies that he was under any moral obligation to do it .
He concedes that man has no moral right to visit the child of his begetting with wanton cruelties , painful diseases and death , but refuses to limit God 's privileges in this sort with the children of his begetting .
The Bible and man 's statutes forbid murder , adultery , fornication , lying , treachery , robbery , oppression and other crimes , but contend that God is free of these laws and has a right to break them when he will .
He concedes that God gives to each man his temperament , his disposition , at birth ; he concedes that man cannot by any process change this temperament , but must remain always under its dominion .
Yet if it be full of dreadful passions , in one man 's case , and barren of them in another man's , it is right and rational to punish the one for his crimes , and reward the other for abstaining from crime .
There -- let us consider these curiosities .
Temperament ( Disposition )
Take two extremes of temperament -- the goat and the tortoise .
Neither of these creatures makes its own temperament , but is born with it , like man , and can no more change it than can man .
Temperament is the law of God written in the heart of every creature by God 's own hand , and must be obeyed , and will be obeyed in spite of all restricting or forbidding statutes , let them emanate whence they may .
Very well , lust is the dominant feature of the goat 's temperament , the law of God is in its heart , and it must obey it and will obey it the whole day long in the rutting season , without stopping to eat or drink .
If the Bible said to the goat , " Thou shalt not fornicate , thou shalt not commit adultery , " even Man -- sap - headed man -- would recognize the foolishness of the prohibition , and would grant that the goat ought not to be punished for obeying the law of his Maker .
Yet he thinks it right and just that man should be put under the prohibition .
All men .
All alike .
On its face this is stupid , for , by temperament , which is the real law of God , many men are goats and can't help committing adultery when they get a chance ; whereas there are numbers of men who , by temperament , can keep their purity and let an opportunity go by if the woman lacks in attractiveness .
But the Bible does n't allow adultery at all , whether a person can help it or not .
It allows no distinction between goat and tortoise -- the excitable goat , the emotional goat , that has to have some adultery every day or fade and die ; and the tortoise , that cold calm puritan , that takes a treat only once in two years and then goes to sleep in the midst of it and does n't wake up for sixty days .
No lady goat is safe from criminal assault , even on the Sabbath Day , when there is a gentleman goat within three miles to leeward of her and nothing in the way but a fence fourteen feet high , whereas neither the gentleman tortoise nor the lady tortoise is ever hungry enough for solemn joys of fornication to be willing to break the Sabbath to get them .
Now according to man 's curious reasoning , the goat has earned punishment , and the tortoise praise .
" Thou shalt not commit adultery " is a command which makes no distinction between the following persons .
They are all required to obey it :
Children at birth .
Children in the cradle .
School children .
Youths and maidens .
Fresh adults .
Older ones .
Men and women of 40 .
Of 50 .
Of 60 .
Of 70 .
Of 80 .
Of 90 .
Of 100 .
The command does not distribute its burden equally , and cannot .
It is not hard upon the three sets of children .
It is hard -- harder -- still harder upon the next three sets -- cruelly hard .
It is blessedly softened to the next three sets .
It has now done all the damage it can , and might as well be put out of commission .
Yet with comical imbecility it is continued , and the four remaining estates are put under its crushing ban .
Poor old wrecks , they could n't disobey if they tried .
And think -- because they holily refrain from adulterating each other , they get praise for it !
Which is nonsense ; for even the Bible knows enough to know that if the oldest veteran there could get his lost heyday back again for an hour he would cast that commandment to the winds and ruin the first woman he came across , even though she were an entire stranger .
It is as I have said : every statute in the Bible and in the law - books is an attempt to defeat a law of God -- in other words an unalterable and indestructible law of nature .
These people 's God has shown them by a million acts that he respects none of the Bible 's statutes .
He breaks every one of the himself , adultery and all .
The law of God , as quite plainly expressed in woman 's construction is this :
There shall be no limit put upon your intercourse with the other sex sexually , at any time of life .
The law of God , as quite plainly expressed in man 's construction is this :
During your entire life you shall be under inflexible limits and restrictions , sexually .
During twenty - three days in every month ( in absence of pregnancy ) from the time a woman is seven years old till she dies of old age , she is ready for action , and competent .
As competent as the candlestick is to receive the candle .
Competent every day , competent every night .
Also she wants that candle -- yearns for it , longs for it , hankers after it , as commanded by the law of God in her heart .
But man is only briefly competent ; and only then in the moderate measure applicable to the word in his sex 's case .
He is competent from the age of sixteen or seventeen thence - forward for thirty - five years .
After fifty his performance is of poor quality , the intervals between are wide , and its satisfactions of no great value to either party ; whereas his great - grandmother is as good as new .
There is nothing the matter with her plant .
Her candlestick is as firm as ever , whereas his candle is increasingly softened and weakened by the weather of age , as the years go by , until at last it can no longer stand , and is mournfully laid to rest in the hope of a blessed resurrection which is never to come .
By the woman 's make , her plant has to be out of service three days in the month , and during a part of her pregnancy .
These are times of discomfort , often of suffering .
For fair and just compensation she has the high privilege of unlimited adultery all the other days of her life .
That is the law of God , as revealed in her make .
What becomes of this high privilege ?
Does she live in free enjoyment of it ?
No .
Nowhere in the whole world .
She is robbed of it everywhere .
Who does this ?
Man.
Man 's statutes -- if the Bible is the Word of God .
Now there you have a sample of man's " reasoning powers , " as he calls them .
He observes certain facts .
For instance , that in all his life he never sees the day that he can satisfy one woman ; also , that no woman ever sees the day that she can't overwork , and defeat , and put out of commission any ten masculine plants that can be put to bed to her . [**]
He puts those strikingly suggestive and luminous facts together , and from them draws this astonishing conclusion :
The Creator intended the woman to be restricted to one man .
So he concretes that singular conclusion into law , for good and all .
And he does it without consulting the woman , although she has a thousand times more at stake in the matter than he has .
His procreative competency is limited to an average of a hundred exercises per year for fifty years , hers is good for three thousand a year for that whole time -- and as many years longer as she may live .
Thus his life interest in the matter is five thousand refreshments , while hers is a hundred and fifty thousand ; yet instead of fairly and honorably leaving the making of the law to the person who has an overwhelming interest at stake in it , this immeasurable hog , who has nothing at stake in it worth considering , makes it himself !
You have heretofore found out , by my teachings , that man is a fool ; you are now aware that woman is a damned fool .
Now if you or any other really intelligent person were arranging the fairness and justices between man and woman , you would give the man one - fiftieth interest in one woman , and the woman a harem .
Now would n't you ?
Necessarily .
I give you my word , this creature with the decrepit candle has arranged it exactly the other way .
Solomon , who was one of the Deity 's favorites , had a copulation cabinet composed of seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines .
To save his life he could not have kept two of these young creatures satisfactorily refreshed , even if he had had fifteen experts to help him .
Necessarily almost the entire thousand had to go hungry years and years on a stretch .
Conceive of a man hardhearted enough to look daily upon all that suffering and not be moved to mitigate it .
He even wantonly added a sharp pang to that pathetic misery ; for he kept within those women 's sight , always , stalwart watchmen whose splendid masculine forms made the poor lassies ' mouths water but who had n't anything to solace a candlestick with , these gentry being eunuchs .
A eunuch is a person whose candle has been put out .
By art .[**]
From time to time , as I go along , I will take up a Biblical statute and show you that it always violates a law of God , and then is imported into the lawbooks of the nations , where it continues its violations .
But those things will keep ; there is no hurry .
Letter IX
The Ark continued its voyage , drifting around here and there and yonder , compassless and uncontrolled , the sport of the random winds and swirling currents .
And the rain , the rain , the rain !
It kept falling , pouring , drenching , flooding .
No such rain had ever been seen before .
Sixteen inches a day had been heard of , but that was nothing to this .
This was a hundred and twenty inches a day -- ten feet !
At this incredible rate it rained forty days and forty nights , and submerged every hill that was four hundred feet high .
Then the heavens and even the angels went dry ; no more water was to be had .
As a Universal flood it was a disappointment , but there had been heaps of Universal Floods before , as is witnessed by all the Bibles of all the nations , and this was as good as the best one .
At last the Ark soared aloft and came to rest on top of Mount Ararat , seventeen thousand feet above the valley , and its living freight got out and went down the mountain .
Noah planted a vineyard , and drank the wine and was overcome .
This person had been selected from all the populations because he was the best sample there was .
He was to start the human race on a new basis .
This was the new basis .
The promise was bad .
To go further with the experiment was to run a great and most unwise risk .
Now was the time to do with these people what had been so judiciously done with the others -- drown them .
Anybody but the Creator would have seen this .
But he did n't see it .
That is , maybe he did n't .
It is claimed that from the beginning of time he foresaw everything that would happen in the world .
If that is true , he foresaw that Adam and Eve would eat the apple ; that their posterity would be unendurable and have to be drowned ; that Noah 's posterity would in their turn be unendurable , and that by and by he would have to leave his throne in heaven and come down and be crucified to save that same tiresome human race again .
The whole of it ?
No !
A part of it ?
Yes .
Now much of it ?
In each generation , for hundreds and hundreds of generations , a billion would die and all go to perdition except perhaps ten thousand out of the billion .
The ten thousand would have to come from the little body of Christians , and only one in the hundred of that little body would stand any chance .
None of them at all except such Roman Catholics as should have the luck to have a priest handy to sandpaper their souls at the last gasp , and here and there a presbyterian .
No others savable .
All the others damned .
By the million .
Shall you grant that he foresaw all this ?
The pulpit grants it .
It is the same as granting that in the matter of intellect the Deity is the Head Pauper of the Universe , and that in the matter of morals and character he is away down on the level of David .
Letter X
The two Testaments are interesting , each in its own way .
The Old one gives us a picture of these people 's Deity as he was before he got religion , the other one gives us a picture of him as he appeared afterward .
The Old Testament is interested mainly in blood and sensuality .
The New one in Salvation .
Salvation by fire .
The first time the Deity came down to earth , he brought life and death ; when he came the second time , he brought hell .
Life was not a valuable gift , but death was .
Life was a fever - dream made up of joys embittered by sorrows , pleasure poisoned by pain , a dream that was a nightmare - confusion of spasmodic and fleeting delights , ecstasies , exultations , happinesses , interspersed with long - drawn miseries , griefs , perils , horrors , disappointments , defeats , humiliations , and despairs -- the heaviest curse devisable by divine ingenuity ; but death was sweet , death was gentle , death was kind ; death healed the bruised spirit and the broken heart , and gave them rest and forgetfulness ; death was man 's best friend ; when man could endure life no longer , death came and set him free .
In time , the Deity perceived that death was a mistake ; a mistake , in that it was insufficient ; insufficient , for the reason that while it was an admirable agent for the inflicting of misery upon the survivor , it allowed the dead person himself to escape from all further persecution in the blessed refuge of the grave .
This was not satisfactory .
A way must be conceived to pursue the dead beyond the tomb .
The Deity pondered this matter during four thousand years unsuccessfully , but as soon as he came down to earth and became a Christian his mind cleared and he knew what to do .
He invented hell , and proclaimed it .
Now here is a curious thing .
It is believed by everybody that while he was in heaven he was stern , hard , resentful , jealous , and cruel ; but that when he came down to earth and assumed the name Jesus Christ , he became the opposite of what he was before : that is to say , he became sweet , and gentle , merciful , forgiving , and all harshness disappeared from his nature and a deep and yearning love for his poor human children took its place .
Whereas it was as Jesus Christ that he devised hell and proclaimed it !
Which is to say , that as the meek and gentle Savior he was a thousand billion times crueler than ever he was in the Old Testament -- oh , incomparably more atrocious than ever he was when he was at the very worst in those old days !
Meek and gentle ?
By and by we will examine this popular sarcasm by the light of the hell which he invented .
While it is true that the palm for malignity must be granted to Jesus , the inventor of hell , he was hard and ungentle enough for all godlike purposes even before he became a Christian .
It does not appear that he ever stopped to reflect that he was to blame when a man went wrong , inasmuch as the man was merely acting in accordance with the disposition he had afflicted him with .
No , he punished the man , instead of punishing himself .
Moreover , the punishment usually oversized the offense .
Often , too , it fell , not upon the doer of a misdeed , but upon somebody else -- a chief man , the head of a community , for instance .
And Israel abode in Shittim , and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab .
And the Lord said unto Moses , Take all the heads of the people , and hang them up before the Lord against the Sun , that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel .
Does that look fair to you ?
It does not appear that the " heads of the people " got any of the adultery , yet it is they that are hanged , instead of " the people . "
If it was fair and right in that day it would be fair and right today , for the pulpit maintains that God 's justice is eternal and unchangeable ; also that he is the Fountain of Morals , and that his morals are eternal and unchangeable .
Very well , then , we must believe that if the people of New York should begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of New Jersey , it would be fair and right to set up a gallows in front of the city hall and hang the mayor and the sheriff and the judges and the archbishop on it , although they did not get any of it .
It does not look right to me .
Moreover , you may be quite sure of one thing : it could n't happen .
These people would not allow it .
They are better than their Bible .
Nothing would happen here , except some lawsuits , for damages , if the incident could n't be hushed up ; and even down South they would not proceed against persons who did not get any of it ; they would get a rope and hunt for the correspondents , and if they could n't find them they would lynch a nigger .
Things have greatly improved since the Almighty 's time , let the pulpit say what it may .
Will you examine the Deity 's morals and disposition and conduct a little further ?
And will you remember that in the Sunday school the little children are urged to love the Almighty , and honor him , and praise him , and make him their model and try to be as like him as they can ?
Read :
1 And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
2 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites : afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people ....
7 And they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
8 And they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles , with fire .
11 And they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of men and of beasts .
12 And they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
13 And Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the congregation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
15 And Moses said unto them , Have ye saved all the women alive ?
16 Behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord .
17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
18 But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
20 And purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle , This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses ....
25 And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
26 Take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the congregation :
27 And divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the congregation :
28 And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle ....
31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses .
32 And the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves ,
34 And threescore and one thousand asses ,
35 And thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him ....
40 And the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the Lord 's tribute was thirty and two persons .
41 And Moses gave the tribute , which was the Lord 's heave offering , unto Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses ....
47 Even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it ....
13 And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
14 But the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the Lord thy God hath given thee .
15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
16 But of the cities of these people , which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
The Biblical law says : " Thou shalt not kill . "
The law of God , planted in the heart of man at his birth , says : " Thou shalt kill . "
The chapter I have quoted shows you that the book - statute is once more a failure .
It can not set aside the more powerful law of nature .
According to the belief of these people , it was God himself who said : " Thou shalt not kill . "
Then it is plain that he cannot keep his own commandments .
He killed all those people -- every male .
They had offended the Deity in some way .
We know what the offense was , without looking ; that is to say , we know it was a trifle ; some small thing that no one but a god would attach any importance to .
It is more than likely that a Midianite had been duplicating the conduct of one Onan , who was commanded to " go into his brother 's wife " -- which he did ; but instead of finishing , " he spilled it on the ground . "
The Lord slew Onan for that , for the lord could never abide indelicacy .
The Lord slew Onan , and to this day the Christian world cannot understand why he stopped with Onan , instead of slaying all the inhabitants for three hundred miles around -- they being innocent of offense , and therefore the very ones he would usually slay .
For that had always been his idea of fair dealing .
If he had had a motto , it would have read , " Let no innocent person escape . "
You remember what he did in the time of the flood .
There were multitudes and multitudes of tiny little children , and he knew they had never done him any harm ; but their relations had , and that was enough for him : he saw the waters rise toward their screaming lips , he saw the wild terror in their eyes , he saw that agony of appeal in the mothers ' faces which would have touched any heart but his , but he was after the guiltless particularly , than he drowned those poor little chaps .
And you will remember that in the case of Adam 's posterity all the billions are innocent -- none of them had a share in his offense , but the Deity holds them guilty to this day .
None gets off , except by acknowledging that guilt -- no cheaper lie will answer .
Some Midianite must have repeated Onan 's act , and brought that dire disaster upon his nation .
If that was not the indelicacy that outraged the feelings of the Deity , then I know what it was : some Midianite had been pissing against the wall .
I am sure of it , for that was an impropriety which the Source of all Etiquette never could stand .
A person could piss against a tree , he could piss on his mother , he could piss on his own breeches , and get off , but he must not piss against the wall -- that would be going quite too far .
The origin of the divine prejudice against this humble crime is not stated ; but we know that the prejudice was very strong -- so strong that nothing but a wholesale massacre of the people inhabiting the region where the wall was defiled could satisfy the Deity .
Take the case of Jeroboam .
" I will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall . "
It was done .
And not only was the man that did it cut off , but everybody else .
The same with the house of Baasha : everybody was exterminated , kinsfolks , friends , and all , leaving " not one that pisseth against a wall . "
In the case of Jeroboam you have a striking instance of the Deity 's custom of not limiting his punishments to the guilty ; the innocent are included .
Even the " remnant " of that unhappy house was removed , even " as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone . "
That includes the women , the young maids , and the little girls .
All innocent , for they could n't piss against a wall .
Nobody of that sex can .
None but members of the other sex can achieve that feat .
A curious prejudice .
And it still exists .
Protestant parents still keep the Bible handy in the house , so that the children can study it , and one of the first things the little boys and girls learn is to be righteous and holy and not piss against the wall .
They study those passages more than they study any others , except those which incite to masturbation .
Those they hunt out and study in private .
No Protestant child exists who does not masturbate .
That art is the earliest accomplishment his religion confers upon him .
Also the earliest her religion confers upon her .
The Bible has this advantage over all other books that teach refinement and good manners : that it goes to the child .
It goes to the mind at its most impressible and receptive age -- the others have to wait .
" Thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee . "
That rule was made in the old days because " The Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp . "
It is probably not worthwhile to try to find out , for certain , why the Midianites were exterminated .
We can only be sure that it was for no large offense ; for the cases of Adam , and the Flood , and the defilers of the wall teach us that much .
A Midianite may have left his paddle at home and thus brought on the trouble .
However , it is no matter .
The main thing is the trouble itself , and the morals of one kind and another that it offers for the instruction and elevation of the Christian of today .
God wrote upon the tables of stone : " Thou shalt not kill , " Also : " Thou shalt not commit adultery . "
Paul , speaking by the divine voice , advised against sexual intercourse altogether .
A great change from the divine view as it existed at the time of the Midianite incident .
Letter XI
Human history in all ages is red with blood , and bitter with hate , and stained with cruelties ; but not since Biblical times have these features been without a limit of some kind .
Even the Church , which is credited with having spilt more innocent blood , since the beginning of its supremacy , than all the political wars put together have spilt , has observed a limit .
A sort of limit .
But you notice that when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth , adored Father of Man , goes to war , there is no limit .
He is totally without mercy -- he , who is called the Fountain of Mercy .
He slays , slays , slays !
All the men , all the beasts , all the boys , all the babies ; also all the women and all the girls , except those that have not been deflowered .
He makes no distinction between innocent and guilty .
The babies were innocent , the beasts were innocent , many of the men , many of the women , many of the boys , many of the girls were innocent , yet they had to suffer with the guilty .
What the insane Father required was blood and misery ; he was indifferent as to who furnished it .
The heaviest punishment of all was meted out to persons who could not by any possibility have deserved so horrible a fate -- the 32,000 virgins .
Their naked privacies were probed , to make sure that they still possessed the hymen unruptured ; after this humiliation they were sent away from the land that had been their home , to be sold into slavery ; the worst of slaveries and the shamefulest , the slavery of prostitution ; bed - slavery , to excite lust , and satisfy it with their bodies ; slavery to any buyer , be he gentleman or be he a coarse and filthy ruffian .
It was the Father that inflicted this ferocious and undeserved punishment upon those bereaved and friendless virgins , whose parents and kindred he had slaughtered before their eyes .
And were they praying to him for pity and rescue , meantime ?
Without a doubt of it .
These virgins were " spoil " plunder , booty .
He claimed his share and got it .
What use had he for virgins ?
Examine his later history and you will know .
His priests got a share of the virgins , too .
What use could priests make of virgins ?
The private history of the Roman Catholic confessional can answer that question for you .
The confessional 's chief amusement has been seduction -- in all the ages of the Church .
Père Hyacinth testifies that of a hundred priests confessed by him , ninety - nine had used the confessional effectively for the seduction of married women and young girls .
One priest confessed that of nine hundred girls and women whom he had served as father and confessor in his time , none had escaped his lecherous embrace but he elderly and the homely .
The official list of questions which the priest is required to ask will overmasteringly excite any woman who is not a paralytic .
There is nothing in either savage or civilized history that is more utterly complete , more remorselessly sweeping than the Father of Mercy 's campaign among the Midianites .
The official report does not furnish the incidents , episodes , and minor details , it deals only in information in masses : all the virgins , all the men , all the babies , all " creatures that breathe , " all houses , all cities ; it gives you just one vast picture , spread abroad here and there and yonder , as far as eye can reach , of charred ruin and storm - swept desolation ; your imagination adds a brooding stillness , an awful hush -- the hush of death .
But of course there were incidents .
Where shall we get them ?
Out of history of yesterday 's date .
Out of history made by the red Indian of America .
He has duplicated God 's work , and done it in the very spirit of God .
In 1862 the Indians in Minnesota , having been deeply wronged and treacherously treated by the government of the United States , rose against the white settlers and massacred them ; massacred all they could lay their hands upon , sparing neither age nor sex .
Consider this incident :
Twelve Indians broke into a farmhouse at daybreak and captured the family .
It consisted of the farmer and his wife and four daughters , the youngest aged fourteen and the eldest eighte

Al - Qaeda 's violent methods and tactics have been coming under mounting criticism this year from Islamist scholars who once supported it .
Osama bin Laden 's defiant message has inspired many Muslims
One by one they have been coming out in public to denounce the organisation 's actions as being counterproductive .
But at the same time , a leading British de-radicaliser says the number of young British Muslims attracted to violent extremism is growing - and , he claims , the UK government is partly to blame .
In the living room of his London home , the Libyan former jihadist Nu'man Bin Othman reads out part of the open letter he sent recently to al - Qaeda 's no 2 and chief strategist , Dr Ayman al - Zawahiri .
He tells him that al - Qaeda 's tactics have been a failure and - most damningly - its methods un -Islamic .
He even questions its very claim to speak for Muslims .
Comrades in arms
What is so striking about this is that Bin Othman is no armchair commentator , he is a former comrade - in - arms of Osama Bin Laden .
Together they fought the communists in Afghanistan in the 1990s and as recently as the summer of 2000 he attended the al - Qaeda leader 's ' summit ' of jihadists in Afghanistan .
Yet now , while like many Muslims he still deeply disapproves of western policies and actions in the Middle East , Bin Othman is telling his former allies that al - Qaeda 's strategy of apparent indiscriminate killing is wrong .
" I said to him , we want to give you what you need , not what you want .
You need to re-examine your ideology and you need someone to advise you .
Why should I believe I have a duty to support al - Qaeda ?
How , Islamically , did they establish their authority ? "
Oh , you young people , do not be deceived by the heroes of the internet , the leaders of the microphones ...
Sayyid Imam
Egyptian ideologue
His denunciation of al - Qaeda follows another highly significant repudiation by the jailed Egyptian ideologue , Sayyid Imam .
Also known as ' Dr Fadl ' , he is seen as the godfather of jihadi thought , the man whose edicts al - Qaeda 's leadership have drawn on for years .
But last November he published a devastating treatise that drew on Islamic law and jurisprudence to plead with would - be jihadis that resorting to violence is forbidden , and so was rebelling against a Muslim ruler .
It said : " Oh , you young people , do not be deceived by the heroes of the internet , the leaders of the microphones , who are launching statements inciting the youth while living under the protection of intelligence services , or of a tribe , or in a distant cave or under political asylum in an infidel country .
" They have thrown many others before you into the infernos , graves , and prisons .
Those who have triggered clashes and pressed their brothers into unequal military confrontations - are specialists neither in fatwas nor in military affairs . "
Impressionable youth
So , are words like these having any effect on impressionable young men who are vulnerable to being influenced by al - Qaeda 's recruiters ?
To find out , we visited the Active Change Foundation in East London .
It 's a movement set up to try to steer young men away from violent jihad .
It was set up by Hanif Qadir , himself a former jihadi who turned back six years ago on the brink of going to fight alongside the Taleban in Afghanistan .
I asked him if all this ideological debate on jihadism is making any real difference at street level .
Many still want to take part in violent jihad , says Hanif Qadir
He replied that while some ' veteran ' jihadists were coming back from theatres of conflict like Afghanistan and Chechnya bitter and disillusioned , the number of people queuing up for violent jihad was growing .
He blames western foreign policy for playing into the hands of jihadi recruiters and says the UK government should do more to listen to Muslim grievances .
" I think there 's a lack of communication and I think that until we get this individual involvement from politicians and ministers and other people to come down and in this safe space have a critical dialogue , we 're going to get young people who are going to try to vent their frustration elsewhere , " he said .
Potential recruits
It is almost as if there are two separate tectonic plates , grinding against each other in opposite directions .
At one level there is the intellectual debate , the Arab thinkers within the jihadi movement .
These are the people who are standing back and questioning whether al - Qaeda 's extreme methods are n't actually doing more harm than good to Muslims .
But then down at the grass roots level , things are moving the other way , because there are still growing numbers of potential recruits to violent jihad , including in Britain .
Often these recruits have only a shallow knowledge of Islam , and they are far less impressed by theological debate than they are by more day - to - day , down - to - earth factors like TV reports of western airstrikes on civilians in Afghanistan or the presence of US and British troops in Iraq .
With conflicts still raging in those two countries , and the Palestinian question unsettled , it is still too early to predict with any certainty which way al - Qaeda 's fortunes will go .
Frank Gardner reports on the future of Al - Qaeda in Analysis on BBC Radio 4 at 20.30 Thursday 7th August and 21.30 Sunday 10th of August .

If you believe that , I 've got a bridge in Alaska to sell you
Obama tries out a few new lines in Colorado , Carrie Budoff Brown reports :
" But now suddenly , John McCain says he is about change , too .
He even started using some of my lines .
Suddenly he says he wants ' to turn the page . '
He had an ad today that he started running that he and Gov. Palin would bring the change that we need .
He had this in an advertisement .
Sound familiar ?
Let me tell you something , instead of borrowing my lines he needs to borrow our ideas , " Obama said .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- India launched its first lunar mission on Wednesday , with hopes of achieving high - resolution images of the moon 's topography and diving into the international space race .
The spacecraft carrying India 's first lunar probe , Chandrayaan - 1 , lifts off in Sriharikota on Wednesday .
The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan - 1 , or " moon craft " in ancient Sanskrit , came at 6:20 a.m. Wednesday ( 8:50 p.m. ET ) from the Sriharikota space center in southern India .
The two - year mission seeks high - resolution imaging of the moon 's surface , especially the permanently shadowed polar regions , according to the Indian Space Research Organization .
It will also search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical breakdown of certain lunar rocks , the group said .
Despite the numerous missions to the moon over the past 50 years , " we really do n't have a good map of the moon , " said Miles O'Brien , CNN chief technology and environment correspondent .
" The goal is to come up with a very intricate , three - dimensional map of the moon . "
The Chandrayaan - 1 is carrying payloads from the United States , European Union countries Germany , Britain , Sweden and Bulgaria , and India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs , including NASA .
Watch the launch of India 's first lunar mission »
ISRO said on its
Web site that the mission would lay the groundwork for future lunar missions and " probe the physical characteristics of the lunar surface in greater depth than previous missions by other nations . "
" It will also give us a deeper understanding about the planet Earth itself or its origins , " a statement on the Web site said .
" Earlier missions did not come out with a full understanding of the moon and that is the reason scientists are still interested .
This will lay the foundation for bigger missions and also open up new possibilities of international networking and support for planetary programs . "

The new space race
Until now , India 's space launches have been more practical , with weather warning satellites and communiations systems , The Associated Press cited former NASA associated administrator Scott Pace as saying .
To date , only the U.S. Russia , the European Space Agency , Japan and China have sent missions to the moon , according to AP .
Critics of the mission have questioned its $ 80 million price tag , saying the money should have been spent by the government to improve education and fight poverty .
But , " there are scientists that would argue that there are plenty of things we do n't know about the moon ... and India might have the know - how " to find answers , said CNN 's Sara Sidner in New Delhi .
The United States and the Soviet Union dominated the field of lunar exploration from the late 1950s .
The United States is preparing for its own mission slated for next spring -- the first U.S. lunar mission in more than a decade , according to NASA .
Soviet spacecraft were the first to fly by , land on and orbit the moon .
Luna 1 , launched on January 2 , 1959 , and sped by the moon two days later .
Luna 2 was launched on an impact mission on September 12 , 1959 , striking the surface two days later .
Luna 9 launched on January 31 , 1966 , becoming the first craft to successfully land on the moon and send back data , touching down on the surface on January 31 , 1966 , and transmitting until February 3 , 1967 , when its batteries ran out .
Luna 10 was launched March 31 , 1966 , entered lunar orbit on April 3 , and operated for 56 days .
But the United States ' Apollo missions were the first manned missions to reach the moon , culminating with six missions that set down on the surface .
The first , Apollo 11 , left earth on July 16 , 1969 , and landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin on the lunar surface on July 20 while command module pilot Michael Collins orbited above .
The astronauts returned safely to earth on July 24 .
Most recently India 's fellow Asian nations , China and Japan , put lunar orbiters in place .
Japan launched the Kaguya orbiter in October 2007 , followed by China 's launch of the Chang 'e mission a few weeks later .

McCain protests NBC coverage
Sen . John McCain's ( R - Ariz . ) campaign manager Rick Davis asked Sunday for a meeting with Steve Capus , the president of NBC News , to protest what the campaign called signs that the network is " abandoning non-partisan coverage of the presidential race . "
Davis made the request Sunday in a letter that is part of an aggressive effort by McCain to counter news coverage he considers critical .

In this case , the campaign is objecting to a statement by NBC's Andrea Mitchell on " Meet the Press " questioning whether McCain might have gotten a heads - up on some of the questions that were asked of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , who was the first candidate to be interviewed Saturday night by Pastor Rick Warren at a presidential forum on faith .
Warren told the audience that McCain was being held in " a cone of silence " so he would n't hear the questions , which were similar for both candidates .
Warren referred again to " the cone of silence " when McCain came onstage , and the senator joked : " I was trying to hear through the wall . "
Mitchell reported that some " Obama people " were suggesting " that McCain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to Obama .
He seemed so well prepared . "
A McCain aide said that is not the case : " Senator McCain was in a motorcade led by the United States Secret Service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed . "
Mitchell made the comment in the context of saying McCain did better , and that the Obama camp was defensive .
In response to the campaign 's letter , she pointed out that journalists get criticism from both sides .
" I was n't expressing an opinion , " Mitchell said .
" I was reporting what they were saying . "
Here is the text of the letter :
August 17 , 2008
Mr. Steve Capus
President , NBC News
30 Rockefeller Plaza
New York , NY 10112
Steve :
We are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at NBC News has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated , partisan claims in order to undercut John McCain .
Nowhere was this more evident than with NBC chief correspondent Andrea Mitchell 's comments on " Meet the Press " this morning .
In analyzing last night 's presidential forum at Saddleback Church , Mitchell expressed the Obama campaign spin that John McCain could only have done so well last night because he " may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to Obama . "
Here are Andrea Mitchell 's comments in full :
Mitchell : " The Obama people must feel that he did n't do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context , because what they are putting out privately is that McCain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to Obama .
He seemed so well - prepared . "
( NBC 's " Meet The Press , " 8/17/08 )
Make no mistake :
This is a serious charge .
Andrea Mitchell is repeating , uncritically , a completely unsubstantiated Obama campaign claim that John McCain somehow cheated in last night 's forum at Saddleback Church .
Instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way , Andrea Mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions of " Meet the Press " viewers with no indication that 1 . )
There 's not one shred of evidence that it 's true ; 2 . ) In his official correspondence to both campaigns , Pastor Rick Warren provided both candidates with information regarding the topic areas to be covered , which Barack Obama acknowledged during the forum when asked about Pastor Warren 's idea of an emergency plan for orphans and Obama said , " I cheated a little bit .
I actually looked at this idea ahead of time , and I think it is a great idea ; " 3 . )
John McCain actually requested that he and Barack Obama do the forum together on stage at the same time , making these kinds of after - the - fact complaints moot .
Indeed , instead of taking a critical journalistic approach to this spin , Andrea Mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating Obama campaign talking points .
This is irresponsible journalism and sadly , indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at NBC News this election cycle .
Instead of examining the Obama campaign 's spin for truth before reporting it to more than 3 million NBC News viewers , Andrea Mitchell simply passed along Obama campaign conspiracy theories .
The fact is that during Senator Obama 's segment at Saddleback last night , Senator McCain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed .
In the forum , John McCain clearly demonstrated to the American people that he is prepared to be our next President .....
We are concerned that your News Division is following MSNBC 's lead in abandoning non-partisan coverage of the Presidential race .
We would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at NBC .
Sincerely ,
Rick Davis
Campaign Manager

This Is Luck
Look at the top picture and you can see where this guy broke through
the crash barrier ( right side where the people are standing on the road ) .
His truck left the road , traveling from right to left .
He flipped
end - over - end , across the culvert outlet and landed on the left side of it .
Now look at the picture below .
The origin of the microscopic meteorites that make up cosmic dust has been revealed for the first time in new research out September 1 , 2008 .
The research shows that some of the cosmic dust falling to Earth comes from an ancient asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars .
This research improves our knowledge of the solar system , and could provide a new and inexpensive method for understanding space .
Cosmic dust particles , originally from asteroids and comets , are minute pieces of pulverised rock .
They measure up to a tenth of a millimetre in size and shroud the solar system in a thin cloud .
Studying them is important because their mineral content records the conditions under which asteroids and comets were formed over four and a half billion years ago and provides an insight into the earliest history of our solar system .
The study ’s author , Dr Mathew Genge , from Imperial College London ’s Department of Earth Science and Engineering , has trekked across the globe collecting cosmic dust .
He says : “ There are hundreds of billions of extraterrestrial dust particles falling though our skies .
This abundant resource is important since these tiny pieces of rock allow us to study distant objects in our solar system without the multi-billion dollar price tag of expensive missions . ”
The origin of the cosmic dust that lands on Earth has always been unclear .
Scientists previously thought that analysing the chemical and mineral content of individual dust particles was the key to tracing their origin .
But this study suggests that a comparison of multiple particles gives better results .
To pinpoint the cosmic dust ’s origin , Dr Genge analysed more than 600 particles , painstakingly cataloguing their chemical and mineral content and reassembling them like a complex jigsaw .
Dr Genge comments :
“ I ’ve been studying these particles for quite a while and had all the pieces of the puzzle , but had been trying to figure out the particles one by one .
It was only when I took a step back and looked at the minerals and properties of hundreds of particles that it was obvious where they came from .
It was like turning over the envelope and finding the return address on the back . ”
Dr Genge found that the cosmic dust comes from a family of ancient space rocks called Koronis asteroids , which includes 243 Ida , widely photographed by the NASA Galileo probe .
The rocks are located in an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and were formed around two billion years ago when a much larger asteroid broke into pieces .
Further analysis shows that the dust originates from a smaller grouping of 20 space rocks within the Koronis family called Karin asteroids .
It comes from an ancient chondrite rock , common in Karin asteroids , which was formed in space at the birth of the solar system .
Chondrite meteorites often fall to Earth and Dr Genge was able to match the mineralogy and chemistry of the dust particles with chondrite meteorite samples previously collected .
He backed up the cosmic dust ’s origin with infrared astronomical satellite data which showed Karin asteroids grinding and smashing against one another to create cosmic dust .
Dr Genge says his research holds exciting possibilities for a deeper understanding of our early solar system .
He concedes that analysing space dust will never entirely replace space missions , but adds that we may not have to visit so many different places .
He concludes : “ This research is the first time we have successfully demonstrated a way to locate the home of these important little particles .
The answer to so many important questions , such as why we are here and are we alone in the universe , may well lie inside a cosmic dust particle .
Since they are everywhere , even inside our homes , we do n’t necessarily have to blast off the Earth to find those answers .
Perhaps they are already next to you , right here and right now . ”
There was a loud , sharp sound followed by flames and massive blast of wind that threw the young boy twenty yards through the air .
It felt as if he had fallen off the mountain .
When he pulled himself to his feet , dazed and battered , he discovered nine members of his family were dead and that his mother was badly wounded .
All were victims of a deadly artillery shell fired by the Pakistani military battling with Taliban fighters in the country 's mountainous border region .
As soon as they were able , the boy 's remaining family and the rest of his village fled .
That was two months ago .
Now 12 - year - old Ikram Ullah sits with thousands of others in a wretched , fly - ridden refugee camp close to the north - west city of Mardan , his face streaked with dirt and tears as he tells his story and wonders what will happen to him .
The food is poor , there are few proper facilities and there is nothing to do .
" Life here , " he says , crouching in the dust among rows of canvas tents , " is filled with sadness and grief . "

Ikram is not alone .
Aid agencies estimate up to 200,000 desperate people have been forced to leave their villages as a result of the fighting .
Scattered in camps across northern Pakistan , they offer a glimpse into a deadly conflict largely overlooked by the West but which has created chaos and misery for the region 's civilian population .
All the while , as the Pakistan Army bends to pressure from the US to do more to confront the Taliban militants building strongholds and extending their influence in the tribal areas , so the fall - out for the civilians gets worse .
Every day their lives are threatened both by the pounding jets that sweep into the valleys on bombing runs and by the clattering helicopter gunships that the Pakistan military is using to spearhead its assaults .
The people sitting in the dust are the so - called " collateral damage " of Pakistan 's own war on terror .
But the danger goes far beyond that .
The spread of the Taliban and the seemingly endless cycle of violence they have created threatens the very fabric of Pakistan , an unstable nuclear - armed state that at times appears on the very brink of unraveling .
Were that to happen the consequences both for the country and the region would be unthinkable .
The civilian administration elected earlier this year , pulled back and forth by the various pressures upon it and its stalted , stuttering approach to confronting the militants , at times looks ill - prepared to tackle this most pressing of problems .
Until now , the conflict - which can trace its roots to the 1970s and 1980s when the Pakistani military and US government funded and encouraged Islamic mujahideen fighters to wage guerilla war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan - has largely played out in remote tribal areas located along its north - western border .
For those in the West it has been a conflict easy enough to ignore , should they choose .
The tribal agencies have long been considered an area all but outside the control of the central government .
But that has started to change .
In recent months , militants have escalated their attacks on targets linked to either the Pakistani military and police or the West in what they say is a direct response to the government 's decision to bow to US pressure .
The most stunning of these was the truck - bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in September that more than 50 people dead , including half - a- dozen foreigners .
There have also been attacks on the country 's prime minister and the Anti-Terrorism Police 's headquarters , while in August the Taliban claimed responsibility after two suicide bombers killed around 70 people at a munitions plant at Wah , 20 miles from the capital .
A Taliban spokesman said afterwards : " Only innocent people die when the Pakistan army carries out airstrikes in Bajaur or Swat . "
At the same time , areas outside of the tribal regions have seen the increasing influence of the Taliban .
There was panic earlier this summer when it was claimed militants were threatening to lay siege to the strategically important city of Peshawar , capital of the North West Frontier Province .
( NWFP ) .
In the province 's Swat Valley , once a leading tourist attraction and considered the " Switzerland of Pakistan " , the army has also stepped operations against militants .
And last week shopkeepers in Lahore , long considered a bulwark against extremism , began publicly setting fire to DVDs of pornographic movies after receiving threats from militants .

The tribal areas are a world apart .
Officially known as Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) , they are squeezed in between Afghanistan and Pakistan 's NWFP in a strip that runs north to south - west and contain some of the most mountainous and inhospitable terrain in the region .
Large parts of these seven rugged agencies - North and South Waziristan , Kurram , Orakzai , Khyber , Mohmand and Bajaur - are also utterly lawless .
Peopled by Pashtun tribes famous both for their fierceness and code of traditional hospitality , the area has only ever nominally been in the control of the central government and has instead been governed by tribal leaders and their traditional jirgas , or community meetings .

The region 's virtual autonomy dates to the creation of Pakistan .
After the British left the subcontinent following Partition , the tribal areas technically became independent and it was up the tribal chiefs or maliks to agree whether or not to become part of Pakistan .
As part of the deal that was agreed , the tribal chiefs managed to ensure they would retain the large degree of autonomy they had enjoyed under the British empire .
Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 , it was through these tribal areas that dictator Zia ul - Haq - with funding from the US and Saudi Arabia - dispatched thousands of young fighters to join Afghan militias opposing the Red Army .
Training camps were set up by the ISI intelligence agency along the border to prepare these fighters for battle .
Praised by Ronald Reagan as " freedom fighters " , these mujahideen , or holy warriors , were a crucial factor in the Soviet 's decision a decade later to withdraw .
In 1994 , following years of civil war in Afghanistan , the government of Benazir Bhutto , provided financial and military backing to a group of Afghan fighters based in the city of Kandahar and calling themselves " the students " or Taliban in their efforts to take control of the country .
Bhutto argued that stability in Afghanistan and a government of its own sponsorship would help Pakistan .
" I do n't know how much money they were ultimately given , " she later recalled .
" I know it was a lot .
It was just carte blanche . "
Two years later the Taliban seized Kabul and set in place an increasingly authoritarian rule that only ended when the US invaded following the 2001 al - Qa'ida attacks on New York and Washington .
When the Taliban and al - Qai'da fighters they had given refuge to were forced from Afghanistan , it was into the tribal areas of Pakistan that many fled .
Bin Laden himself managed to slip away in late 2001 through the White Mountains after apparently having been surrounded by Afghan militia at Tora Bora .
Eversince , he and his deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri have been linked to both the South Waziristan and Bajaur areas .
In these tribal areas , among fellow Pashtuns , the Taliban received warm welcome .
As they were able to regroup and rebuild and to again take up battle against US and Nato forces inside Afghanistan .
At the same time , their influence spread and increasing number of Pakistan Taliban were recruited to an anti-American jihad .
A number of Pakistan Taliban leaders are now firmly established in the tribal areas .
It is these fighters that have been the focus of on - and - off operations by the military since Pakistan signed up to George Bush 's war on terror .
Both Pervez Musharraf and the recently elected civilian government have backed both negotiated settlements and military force to try and deal with the militants .
But in August , after constant pressure from Washington to do more to stop the flood of militants crossing into Afghanistan and attacking US and Nato troops , the Pakistan military launched a major operation in the Bajaur agency - home of the 12 - year - old Ikram and his family .
The effect has been devastating .
" When the fighter jets came into our valley four people were killed , " says Abdul Rauf , a creased - faced 50 - year - old refugee from a Bajaur village called Tauheedabada .
" All the people were crying , we were frightened .
After that we started to run away . "
There are thousands of people like Rauf , thousands who have suffered tragedies like endured by Ikram .
Aid agencies say a little under 200,000 people have been forced from their homes , but that is partly guesswork .
" Since mid-August , we 've seen an exodus of about 190,000 people from areas bordering Afghanistan .
This includes Bajaur and Swat , " said Vivian Tan of UNHCR .
" The government tells us over 168,000 people are internally displaced in NWFP , while the Afghan authorities in Kunar province have reported about 20,000 people arriving since mid-August .
We have no access to most of these border areas , so we 're relying completely on government figures . "

Pakistan 's army is headquartered in the neat and well - tended cantonment district of Rawalpindi , the garrison city located near Islamabad .
It from here that the fight against the militants is overseen and officers bristle at the suggestion that the military 's efforts to root out the militants is only half - hearted .
On the wall of Lt Col Haider Baseer 's office , beneath of photograph of Pakistan 's founder , Mohammad ali -Jinnah , is pinned a photocopied map showing the location of some of the ongoing operations .
A total of 120,000 troops are currently deployed .
" We are operating in Swat , in Bajaur , in
Darra Adam Khel and North and South Waziristan , " says the colonel , a military spokesman , whose office is located in a quadrangle containing sweet - smelling roses .
The colonel admits the military has been surprised by the resistance offered by the Taliban .
A total of 1,400 soldiers and paramilitaries ( from the Frontier Corps or FC ) have been lost in operations since 2001 .
He says the Taliban is fighting a classic guerilla war and that both the terrain and the enemy is difficult .
" Everybody has a gun , " he says .
" It 's their culture . "
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that this conflict pitches Muslim against Muslim and often - in the case of the FC - Pashtun against Pashtun .
There have been reports of desertion and surrender .
One military officer who has been based in Swat and Warisistan admitted this was , at least initially , a problem for many troops .
" At the beginning , before we were inducted into this war , it was troubling .
We asked ourselves , how are we going to fight against fellow Muslims ?
In the Pakistan army we were motivated to fight against India and if we die , we were told we become martyrs who go to heaven , " he says .
" Now I am convinced that I am fighting this war for my country and my religion .
When I arrived in the tribal areas , I saw how the militants , the terrorists were working against the country and the religion .
Now we see all the criminal elements getting into their fold .
They do not represent Islam in any way . "
What has certainly complicated matters in recent months is the involvement of US forces in the battle against militants .
For a long time , the US has been using unmanned drones flown out of Afghanistan to attack suspected militant hideouts .
Sometimes they claim to kill al - Qa'ida members , often they kill civilians .
In June , a US airstrike killed 11 members of the FC .
Such unathourised air strikes have steadily fuelled popular sentiment against the US .
But the situation was brought to boiling point in early September 3 when it was revealed US special forces had entered Pakistan and attacked the village of Jalal Khel in the Angoor Adda area of South Waziristan .
Up to 20 people were killed , including women and children .
The incident triggered angry protests from both villagers and Pakistan 's political and military leaders .
There were also a series of incidents of Pakistani and US troops exchanging fire along the border .
" Obviously this is difficult .
No -one wants to see foreign soldiers entering the country , " says Col Baseer .
" We have asked the US to stop the border incursions . "
Yet the most serious allegation concerning Pakistan 's seemingly lacklustre effort to confront the militants is that parts of the military establishment do not wish to .
In particular , the shadowy ISI intelligence agency ( whose director was recently changed ) has been accused of maintaining operational links with the Taliban , the organisation it helped create three decades ago .
Such allegations are nothing new ; in 2002 , for example , critics seized on a decision by Musharraf to arrest up to 2,000 militants in a purported crackdown only to release them all a few weeks later .
But this summer the CIA 's deputy director , Stephen Kappes , travelled to Islamabad and presented what is said was evidence that mid-level ISI officials were involved in a suicide bomb plot hatched by a veteran Taliban leader Jalaluddin Haqqani that targeted the Indian embassy in Kabul , killing 54 people .
Haqqani had previously been described by an ISI official as an " asset " .
Remarkably , members of Pakistan 's government agree with the US assessment that such links remain .
One recent afternoon in Islamabad , seated on the kind of overstuffed sofa so commonly found in South Asian sitting rooms , one minister said Pakistan had always considered Afghanistan its " fifth province " .
Such a view had created the problems the country was now facing .
" The Taliban was created by the Pakistanis and the CIA .
All the problems were created here .
Who do you think created these people ? " said the minister , who asked not to be identified .
" That is why they are not prepared to take them on .
They consider them their assets . "
Even military officers who reject such claims admit that the US and Pakistan have different priorities when it comes to confronting the militants .
This could explain why US military operations inside Pakistan using unmanned drones have largely targeted militants blamed for attacks inside Afghanistan , such as Jalaluddin Haqqani , his son , Serajuddin , and members of their network including brothers Daud Jan and Abdur Rehman .
This network has been blamed by Washington being largely responsible for a 40 per cent increase in attacks in eastern Afghanistan this year .
The Pakistan military , meanwhile , has focused its efforts on militants believed responsible for attacks inside Pakistan such as Baitullah Mehsud , who operates out of South Waziristan and who was blamed for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto last December , Maulana Fazlullah , the Taliban leader in the Swat Valley and Faqir Mohammed , a Taliban leader in Bajaur .
" The priorities are mismatching , " concedes the military 's chief spokesman , Maj Gen Athar Abbas .
" We can not risk opening up another front while we do n't have the resources . "
And while Maj Gen Abbas strenuously denies the charge of supporting the re-energised Taliban , he admits too , that indirect links are maintained .
" Which agency in the world would break its last contact with them ? "

One morning in mid-August , the day crisp and clean , up to 4,000 Pashtuns from the town of Salarzai in the Bajaur agency gathered to talk .
Some had come from up to 10 miles away to attend the meeting , arriving in pick - ups and trucks .
The younger men were dressed in Salwar Kameez and vests , while some of the older tribesman wore rough woollen clothes .
Many were wearing traditional Chitrali turbans , worn only for special occasions .
Almost everyone was armed with many carrying Kalashnikov rifles and rocket - launchers - " a gift from the Soviet jihad " .
The jirga had been called by tribal elders after Taliban militants attacked and killed two chiefs , or maliks , and a Muslim priest just days before .
One of the slain maliks was Shah Zarin Khan and it was his supporters who addressed the jirga first .
For centuries , the system of jirgas - which women are not permitted to attend - have been used by the Pashtun tribes to decide important issues and make rulings .
On this morning , the meeting had been called to discuss setting up a defence force or lashkar , to take on the Taliban , who had increasingly been vying for power with the tribal elders .
Syed Akhunzada Chattan , the local MP , was among those subsequently called to speak .
He told the people , sitting on stones that have for decades been used as seats :
" The sanctuary that we gave the Taliban was because we thought they were good people , because they had established peace in Afghanistan , because they fought against a superpower in the form of America .
Then the Taliban started hurting us .
These people are the enemy of Pakistan , they want a weak Pakistan .
We can not surrender our area to these people .
We have to throw them out . "
As Chattan spoke , the villagers raised their fists in a show of solidarity .
There and then it was decided to set up the defence force and to target the Taliban leaders .
An announcement went out that anyone with information about a Taliban fighter would receive a reward of 10,000 rupees .
On the other hand , anyone found harbouring such fighters would be fined 1 m rupees and their home burned down .
Within a week , claims Chattan , the Taliban had been driven from the area .
Against the backdrop of rising militant violence , the establishment of traditional lashkars has been promoted by the military and the government as a homegrown means of confronting the Taliban .
While some reports suggest the tribes are acting against the Taliban 's efforts to impose the strictest of moral codes , there appears to be more evidence that the tribes object mainly to the militants ' efforts to seize control in the areas and to criminal elements and " miscreants " who use the cloak of the Taliban to behave like mafia .
The military insists it provides the lashkars with " moral support " and encouragement but denies reports that it has supplied them with weapons or money .
But the emergence of the lashkars at a time when the military is also increasing its operations , suggests at the very least a degree of central planning .
* * *
Understandably the setting - up of the lashkars remains a perilous task .
The Taliban has persistently targeted tribal elders believed to be working against them .
Earlier this month in the Orakzai area , more than 30 such elders from the Alizai tribe were killed in a suicide bomb attack at a meeting in the village of Ghiljo .
As in the meeting in Bajaur , hundreds of people had gathered to discuss the establishment of an anti-Taliban force .
Indeed , a second meeting called by the tribal elders in Salarzai was also targeted by a suicide bomber sent by the Taliban .
" He was caught , stripped of his explosive vest and then shot dead , " said Chattan , the MP .
The combination of lashkars and the increasingly heavy military operations in places such as Bajaur and Swat , appears to he having some results .
Last week , Maulvi Omar , a spokesman for the coalition of around 40 Taliban groups operating in the tribal areas , announced that it was prepared for unconditional talks with the government if the military halted its current actions .
It also offered to help oust " foreign fighters " from the tribal areas .
" We are willing to negotiate with the government without any conditions , " he told the BBC 's Urdu service .
" We are also willing to lay down our arms , once the military ceases operations against us . "
The Pakistani government the offer .
Its decision indicated either that the army believes it has the upper hand over the militants or that there is ongoing pressure from Washington to continue its military strikes .
Either way , it was the first time the authorities had turned down such an offer of talks .

Inside out the bombed - out interior there is a frenzy activity .
Electricians , plasterers , metal workers and general labourers are furiously at work while all around them is the evidence of destruction .
There is rubble , there is twisted metal , there are bombed out windows , but there is also a determination to have the Marriott Hotel ready for a grand reopening party on New Years Eve .
On the evening of September 20 , a massive truck bomb was detonated at the gates of this Islamabad landmark , creating a huge crater and doing extensive damage to the building .
At least 54 people were killed , including 17 security guards on duty at the gates and doors of the building .
In the aftermath of the blast , a fire raged here for hours , sending up huge plumes of smoke and delivering the chillingly clear message that no - one was safe from militant violence .
While it is not entirely clear who was responsible for the blast - one Taliban spokesman denied responsibility and there are many in Pakistan who will gladly proffer the most Byzantine of conspiracy theories - most observers believe this was another militant strike on a highly visible target .
The hotel was centre stage in the working and social lives of the city 's political and diplomatic elite .
And while Pakistanis made up the overwhelming majority of the blast 's victims , it was also clearly interpreted as an attack on a Western target .
" There were 2,000 people inside the hotel at the time .
A lot of lives were saved , " says Maj Tahir Qureshi , the hotel 's head of security , leading a way past the flurry of labourers and clouds of cement dust .
" The only thing we could do was to stop them at the entry gates .
Those security guards gave their lives to stop it . "
There had been deadlier bomb attacks before the Marriott blast and there have been others subsequently , but it this attack that forced a wider audience to take notice of what was going on in Pakistan .
A conflict that had largely been confined to the tribal areas or else bomb attacks on military and police targets , was now taking place against a Five Star backdrop .
President Asif Ali Zardari , while in New York , described the event as Pakistan 's 9/11 .
In the aftermath , Zardari , whose wife , Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated last December , vowed to continue the effort against militants .
" Make this pain your strength , " he said .
" This is a menace , a cancer in Pakistan that we will eliminate .
We will not be scared of these cowards . "
The attack has also forced a wider debate about how best to confront the militant threat emanating from the tribal areas .
Whether militarily or else through negotiation - as the West is now attempting with the Taliban in Afghanistan - Pakistan 's recently - elected civilian leaders and its military have been forced to find a solution .
With so many people killed by the violence - one recent report suggested that in the first eight months of this year suicide bombings in Pakistan had killed more people than such attacks in Iraq or Afghanistan - there has also been endless soul - searching about the nature of the enemy .
Noticeably this has emerged from within Pakistani society - commentators , politicians as well as ordinary people .
Religious leaders have also spoken out against what is happening .
Two groups of clerics have issued fatwas or religious orders against what now totals for than 100 suicide bombings since July 2007 .
they have killed around 1,200 people .
Peshawar sits on the very edge of the tribal areas .
In the mid-80s Osama bin Laden had moved his family here from Saudi Arabia and developed his reputation as a patron of humanitarian and Arab causes and a supporter of the jihad .
Today , for all its modernity and amenities , there is still a hint of the city 's position as a frontier town .
The crenellated sandstone walls of a British - built fort now serve as the headquarters of the Frontier Corps .
Meanwhile it along the historic trade route leading from Peshawar through the Khyber Pass and on to Kabul , that 85 per cent of the fuel used by Western forces in Afghanistan is transported .
Last month the crossing point on this road into Afghanistan was temporarily closed by the Pakistani authorities because of what they said was poor security .
On a recent evening , the soft golden light of South Asia is slipping away as the faithful arrive to pray at the city 's Sunehri mosque .
In a large , airy upstairs classroom , the imam , Khan Mohammed Saeed , sits overseeing a group of young boys , hard at their study .
The imam is no liberal ; his view that Pakistan should be run according to Islamic law would alarm many both inside the country and abroad .
But asked about the militants located just miles from where he sat , he does not hesitate .
" There are people in the tribal areas and the NWFP who have come to do bomb blasts and destroy our religion , " he says .
" Our religion does not give us permission to do these things …
In none of our teachings or texts or what our learned scholars have taught , is there any permission to do these things . "
WHO'S FIGHTING WHO
Military / government
Asif Ali Zardari , the Pakistan president , widely known as " Mr 10 Per Cent " over numerous corruption cases .
He became leader of the main opposition party , the People 's Party of Pakistan , after his wife , Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated last year , and became president following elections .
Army chief of staff General Ashfaq Kayani says the army should remain out of politics but could yet change his mind .
Pakistani Taliban
The Taliban leaders in the wild and woolly tribal areas include former gym fanatic Baitullah Mehsud , wanted for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
Maulana Fazlullah , the leader in the picturesque Swat valley ( which was formerly a tourist destination ) has his own clandestine FM radio station .
Faqir Mohammed , in Bajaur , leads a religious group that forcibly imposed Sharia in the tribal areas during the 1990s .
Al - Qa'ida
Al - Qa'ida 's leader Osama bin Laden , and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , may be hiding in the border regions of Pakistan while senior Taliban leaders may be living in the Pakistani city of Quetta .
Tribal leader
Anwar Kamal , a former minister , was the first to rally his tribesmen and form a lashkar , or tribal militia , to beat back the Taliban more than a year ago .
Mr Kamal 's success in clearing the town of Lakki Marwat , adjoining the tribal areas , has recently been replicated elsewhere .

Matthews : " Did you see FOX television as a tool when you were in the White House ?
As a useful avenue to get your message out ? "
McClellan : " I make a distinction between the journalists and the commentators .
Certainly there were commentators and other , pundits at FOX News , that were useful to the White House . " [...]
That was something we at the White House , yes , were doing , getting them talking points and making sure they knew where we were coming from .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign has agreed to put former rival Sen. Hillary Clinton 's name in nomination at the Democratic National Convention this month .
Former rivals Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have called for unity at the Democratic convention .
The move is seen as a bid to heal the wounds of the bitter primary season .
Obama 's campaign encouraged Clinton to put her name in roll call " as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nation 's primary contests , " according to a statement from the Clinton and Obama press offices .
" They are both committed to winning back the White House and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in Denver , " the statement said .
Watch why Clinton will get a vote at DNC »
Both sides came to the mutual decision that the move was the best path , a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions said .
Clinton suspended her presidential campaign June 7 after a protracted primary battle with Obama .
She urged the 18 million people who voted for her to get behind Obama , but not all of her backers have followed suit .
A Democratic Party operative familiar with convention plans said the move would bring " peace in the kingdom . "
The source added the Obama campaign " always knew it would probably have to happen . "
" They have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this ' for history , ' " the operative said .
Clinton would not be the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for president at a major party convention .
U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was placed in nomination at the 1964 Republican convention , and U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York was placed in nomination at the 1972 Democratic convention .
The senator from New York is scheduled to speak at the convention on the second night -- August 26 .
It 's also the 88th anniversary of the day women were granted the right to vote .
Former Virginia Gov. and Senate candidate Mark Warner is delivering the keynote that night , and former President Clinton is set to speak the following night .
Both of the candidates have called for party unity , but Clinton also has made it clear that she wants the voices of her supporters heard .
Many die - hard Clinton fans have been hoping that her name would appear on the ballot .
At a gathering last month in California , Clinton suggested that doing so could provide a " catharsis " for her supporters .
" I happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected , " Clinton said .
Clinton said she wanted her supporters to leave the convention feeling their voices were heard and satisfied with Obama as the nominee .
" I mean everybody comes , and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity , and I think that 's all to the good , because then , you know , everybody can go , ' OK , great .
Now let 's go out and win . ' "
The former first lady immediately shot down the notion that she might try to upstage Obama .
" Since the delegate count is so close ... what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin ? " a questioner asked her at the event .
" That is not going to happen , not going to happen .
Look , what we want to have happen is for Sen.
Obama to be nominated by a unified convention of Democrats , " she said .
" The best way I think -- and I could be wrong -- but the best way I think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they 've had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of ... you know , there is a catharsis , " she said .
Because Clinton suspended her campaign instead of dropping out , she held on to the pledged delegates she earned in the primaries and caucuses .
The superdelegates -- a group of party officials and leaders -- can endorse any candidate at any time .
Since announcing the suspension of her campaign , Clinton has gone to great lengths to promote party unity .
She and Obama even made a joint appearance in Unity , New Hampshire , where both candidates received the same amount of votes in that state 's primary in January .
The Democratic National Committee has detailed rules on placing a candidate 's name in nomination .
In short :
A candidate must give written consent .
He or she must have a petition with signatures of delegates representing at least 300 delegate votes .
No more than 50 votes on the petition may come from any one state / delegation ( that means at least six states / delegations are required on the petition ) .
The names of the people giving the nomination speech and the seconding nomination speech also must be provided .
A total of 20 minutes is provided per candidate for the " presentation of his or her name " and for nominating and seconding speeches .
CNN 's John King , Jessica Yellin , Candy Crowley and Robert Yoon contributed to this report .
All About Hillary Clinton • Democratic Party • Barack Obama
Ike & Tina Turner Sing the Blues is slated to drop this month via Acrobat Records .
The album consolidates two early releases from the power couple 's catalogue into 18 hip - shaking tracks .
Even in the context of a blues record , Ike 's band provides some funky rhythms and Tina is an absolute dynamo .
In general , soul singers have amassed a pretty impeccable track record when it comes to covering the blues .
Part of it stems from the mixed roots of soul , blues , and gospel music that often make them indistinguishable .
The other less obvious factor is that when soul singers sing the blues , they 're almost always singing something else .
When Sam Cooke sings the blues , he 's really deconstructing big band jazz standards .
Take for example the songs on My Kind of Blues ( RCA 1961 ) .
The most recognizable songs are arguably " Trouble in Mind " and " Exactly Like You , " both of which have been covered numerous times by various artists including Aretha Franklin , Bob Dylan , and the smoky - voiced songstress Nina Simone .
Throughout the album , Cooke is his usual suave and confident self .
He commands the mic with a professionalism and elegance that is both reassuring to the band members and respectful of the listener .
The listening experience is similar to that of Live at the Copa but the band is much looser and Cooke is jitter - free .
The most impressive vocal performance on the record is without a doubt " Do n't Get Around Much Anymore , " an advanced version of the original Duke Ellington composition .
The piano keys lead the song in with a little jazzy fill to bring out the lounge room aesthetic .
Once the horns sound , you can almost picture Cooke twirling a bandstand - esque 180 just in time for his vocal cue .
Two minutes in , he takes absolute control of the number , adding his trademark repetitions for emphasis and guttural " AH "s for style .
Cooke is famous for making dramatic bridges sound routine , but on this track it 's simply unfair .
" Nobody Knows You When You 're Down and Out " is another mid tempo ballad perfectly suited for the singer .
He takes noticeable pleasure in mouthing lines like " I bought that bootleg liquor , champagne and wine , " or " I 'm gonna hold on till that eagle grins . "
Once you hear Sam Cooke sing those lyrics , it 's impossible to imagine anyone else doing it .
And what about Night Beat you say ?
Does n't that constitute as a blues album ?
Well , since I 'm strutting through this article on the gimmicky basis that " Blues " is found somewhere in the title of the album , I unfortunately am obligated to give Night Beat a back seat in this discussion .
But for the record , the 1963 release is arguably Cooke 's most critically acclaimed album — perhaps partially because it proved that he could shift seamlessly away from pop music just as he did gospel .
The album was recorded over the course of one weekend .
Its intimacy stems from plain - spoken meditations and simple piano arrangements that act as a tribute to the Texan blues - pianist Charles Brown , a man whose work in the late 1940s and 50s helped influence artists like Percy Mayfield and Ray Charles .
But despite the general contemplative tone of the album , Cooke manages to insert some more carefree , up - tempo numbers to balance out the emotional spectrum .
" Shake , Rattle And Roll " is an electrifying classic and an unexpected finale judging from the gorgeously somber tone of opener " Nobody Knows The Trouble I 've Seen . "
When Otis Redding sings the blues , he 's really singing soul .
Otis Blue : Otis Redding Sings Soul was a landmark album in the establishment of Soul and R&B in popular music .
It featured many of his greatest hits including , " Respect , " " I 've Been Loving You Too Long , " and " Satisfaction . "
It also saw three Sam Cooke covers to honor his hero who died the previous year .
Even while reinterpreting so many songs , Otis Blue stands out as an iconic masterpiece in the southern soul pantheon .
" Satisfaction " rumbles furiously as Redding famously employs his decided pronunciations .
Not to knock on the Temptations too hard , but " My Girl " now seems exhausted of all authenticity by the number of times it 's been covered by wedding bands and lounge groups .
Redding 's interpretation actually sounds more refreshing than the original .
Believe it or not , there is one authentic blues number on Otis Blue .
" Rock Me Baby " rolls along at the same pace as the B.B. King version .
The lyrics are classically structured — only a couple of phrases in repetition .
Steve Cropper provides the requisite scorching guitar solo .
While the song seems like a bizarre choice for the album , its sputtering horns help meld the song fluidly with the rest of the disc .
Otis ' version sounds naturally desperate and pleading because of his devastating vocals .
But when Tina Turner gives it a shot on Sing the Blues , the song 's message takes on a decidedly different tone .
So ultimately what 's the lesson of all this ?
Is it that soul singers are infinitely more adept at changing their stripes than other artists ?
Perhaps the most tangible thing to get from listening to these albums is that blues ' penetrative force comes from wearing its heart and message on its sleeve — an attribute it shares with soul and gospel .
The words are expressed intimately while echoing the common travails and joys in life .
Lessons are morals and breakups are the eternal muse .
Whether that message is meant to be shared with a girlfriend , every man , or God , is up to the artist .
Sometimes it reaches all three .
Adding to a lengthening string of vote suppression tactics , the GOP has now been accused of telling Democrats they can call in their vote for Barack Obama .
In the Florida Panhandle county of Okaloosa , Democratic Party headquarters received a report last week from a voter who claimed that she received a phone call advising her she could vote for Obama by telephone .
A volunteer who overheard the report relayed to OEN that the voter advised she was asked if she were Democrat and if she planned to vote for Obama .
Answering yes to both , she was told , " You can skip the lines and the inconvenience of voting at a polling place by dialing this telephone number ... "
After the voter dialed it , a pleasant voice said , " Thank you for your vote for Barack Obama . "
A second source from Okaloosa would only confirm that the matter had been forwarded to the legal department .
A phone call to the attorney for the Okaloosa County Democratic Party went unreturned .
OEN could not confirm the language of the alleged phone call .
Okaloosa has nearly 125,000 registered voters , one - fourth of whom are Democrats .
Tactics employed this year in Florida include :
* Jewish voters were targeted by phone calls claiming that Barack Obama donated funds to the Palestinian Liberation Organization .
* Democrats received a GOP fundraising letter indicating they were registered as Republican .
" The first - class GOP mailing has a ' Do not forward ' instruction on the envelope , meaning they will be returned to the GOP if a recipient has had mail forwarded , perhaps to a summer address , or has moved , " reported the St. Petersburg Times .
Letters returned as undeliverable can be compiled into ' challenge lists ' that will slow down voters on Election Day .
In 2000 , Florida taught the nation how Democrats could be removed from the voter rolls en masse on the grounds they were convicted felons .
Greg Palast exposed the Florida tactic while writing for the BBC , whereby nearly 100,000 voters – mostly black males who usually vote Democratic – were removed from rolls .
Most of those illegally purged from the rolls had names similar to convicted felons .
" Purges were first instituted immediately after African Americans were granted the franchise , " reports the ACLU .
This year , in a similar tactic , millions of voters have been removed from the rolls nationwide on the grounds their voter registration information did not agree with motor vehicle or Social Security information on that voter .
A recent report by the Brennan Center revealed that 13 million voters were purged from the rolls from 2004 to 2006 .
In its study of twelve states , it found that none of them advised voters they were being purged .
A more outrageous tactic by the GOP to suppress votes is to target voter registration organizations .
Today , the Buckeye Institute , a neoliberal think tank headed by Ohio 's notorious vote suppressor , J. Kenneth Blackwell , filed a state RICO action against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) on behalf of two Warren County , Ohio voters .
Reviving an unsuccessful tactic employed against the organization in 2004 , the allegations recycle discredited claims from 2004 , and attempt to link unsubstantiated stories to ACORN , raising sensational news stories and patently false and unattributed congressional testimony .
" Such a legal filing by the right wing Buckeye Institute , an organization that features the well - known voter suppression Commissar Ken Blackwell who sought to block Ohio voters from access to the ballot in 2004 , has about as much credibility as if they had announced that it was Al Capone that was behind the lawsuit , " responded ACORN in a statement to OEN .

This year , ACORN , along with Project Vote , recently completed a wildly successful voter registration campaign in twenty - one states , logging 1.3 million new voters .

[ Render Unto Caesar : Serving the Nation by Living Our Catholic Beliefs in Political Life , By Charles J. Chaput ]
As a former parishioner of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Denver who has had the pleasure of attending scores of masses presided over by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput , I can personally attest to the great moral strength , courage , and wisdom of the archbishop .
It was for this reason that I eagerly awaited the release of Archbishop Chaput 's new book , Render Unto Caesar : Serving the Nation by Living Our Catholic Beliefs in Political Life , which was released this month .
I was anxious to read the book for a more personal reason as well , stemming from a brief email exchange between the archbishop and me that occurred approximately a year ago .
I had written to the archbishop in the hope that he could explain to me how Christians could morally countenance the practice of taxation by states .
I said that it appeared to me that taxation was morally synonymous with robbery , ( since taxation necessarily involves taking men's justly earned property by force and without their consent ) , and thus ought to be condemned by Christians as a violation of the 7th commandment .
I asked the archbishop to clarify this for me , and he replied that taxation is not synonymous with robbery , citing the famous " Render unto Caesar " passage in the New Testament ( Matt. 22 ) .
When I recently learned that the archbishop had written a new book entitled , of all things , Render unto Caesar , my heart lept at the idea of finding a more thoroughgoing analysis of the moral relationship between Christians and the tax - funded state .
I anticipated that I would encounter in the book a moral defense of taxation and the state that would lay bare our responsibilities as a Christians to pay taxes and support the existence of the state .
Unfortunately , however , the archbishop does not endeavor in the book to put forward an argument designed to demonstrate that taxation is not morally equivalent to robbery .
Nor does he endeavor to demonstrate why all states are not , as St. Augustine famously put it in The City of God , " gangs of criminals on a grand scale . "
Despite the title of the book , Archbishop Chaput leaves the reader without any argument as to why the state has a right to rule over us , why we have a moral obligation to submit to such domination , or why the state possesses the moral authority to extract money from us at the point of a gun .
Put in even simpler terms , Archbishop Chaput offers no compelling arguments against those of us who happen to be , in Jerome Tuccille 's words , " sane , moderate , middle - of - the - road anarchist [s ] . "
This review will focus on one particularly troubling ( and glaringly obvious ) contradiction in the book .
Specifically , I will focus on the problem of asserting on the one hand , as does Archbishop Chaput , that all human beings are endowed by God and nature with equal dignity and sanctity , while asserting on the other hand such things as " rulers who commanded obedience to just laws , peaceful conduct , or honesty in business dealings posed no moral problem for Christians " ( p. 64 ) , or " even in classic Catholic thought , the church must respect the institutions of the state " ( p.135 ) .
If we are to take seriously the idea of equal human dignity and the sanctity of every single human life , then , contrary to Archbishop Chaput , we must necessarily denounce the tax - funded , coercive state as the single most egregious violator of human dignity and the most dangerous enemy of human life and civilization .
This is true , moreover , of each and every state that gains its revenue through taxation — including so - called " liberal democracies . "
If all men are endowed with equal dignity , how is the state morally justifiable ?
The reason Archbishop Chaput 's assertions are problematic and ultimately incompatible is that the tax - funded state is , in the final analysis , a group of men who have arrogated to themselves the " right " to rule , impress , rob , imprison , and regulate their subjects — without the subjects ' consent .
As St. Augustine noted , anticipating the work of such later scholars as Franz Oppenheimer , the state originated in the world , not through social contract or voluntary arrangement , but rather through force , robbery and murder :
A gang is a group of men under the command of a leader , bound by a compact of association , in which the plunder is divided according to an agreed convention .
If this villainy wins so many recruits from the ranks of the demoralized that it acquires territory , establishes a base , captures cities and subdues peoples , it then openly arrogates to itself the title of kingdom , which is conferred on it in the eyes of the world , not by the renunciation of aggression , but by the attainment of impunity .
For it was a witty and truthful rejoinder which was given by a captured pirate to Alexander the Great .
The king asked the fellow , ' What is your idea , in infesting the sea ? '
And the pirate answered , with uninhibited insolence , ' the same as yours , in infesting the earth !
But because I do it with a tiny craft , I 'm called a pirate : because you have a mighty navy , you 're called an emperor . '
Although it might be tempting to view the state romantically as an organic institution , emerging Athena - like from the body of people residing in a given territory , the truth is quite different — even in states that supposedly originated in a so - called " social contract . "
As the political scientist Terry Moe has observed in this regard , the social contract theory of government is wholly at odds with the political reality subjects confront and submit to in their lives :
Centuries of political philosophy notwithstanding , there is no social contract in any meaningful sense that can account for the foundations of government …
The typical situation in all modern societies is that people are born into the formal structure of their political systems , do not agree to it from the outset , and cannot leave if they find it disadvantageous ( unless they are prepared to leave the country ) …
This being so , the fact that some groups may lose in domestic politics — and may , in particular , have new institutions thrust upon them that they do n’t want and do n’t find beneficial — cannot be glossed over by saying that they have agreed to the larger system .
They have n’t .
This is true not only in despotic , dictatorial , communistic , fascist , or monarchical states ; it is true in all states — including democratic ones .
For in democratic states , just as in every other state , the subject is never given an option to submit to the authority of his self - appointed leaders , or the option to keep out of the exploitative relationship altogether .
Instead , he is given the unenviable choice of selecting which among several competing scoundrels will harm him the least .
As the 19th - century American lawyer Lysander Spooner noted in this regard , the voter in a democratic state is forced to " choose " his leader in a democratic system as a form of self - defense against the worst of the scoundrels who wish to subject him to their whims and exploitations :
In the case of individuals , their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent …
On the contrary , it is to be considered that , without his consent having ever been asked , a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist , a government that forces him to pay money , render service , and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights , under peril of weighty punishments .
He sees , too , that other men practice this tyranny over him by use of the ballot .
He sees further that , if he will but use the ballot himself , he has some chance of relieving himself of this tyranny of others , by subjecting them to his own .
In short , he finds himself , without his consent , so situated that , if he use the ballot he may become a master , if he does not use it , he must become a slave .
And he has no other alternative than these two .
In self defense , he attempts the former .
The simple yet profound truth that these insights point to is that all states are nothing more than groups of highly organized and extremely effective bandits , since they do not , and in practice never can ( as A. John Simmons , Murray Rothbard , Lysander Spooner , and Robert Paul Wolff have amply demonstrated ) , actually garner the consent of every person , or even a fraction of the people , over which they claim the authority to " rule . "
Archbishop Chaput himself comes close to recognizing that force is indeed the core ethic of the state when he writes , " Politics involves the exercise of power " ( p. 217 ) .
This sets up a serious problem for those who , like Archbishop Chaput , are committed to the idea that every single person on the face of the Earth is endowed by God or nature with undeniable and equal dignity .
For , in the face of the cold , hard fact that states necessarily rule by force and coercion , any world occupied by states will thus be a world in which some men are supposedly entitled to more dignity than others .
In a world governed by states , there exist two categorically distinct groups of men : the self - proclaimed rulers and the hapless subjects , who are entitled to a lesser degree of dignity .
For the ruling caste , in a world of states , possesses not only the right to determine their own fate in this world but also the fate of their citizen - slaves .
The subjugated castes , on the other hand , possess neither of these rights ; on the contrary , they possess only the right to abide by the decrees and whims of their self - proclaimed rulers , or suffer merciless penalties .
This was the choice given to St. Thomas More , whom Archbishop Chaput cites approvingly , when he was given the option of accommodating his supposed ruler — or death .
This is hardly a choice that comports with the idea of equal dignity of all men .
The fallback position of Catholic social teaching , when confronted with these sobering facts about the state as a necessarily coercive institution , has been to affirm that there exists a difference between so - called " proper " or " legitimate " authority and wrongfully employed authority .
Thus , Archbishop Chaput claims that Paul 's Letter to the Romans ,
is a call for proper obedience , not mindless submission .
The key line in these verses from Paul 's letter is ' For there is no authority except from God , and those that exist have been instituted by God . '
Christians obey secular rulers not because of anything inherent to the rulers .
Rather , when rulers properly use their power , they draw their authority from God. ( p. 205 )
The problem with this sort of argument is that it is almost stupefyingly question begging .
It would be one thing to assert that God has bestowed different gifts on people , and that some men are blessed by God with the gift of leadership , while others are not ; it is quite another thing , however , to deduce from this that some men are given the right by God to impress their will on their less - fortunate neighbors , take a portion of their neighbors ' income by threatening to jail or kill them if they refuse to obey , and impress their neighbors into military service , jury duty , or any other service for that matter .
Furthermore , the idea that some rulers are " legitimate , " while others are not would leave unanswered the most critical political question of all .
As Robert Paul Wolff puts it , " We must demonstrate by an a priori argument that there can be forms of human community in which some men have a moral right to rule . "
It is not enough to assert that some men rule by the authority of God Himself , and not provide any argument or criteria by which to judge so - called " legitimate authority , " or any criteria by which we might be able to determine which of the over six billion people on this planet have been singled out by God Himself to rule over the rest of us without our consent .
Are we not better off assuming , with the Declaration of Independence , that all men are created equal in the eyes of God , endowed with exactly the same amount of dignity and exactly the same rights , rather than trying to deduce special rights of coercion and subjugation for certain privileged castes ?
Caesar has a " right " to my hard - earned money ?
Why ?
I am currently employed as a roofer in the city of Denver .
I earn my daily bread by the strength of my arms and the sweat of my brow .
I also happen to believe , with Archbishop Chaput , in the sanctity of human life and the utter immorality of aggressive wars .
At present , however , I am forced to spend a portion of every day , month , and year working to fund the very practices that I abhor .
This is because I am taxed by the various governments that claim a right to a part of my labor and then proceed to spend that portion of my hard - won money on state - funded abortion and aggressive war ( among very many other things my conscience cannot abide ) .
Where do they get the right to take my money and spend it on practices that I abhor ?
The fact that I , like virtually every conscientious American Catholic , am forced to contribute to state - funded abortion and aggressive wars presents a serious problem for Archbishop Chaput 's theory of the state .
For the archbishop writes , citing the Vatican II document Dignitatis Humanae , " [ man ] must not be forced ' to act contrary to his conscience , especially in religious matters ' ( DH 3 ) …
All persons have a God - given right to believe as their conscience demands .
Truth can only be proposed .
It can not be imposed without violating the sanctity of the individual person and subverting the truth itself " ( p. 115 ) .
If men are endowed with the God - given right to act in a manner consistent with their consciences , how can the tax - funded state ever be morally justifiable ?
Because taxation is necessarily coercive ( that is , all taxes are paid to the state under the threat of severe punishment ) , subjects are prohibited from employing the fruits of their labor in a manner consistent with their consciences .
On the contrary , the subject makes his contribution to the state coffers merely in an attempt to avoid jail or the gulag , and the ruling caste subsequently apportions his contributions to those things that it , for whatever reasons , deems expedient .
In the present American context , this means disbursing Catholic tax contributions to state - funded abortion and aggressive wars — including war against civilians in Iraq .
This is true not only in a dictatorship or monarchy , but also in a democracy , since there has never been , and probably never can be , a situation in which each and every democratic subject completely and unequivocally agrees with the disbursement of his tax contributions .
This problem is all the more acute when we reckon the actual cost in human life that the modern , tax - funded state has imposed on the City of Man .
The number of people who were murdered in cold blood by their own governments , ( that is , they were murdered by the very institutions they were forced to fund at the point of a gun ) , is estimated by R.J. Rummel to be 170 million in the 20th century alone .
Archbishop Chaput attributes the recent massive loss of human life through " wars , repressions , and genocides " to unbelief in Jesus Christ ( p. 74 ) .
But , surely this is an unsatisfying explanation , since there have always been unbelievers and murderous thugs in the world of man .
What has changed in the 20th century , however , is that the modern state has come to pervade the entirety of human life , has arrogated to itself the ability to tax its subjects to the hilt to fund its monstrous programs , and then turn the murderous apparatus of the state on its own people , as I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere .
It is thus not surprising that Michael Walzer , the most prominent modern philosopher of war , writes , " it is n't too much of an exaggeration to say that the greatest danger most people face in the world today comes from their own states . "
What needs to be done ?
I hold the worthy archbishop of Denver in the highest esteem .
He is , and has been for some time , a beacon of courage for Catholics throughout the United States .
I do , however , find the theory of the state propounded in his recent book lax in several important regards .
In saying this , I feel it is incumbent upon me to make two notes about the state in conclusion .
First , let me disclose that I am convinced that man does not need government in order to live a peaceful , pious and productive life in society .
Indeed , as I have endeavored to demonstrate in this review , the state is an institution that is and forever shall be opposed to the interests of the nature of man : the state necessarily subsists through coercion , robbery and murder , while the actual interests of men lie in peace , trade , and secure private - property rights .
I am furthermore convinced that anarchism ( specifically , anarchocapitalism ) as a system of social organization is demonstrably workable , and is , moreover , the only system that can be reconciled with the idea that all men are endowed by God with equal dignity and equal rights .
My convictions are based upon the economic arguments provided by the Austrian economists , most notably Murray Rothbard and Hans - Hermann Hoppe .
Second , allow me to address one final issue that is relevant to both Archbishop Chaput 's recent book and the obligation of man to the state in general .
If man has a right to live his life as his conscience sees fit , and he may well share his beliefs with a great number of his friends and neighbors , he and his neighbors have an indisputable right to separate themselves and their property from the depredations of a state that claims their allegiance .
They have , in other words , a right to secede from a state they deem immoral , for whatever reasons .
The so - called " American experiment " was born precisely in this recognition that men have a right to determine their own destiny and strive to serve God as their consciences deem appropriate .
The first and greatest step toward affirming man 's right to conscience in the City of Man is thus to let him leave the state that currently clamps a yoke around his neck , and let him set off in the direction of his own conscience .
All men are created equal in the eyes of God , and all men are entitled to this right of self - determination .

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Argentine officials said on Thursday theirs is the first government worldwide to require that companies engaged in potentially hazardous activities buy insurance to cover environmental damage .
Government officials said preliminary figures show that about 35,000 companies would have to comply with the new rules .
“ Argentina is taking a leadership role in the region on this issue , ” Sergio Chodos , an undersecretary at the Environment Secretariat , told Reuters .
“ There ’s a lot of environmental insurance sold in Europe , but it ’s not obligatory because it does n’t have to be .
In Argentina , lawmakers understood that this had to be made obligatory , ” he said .
Argentina ’s Congress passed a law to this effect in 2002 and it was finally implemented last month .
The insurance policies will range in price from 120,000 pesos ( $ 36,090 ) a year to 50 million pesos ( $ 15 million ) , depending on a given company ’s activities , output and the potential risk involved .
Only one insurance company is currently authorized to sell this type of coverage in Argentina , but others are applying to do so , officials said .
( $ 1 = 3.325 Argentine pesos )
Even while at the top of its game , Apple Inc. can seemingly find faults with just about anything , including a bit of itself .
The Mac maker is constantly evaluating the market segments in which it wishes to participate and those which it does not .
It 's an application of love - hate methodology that inevitably produces its share of casualties .
Take , for instance , the firm 's petite line of headless desktop computers known as Mac minis .
They retail between $ 599 and $ 799 , catering to the once critical sub - $ 800 PC market .
Conspicuously , it was that precise market segment in which Apple executives asserted little interest just months before introducing the first Mac mini at the Macworld trade show in January of 2005 .
Maybe management was n't fibbing after all .
Since then , the Mac mini has been treated to a rather mundane life - cycle .
It has seen just four updates since inception , one of which was so insignificant in Apple 's own eyes that the company did n't even bother to draft a press release .
Even now , the current minis ' 1.66GHz and 1.83GHz Core Duo processors are a far cry from the silicon offered in the rest of Apple 's PC offerings .
And rightfully so , as the company has seen lower margins from the units , which never gained the sales traction of its more fully equipped iMacs and MacBooks .
Some have gone so far as to call the mini Apple 's bastard child ; the neglected Mac that never was .
At the same time , the history behind its creation and the reasons for its seeming abandonment are comparatively fuzzy .
There is some speculation that Apple conceived the Mac mini under pressure from shareholders who wanted a sub -$ 800 Mac , but never really saw much in the design itself .
It 's almost as if the mini stood in direct contrast to Apple 's fundamentals from the get - go .
In at least one instance , during the winter months of 2005 and early 2006 , Apple began toying with concepts to more closely tie the mini to the essential nature of its business .
The most public of those , per AppleInsider reports , was a plan to include a built - in iPod dock atop the high - end models .
But just like every other bright idea Apple had for the tiny Mac , it was shelved and transformed under more economical standards into a project that would eventually emerge as Apple TV .
In fact , it was about that time in early 2006 when Apple TV really began to take shape inside Apple and the development of the mini began its slow , inevitable decline .
Not coincidentally , Apple TV turned out a lot like a next - generation mini , with the stripping - out of the optical disc drive representing the essence of Apple 's long - term digital media strategy .
Still , the mini has had its share of selling points .
Due to its small footprint and low cost , it was immediately nominated by seasoned techies as the perfect media server for the living room .
Some even went as far as installing the the tiny Mac in their vehicles .
But with the advent of Apple TV , Apple seems to have shoved the diminutive device into the far corner of what had already been a niche audience .
Therefore , it comes as little surprise that sources , for whom AppleInsider holds the utmost respect , are now pointing towards the mini's impending demise .
For it 's according to those people that the miniature Mac will soon follow in the wake of its similarly - proportioned counterparts of years past : the PowerBook 2400 , the PowerMac G4 Cube , and , most recently , the 12 - inch PowerBook .
Whether Apple will squeeze another revision from the mini , and how long it plans to allow existing models to linger , are both unclear .
But as the extended Memorial Day break dawns upon us , the point being driven should be clear :
People really want to believe effort is a myth , at least if we consider what we consume in the media :
politicians and beauty queens who get by on a smile and a wink
lottery winners who turn a lifetime of lousy jobs into one big payday
sports stars who are born with skills we could never hope to acquire
hollywood celebrities with the talent of being in the right place at the right time
failed CEOs with $ 40 million buyouts
It really seems ( at least if you read popular media ) that who you know and whether you get ‘ picked ’ are the two keys to success .
Luck .
The thing about luck is this : we ’re already lucky .
We ’re insanely lucky that we were n’t born during the black plague or in a country with no freedom .
We ’re lucky that we ’ve got access to highly - leveraged tools and terrific opportunities .
If we set that luck aside , though , something interesting shows up .
Delete the outliers –the people who are hit by a bus or win the lottery , the people who luck out in a big way , and we ’re left with everyone else .
And for everyone else , effort is directly related to success .
Not all the time , but as much as you would expect .
Smarter , harder working , better informed and better liked people do better than other people , most of the time .
Effort takes many forms .
Showing up , certainly .
Knowing stuff ( being smart might be luck of the draw , but knowing stuff is the result of effort ) .
Being kind when it ’s more fun not to .
Paying forward when there ’s no hope of tangible reward .
Doing the right thing .
You ’ve heard these things a hundred times before , of course , but I guess it ’s easier to bet on luck .
If people are n’t betting on luck , then why do we make so many dumb choices ?
Why are n’t useful books selling at fifty times the rate they sell now ?
Why does anyone , ever , watch reality TV shows ?
Why do people do such dumb stuff with their money ?
I think we ’ve been tricked by the veneer of lucky people on the top of the heap .
We see the folks who manage to skate by , or who get so much more than we think they deserve , and it ’s easy to forget that :
a. these guys are the exceptions
and
b. there ’s nothing you can do about it anyway .
And that ’s the key to the paradox of effort :
While luck may be more appealing than effort , you do n’t get to choose luck .
Effort , on the other hand , is totally available , all the time .
This is a hard sell .
Diet books that say , " eat less , exercise more , " may work , but they do n’t sell many copies .
With that forewarning , here ’s a bootstrapper ’s / marketer ’s/ entrepreneur ’s / fast - rising executive ’s effort diet .
Go through the list and decide whether or not it ’s worth it .
Or make up your own diet .
Effort is a choice , at least make it on purpose :
1. Delete 120 minutes a day of ‘ spare time ’ from your life .
This can include TV , reading the newspaper , commuting , wasting time in social networks and meetings .
Up to you .
2 . Spend the 120 minutes doing this instead :
Exercise for thirty minutes .
Read relevant non-fiction ( trade magazines , journals , business books , blogs , etc. )
Send three thank you notes .
Learn new digital techniques ( spreadsheet macros , Firefox shortcuts , productivity tools , graphic design , html coding )
Volunteer .
Blog for five minutes about something you learned .
Give a speech once a month about something you do n’t currently know a lot about .
3 . Spend at least one weekend day doing absolutely nothing but being with people you love .
4 . Only spend money , for one year , on things you absolutely need to get by .
Save the rest , relentlessly .
If you somehow pulled this off , then six months from now , you would be the fittest , best rested , most intelligent , best funded and motivated person in your office or your field .
You would know how to do things other people do n’t , you ’d have a wider network and you ’d be more focused .
It ’s entirely possible that this wo n’t be sufficient , and you will continue to need better luck .
But it ’s a lot more likely you ’ll get lucky , I bet .

In THE SHOCK DOCTRINE , Naomi Klein explodes the myth that the global free market triumphed democratically .
Exposing the thinking , the money trail and the puppet strings behind the world - changing crises and wars of the last four decades , The Shock Doctrine is the gripping story of how America ’s “ free market ” policies have come to dominate the world -- through the exploitation of disaster - shocked people and countries .

-A Film by Alfonso Cuaron & Naomi Klein .
Directed by Jonas Cuaron ( 2007 ) .
Based on Klein 's bestselling book : " Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism "
- Milton Friedman ( The 20th Century 's most prominent economist advocate of free markets .
He was widely regarded as the leader of the Chicago School of monetary economics , which stresses the importance of the quantity of money as an instrument of government policy and as a determinant of business cycles and inflation .
Recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize for Economic Science , 1976 , Recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom , 1988 ) .
But on Wednesday the British government , showing the kind of clear thinking that has been all too scarce on this side of the pond , announced a plan to provide banks with £ 50 billion in new capital  the equivalent , relative to the size of the economy , of a $ 500 billion program here  together with extensive guarantees for financial transactions between banks .
And U.S. Treasury officials now say that they plan to do something similar , using the authority they did n’t want but Congress gave them anyway .
The question now is whether these moves are too little , too late .
I do n’t think so , but it will be very alarming if this weekend rolls by without a credible announcement of a new financial rescue plan , involving not just the United States but all the major players .
Why do we need international cooperation ?
Because we have a globalized financial system in which a crisis that began with a bubble in Florida condos and California McMansions has caused monetary catastrophe in Iceland .
We ’re all in this together , and need a shared solution .
Why this weekend ?
Because there happen to be two big meetings taking place in Washington : a meeting of top financial officials from the major advanced nations on Friday , then the annual International Monetary Fund / World Bank meeting Saturday and Sunday .
If these meetings end without at least an agreement in principle on a global rescue plan  if everyone goes home with nothing more than vague assertions that they intend to stay on top of the situation  a golden opportunity will have been missed , and the downward spiral could easily get even worse .
What should be done ?
The United States and Europe should just say “ Yes , prime minister . ”
The British plan is n’t perfect , but there ’s widespread agreement among economists that it offers by far the best available template for a broader rescue effort .
And the time to act is now .
You may think that things ca n’t get any worse  but they can , and if nothing is done in the next few days , they will .
simplyglobal : A simple globalization plugin for Rails
The following is a guest post from Dan Simard
Sometimes , you have to reinvent the wheel .
It ’s really sad to say and you will probably hate me for saying that ( and I know that you ’ll do because I hate myself for it ) .
I ’ve written a new globalization plugin for Rails .
Why did I reinvented the wheel ?
I searched and tried a lot of other globalisation plugins … and I really tried them .
I spent hours with Globalize .
It was just too much .
I tried the gettext_Localize that works with the good ol ’ gettext command .
Fuck it .
Too complicated .
It just did n’t fit my needs at all .
All I wanted was a wheel that you can put a wood - pole in the middle and then it could start spinning .
I made one .
You can go on the simplyglobal project homepage to learn on to install it and use it .
In fact , this is not really a globalization plugin because there ’s no localization handling or anything that can look like it .
The name should have been simplytranslated but I already created the project with the name simplyglobal and it was an hassle to change it .
How to install
1. Execute ./ script/ plugin install http://simplyglobal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/simplyglobal
2. Create a file named simplyglobal.rb in the config / initializers directory
3 . In simplyglobal.rb , create hashes of language
Add the language hashes to the object
You will end up with a file named simplyglobal.rb that looks like this :
# français fr = { " hi " => " bonjour " , " welcome " => " bienvenue " } # espanol es = { " hi " => " hola " , " welcome " => " bienvenida " } SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash ( : fr , fr ) SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash(:es , es )
In development , this file will be loaded every request .
In production , it is loaded once .
How to use it with strings
After you installed it , you can use it in these various ways .
SimplyGlobal adds a t( ) method to all string objects that will return the translated string .
Example , if you have defined a language hash that looks like this ( note : normally , the languages hash are defined in config / initializers / simplyglobal.rb but I put it inline for the sake of the example ) :
fr = { " hi " => " bonjour " } # Create the language hash SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash ( : fr , fr ) #
Add the language hash to simplyglobal SimplyGlobal.locale = : fr # Assigns the locale to use " hi " .t # returns " bonjour "
As simple as that !
You can use it like the % method of the String class .
fr = { " hi %s %d " => " bonjour %s %d " } # Create the language hash SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash ( : fr , fr ) #
Add the language hash to simplyglobal SimplyGlobal.locale = : fr # Assigns the locale to use " hi " .t ( " Johnny " , 5 ) # returns " bonjour Johnny5 "
You can also return all translations for a word .
That is a special feature developed only for Frank .
SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash( : fr , { " hi " => " bonjour " } ) #
Add the french language hash SimplyGlobal.add_language_hash(:es , { " hi " => " hola " } ) #
Add the spanish language hash " hi " .t ( : all ) # returns a hash : { : fr => " bonjour " , : es => " hola " }
Using it with views
Just create a view ending with _fr and simplyglobal will use it .
def index SimplyGlobal.locale = : fr # Will try to render index_fr.html.erb # rather than index.html.erb end
It also works for the partial .
< %= render : partial => " info " %>
will try to render _info_fr.html.erb rather than _info.html.erb .

Congress wields tremendous power over domestic policy
That is what Larry Sabato , Professor of Political Science at the University of Virginia , is saying about the potential for big Democratic gains in the US Senate races in November .
One - third of Senators are up for election every two years , as well as all Congressmen , and of this year 's 35 , the majority are Republicans .
Controlling Congress is the key to any President getting through his domestic policy agenda .
In 2006 , the dramatic mid-term elections saw Democrats regaining control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
But they currently only have a slim majority of 51 - 49 in the Senate ( and one of these votes is the independent Democrat Joe Lieberman who is campaigning for Senator McCain ) .
POSSIBLE DEMOCRATIC GAINS Key Senate races
Alaska , Colorado , Georgia , Kentucky , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Carolina , Oregon , Virginia
This year , the Democrats are poised to build on their 2006 success by winning even more seats , even , perhaps , the 60 needed for a filibuster - proof majority , which would stop Republican lawmakers " talking out " legislation with which they disagree .
This would allow Democrats in the Senate to push through a much more ambitious - and liberal - agenda , especially if the American people also elect Barack Obama to the White House in November .
The opinion polls nationally are running strongly towards the Democrats .
Shaky grip
But to make major gains in the Senate , Democrats would have to pick up seats in some very unlikely states .
Republicans have held Alaska 's Senate seats since 1981 One of the most surprising is Alaska , whose Senate delegation has been solidly Republican since 1981 .
Incumbent Republican Senator Ted Stevens , who faces re-election in November , has been a dominant figure in Alaskan politics since 1968 , when he first won his seat .
But his grip on power is beginning to look decidedly shaky - he is currently on trial , charged with covering up renovation work carried out on his house free of charge by oil company employees .
Even before his indictment was served , Mr Stevens had been facing a tough re-election battle against the Democratic Mayor of Anchorage , Mark Begich .
None of the other Senate races have - as yet - been affected by scandal .
But four other Republican - held seats where sitting Republicans are retiring are looking like possible pick - ups for the Democrats .
Of these four , the two most likely openings for the Democrats are in Virginia and Colorado , two traditionally Republican states that have been increasingly voting for Democrats in recent elections .
In Virginia , the seat of outgoing Republican John Warner - Elizabeth Taylor 's ex-husband , no less - is being fought over by two former Virginia governors : Republican Jim Gilmore and Democrat Mark Warner .
Mark Warner has been credited with beginning the wave of recent Democratic victories in the state that culminated with election wins for current Governor Tim Kaine and Senator Jim Webb in 2006 .
Polls suggest he is streets ahead of Mr Gilmore .
In Colorado , where the Democrats won a Senate seat in 2006 , Congressman Mark Udall , a Democrat , is leading former congressman Bob Schaffer .
Like Virginia , the trend in Colorado has been towards the Democrats of late , and both states are showing signs of backing Barack Obama in the presidential poll , which should help Democratic candidates lower down the ballot .
Cousins The Democrats also have good chances in another open seat .
Tom Udall - and his cousin Mark - are both running for the Senate In New Mexico , Democrat Tom Udall - a cousin of Mark Udall - is challenging his fellow congressman , Republican Steve Pearce for outgoing Senator Pete Domenici 's seat .
The Udalls appear to have luck on their side this year .
Tom Udall 's opponent could have been the other member of New Mexico 's congressional delegation , moderate Republican Heather Wilson .
But Ms Wilson lost out to Mr Pearce - a staunch conservative - in the selection primary , and Mr Udall will not be forced to fight so hard for centrist voters .
Polls suggest he will beat Mr Pearce in November .
The Udalls are a Western dynasty .
Tom 's father , Stewart Udall , was an Arizona Congressman and Secretary of the Interior a generation ago under John F Kennedy .
Southern comfort
The fourth open seat being talked about as a possible Democratic gain is - perhaps surprisingly - Mississippi .
Republicans like Senator Liz Dole are facing real challenges
The state has long been a Republican stronghold , but - without the advantage of incumbency - Republican candidate Roger Wicker , who was appointed to fill out the remainder of Trent Lott 's Senate term , is having a tough time defending it against the challenge of Democrat - and former Mississippi governor - Ronnie Musgrove .
Mr Musgrove will be hoping that the presence of Barack Obama at the top of the ticket will encourage a large turnout among African - American voters , which would improve his chances of success .
The Republicans are also facing strong challenges in traditionally Republican states like North Carolina - where Democrat Kay Hagan is currently leading Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole in opinion polls - and Georgia , where polls suggest the two parties are neck and neck .
Polling also indicates that even the leader of the Republicans in the Senate - Mitch McConnell - has a fight on his hands to keep his ultra-safe Kentucky seat .
Democratic states
The Democrats also have their eye on a number of seats held by Republicans battling for re-election in states that are traditionally Democratic .
Of these , the most likely Democratic gain would be in New Hampshire , where incumbent Republican John Sununu faces a very tough fight against popular former state governor Jeanne Shaheen .
Two other Republican incumbents in broadly Democratic states - Gordon Smith in Oregon and Norm Coleman in Minnesota - also face the prospect of losing their seats to strong Democratic challengers .
Mr Coleman 's battle against Democrat Al Franken , a comedian and radio host , is complicated further by the presence of a third party candidate , Dean Barkley , who briefly served in the Senate , on the ballot .
" No - one knows what 's going to happen in Minnesota , " says Professor Sabato .
Glimmer of hope
As the races currently stand , the Democrats have a good chance of gaining at least seven seats - Alaska , Colorado , New Mexico , New Hampshire , North Carolina , Oregon and Virginia - and could pick up as many as eleven .
Seven pick - ups would give them 58 seats in the senate , while eleven would put them on 62 .
Why does any of this matter ?
Well , because of the Senate 's procedural rules , it takes 60 votes to overturn a " filibuster " - when a senator " talks out " a bill , effectively killing it .
So even if a party has only a minority of seats in the senate , it can block the passage of legislation with a mere 41 votes .
Indeed , since winning a Senate majority in 2006 , the Democrats have been consistently stymied by Republican filibusters .
The more Senators the Democrats have , the greater their chances of pushing through their legislative agenda in the face of Republican opposition .
Professor Sabato reckons that if the Democrats win 58 seats , the votes of the handful of moderate Republicans ( like Olympia Snowe of Maine , or Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania ) will in fact be enough to allow Barack Obama - if elected - to get his legislative agenda through the Senate .
So when you are watching the results come in on election night , make sure you keep an eye on the Senate races as well .
If the Democrats reach the magic number , they could be in a position to override Republican opposition and introduce major new legislation .

AUG 03
This was the fun part .
I bought some CAD software , read the book and spent six months designing , redesigning and tweaking the plan .
Finally happy , I worked out that the cost of the house would be hopelessly prohibitive , so started again ( losing the swimming pool , triple garage etc ) .
Eventually , having scaled the house to the size of the plot , I contacted the most respected ( read expensive ) architect in the Highlands and asked him to look at the plans and give me his professional opinion .
The fact that he kept a straight face went a long way to convincing me that he should be the technical adviser / nanny ( as , at that time I had absolutely NO idea how to build a house ) .
Because of this I spent many hours trying to locate and employ a project manager - but there are certain things one cannot do in the north west Highlands , and one of them is find project managers .
I was thus duly and reluctantly promoted .
MAY 04 I then had to find a company that could supply the logs .
As I saw it , there were two ways to go .
Scandinavian pine or Canadian red cedar .
The cedar had the benefit of resisting wood boring insects and not needing treating , but was more expensive , a lot more to transport to Scotland , very heavy and looks a bit ' lumberjack ' for my tastes .
The ' polar ' pine wood grown in Lapland is NOTHING like what you might find for sale in B &Q ( much slower growing , very dense and hard wearing , and as a company called Sustainable Buildings was importing kits with a life expectancy of hundreds of years , I decided this was the best option .
( Techie bit : skip if you know or are not interested )
Completed designs are converted into AutoCad files , sent by e mail to Scandinavia , where a Finnish company ( Sustainable Buildings use ArticHouse ) price the kit and point out any design or production issues .
Once they have the go ahead from the client ( and half the money ) they simply press the ' GO ' button and the factory cuts and numbers all the logs which are then automatically sorted ready to be packed and shipped to wherever .
If the customer is not going to build the kit themselves , Finnish workers ( in groups of two ) who are used to constructing these kits can be hired to fly over and ' join the numbers ' - a bit like a giant Lego kit .
Back to the story : Below are the final floor plans at the time of the build .
Click on either of the plans to see larger versions .
The design started with my main desire to have a huge wall of glass ( two floors high ) that faces the loch .
Behind that would be a ' mezzanine ' with a lounge looking down onto the living room .
This open plan living area ( incorporating kitchen and dining areas would be flanked by glass patio doors for access to decking and even more view .
The downstairs would also have 3 bedrooms ( 2 en suite ) , a hall , boot room , main bathroom and an inbuilt garage with utility ( dropped due to planning objections ) .
Upstairs as well as the lounge there would be a further 2 bedrooms ( one of which to be my music room with sound proofed isolation room off ) .
There would be a brick chimney for open fire and the whole house was to be air conditioned ( you ca n't open windows in the Highlands in August due to midges )
See above and below .
WASHINGTON -
Israel was one of only two countries who stood by the United States on Wednesday at a United Nations General Assembly vote to lift the American trade embargo on Cuba .
The vote in the 192 - member world body was 185 to 3 , with 2 abstentions .
The US , Israel and Palau voted " no " while Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained .
Diplomatic duel Israel vs. Cuba Yitzhak Benhorin Cuban ambassador to UN attacks Israel for Gaza blockade as representative of non-aligned movement ; Israeli ambassador responds by saying it is unclear who Cuba purports to represent Diplomatic duel : Israel vs. Cuba
That was one more " yes " vote than last year 's vote of 184 to 4 with 1 abstention , and when the final vote flashed on the screen in the General Assembly chamber , there was loud applause .
" We proudly voted with the US , at a time where most of the world showed solidarity with Cuba , " said Israel 's Deputy UN Ambassador Daniel Carmon , " the decision was made by a solid majority , which is similar to the automatic majority against us in Palestinian decisions . "
" When the vote was over , applause and shouts were heard , which is unacceptable in the UN , " he added .
Wednesday 's approval of the resolution was the 17th straight year that the General Assembly called for the embargo against Cuba to be repealed " as soon as possible . "
" We expect that the new president will change the policy toward Cuba , " Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told the Associated Press in an interview following the vote .
Referring to the race pitting Democrat Barack Obama against Republican John McCain , Perez Roque said he hopes the next American leader " treats Cuba with respect , lifts the blockade , and hears the message that the UN sent today . "
The United States has no diplomatic relations with Cuba , lists the country as a state sponsor of terror and has long sought to isolate it through travel restrictions and a trade embargo .
The embargo , imposed in 1962 , has been tightened during President Bush 's two terms .
As found on the Nike PR Forums :
Nike is announcing today that it recognizes Arien O'Connell as a winner in last weekend 's Nike Women 's Marathon with the fastest chip time , completing the full race in 2:55:11 .
She shattered her previous time and achieved an amazing accomplishment .
Arien will receive the same recognition and prize , including a Tiffany & Co. bowl , the full marathon elite group winner received .
Arien was unfortunately not immediately recognized as a race winner because she did not start the race with the elite running group , which is required by USATF standards .
Because of their earlier start time , the runners in the elite group had no knowledge of the outstanding race Arien was running and could not adjust their strategies accordingly .
Learning from the unique experience in this year 's race , Nike has decided today to eliminate the elite running group from future Nike Women 's Marathons .
Next year , all runners will run in the same group and all will be eligible to win .
Nike has a proven track record of supporting athletes and we 're proud to be able to honor Arien and other athletes who surpass their goals and achieve great accomplishments .
django - genshi is a small wrapper library around Genshi that provides an API similar to django . template .
Included are imitations of Context and RequestContext .
There is also an implemention of the Django template loader system adapted for Genshi , and a selection of shortcut functions .
Usage
See the Django [ 1 ] and Genshi [ 2 ] documentation for detailed usage notes .
The API of django - genshi is intended to mirror that of Django , while writing or manipulating the templates will require knowledge of Genshi .
Genshi cannot use Django ’s default template loaders – to work around this , the app_directories , filesystem , and eggs loaders have been modified and included in the django_genshi.loaders package .
Modify your TEMPLATE_LOADERS
accordingly .
Example :
>>> from django_genshi import render_to_response >>> response = render_to_response ( ' template_name.xml ' , { " name " : " world " } ) >>> print response.content < h1 > Hello world !</h1 >

A running cliché of the political left and the press corps these days is that our current financial problems all flow from Congress 's 1999 decision to repeal the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 that separated commercial and investment banking .
Barack Obama has been selling this line every day .
Bill Clinton signed that " deregulation " bill into law , and he knows better .
In BusinessWeek.com , Maria Bartiromo reports that she asked the former President last week whether he regretted signing that legislation .
Mr. Clinton 's reply :...

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
At least 30 Chase bank offices in nine U.S. states have been targeted by threatening letters , many of them containing an unidentified powder , an FBI spokesman said on Tuesday .
At least five Chase branches in Colorado and Oklahoma received the letters on Monday and some contained a white powder , Chase had said .
“ Today we ’re well over two dozen , ” FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said .
“ To the best of my knowledge they ’re all Chase . ”
An FBI statement later said more than 30 letters were being investigated .
He declined to characterize the threats but said he was unaware of any connection to recent troubles in the U.S. financial system .
“ At this point , field tests on the powder have been negative , ” for harmful substances , Kolko said .
He said local laboratories will do more testing .
Chase spokesman Tom Kelly said there have been no injuries to bank employees or customers , and referred additional questions about the probe to the FBI .
The FBI , U.S. Postal Inspectors and local authorities are investigating the letters , he said .
The letters have been received at branches in New York , New Jersey , Washington , D.C. , Illinois , Ohio , Oklahoma , Colorado , Georgia and Texas .
“ Even sending a hoax letter is a serious crime , ” Kolko said .
JPMorgan Chase & Co last week surpassed Citigroup Inc to became the largest U.S. bank .

The Bush family and the S&L Scandal
Neil , George Jr. , George Sr. , and Jeb Bush
The Savings and Loan industry had been experiencing major problems through the late 60s and 70s due to rising inflation and rising interest rates .
Because of this there was a move in the 1970s to replace the role of S&L institutions with banks .
In the early 1980s , under Reagan , regulatory changes took place that gave the S&L industry new powers and for the first time in history measures were taken to increase the profitability of S&Ls at the expense of promoting home ownership .
A history of the S&L situation can be found here :
http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&l/
What is important to note about the S&L scandal is that it was the largest theft in the history of the world and US tax payers are who was robbed .
The problems occurred in the Savings and Loan industry as they relate to theft because the industry was deregulated under the Reagan / Bush administration and restrictions were eased on the industry so much that abuse and misuse of funds became easy , rampant , and went unchecked .
Additional facts on the Savings and Loan Scandal can be found here :
http://www.inthe80s.com/sandl.shtml
There are several ways in which the Bush family plays into the Savings and Loan scandal , which involves not only many members of the Bush family but also many other politicians that are still in office and still part of the Bush Jr. administration today .
Jeb Bush , George Bush Sr. , and his son Neil Bush have all been implicated in the Savings and Loan Scandal , which cost American tax payers over $ 1.4 TRILLION dollars ( note that this is about one quarter of our national debt ) .
Between 1981 and 1989 , when George Bush finally announced that there was a Savings and Loan Crisis to the world , the Reagan / Bush administration worked to cover up Savings and Loan problems by reducing the number and depth of examinations required of S&Ls as well as attacking political opponents who were sounding early alarms about the S&L industry .
Industry insiders were aware of significant S&L problems as early 1986 that they felt would require a bailout .
This information was kept from the media until after Bush had won the 1988 elections .
Jeb Bush defaulted on a $ 4.56 million loan from Broward Federal Savings in Sunrise , Florida .
After federal regulators closed the S&L , the office building that Jeb used the $ 4.56 million to finance was reappraised by the regulators at $ 500,000 , which Bush and his partners paid .
The taxpayers had to pay back the remaining 4 million plus dollars .
Neil Bush was the most widely targeted member of the Bush family by the press in the S&L scandal .
Neil became director of Silverado Savings and Loan at the age of 30 in 1985 .
Three years later the institution was belly up at a cost of $ 1.6 billion to tax payers to bail out .
The basic actions of Neil Bush in the S&L scandal are as follows :
Neil received a $ 100,000 " loan " from Ken Good , of Good International , with no obligation to pay any of the money back .
Good was a large shareholder in JNB Explorations , Neil Bush 's oil - exploration company .
Neil failed to disclose this conflict - of - interest when loans were given to Good from Silverado , because the money was to be used in joint venture with his own JNB .
This was in essence giving himself a loan from Silverado through a third party .
Neil then helped Silverado S&L approve Good International for a $ 900,000 line of credit .
Good defaulted on a total $ 32 million in loans from Silverado .
During this time Neil Bush did not disclose that $ 3 million of the $ 32 million that Good was defaulting on was actually for investment in JNB , his own company .
Good subsequently raised Bush 's JNB salary from $ 75,000 to $ 125,000 and granted him a $ 22,500 bonus .
Neil Bush maintained that he did not see how this constituted a conflict of interest .
Neil approved $ 106 million in Silverado loans to another JNB investor , Bill Walters .
Neil also never formally disclosed his relationship with Walters and Walters also defaulted on his loans , all $ 106 million of them .
Neil Bush was charged with criminal wrongdoing in the case and ended up paying $ 50,000 to settle out of court .
The chief of Silverado S&L was sentenced to 3.5 years in jail for pleading guilty to $ 8.7 million in theft .
( Keep in mind that you can get more jail time for holding up a gas station for $ 50 . )
Today Neil Bush is working on closing a deal in Florida , where his brother Jeb is governor , to sell a software package to schools with his startup company Ignite .
Update 11/28/2003 : Some of Neil Bush 's business deals have been exposed in his recent divorce case .
For more on this see :
http://www.truthout.org/docs_03/112703A.shtml
http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2004/01/26/neil_bush/index.html
It should also be noted that shortly after news of Neil Bush ’s involvement in the S&L scandal hit the press his father , George Bush Sr. , announced the Desert Storm campaign in Iraq , which subsequently had the result of making Neil ’s name quickly fade from the headlines .
In addition , while Neil Bush 's divorce proceeding were exposing more backroom Bush dealings , America was once again bombarded with war propaganda for Operation Iraq Freedom .
The S&L scandal is by no means the only incident of questionable , and actually illegal , financial activity that the Bush family has been involved in .
The line of questionable , illegal , and unethical businesses practices goes back at least to Prescott Bush Sr. , George Bush Sr. ’s father .
Prescott Bush was a Senator from 1952 – 1963 .
Previous to his time as a Senator Prescott was a banker and businessman .
Prior to the American entry into WWII Prescott Bush was director of Union Banking Corporation .
Union Banking Corporation helped to finance Hitler ’s regime .
The Concentration Camps of Nazi Germany were labor camps that the Nazis used to make products for their regime as well as for sale to raise money .
Prescott profited directly from the Auschwitz labor camp .
In 1942 , after Hitler declared war on America the United States government seized the Union Banking Corporation under the Trading with the Enemy Act as a front operation that was supporting the Nazis .
Much of the profits from the operation were already pocketed by Prescott however , and $ 1.5 million was put in a trust fund for George Bush Sr .

The issues of WWII will be revisited again later .
This is actually just the tip of the iceberg as far as the Bush family and business dealings are concerned , the topic is a book in itself .
In the interest of brevity I invite you to research the Bush family business ties yourself , including those in Saudi Arabia , where George Bush made millions as an oil well developer , and George Bush ’s $ 14 million deal when he sold the Texas Rangers , while leaving tax payers footing the bill .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The tightening credit market has claimed the life of yet another retailer , with bankrupt department - store chain Mervyn's the latest to call it quits .
After exhausting all other options , Mervyn's , the 59 - year old retailer in California and the Southwest , said it plans to hold " going out of business " sales during the holidays at all of its remaining 149 locations .
The Hayward , Calif . - based company , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July , said that it will offer deep discounts to drive traffic to its stores .
Gordon Brown today waded into the row over George Osborne 's candour and judgment , calling for an investigation into claims that the shadow chancellor was personally involved in discussions to channel a £ 50,000 donation from Russia 's richest oligarch to the Conservative party .
Asked about the issue at prime minister 's question time , Brown told MPs the matter was " very serious indeed " , adding : " I hope it is investigated by the authorities . "
Denis MacShane , a Labour MP , also attempted to ratchet up the pressure on Osborne , and has written to the shadow chancellor seeking clarification on the issue .
Osborne looked uncomfortable during the exchange after he yesterday faced a barrage of questions and was made to offer a detailed account of what happened when he met the tycoon Oleg Deripaska four times in a single weekend during his summer holiday in Corfu .
Osborne , who was backed last night by his leader , David Cameron , was forced to admit that he had been involved in a conversation at the villa of financier Nat Rothschild about the way a donation could be secured from Deripaska .
On a day of extreme political danger for Osborne , Rothschild , a regular fundraiser for the Conservatives , revealed he was willing to go to court to prove his claim that Osborne had not only wanted to secure a donation from the Russian , but had been party to discussions as to how this could be made legal .
Rothschild claimed Osborne had been present when the party 's chief executive and fundraiser , Andrew Feldman , had suggested the money could be channelled through LDV , a British firm owned by Deripaska .
It is not illegal to accept a donation from a registered UK company , but could be in breach of section 61 of the 2000 political parties law to enter into or " act in furtherance of " an arrangement which disguised an overseas donation .
In his detailed statement last night , Osborne insisted that at no point did he or Feldman " suggest ways of channelling a donation " .
Rothschild , an old and close friend of Osborne 's , went public after he became enraged at the way in which the shadow chancellor had abused his hospitality .
He was furious that Osborne breached confidences about his conversations with Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , while the politicians were private guests at Rothschild 's luxury Corfu villa in August .
Osborne has been seen as the source of malicious newspaper stories that Mandelson had " dripped poison " about Gordon Brown in private conversations , and also that Mandelson held potentially controversial meetings with Deripaska on his £ 18 m yacht , moored near the villa of Rothschild , a friend and business partner of Deripaska .
On a day when some of the biggest political reputations at Westminster were at stake , it became clear that Rothschild , the son of the merchant banker Lord Rothschild , was so infuriated by Osborne 's discourtesy that he was prepared to wreck their friendship .
This prompted Tory claims that Mandelson , bent on revenge , must have manipulated Rothschild into causing Osborne such political embarrassment .
At lunchtime yesterday , Osborne issued a limited denial of Rothschild 's claims by saying he had not solicited money from Deripaska , and no money had been taken .
" We did not ask for any money , we did not receive any , " he said .
Sources close to Rothschild immediately insisted this limited denial obscured the fact that Osborne and Feldman had enthusiastically discussed the possibility of securing the donation from Deripaska .
Rothschild accepts there was no direct conversation with the Russian , but says the Conservatives had discussed the issue with him .
By mid-afternoon , Osborne issued a fuller statement , admitting he had met Deripaska four times in one weekend in Corfu , and that in the presence of Rothschild , Feldman and two other witnesses he had indeed discussed a donation from Deripaska .
But he portrayed Rothschild as the initiator of the discussion .
Osborne said that , in the discussion on the terrace of the villa , " Rothschild suggested to Feldman that his friend Mr Deripaska could be interested in making a donation . "
Osborne 's account continued : " Feldman at this point made clear there are very strict rules on donations to political parties in the UK .
Feldman explained a political donation is only lawful if you appear as an individual on the UK electoral roll , or if the donation comes from a legitimate UK trading company . "
At this point , according to Osborne 's account , " Rothschild said that Mr Deripaska owned UK trading companies including Leyland DAF " , a Midlands - based vehicle firm .
He insisted " there was no discussion about how a donation could be concealed or channelled " .
If a donation had come from the Leyland DAF board , ordered by Deripaska , it would have been arguable whether it was lawful since the company might have been acting as an agent for a foreign donor .
After the discussion at the villa , Rothschild arranged for Osborne and Feldman to go aboard Deripaska 's yacht in his company , but Osborne insists no discussion of a donation occurred at this one - hour meeting , even though Feldman , the party 's chief fundraiser and an old schoolfriend of Cameron's , was present .
Allies of Rothschild 's appeared last night to corroborate this account .
Osborne insists he had no further conversations on a donation , but he says Rothschild suggested in a phone call on September 18 with Feldman that Leyland DAF was interested in making a donation .
According to the Tory account , Feldman at this point considered whether such a donation would be appropriate and after discussion with party officials decided it would not be , so ending the possibility .
Allies of Deripaska 's weighed in against Osborne 's implication that he initiated talks , saying the billionaire " has never donated to any political party in Britain and he has no intention of doing so " .
Last night Rothschild further challenged details of Osborne 's version of events , saying he had discussed the possibility of a donation from the oligarch via DAF with Osborne before they met Deripaska .
In further conflict with Osborne 's story , he said the issue of a donation was again raised in talk on Deripaska 's yacht .
After the meeting on the yacht , Rothschild claims the subject was raised again over dinner and " Osborne was interested in whether and how such a donation could be secured " .
He also claims the Tories were still interested when he raised the issue with Feldman in September .
Rothschild said : " I was left with the impression the Conservative party remained interested . "
He added that another guest at his villa , James Goodwin , a consultant , was willing to corroborate his account .
Friends of Rothschild 's last night defended his behaviour , and his decision to stand by Mandelson , a friend for 10 years , rather than Osborne , his older friend and closer political ally .
One said : " There is a long history in British politics in which people from other political parties meet and discuss the state of their parties and remain discreet about it .
He [ Rothschild ] is doubly angry in that his mother had been funding Osborne 's office for years . "
Cameron fully backed Osborne , who may yet face questioning for failing to declare he and his family had stayed at Rothschild 's villa .
He said : " At no point did he ask for any money and the Conservative party did n't receive any money .
That is the absolutely vital point . "
In his letter to the shadow chancellor , MacShane asks a series of questions about Osborne the series of events in Corfu .
The MP demands to know :
• if Osborne had a conversation with Rothschild about a donation to the Conservative party ,
• if Osborne arranged for Feldman to meet with Deripaska ,
• if a further discussion took place with Rothschild about a donation ,
• if Osborne knew that Deripaska was a Russian national and any donation had to be made by a UK company ,
• if Osborne was involved in a discussion about Leyland DAF ,
• if Osborne made a follow - up phone call to Rothschild to check on whether such a contribution would be made , and
• if Osborne would confirm that it was Deripaska who decided he did not want to make a donation .
In response , a Conservative spokesman said : " The prime minister 's statement in the Commons and Denis MacShane 's letter are a desperate attempt to keep this story going .
All the questions raised in Denis MacShane 's letter are dealt with in yesterday 's statement from George Osborne and Andrew Feldman .
" The person who has n't answered any questions is Peter Mandelson , who should immediately set out a detailed account of his numerous dealings with Mr Deripaska . "
( Natural News ) Women who are deficient in vitamin D at the time they are diagnosed with breast cancer are nearly 75 percent more likely to die from the disease than women with sufficient vitamin D levels , and their cancer is twice as likely to spread to other parts of the body .
" This study links vitamin D with the aggressiveness of disease , " said JoEllen Walsh of the University of Albany , who was not involved in the study .
" It suggests that your vitamin D status may affect how your disease progresses .
" A number of prior studies have strongly demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of developing cancers of the breast , colon , esophagus , pancreas and prostate , and perhaps others .
But until now , no study has looked at how vitamin D levels affect the progress of any cancer .
Between 1989 and 1995 , researchers tested the blood of 512 women who had been newly diagnosed with breast cancer .
All the breast cancer cases were localized , meaning the disease had not spread beyond the breast and armpit region .
The average participant age was 50 .
Fifteen percent of the women with healthy vitamin D levels died from their cancer , and 17 percent had their cancers metastasize , or spread to other organs .
In contrast , 26 percent of the vitamin D - deficient women died , and 31 percent had cancer that metastasized .
This translated into a 73 percent higher risk of death among women who were vitamin D deficient , and a 94 percent higher risk of the cancer spreading .
Among a third group of women , classified as not deficient in the vitamin but still falling short of optimal blood levels , there was no difference in cancer death rates .
Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more common among women with a higher body weight .
According to study author Pamela Goodwin of Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Toronto , this is because " fat tissue acts as a trap for vitamin D . " " Levels were also lower in younger women , " she said , " which was a bit of a surprise , until we realized older women were taking more supplements .
" Women who were premenopausal or had high insulin levels were also more likely to be deficient in vitamin D. Only 24 percent of the women involved in the study had vitamin D levels considered healthy , while 37.5 percent were considered deficient and the remaining 38.5 percent fell in between .
" This study found that vitamin D deficiency is very common among women with breast cancer , and it suggests that vitamin D deficiency is linked to poorer outcomes in these women , " said Nancy Davidson , director of the breast cancer program at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
Goodwin recommended that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer should take a simple blood test to determine their body 's vitamin D levels .
"
If you 're a woman with breast cancer , it 's probably worthwhile having vitamin D levels checked .
If they 're deficient , they should take more to get it in the range that we think is beneficial , " she said .
" This study is significant because it tells us this may be one thing women can do to improve their prognosis , " said Anne McTiernan of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center .
Even with strong evidence that vitamin D can help prevent - and , in the current study , fight off - various cancers , researchers are still unclear on the mechanism by which the chemical works .
" We know from basic science studies that breast cancer cells have vitamin D receptors and can interact with vitamin D , " Goodwin said .
Some scientists have suggested that the nutrient might play a role in regulating programmed cell death , without which cells can turn cancerous .
" Vitamin D is pretty unique in its action in that it does enter the cancer cells and induces them to undergo a cell death process , " Walsh said .
" The effects of vitamin D on breast cancer cells are very similar to the established drug Tamoxifen that many women take for breast cancer .
"
In a demonstration for ABC News , Walsh added vitamin D to a breast cancer culture , causing the cells to shrivel up and die .
Breast cancer cells are not the only cells with vitamin D receptors .
In fact , nearly every cell in the body interacts with the vitamin in some way .
Vitamin D , technically a hormone , is synthesized by the body upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight .
It can also be acquired from certain dietary sources , including grains and dairy , which are fortified with it in many countries , or via supplements .
The average light - skinned person can produce all the vitamin D he needs from about 15 minutes a day of sunlight on the face and hands , while it takes about twice as long for a darker skinned person .
But at far northern latitudes , especially during the winter , there may not be enough sunlight for the body to produce sufficient quantities .
Daily vitamin D recommendations vary widely by country , with the United States and Canada recommending 200 IU per day for children and 400 IU for adults .
But many researchers , and even the Canadian Cancer Society , have recommended that this value be raised to 1,000 IU per day .
While 400 IU may be sufficient to maintain bone health , scientists say , higher levels are needed to provide cancer - fighting benefits .

Perhaps Simone Racheli does n't even know that bacon scarves are a craze and that the bacon scarf designers wish that their creations looked as realistic as Racheli 's sculptures .
What he has created , though , are sculptures of inanimate objects , that have animal ( and human ) insides , like fat , meat , guts , bones ...
And , like animals prepared for consumption , their skins have been removed .
On display at the Paola Maria Deanesi Gallery in Northern Italy , these full - size ( dare I write life - size ? ) sculptures of every day items are an interesting portrayal of Racheli 's views on the human and animal condition , which I will not speculate upon .
Racheli used several different materials to create each sculpture , but no animal or human byproducts .
1. Telaio Bicicletta Sculpture , 2006
The Bicycle Frame , with no shiny chrome coating , only bacon !
Made of metal , wax , and paper mache .
The Bicycle Frame sculpture is about 4 feet long and 30 inches high .
2. Frullino Sculpture , 2006
My first impression was of a rabbit , but this is a food Mixer made of metal , wax , and paper mache .
The Mixer is exposed , without bright plastic or chrome , but very detailed inner workings , measures almost full - size ... about 10 by 7 inches .
3. The Poltrana Sculpture , 2006
The Chair , made of cellulose fiber , paper mache , and wax .
Yes , it 's full size , but I 'm not sure you can sit on it .
The Chair has enough surface to make it really look like a large skinned animal .
4. Ferro da Stiro Sculpture , 2006
The Iron is mostly paper mache and wax , but plastic rounds with holes for the steam add realism to the Iron 's function .
Fully sized , as well .
5 . The Water Closet Sculpture , 2006
Racheli actually titled this sculpture in English with the British phrase for toilet - Water Closet .
Again , it 's life - size , but how much weight a paper mache sculpture holds ... well , I do n't know .
What is the Water Closet holding on it's rear portion ?
I assume that it is supposed to be the tank of the toilet , but nude as it is , the figure looks like a chicken or other fowl .
6. Asciugacapelli Sculpture , 2006
The Hairdryer , made with the smallest bit of plastic , plus paper mache and wax , looks like a large thigh bone of a turkey , with its surplus skin folded up .
To many , Simone Racheli's " meat sculpture " are works of ridicule , but I do n't think they were intended to be funny or part of the " what can be made of bacon " craze .
That 's my opinion , of course .

Morningstar is reporting , France To Buy 30,000 Planned Homes To Boost Building Business .
President Nicolas Sarkozy , grappling with the global financial crisis , has decided to directly support the French construction industry by buying 30,000 homes waiting to be built , the presidential palace said Wednesday .
" So that current property programs can be successfully concluded , the president ... has decided to intervene directly , ordering the purchase at discounted prices of houses on which building work has not yet begun , " a statement said .
This move will initially cover 30,000 homes , and by ensuring that they will be built , the decision will support the homebuilding industry , it said .

Homes in foreclosure process set another record
Sept. 5 , 2008
The rate of mortgages entering foreclosure hit another record high in the second quarter , as did the percentage of loans somewhere in the foreclosure process , the Mortgage Bankers Association reported on Friday .
The delinquency rate , a measure of mortgages with at least one overdue payment but are n't in foreclosure , also was the highest ever recorded in the 39 - year history of the MBA 's quarterly survey .
Increases in foreclosures seen in California and Florida overshadow improvements seen in states including Texas , Massachusetts and Maryland , he said .
Only eight states -- Nevada , Florida , California , Arizona , Michigan , Rhode Island , Indiana and Ohio -- had rates of foreclosure starts that were above the national average , Brinkmann said in a telephone interview .
That " is an indicator that this is not equally distributed across the country , " he said .
California and Florida alone accounted for 39 % of all of the foreclosures started nationally during the second quarter .
Together , the two states made up 73 % of the increase in foreclosures between the first and second quarters , according to the MBA .
" The worst states are getting worse , " Brinkmann said , noting that overbuilding occurred in California and Florida , and their numbers will continue to drive the national ones .
Those states , he added , also are the two with the most mortgage loans outstanding .
Altogether , more than 9 % of mortgage loans are either delinquent or somewhere in the foreclosure process , Brinkmann said .
The percentage of loans that went into foreclosure in the second quarter was 1.08 % , up from 1.01 % in the first quarter and 0.59 % a year ago .
Meanwhile , 2.75 % of loans in the survey were somewhere in the foreclosure process , up from 2.47 % last quarter and 1.4 % in the second quarter of 2007 .
The delinquency rate was 6.41 % of all loans outstanding , according to the survey .
The rate was 6.35 % in the first quarter , and 5.12 % a year ago .
But Brinkmann pointed out that the overall delinquency rate was driven by loans that were 90 days or more past due -- and by those that were in California and Florida .
The 30 - day delinquency rate was below levels seen in 2002 , he said .
The delinquency breakdown supports the argument that the foreclosures are being driven by housing fundamentals as opposed to economic issues such as job losses , he said .
Drops in home prices seem to be driving the transition between a loan that is delinquent and one that goes into the foreclosure process .
The survey covers 45 million loans on one to four unit residential properties , representing between 80 to 85 % of all first - lien residential mortgage loans outstanding in the country .
Loans in the survey were reported by about 120 lenders .

What About Jobs ?

Wenn Sie Geld haben , welches Sie in absehbarer Zeit benötigen , macht es Sinn dieses anzulegen .
Dadurch sind größere Geldbeträge von Ihrem Girokonto getrennt , was eine gewisse Sicherheit bietet .
Das angelegte Geld , sofern
Sie eine sinnvolle Anlage gewählt haben , hat gleichzeitig gute Chancen sich zu vermehren .
Doch die klassischen Geldanlagen wie Sparbücher oder Aktien Fonds bringen nur selten gute Zinsen , bzw .
sind mit einem hohen Risiko verbunden .
Interessanter ist es deshalb sich nach Alternativen Anlagemöglichkeiten umzusehen – und diese können sehr vielfältig sein .
Edelmetalle , Wertgegenstände , Sammelobjekte und andere Alternativen
Die bekannteste Alternative Geldanlage ist diejenige in Edelmetalle .
Insbesondere Gold , Platin und Silber sind als Anlagemetalle bekannt , jedoch sind sie weder die seltensten , noch die wertvollsten Edelmetalle .
Das vielleicht interessanteste Anlagemetall auf dem Markt ist kristallines Osmium .
Es wird in Form unterschiedlich geformter Scheiben und Ringe verkauft .
Während Platin rund 30 EUR pro Gramm kostet , liegt Osmium bei über 800 EUR , wobei der Wert seit Jahren stetig steigt .
Neben Edelmetallen sind auch Edelsteine eine gute Anlagemöglichkeit .
Insbesondere der Diamant in Form des reinen Einkaräters wird als Geldanlage genutzt .
Wenn
Sie jedoch eine etwas ausgefallenere Alternative suchen , dann sind farbige Diamanten noch besser geeignet , da manche Farben um ein Vielfaches seltener sind und die Nachfrage für die Verwendung in einzigartigen Schmuckstücken weiter steigt .
Diese recht kreative alternative Geldanlage führt letet zu weiteren Möglichkeiten Ihr Geld anzulegen über .
Die Investition in Häuser und Grundstücke ist nicht unbekannt und hat letztlich eine Sache mit bunten Diamanten gemein : es handelt sich um ideelle Werte .
Selbstverständlich kann jeder Gegenstand von einem Experten auf einen bestimmten
Wert beziffert werden , doch wie viel Geld Sie beim Verkauf dafür tatsächlich erhalten , hängt letztlich von den Vorstellungen des Käufers ab .
Sammelobjekte und Bücher
Dadurch bietet sich Ihnen die Möglichkeit in nahezu jeden Gegenstand zu investieren , von dem Sie überzeugt sind , dass sein Wert langfristig steigt , oder Sie anderweitig später daran verdienen können .
Insbesondere bei Sammelobjekten besteht die Möglichkeit , dass ihr Wert im Laufe der Jahre deutlich steigt .
Ein Beispiel hierfür können Bücher und insbesondere Comicbücher sein .
Hier zählt der Erhaltungszustand und durch die Tatsache , dass mit der Zeit Exemplare verloren gehen , werden die übrig gebliebenen und gut erhaltenen Stücke seltener und wertvoller .
Auch Autos , wie etwa Oldtimer können eine ähnliche Variante dieser alternativen Geldanlage darstellen .
Beim Anlegen auch an den Weiterverkauf denken !
Wenn
Sie eine solche Geldanlage in Erwägung ziehen , dann sollten Sie auf ihre Eigenheiten achten .
Bereits die Anlage in Osmium ist problematischer als bei Aktien , denn das weltweite Handelsvolumen ist so gering , dass Sie dieses Metall nicht über eine Bank beziehen können .
Auch die anderen Alternativen werden außerhalb von Banken und Börsen gehandelt und es ist unverzichtbar , dass Sie sich mit dem jeweiligen Gegenstand auskennen .
Der Markt für Sammelobjekte kann klein und der Weiterverkauf schwierig sein .
Letztlich müssen manche Wertgegenstände gepflegt werden , damit ihr Wert erhalten bleibt und steigt .
Mein Fazit
Neben den klassischen Geldanlagen , wie sie von Banken angeboten werden , gibt es eine nahezu endlose Anzahl von Alternativen .
Neben seltenen Edelmetallen und Immobilien besteht die Möglichkeit in eine endlose Bandbreite von Wertgegenständen zu investieren .

After all these years , believe it or not , it was my first appearance on Amy Goodman 's Democracy Now !
this morning .
I was happy to appear along with my friend Harvey Wasserman of the great Columbus Free Press to discuss our many concerns about Election Day 2008 , touch - screen vote - flipping , voter roll purging , and the woeful effort by the DNC and Obama Campaign to take steps to correct these enormous problems .
So happy , in fact , that I almost did n't mind waking up at 4 am to do the show .
Almost .
I hope you 'll not mind the fuzzy webcam I had to use from my dark , pre-dawn cave this morning during my appearance .
The video follows in three parts , the text transcript is here ...

I am sick to death of the Democratic Convention and all that they have brought to the table in their feeble attempt to show that they are worth considering in this election .
They have dodged the questions about the loss of our civil liberties , proposed different battlefields instead of ending these wars that have destroyed America�s credibility and wrecked our economy .
In this war of words for the votes that will put them in power , these Democrats have failed to address the true concerns of those whom they court .
They have played the corporate controlled media games that are supposed to enable the American people to become a �knowledgeable , well - informed electorate� .
This has resulted in the nomination of people that don�t have the American peoples� best interests at heart .
The truth is that the Convention in Denver shows us how gullible and na�ve the majority of Democrats really are .
It sickens me to see tears streaming down the faces of people that honestly believe that the first African - American to seek the nation�s highest office is something grand , something that will help heal the scars of racial intolerance and bigotry .
While the nomination of an African - American is long overdue , to see these people put their dreams and aspirations into the hands of a corporate controlled , shameless sociopath that has turned his back on old friends and colleagues in order to seek higher office is enough to put tears on the face of many Americans .
The tears I speak of are not the tears that come from joy and hope , but they are tears of anger and disillusionment that come from seeing how this man can use the hope of the people�s desire for change , into a tool that he can wield to suit his own agenda .
What is that agenda ?
I don�t believe that there is anyone that can answer that question .
I don�t believe that Mr. Obama can answer that question himself .
In the beginning of this , during the primaries , he seemed to desire and end to America�s military adventure in Iraq that have caused , directly and indirectly , the deaths of over 1.2 million Iraqi men , women and children .
We see that now he wants to shift the war to Afghanistan and increase the size of the military by 65,000 soldiers .
Where is the peace candidate that debated with the likes of Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel along with Chris Dodd ?
Was this just a tactic ?
If this was just a tactic , should the Democrats that believed in his rhetoric forgive him because he did it out of political expediency and that this is �just how the game is played � ?
In fact , is this just all a big game , a kind of national spectacle that we participate in every four years just so we can pretend that we actually have the power to change this nation�s direction ?
Let me take a moment to address the questions that haven�t been asked .
Whether these questions should have been asked or not , I�ll leave up to you .
I put these questions before you in the hope that you may find them important as to the direction that we as a people find ourselves heading .
�
Will there be an investigation into the numerous signing statements and the Presidential Directives that George W. Bush used during his presidency to determine whether or not they were legal , and will Mr. Obama ask that Bush be prosecuted if it is found that he violated the law ?
Will the use of weapons of war such as napalm , white phosphorus , cluster bombs and depleted uranium by our military against civilian targets be investigated to determine if International Law and treaty obligations were violated ?
Will the Executive Branch review The Military Commissions Act of 2006 , The John Warner Defense Bill ( the re-vamped Innsurection Act that does away with posse comitatus ) , the revamped FISA Bill and the Patriot Acts to determine if they are Constitutional ?
Will a criminal investigation into the events of 9/11 be conducted ?
Will the investigation into the outing of CIA covert agent Valerie Plame be continued ?
Will there be an investigation of �extraordinary rendition � and allegations of torture that have been leveled at the CIA and other intelligence agencies ?
If it is determined that U.S. and / or International Laws have been broken or circumvented , will there be prosecutions for the violators ?
Will there be an investigation into the allegations of the charges that Iraq held Weapons of Mass Destruction prior to the invasion of that country by the U.S. ?
If it is determined that the Executive Branch knew that they did not exist and used this as a pretense for the invasion and the war that followed , will the people responsible for these violations and those that covered it up be prosecuted ?
Will allegations of voter fraud in the last presidential election be investigated ?
Will this administration review any charges of voter fraud or try to find new ways to combat it ?
In the latest crisis in Georgia , the mainstream press reported for weeks afterwards that the Russians invaded Georgia without provocation .
We have now learned that it was Georgia that invaded South Ossetia that started the conflict .
Will Obama look into why the media in the United States either cannot get the true facts out to the people or why many events that occur in the world are not reported on by the American media ?
Will your administration look into lost funds , overspending and no-bid contracts given to corporations linked to the Bush administration ?
If wrongdoing is found will you authorize prosecutions for the law - breakers ?
These are just a few questions that come to mind .
I�m sure there are others that many people have that have not been asked by the media .
Why don�t we hear the questions about how the Bill of Rights has been stripped away from Americans since this � Global War on Terror� started ?
Who is the Federal government at war with exactly , is it us , the American people ?
How many more of our freedoms will be given away to this new breed of corporate shills that have infiltrated every branch of government ?
Why must they be allowed to wiretap and spy on us ?
Who exactly are they worried about and why ?
Ruby Ridge , Waco , and even the false allegations that allowed the FDLS raids in Texas and numerous other assaults on Americans have been taking place , yet everyone turns a blind eye to the bypassing of our Constitutional rights in order not to be singled out as a �dissenter� .
Deny constitutional rights to some , and you deny them to all .
No -fly lists and enemies� lists are kept secret from the people .
This is not just a small by product of �keeping the American people safe� , this is a war declared against our right to protest and to demand accountability from our government .
When a nominee for the highest office in the land is not asked questions about the loss of our freedoms , when our press no longer holds them responsible for doing anything about it , then it�s time we replaced that press .
The media that represents a free press should not be controlled by the same corporate interests that also control our elected officials .
That is the very definition of a fascist government .
Sinclair Lewis said that � When fascism comes to America , it will be draped in the flag and be carrying the cross� .
This statement unfortunately comes very close to the truth .
The American people have a large task in front of them if they wish to stop this slide into a fascist police state that looms large before us .
Waving the flag and cheering on the Democrats and Republicans that have been complicit in moving us in that direction will only reinforce their belief that we are incapable of critical thought and therefore true dissent .
We can continue to turn a blind eye to the treacherous game these people are playing with us and wait until our lives become regulated beyond what we can endure and revolt in a bloody struggle , or we can wake up from our slumber now and strip them of these powers that they have managed to gain through fear and deceit .
This is something we must decide , and decide we must .
We can either reform this government through the ballot box by rejecting both major corporate - funded and corporate controlled political parties by voting for Cynthia McKinney ( the only candidate with ballot access an almost every State ) , or wait can wait until the boot of oppression becomes unbearable .
This is the choice we have in this election cycle .
UPDATE : I waited to publish this until after Senator Obama gave his acceptance speech in Denver .
While he gave a rousing speech about caring for each other , and talked about economic freedoms and flatly contested the Republican mantra of the �trickle down economic theory� , he repeated the media lie about “ Russian Aggression ” , pandering to the right when he knows that it was not Russia that started the conflict .
If they had wanted Georgia , they would have taken Georgia !
He did not mention our loss of civil liberties .
He did not touch upon the draconian laws passed during the Bush administrations war on the Constitution ; in fact he never mentioned the document at all .
We must either make him incorporate this loss of our civil liberties , or vote for Cynthia McKinney who does .
There is no big choice here , either we want our freedoms restored , or we don�t .
We don�t owe Barack Obama or the Democrats our loyalty because they are not the Republicans , rather they must earn OUR loyalty because we are the people that will or will not put them in office .
The choice is Obama�s to make .

New research , reported this week in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , finds that coal burning , primarily in North America and Europe , contaminated the Arctic and potentially affected human health and ecosystems in and around Earth 's polar regions .
The study , titled " Coal Burning Leaves Toxic Heavy Metal Legacy in the Arctic , " was conducted by the Desert Research Institute ( DRI ) , Reno , Nev. and partially funded by the National Science Foundation .
Detailed measurements from a Greenland ice core showed pollutants from burning coal -- the toxic heavy metals cadmium , thallium and lead - - were much higher than expected .
The catch , however , was the pollutants were n't higher at the times when researchers expected peaks .
Records taken from a Greenland ice core showed pollution from coal burning in North America and Europe that traveled through the atmosphere and deposited in the Arctic Region was higher 100 years ago , confounding researcher expectations that pollution was at its peak in the 1960s and ' 70s .
This image is of an ice core sample sitting on a melter head in the research facility .
The longitudinal ice core sample falls by gravity onto the heated melter plate and the melt water split into three streams by grooves etched into the melter head .
Only the inner most 10 percent of the melt water is used for ultra - trace elemental measurements .
The middle 20 percent used for major ions and particle size determinations .
The potentially contamined outer 70 percent of the melt water is discarded .

" Conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and ‘ 70s , the peak of industrial activity in Europe and North America and certainly before implementation of Clean Air Act controls in the early 1970s , " said Joe McConnell , lead researcher and director of DRI 's Ultra - Trace Chemistry Laboratory .
" But it turns out pollution in southern Greenland was higher 100 years ago when North American and European economies ran on coal , before the advent of cleaner , more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas - based economies , " McConnell said .
In fact , the research showed pollutants were two to five times higher at the beginning of the previous century than today .
Pollution levels in the early 1900s also represented a 10 - fold increase from preindustrial levels .
Continuous , monthly and annually averaged pollution records taken from the Greenland ice core dating from 1772 - 2003 produced the results .
And although data showed heavy - metal pollution in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic is substantially lower today than a century ago , McConnell and his research partner , Ross Edwards , an associate research professor at DRI , said there is still cause for concern .
" Contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal - driven growth of Asian economies , " they wrote in the report .
They argued the consequence may be greater risk to the food chain as toxic heavy metals from industrial activities in Asian nations are transported through the atmosphere and deposited in the polar regions .
Food chain contamination through toxic metal absorption from both the environment and from consumption of contaminated food sources could make its way to humans , who feed on long - lived land and marine animals such as caribou , seals and whale .
" Impacts on human health in the Arctic region have n't been determined , " said McConnell .
But he suggested cleaner burning coal technologies , or better yet reduced reliance on coal burning , may head off the potential problem .
