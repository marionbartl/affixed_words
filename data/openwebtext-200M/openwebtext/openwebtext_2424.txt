JERUSALEM  Israeli authorities on Monday expelled Richard Falk , a United Nations investigator of human rights in the Palestinian territories , saying he was unwelcome because of what the government has regarded as his hostile position toward Israel .
Mr. Falk , an American , arrived in Israel on Sunday .
He was held at the airport and placed on the first available flight back to Geneva , his point of departure .
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Falk had been informed in advance that his entry would be barred .
Mr. Falk was not immediately available for comment .
Mr. Falk , a professor of international law at Princeton , has the title of United Nations Human Rights Council special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories .
He has long been criticized in Israel for what many Israelis say are unfair and unpalatable views .
He has compared Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians to Nazi atrocities and has called for more serious examination of the conspiracy theories surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks .
Pointing to discrepancies between the official version of events and other versions , he recently wrote that “ only willful ignorance can maintain that the 9/11 narrative should be treated as a closed book . ”

November 14 , 2008
— Forty three years ago , Charles J. Byrne , a Bellcomm , Inc. engineer , became concerned about NASA 's plans to archive the data to be sent from a series of Moon mapping precursor missions to the Apollo lunar landings .
The Lunar Orbiter telemetry , which just two years and five unmanned missions later would account for imagery of 99 percent of the Moon , was originally planned by the space agency to be recorded on photographic film only .
The five orbiters themselves would carry the equipment to develop their film and then scan it for transmission back to Earth .
Once there , it would then be reprinted in strip form to then be manually re-assembled and re-photographed for study .
Anyone who has used a copy machine to make a copy of a copy knows that resolution is lost in the process .
The same was true for Lunar Orbiter , though for NASA , which needed quicker access to the data than computers of that day were able to provide , the resulting images would be what they needed to evaluate landing locations for Apollo .
Still , thought Byrne , there would be value to having a tape back - up , so he outlined his idea for a Lunar Orbiter DVR - like system in a July 1965 memo .
" It is concluded that the ability to fully optimize the later site survey missions on the basis of early Lunar Orbiter data depends on an immediate decision to provide tape recorders , " wrote Byrne .
An AMPEX FR - 900 recorder ( left ) is used at Goldstone .
( NASA )
NASA agreed and AMPEX FR - 900 2 - inch analog tape recorders were positioned at the Goldstone , California , Madrid , Spain and Castle Island ( Woomera ) , Australia tracking stations to record all the images from the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft .
Byrne had referenced " later site survey missions " in his memo .
What he did n't know -- what he could n't know then -- was how much later those tapes would come back into use .
Earthrise and the sun sets on Lunar Orbiter
Though Lunar Orbiter was quickly overshadowed by the manned Apollo missions , they did accomplish a number of firsts .
The spacecraft captured the first high resolution global map of the Moon , the first stereo imagery of the surface , and the first images of the Earth from the Moon .
The latter was particularly noteworthy as it amounted to the spacecraft 's controllers turning Lunar Orbiter 1 away from the surface to take what was essentially an artistic shot .
The black and white image was quick to capture the public 's attention .
" There are two pictures that are iconic for somebody my age , " said Keith Cowing , who was 11 at the time of Lunar Orbiter 1 .
" One is what LIFE magazine called the ' view of the century ' which is the oblique shot of Copernicus crater taken by Lunar Orbiter 2 as I recall , and it was the picture of the century because up until then , I had never seen a sideways view of a mountain inside a crater on the Moon , nor had anybody else .
That struck me that it was a world like Earth .
It was almost like listening to what Galileo said about the fancible mountains of the Moon .
This be the mountain ! "
" And the other one of course , is earthrise , Earth rising above the surface of the Moon , " continued Cowing in an interview with collectSPACE .
" At the time , all the photos were either television or photographs that had been sent back and they were murky . "
Lunar Orbiter 's Earthrise , as originally released .
( NASA / LPI )
" Very shortly thereafter , we landed on the Moon and there were the ghostly images of people walking on the Moon . "
That astronauts landed safely and explored the surface meant that the Lunar Orbiters had done their job .
With the Apollo program coming to a close and without a pressing need for the Lunar Orbiter data , NASA put the tapes into storage , first in Maryland and then in the mid-1980s they were moved to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
That 's where they came under the care of Nancy Evans , co-founder of the NASA Planetary Data System ( PDS ) .
Evans , working with Mark Nelson of Caltech , began a project to obtain surplus FR - 900 tape drives , refurbish them , and digitize the Lunar Orbiter analog data on the tapes .
They were successful in so much that they were able to obtain the tape drives and get them running , but without funding the project folded .
By the early 1990s , Evans had retired from JPL , taking with her the government - surplused drives in the hope of finding private funding to continue the project she began .
A " cool little project "

Unfortunately , the money would never materialize and Evans moved on to her second career as a veterinarian .
Nearly two decades would pass while the drives sat in her garage , collecting dust .
Approaching a second retirement in 2007 , Evans began searching for someone to take the drives and do something with them .
Dennis Wingo , author of " Moonrush : Improving Life on Earth with the Moon 's Resources " and the president of the aerospace engineering company SkyCorp , Inc. , was intrigued .
" In the spring of 2007 , Dennis Wingo sent me a note saying , ' I found this posting on some internet board where someone says there are all these Lunar Orbiter tapes and someone apparently tried to get data off of them years ago ' , " described Cowing , who runs SpaceRef Interactive .
Cowing was intrigued but skeptical .
" I said , ' Is this really worth doing ? ' " he admitted .
Wingo explained , recalled Cowing , the way in which the original Lunar Orbiter images were processed and how that resulted in a loss of resolution .
Looking at the data now as it was released in 1966 , " we discovered , among other things , these things had done imaging of the poles .
The resolution was good , it could have been better , but again , all they had were photographs ... or photographs of photographs . "
The tapes being loaded for transport .
( LOIRP/MoonViews.com )
" We realized we could go get these tapes , we could go get these drives and if we can find a way to restore them , this would be a cool little thing to do , " shared Cowing .
After verifying that the tapes were accessible , arranging storage space with NASA 's Ames Research Center and insuring that the drives were more or less intact , Cowing invested his own money into renting a couple of trucks and he and Wingo set off through California to reunite the data with their recorders .
Moving into McMoon's
Cowing and Wingo needed a place to clean and restore the four refrigerator - size drives as well as sort through the 1,500 data reels .
" We really did n't need anything more than doors that locked and electricity , " explained Cowing .
" A workspace where if we messed it up with these drives and got it all dirty , no one would really care . "
Ames had a number of buildings in their research park that could work , including a former military barber shop and a recently - closed McDonald's .
" At the time we thought we might have to use some type of noxious cleaning and [ the McDonald 's ] had a ventilation fan , so we thought that would be perfect and there was a sink in the back with a big washing appartus .
There were shelves and it was available , so we said , ' why not ? ' , " said Cowing .
" We just jokingly call it McMoon 's , " he revealed .
" People to this day come up thinking it 's open .
They walk in and stand there , and we 've got all this electronic stuff laid out and they ask if they can get a hamburger .
It is a routine if you work there that someone comes up once a day . "
The drives inside McMoon 's . ( LOIRP/MoonViews.com )
Of course , not all visitors are unwelcome .
" We were able to get some smart , local kids to help us with the electronics and processing , " explained Cowing .
" It was n't so much that it was cheap , we felt we wanted to teach people at the same time . "
" Today , you do electronics and at the sub - scale of the electronics components , you can't even them without a microscope .
But with this stuff , you can actually see the resistors and capacitors and understand how these circuits work .
So , having these kids touching stuff that was built when their parents were in grammar school , alongside people who had been there , the object lesson was how things were done and this stuff works .
It 's big and heavy and noisy , but it works . "
And work it did .
After a good cleaning ( using the former McDonald 's dish sink ) and replacing parts by using two of the four drives as donors , the team after 99 days brought the 40 year old drive back to life .
" A lot of people thought this was impossible .
Things that are 40 years old do n't work , " recalled Cowing .
" I beg to differ .
I have a KLH Model 14 [ audio speaker ] that I just got and it works just fine . "
Re-discovering Earthrise
The next step was finding an example tape to run through the working drive .
The tapes were still inside their storage boxes .
" This is sort of like archeology .
These were probably last touched by people who are very dead and you can't call them up and ask , ' What did you mean by this ? ' " , Cowing observed .
As they opened and unpacked each box , care was given to retain any of the labels that accompanied them , even though they did not always understand the nomenclature .
" The image we found was found because of the process I put in place , " stated Cowing .
" If there were any tapes that were not like the others , I had them put it in this one spot and it turned out that there were multiple tapes that were ' best of ' tapes that , we think , were made a few years later [ after the originals ] . "
The data tapes inside McMoon 's . ( LOIRP/MoonViews.com )
Still , it took some experimentation to understand how the data was organized and what was on the tape .
" It was not unlike the scene from the movie ' Contact ' where they think they have a video signal but they are not sure and they sort of monkey with the gear and they plug things in and they say , ' Hey look !
That 's a video signal ' .
As they play with it further they suddenly say , ' Oh look , maybe we rotate it that way , flip the contrast , ' and they eventually find out they 've got a video signal and they 're sitting there and playing with it and ' Look , more data ! ' and that 's how it happened , " described Cowing .
" We went from , yes , we can confirm the heads play back the tapes and we do see a video signal to the signal conforms pretty much to what was in the documentation and then we now know how to do this and that . "
The team , now working under the title of the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project ( LOIRP ) , even found assistance by a chance visitor , Charles J. Byrnes .
Byrnes just happened to be attending a lunar conference at Ames when team members had just come across his 1965 memo .
Once discovering he was there , they invited him to McMoon's .
Their first real clue however , as to which image they were processing came from an audio track that accompanied the data .
The recording captured the voice of the tracking station operator , who mentioned seeing Earth .
Earthrise restored by the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project .
The center portion containing Earth has undergone a second level of processing to remove the ' framelet ' lines .
( NASA / LOIRP )
Processing the first few " framelets , " Cowing was able to eventually match the slices to those from the 1966 photo of Earthrise .
The improvement in quality was immediately apparent .
LOIRP 's digitized image was twice the raw resolution of the scanned film archived by the U.S. Geological Study , and that was using a copy of a tape , not the original .
The team had proven that their " cool little project " was worth doing .
NASA 's use for the " time machines "
Beyond being ' cool ' though , the LOIRP has the potential to contribute to NASA 's return to the Moon .
NASA is preparing to launch its Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter in 2009 , a modern day Lunar Orbiter to map the Moon in search of new landing sites and lunar resources .
LOIRP 's restoration of the Lunar Orbiter images to high resolution will provide the scientific community with a baseline to measure and understand changes that have occurred on the moon since the 1960s .
" This is a time machine , " said Cowing .
" It is reaching back into time and through history , bringing information forth .
We want everyone to see it . "
A " time machine " at work in McMoon 's . ( LOIRP/MoonViews.com )
As the images are processed , they will be submitted to the Planetary Data System , which NASA 's Space Science Mission Directorate in Washington sponsors in cooperation with NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
The images also will be calibrated with standard mapping coordinates from the U.S. Geological Survey 's Astrogeology Research Program in Flagstaff , Arizona .
Future images will be made publicly available when they are fully processed and calibrated .
" I feel personally that the interpretation of these images should be done by as broad a community as possible , " shared Cowing .
First though , the drives need further work .
" We have pretty much used these drives to the extent that they can be used without a full overhaul , " Cowing explained .
" That requires pulling the bearings out , dipping them in liquid nitrogen and that 's expensive , " he added .
To that end , NASA 's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and Innovative Partnerships Program Office has provided initial funding for the project .
" It 's a tremendous feeling to restore a 40 - year - old image and know it can be useful to future explorers , " said Gregory Schmidt , deputy director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute at Ames .
" Now that we 've demonstrated the capability to retrieve images , our goal is to complete the tape drives ' restoration and move toward retrieving all of the images on the remaining tapes . "
Yet again , one of the undersea cables that carry so much of the world 's Internet and telephone traffic has been severed , resulting in lost connections for Europe , Asia , and Africa .
According to the AP , the damage was done somewhere between Italy and Egypt in the Mediterranean , although what did the damage is unclear .
Many of us are now highly dependent on the Internet in our daily lives .
I know it 's essential for my job , and if reports in the medical literature are to be believed , more than a few of us might even be psychologically addicted to that steady stream of digital information .
Despite the Internet 's beginnings as a decentralized , nuclear war - proof data network , its global nature and the infrastructure that pipes it from continent to continent actually makes the whole thing fairly fragile ; a well placed fishing net or anchor and whole countries or even regions can be left back in the 1950s , when e-mail sounded like a guy 's name .
In 2007 , Vietnam found this out the hard way when some fishermen severed an undersea cable .
Earlier this year , internet cables feeding the Middle East were cut several times by cargo ships , although at the time the region 's press , which has always tended towards paranoia and conspiracy theories , seemed content to lay the blame at the feet of some undefined saboteurs .
Several cables were affected , namely FLAG FEA , SMW4 and SMW3 near Alexandria , Egypt , along with damage reported to the GO cable off the Sicilian coast .
France Telecom will be repairing the damage , but full service might not be reestablished until the beginning of the new year .
No ship has yet been identified as the culprit of this latest break , but given the increasing frequency of these cable accidents , perhaps it 's time that we started laying them away from busy shipping routes ?
Crisis on Main street : Joe Sixpack arrested
( ACPA - Biloxi ) Joe Sixpack was arrested earlier this afternoon , after urinating on a bank in Main Street , Biloxi .
Mr. Sixpack was very intoxicated and mistook the front window of the bank for the back wall .
Shocked customers had to be led away suffering convulsions , while Sixpack exchanged blows with local police .
In its biggest crisis to date , Main Street was completely shut down by the sudden turn of events .
Curious onlookers reported that Sixpack was blubbering , " Sarah , Sarah I 'm just tryin ' to shake things up baby , I 'm the only one who really fights for you , " as police wrestled him to the ground .
The incident was caught on a nearby traffic camera and is now a minor classic on the Internet .
In a statement to the press , Chief of Police Dwayne Preston confirmed that a Mr Joseph Tyler Sixpack will be charged with resisting arrest , public intoxication , and indecent exposure .
" My JT 's not usually like this , " pleaded his mother Sharlene to startled reporters .
" He just got carried away with all the attention that Palin woman has been puttin ' on him , he 's has n't had this much fame since he was on COPS . "
Sixpack , who has a long string of minor offenses to his name , faces up to 3 months behind bars if convicted , but his court appointed attorney hopes he " will be out in time to vote for Sarah . "
Currently on bail , Mr. Sixpack was last seen sitting on the stoop of his house throwing empty beers cans at reporters who tried to question him .
The irate voter was heard shouting , " git off ma property you sons a betchas and git yur hands off a ma cars , " at frightened newsmen from the New York Times , who were on their first foreign assignment .
Meanwhile Sarah Palin said that she had " heard there is a banking crisis on Main Street and John McCain and I intend to visit there to learn more because Main Street is very important to us . "

Severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) is an inherited disease sometimes known as ' Boy in the bubble syndrome ' , because the patient lacks one or more type of immune cell , making them very susceptible to infections .
Dik van Gent and colleagues , at Erasmus Medical Center , The Netherlands , have now identified a new genetic cause of SCID characterized by a lack of T cells and B cells ( T–B– SCID ) .
Specifically , they identified a patient with T–B– SCID who has a mutation in the gene DNA - PKcs .
Further analysis revealed the reason that the mutant DNA - PKcs protein generated as a result of the DNA - PKcs genetic mutation caused SCID : it was unable to activate another protein ( known as Artemis ) that is essential for the development of T cells and B cells .
Importantly , the mutant DNA - PKcs protein retained the ability to perform one of the main functions of normal DNA - PKcs protein ( a process known as kinase activity ) .
The authors therefore conclude that clinicians with patients who have T–B– SCID should consider the possibility that mutations in the gene DNA - PKcs might be the cause of disease , even in those individuals who have normal DNA - PKcs kinase activity .

I have recently become dissatisfied with the unit testing framework I was using : LIFT .
After reading Phil Gold ’s fairly comprehensive Common Lisp Testing Frameworks I decided to switch to Stefil .
So what ’s so wrong with LIFT ?
Whilst I do n’t want to detract from metabangs efforts , LIFT was annoying me enough that I was considering writing my own unit - testing framework !
No one wants YAUTF ( yet another unit testing framework ) , especially mine , so I went shopping .
I should also say that I ’m overjoyed with other metabang creations like bind and log5 but LIFT does n’t seem to elevate me much any more ( groan ) .
In my experience , your mileage might vary , LIFT seems slow for what it does .
Yes , my machine is a little old and beat - up but still , the unit - testing machinery should not be a significant burden to the unit testing process itself !
To illustrate this point look let ’s look at a highly subjective example .
Suppose I want to test the plain and simple truth , but I want to do it 10,000 times – I do this because I never take “ yes ” for an answer .
Here ’s a REPL snippet doing just that in LIFT
CL - USER > ( lift : deftestsuite test - lift ( ) ( ) ( : tests ( test - true ( lift: ensure t ) ) ) )
Start : TEST - LIFT #< Results for TEST - LIFT [ 1 Successful test ] > CL - USER > ( time ( loop for i from 1 to 10000 do ( lift:run - tests : suite ' test- lift ) ) ) Start : TEST - LIFT Start : TEST - LIFT < snip 9,997 lines ;>
Start : TEST - LIFT
Evaluation took : 4.029 seconds of real time 2.100131 seconds of user run time 0.076005 seconds of system run time [ Run times include 0.06 seconds GC run time . ]
0 calls to %EVAL 0 page faults and 60,780,256 bytes consed .
And then let ’s do the same for Stefil
CL - USER > ( stefil: defsuite * test - stefil ) #< test TEST - STEFIL > CL - USER > ( stefil : deftest test - true ( ) ( stefil : is t ) ) . < snip 9,997 lines ; > .
Evaluation took : 1.238 seconds of real time 0.932059 seconds of user run time 0.116008 seconds of system run time [ Run times include 0.357 seconds GC run time . ]
0 calls to %EVAL 0 page faults and 88,813,344 bytes consed .
Part of the slowness might be that LIFT prints “ Start : TEST - LIFT ” 10,000 times , but I did n’t dig any deeper .
LIFT seems slow when just running a handful of suites .
Apart from the slowness the output produced by LIFT is n’t really particularly useful , it ’s better than nothing , but I ca n’t really be sure of the testing progress within a suite .
Ideally I would just like to see some incremental idea of progress , and a single “ . ” per test and a new line after each suite , like Stefil does , is much cleaner .
Secondly , and this is the kicker , I find it difficult with LIFT to find out what went wrong and where .
Which is surely the whole point of unit -testing .
We expect stuff to fail and hunting down the causes of failure in LIFT is a bit tiresome via the inspector .
Conversely , Stefil supports test failures by dropping you straight into the debugger when an assertion fails .
Which is perfect because you can look at the code that caused the error , dig about in the source , fix it and continue the test .
This is a natural way to go about developing test driven software .
It also leverages the REPL making it a far more interactive experience .
The only snag is that this sort of behaviour is not always what you want if you want to run automated test & build environments .
Stefil provides a special variable * debug - on - assertion - failure * which registers the failure but does n’t drop you in the debugger .
It seems that LIFT does have a testing parameter break - on - error ?
however this only catches errors , but it probably also needs a break - on - assertion ?
as well .
Finally , Stefil just seems more concise & natural .
Since what we ’re doing here is creating functions that test other functions surely we should be able call tests like functions .
In my view classes are not the primary units of a test , functions are .
And so it is in Stefil because every suite & test are callable functions .
In LIFT you have to tell the function lift : run - test to find you a test / suite class with a specific name and then run it .
I did n’t want this blog entry to be a ‘ hatchet - job ’ on LIFT .
I do n’t want that because that ’s not constructive , and there ’s already too much way - too much ranting on the internet .
However , in the final analysis , LIFT could be made to be a lot better than it is .
Since the effort in switching was n’t really that great I decided to switch to Stefil rather than persevere and try to directly improve LIFT .

Liar — Rollins Band
Wonder why things are going so well
You want to know why ?
cause
Im a liar , yeah , Im a liar
Remember all the fun speculators had with stated - income loans ?
Loan documentation is
usually a routine part of obtaining financing .
Lenders ordinarily
require a borrower to provide documentation proving income , assets and
debt .
However , during the final stages of the Great Housing Bubble ,
loan documentation was seen as an unnecessary barrier to completing
more transactions , and loan programs which circumvented normal
documentation procedures flourished .
In short , liar loans were everywhere .
So are these people getting their comeuppance ?
No .
In fact , they are getting a second chance , and this time they get to lie about income in the other direction .
Let me explain .
So you stagger back home and wait for nothing
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back onto the streets
Everyone is doing loan modifications now : Citibank , the GSEs , everyone .
They must .
You saw in yesterday ’s post how destructive the upcoming wave of ARM resets is going to be , and the lenders know this .
They will do every loan workout they can to avoid more foreclosures .
Part of the loan workout requires the borrower to demonstrate they are unable to make payments , and their income is going to be used to figure out how much principal reduction and other loan terms the bank will adjust to accommodate them .
I think you can see where this is going …
All the people who exaggerated their incomes to obtain more house than they can afford , are now trying to look as poor as Church mice to get the biggest mortgage principal reduction they can : the reverse liar loan .
They lied to get in , now they get to lie in order to keep it .
We have a great system in place , do n’t you think ?
The problem is even bigger than that .
The whole loan modification process has built - in moral hazard that is going to burn lenders on a grand scale .
I received an email from a realtor friend ( yes , some realtors actually like me ) that had this story to tell :
A
friend of mine from college purchased a new home in Victorville for
around $ 450,000 .
At the same time many others in his neighborhood
purchased as well .
My friend and his neighbor were both paying their
mortgage .
However , his neighbor called his mortgage company requesting
a loan modification .
The mortgage company explained that he is not in
default and therefore they will not complete a loan modification .
My
friend ’s neighbor decided to quit paying his mortgage while he
continued to make payments on his four - wheeler , quad , and other toys
and make trips to the desert weekly .
He called the mortgage company
back a couple of months later and received a principle reduction of
circa $ 100,000 .
My friend , a very smart person , math thesis of the year
award winner in college , with a masters degree in math , vice principle
at a high school making excellent money , expresses to his neighbor that
he is upset that his home is worth $ 100,000 less than he paid for it ,
however his neighbor then explains that he received a $ 100,000
principle write down by not paying his mortgage and negotiating a loan
modification .
Stopping by his house a few weeks ago on the way back
from Las Vegas my friend explained this to me and said he thinks that
he is going to get a modification as well .
These loan modifications are going to cause a chain reaction through entire neighborhoods and communities .
Are you going to be the only one in your neighborhood who did n’t quit making payments in order to get a loan modification ?
It is really that simple : stop making payments , and you will get a loan modification .
Keep making payments , and you will not .
What is the morality of this ?
Is this wrong ?
The holder of your mortgage is offering to give you a great deal of free money if you stop making payments .
You are not forcing them ; they are freely offering the loan modifications to anyone who qualifies .
By not making a few payments , you qualify .
If Uncle Sam said to you that you must pay your full tax bill by April 15th , but if you are 90 days late , we will knock 1/3 off .
What would you do ?
Is it immoral to take the discount ?
The government ’s and the lender ’s response to this financial crisis is evolving from an irritating curiosity to a complete WTF - are - you - doing series of terrible missteps .
How much more wrong could they be ?
How much more damage are they going to do by trying to solve the problem ?
How much is this going to end up costing the rest of us ?
Is this where our $ 700,000,000,000 is going ?
Let them eat cake .
Today ’s featured property is a typical Irvine rollback .
The owner bought at the peak with an Option ARM , and now he is giving up and letting the property go .
Perhaps he should just do a loan modification and get $ 200,000 knocked off his mortgage …

Located in the desirable University Park community of Irvine , this
beautiful 4 bedroom , 3 bath family home combines a comfortable classic
exterior with an updated contemporary interior .
The totally remodeled
kitchen ( completed in 2007 ) includes custom maple cabinets w/ multiple
pull - outs , granite counter tops and back splash on a center bar with an
over - hang for casual dining , stainless steel counter tops w/ built - in
commercial style sink , DCS stainless steel 48 ′ natural gas range ,
double oven and an 1800 - cfm stainless steel hood .
The family room is
wired for surround sound , has a beverage service area , recessed
lighting and lots of storage space .
The formal living room has vaulted
ceilings , built - in book shelf , pre-wired speaker nooks and a marble
fireplace .
Add to that a new Trane central air - conditioning system with
dual drives for energy efficiency and a new Trane furnace with a fully
programable thermostat with touchscreen controls .
I really do n’t know what these owners are thinking .
This property was originally listed in July for $ 799,000 , and then it was pulled from the market .
It was relisted at a higher price in September ( must have been that huge rally we had ) , and now they have lowered the price back to the original asking price .
It is still too high .
If it was a reasonable price , they would have had offers months ago .
I guess losing a lot of money has affected their judgment .
This property was purchased at 9/8/2005 for $ 950,000 .
The owner used an Option ARM for $ 712,500 , a HELOC for $ 100,000 , and a downpayment of $ 137,500 .
They then spent a lot of money renovating the property and got another HELOC for $ 143,000 ( They probably paid off the other one ) .
The total debt on the property is $ 855,500 assuming the final HELOC is fully tapped .
There is a good chance it is n’t .
This seller may be in a holding pattern at $ 800,000 because that is what they need to pay off the loans .
They know their downpayment is gone .
All that work , and they get to lose all their money .
Bummer .

You think youre going to live your life alone
In darkness and seclusion … yeah , I know
Youve been out there and tried to mix with those animals
And it just left you full of humiliated confusion
So you stagger back home and wait for nothing
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back onto the streets
And now youre desperate and in need of human contact
And then you meet me and yur whole world changes
Because everything I say is everything youve ever wanted to hear
So you drop all you defenses , Im perfect in every way
cause I make you feel so strong and so powerfull inside
You feel so lucky
But your ego obscures reality that you never bothered to
Wonder why things are going so well
You want to know why ?
cause
Im a liar , yeah , Im a liar
Ill tear ( rip ) your mind up , Ill burn your soul
Ill turn you into me , Ill turn you into me
cause
Im a liar , a liar , a liar , a liar …
Liar — Rollins Band
Part 1 on The Plausibility of Life
Darwin is famous for convincingly arguing that natural selection can explain why living things have features that are well - matched to the environment they live in .
In the popular consciousness , evolution is often thought of as natural selection acting on random mutations to produce the amazing tricks and traits found in the living world .
But “ random mutation ” is n’t quite right - when we describe evolution like this , we pass over a key problem that Darwin was unable to solve , a problem which today is one of the most important questions in biology .
This key problem is the issue of variation , which is what biologists really mean when they talk about natural selection acting on random mutations .
Variation and mutation are not the same thing , but they are connected .
How they are connected is the most important issue covered Kirschner and Gerhart ’s The Plausbility of Life .
It is an issue Darwin recognized , but could n’t solve in those days before genetics really took off as a science .
Natural selection really works on organisms , not directly on mutations : a particular cheetah survives better than other cheetahs because it can run faster , not because it has a DNA base ‘ G ’ in a particular muscle gene .
A domesticated yeast can survive in wine barrel because of how it metabolizes sugar , not because of the DNA sequence of a metabolism gene .
I know what you ’re thinking : this is just a semantic game over proximal causes .
But this is not just semantics , it is a real scientific problem : what is the causal chain that leads from genotype to phenotype , that is , from an individual organism ’s DNA sequence , mutations included , to the actual physical or physiological traits of the complete organism ?
If you look around your office or your home , you ’re bound to see natural variation in phenotype in the form of your coworkers or even your family .
We ’re all different , but what accounts for those differences ?
How much is genetic , and how much is environment ?
Or how much of is due to the environment acting on the genetics ?
For evolution to work , certain genes for success have to be preferentially passed on to the next generation , but for centuries , biologists have not been able to look at genes directly .
Ingenious biologists probed the properties of genes by looking for mutants , flies with white eyes , or bread mold that could not make certain amino acids .
During the 20th century , brilliant geneticists worked out a great theory of heredity , explaining the patterns of genetic inheritance , without really knowing what genes were physically made of , or how mutations physically occurred .
Now , in the era of torrents of cheap DNA sequence data , we can know better than ever what kinds of random mutations or sexual shuffling of genes take place inside cells .
Identifying the genotype of an organism is now trivial , but we still do n’t really understand how that genotype , how the combinations of many genes , with many mutations , come together to produce a unique individual .
There are several fields of biology focused on this problem .
Two of the most important are quantitative genetics and systems biology .
Quantitative Genetics
Some cheetahs run faster than others , but it ’s not just one gene that makes a difference ; most likely several different genes are involved in producing different cheetah running speeds .
The same is true of human height : we do n’t just have tall people and short people ; we see a range of heights in the human population .
How many genes are involved in this range of phenotypes ?
What kinds of mutations are involved ?
Those are the kinds of questions asked in quantitative genetics .
One key idea to keep in mind is that we ’re only looking at genes that vary in a population , genes with “ mutations ” or ( more technically ) polymorphisms : where I have an ‘ A ” in my DNA , you may have a ‘ G’ ( or some other type of mutation ) .
Some genes do not vary : in cheetahs , there may be an absolutely critical gene involved running speed , but it is 100 % identical in all cheetahs , and thus it is not responsible for the differences in cheetah running speed .
Quantitative geneticists are only interested in the genes that can be different in different individuals .
So quantitative geneticists look for variation in nature , such as differences in running speed or height , or the ability to form spores in yeast , and then they use the tools of genetics , statistics , and DNA sequencing to find the genes .
They may find , for example , that variants of six different genes in a cheetah population are responsible for almost all of the differences in running speed .
Quantitative geneticists are gene finders : they find the genes and mutations involved in producing the physiological differences in individuals .
Systems Biology
Once you have the ( currently hypothetical ) six different genes responsible for the differences in cheetah running speed , the next problem is to understand how those genes actually work together inside of a cell .
This has classically been the work of biochemists and molecular biologists , who studied what the various physical pieces of a cell do .
But now we are running into some limitations of this classical approach :
First , many biochemists and molecular biologists have only studied one gene or protein at a time .
This is great for understanding how that one protein works , and it is absolutely necessary work .
Yet if we have six varying genes working together to make cheetahs run , we want to know how those six genes work in concert , not as individuals .
And second , even though molecular biologists and biochemists have often gone beyond single proteins , and studied chains of interacting proteins in an information processing pathway or a metabolic system , these pathways and systems are often so complex that verbal , intuitive reasoning is n’t enough to understand how they work .
We need mathematical models .
This is where systems biology comes in .
Recently , a group at the Rockefeller University analyzed how a set of genes works together when a yeast cell commits to copying its DNA .
It turns out that a positive feedback loop is involved , which drives the cell forward through the process of cell division , and prevents the cell from sliding back into its previous , non-DNA - copying state .
Some aspects of this positive feedback loop can be understood by verbal reasoning , but a deeper understanding comes from the mathematical model .
And in this case , the modeling produces new ideas about how the system should work , which researchers can then test .
Coming back to The Plausibility of Life , we can see that the issue of how genes ( and the random mutations of them ) produce the variation in nature that is directly responsible for how well an organism does .
How genetic variation produces phenotypic variation in an organism is now one of the central problems in biology , one that we are at last well - equipped to tackle .
Fields like quantitative genetics and systems biology heavily rely on technology : genetic technology in the lab , DNA - sequencing technology , and the number - crunching technology that makes desktop computers faster than the supercomputers of several decades ago .
Darwin would have been envious .
This is the somewhat delayed first installment of a series of posts on an interesting recent book by the accomplished biologists Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart .
In this book , the authors lay out what they see as the most important research agenda for molecular biologists in the 21st century .
The next installments are below :
Part 2
When was the last time you read a horror story in the newspapers about someone losing all of their data and finances online ?
Thankfully the reason these stories make the news is that these cases do n’t happen very often .
However , protecting yourself online is important to ensure you are not one of the rare cases that wakes up one day to find their bank accounts empty or at the mercy of criminal hackers .
1. Two - Step Authentication
Two - step authentication is the new normal .
It involves authenticating a login on one device on another that you own .
For example , if you log in to your bank account or email on a Windows desktop you could be sent a text message on your iPhone .
The text message will contain a one - time code , sometimes known as a one - time password or OTP , that you need to enter into the device you want to login to .
The code will only be valid for a certain length of time .
In some cases this could be as short a time period as five minutes , in others it could last twenty - four hours .
The shorter the period the more secure the password or code is supposed to be .
There is one code for one login attempt so if for some reason you log off the site , you will have to go through the process again and enter a new code .
Many sites now offer two - step authentication as an opt - out measure .
That means if you do n’t want to use it you have to actively turn it off in settings .
But there are a few services where it is still opt - in and you may be prompted to turn it on .
Changing Phone Numbers
If the authentication is done through text message then it is very important that you keep your phone number up to date so that you do n’t get locked out of your email or bank .
There is a lot of resistance to two - factor authentication for this reason but it ’s important to overcome it .
If you travel a lot and change sim cards in each new country you visit then be sure to inform your bank of your travel plans so they can help you find a way around this .
You can usually change your number over in the app or through a simple call to the bank
2. Consider Using a VPN
A virtual private network or VPN is a way of disguising your internet protocol ( IP ) address .
This is the address that is unique to your machine that tells websites where you are browsing from .
These services are not just used by criminals or those living in countries that block certain websites .
In fact , it is a good idea to use a VPN for your everyday web browsing .
It can keep your browsing more secure and stops websites collecting your personal location data that they could potentially sell on .
VPNs are more affordable than you think and there are many subscriptions available .
Click here to see Virtual Shield cost , a VPN you might want to consider .
3. Use a Password Generator
There is a tendency to use the same passwords for all of our logins from emails to Facebook .
This is natural .
We do n’t want to forget our passwords .
The savvier among us might consider using a variation of our passwords for different logins , for instance , our pet ’s name followed by a different month in the calendar .
However , a clever hacker could easily guess this pattern once they have hacked one of your accounts .
Patterns of any kind are not great for passwords .
Another great way for how to protect yourself on the internet is to use a password generator .
This will generate random and strong passwords that are different for each of your logins .
They will be stored on your device and can be accessed through touch ID or two - factor authentication .
Crucially you do not have to remember the passwords or write them down .
4. Do n’t Login in Shops and Unsecure Public Places
This is one of the most important internet safety tips .
Do not log in to your email or bank account in public places such as in computer shops .
Even if you log out afterward you do n’t know how secure the device or internet connection you are using is .
Any number of people could come into the store and take your details .
Do n’t take the risk .
5. Use Encrypted Messenger Apps Like Signal and Telegram
Internet safety is also about ensuring your communications are confidential .
This is crucial if you are transferring bank details or want a message to remain secret .
Be careful about which messaging app you use .
Avoid using standard text messages .
Contemplate using the secret message app on Facebook which deletes messages after they have been sent even for the user opening them .
But also consider apps like Signal and Telegram .
Signal was famously used by Edward Snowden to communicate secretly so he could expose the mass surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and their British counterpart , the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) .
Protecting Yourself Online : Think Before You Click
If you ’re worried about protecting yourself online then do n’t panic .
Do some basic research into cybersecurity from the experts .
Use a VPN to disguise your IP address and consider carefully the information that you share online .
Create strong passwords and never log in to any of your accounts in public places like shops or libraries .
When communicating with your friends consider alternatives to normal texting like Signal .

RIGA , Nov 8 ( Reuters ) -
The Latvian government said on Saturday it was taking over the country ’s second largest bank as the global financial crisis hit the small Baltic state , where economic growth has also sharply fallen .
It said in a statement it acted to “ ensure a stable financial system in Latvia and the work of Parex bank ” .
Parex is the largest locally - owned bank in a sector where Nordic banks have made inroads in recent years .
Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis told reporters after a cabinet meeting the decision to take over Parex was in line with moves by other European Union countries to support their banks .
Godmanis also said he saw no need to ask the International Monetary Fund or the EU for help .

Several wildfires raged throughout Southern California this weekend , in the hills surrounding Los Angeles , burning some 35,000 acres ( 55 sq mi ) and destroying around 1,000 homes as California 's Fire Season extends toward becoming a year - round condition .
Dry Santa
Ana winds of up to 70 mph drove flames and embers across valleys and into neighborhoods , in some cases burning only a few homes , in others , wiping out entire communities .
Most of the fires are contained now - the causes still under investigation .
Fortunately , few injuries and no deaths have been reported , as some 50,000 evacuees begin returning to their homes to assess the damage .

Users have to be logged in to their Google account to use SearchWiki Google has unveiled a tool that will allow users to customise and refine their search queries .
The company 's SearchWiki lets users re-order , remove or add specific web search results .
This means the next time they perform the same search , the personalised version will pop up .
" I would call this revolutionary .
It 's a huge step , not a baby step in the world of search , " Google 's product manager , Cedric Dupont , told the BBC .
" This is part of an obvious movement of the web to become more participatory , so Google search is adapting to this movement , " he said .
" The SearchWiki is about giving users more control over their search results and increasing user happiness , " Mr Dupont added .
But industry watchers predict one huge problem with the effort .
" Most people are not going to engage with it and think about where the results should be - if it's above this one or below that one , " said Greg Sterling , an editor with SearchEngineLand.com .
" This is really for a motivated or elite core of user who really wants to participate in the process . "
" Social search "
As well as ranking results , SearchWiki allows users who have logged in to their Google account to write comments which will have a dialogue balloon next to the result when they return for any further searches .
These will also be public so that others using SearchWiki can view them and get feedback on a website .
It is hoped " people powered " tools like SearchWiki will benefit overall search Mr Dupont stressed that SearchWiki would not affect the way websites were ranked by Google .
At the bottom of the page , there will be a link to take users to a page showing what search results others have re-ranked , deleted or added .
Mr Sterling said that if Google managed to get a great number of people re-ranking results , it could improve the overall search experience .
" Lots of people have tried so - called ' social search ' , combining algorithmic search with human editorial input , because the perception is that humans have the ability to craft a better result in any given situation because they can make distinctions machines can 't , " he said .
" So this could be quite dramatic if they get a lot of people participating because it could improve the algorithms of the process and serve up better search results . "
Matthew Humphries of geek.com would like to see the tool available to the public at large and not just to account holders .
He said that even among SearchWiki users , search would be improved .
" You always see posts on forums for different subjects asking for the best resources to help with X. With SearchWiki the responses wo n't be a bunch of links , they will be a single link to an annotated Google search page , " he added .

Interesting message on The Pirate Bay today .
At first I thought maybe the FBI , Interpol , or some other law enforcement entity took them offline .
Or perhaps the plethora of Christmas downloaders had knocked them offline .
Though , I 'm not sure giving a gift of pirated music or movies burned to a CD / DVD is exactly the type of Christmas spirit that Jesus would approve of .
See Commandment " Thou shall not steal .
" I was getting an authentication window popup asking for username and password .
The initial message said something about " Forbidden Planet " .
Now I see this message below that says " A username and password are being requested by http://thepiratebay.org.
The site says : " Dont Panic !
TPB will be back shortly .
Dont enter " : Interestingly , this message only appears on one of my ISPs but not another .
Much be some .htaccess rule they 're playing with that blocks some IP addresses but not others .
As to why I was visiting a known pirate / warez site , well , I actually like their Top 100 lists for DVDs .
It gives me ideas for what popular DVDs I should buy my family for Christmas .
Call me a prude , but I do n't download movies illegally .

An Indian - built Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle stands poised to launch the Chandrayaan - 1 lunar probe for the Indian Space Research Organization .
BANGALORE , India -
Five years after being formally approved and following a series of latedelays , India ?s first - ever planetary mission is on track to launch the morningof Oct. 22 Local Time , with arrival in lunar orbit scheduled to occur 17 dayslater .
The Chandrayaan - 1moon mission , featuring Indian , European and U.S. instruments , had been scheduledto launch in April but suffered setbacks including late - arriving payloads andintegration issues .
But officials with the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) , who unveiled plans for the orbiter in 2000 with a target launch date of 2008 , are confident those issuesare behind them .
? Thespacecraft reached the launch site Sept. 30 after completing thermal vacuum , vibration and acoustic testing in Bangalore , ?
ISRO spokesman S. Satish saidOct. 15 .
Integration with the launcher was completed Oct. 14 and at press timethe rocket was slated to be moved to the launch pad Oct. 18 , he said .
? TheChandrayaan - 1 spacecraft after successfully completing [ thermal vacuum ] , vibration and acoustic tests , has reached the launch site , ?
ISRO spokesman S.Satish told SPACE.com sister publication Space News Oct. 8 . ? Allthe operations are going on satisfactorily .?
If all goeswell , Chandrayaan - which means moon vehicle in Hindi - will join two other spacecraftthat reached lunar orbit roughly one year ago : Japan ? slarge Kaguya , or Selene , mission , which launched in September 2007 , and China ?
sChang?e 1 , which launched in October 2007 .
NASA ?s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiteris slated to launch in February , meaning that four spacecraft , each built by adifferent country , could be in lunar orbit simultaneously .
Built at acost to ISRO of some $ 87 million , the fully fueled Chandrayaan - 1 will weigh2,874 pounds ( 1,304 kg ) when it lifts off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centreon Sriharikota Island off India ?s east coast .
After a countdown lasting 52 hours , the probe will lift off tomorrow at 6:20 a.m. Local Time ( Tuesday evening Oct.21 EDT ) aboard a modified version of ISRO ?s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle , orPSLV .
The probewill be India ?s first to leave Earth orbit , something that will be accomplished not by a direct transfer typical of lunar missions but rather through a seriesof Earth orbit - raising maneuvers .
In direct transfer missions , a spacecraft isplaced into a parking orbit around Earth before on board propulsion systemsgive it a substantial velocity boost to place it into a lunar transfer orbitwith an apogee of 238,550 miles ( 384,400 km ) - roughly the moon ?s average distancefrom the Earth .
? Directtransfer would have required an additional stage to PSLV , ? said V. Adimurthy , ascientist at ISRO ?s Vikram Space Science Centre , where the rocket was built .
Satish saidthe PSLV will inject Chandrayaan - 1 into an elliptical orbit around the Earthwith a perigee of 155 miles ( 250 km ) and an apogee of 14,291 miles ( 23,000 km ) .
The spacecraft will reach lunar orbit by firing its liquid - fueled apogee motorseveral times .
The first firing will put the spacecraft in a 186 - by 22,990 - mile ( 300 - by 37,000 - km ) Earth orbit .
Successive firings will raise theapogee to 45,360 miles ( 73,000 km ) and then to the lunar transfer trajectoryorbit of 186 by 240,470 miles ( 300 by 387,000 km ) .
? It takesabout 11 days after launch to establish the lunar transfer trajectory , ?
Satishsaid .
Furtherfirings will insert Chandrayaan - 1 into a 310 - by 3,106 - mile ( 500 - by 5,000 - km ) orbit around the moon .
The orbit will then will be lowered to 62 by 3,106 miles ( 100 by 5,000 km ) and finally to the desired 62 - mile ( 100 - km ) circularorbit , which will take the spacecraft over the Moon ?s poles once every 118 minutes .
? If thelaunch takes place on Oct. 22 , the spacecraft is expected to enter the 100 - kilometer lunar orbit on Nov. 8 , ?
Satish said .
The Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft itself is relatively small , measuring about 5 feet ( 1.5 meters ) on a side with a dry mass of only 1,153 pounds ( 523 kg ) .
Itcarries 11 scientific payloads , including six provided by other nations : two fromthe United States , and one each from Britain , Sweden , Germany and Bulgaria .
? The realchallenge was in accommodating different payloads in specific locations andorientations in a small spacecraft , ?
Mylswamy Annadurai , Chandrayaan - 1 projectdirector , told Space News .
The Indian - built payloads are : the Terrain Mapping Camera ; Lunar Laser RangingInstrument ; Hyperspectral Imager ; High Energy X - Ray Spectrometer ; and the MoonImpact Probe .
The 64 - pound ( 29 - kg ) impact probe will be released from the orbiter over a selectedsite once the spacecraft enters its final orbit , Satish said .
During its 18 - minutedescent , the impact probe - with India ?s national flag painted on its shell - willtake images of the lunar surface .
Its impact will kick up a cloud of dust thatwill be observed and analyzed by the instruments on the orbiter .
Among theinternational payloads , India collaborated on two : the X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer with Britain ?s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ; and the Sub-keVAtom Reflecting Analyzer with the Swedish Institute of Space Physics .
The otherinternational payloads are : a Mini Synthetic Aperture Radar built by the Johns HopkinsUniversity ?s Applied Physics Laboratory of Laurel , Md. ; Moon MineralogicalMapper supplied by NASA ?s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Brown University ; NearInfrared Spectrometer from Germany ?s Max Planck Institute ; and Radiation DoseMonitor supplied by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences .
In additionto mapping lunar surface features and topography , the instrument suite willstudy the Moon ?s elemental and mineralogical composition - in part by measuringreflectance from solar flares that are expected to rise in frequency andintensity over the next few years .
?
Water-ice , if present , can be detected byseveral of these instruments , ?
ISRO said on its Web site .
In responseto questions , Narendra Bhandari , who until recently headed ISRO ?s planetary explorationdivision , listed four main Chandrayaan - 1 objectives :
Study how volatile elements and compounds - possibly including water - get transported to the poles from the hot lunar surface during the day .
Produce a digital elevation map with 5 - meter resolution both vertically and horizontally .
This will enable scientists to select potential sites for a future base .
Produce chemical and mineral maps of the moon .
The mineral spectrometer will measure signals up to 3 microns in the near - infra red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - data that has not previously been collected - giving scientists new information about water and possible organic compounds at the poles .
Map subsurface features on the Moon using a synthetic aperture radar .
? Simultaneousphoto - geological , mineralogical , and chemical mapping will enable us toidentify different geological units , which will test the early evolutionary historyof the Moon , ?
Bhandari said .
He addedthat the simultaneous presence of four Moon probes will enable coordinatedstudy .
For example , he said , one mission may benefit from data collected by another ; or one probe could observe as another crashes into the surface after completingits mission .
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Up to 30,000 additional U.S. troops could be sent to Afghanistan next year , military officials said Saturday .
Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan , with its high mountain terrain .
Roughly 31,000 U.S. troops currently are in Afghanistan .
Of the additional troops , 20,000 will comprise four ground / maneuvering brigades , said Col. Gregory Julian , spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
That number is consistent with what Gen. David McKiernan , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , called for in October , he said .
The additional 10,000 likely refers to support personnel , Julian said .
McKiernan requested the additional 20,000 troops be sent to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country .
On Friday , military officials said Defense Secretary Robert Gates signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year .
Those troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade , the latest approved by Gates for the expected buildup of U.S. troops in the country in 2009 .
The brigade will send a number of much - needed helicopters to the region .
Helicopters are the main mode of transportation for the U.S. military in Afghanistan , where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies .
The additional troops would nearly double the level of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Troop levels are likely to be maintained at this increased level for three to four years , Julian said Saturday , as U.S. forces continue to try to " clear and hold " more parts of Afghanistan from insurgents and militants and train Afghan military and police to be self - sufficient .

A secret meeting on board an American aircraft carrier between the US General David Petraeus and the head of the Pakistani military laid the foundation for the killing of Britain 's most wanted terrorist .
The Independent learnt that talks held on board the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Persian Gulf three months ago led to General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani pledging to provide information on " high - value " targets such as Rashid Rauf , who died in a missile strike inside Pakistan on Saturday .
Senior UK security sources insisted that the lethal attack in North Waziristan on the 27 - year - old Birmingham - born Rauf – accused of being involved in the plot to plant liquid bombs aboard transatlantic airliners – was " a unilateral American action " without any British involvement .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The disclaimer came after two senior MPs called on the British government to say whether or not it had been made aware in advance of the attack plan .
Andrew Dismore , Labour chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights , said : " We can investigate whether British security services had involvement in providing intelligence concerning British nationals in Pakistan . "
The former shadow security minister Patrick Mercer , the Tory MP for Newark , said : " This raises the question of how much co-operation the British intelligence agencies provided in ... the execution of a British subject . "
However , American officials stated that the intelligence on the whereabouts of Rauf and a Saudi Islamist , Abu Zubair al - Masri , was provided by Pakistani authorities .
The agreement on sharing intelligence came during the meeting on the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea in the last week of August , US sources said .
General Kayani , who had taken over from General Pervez Musharraf as the head of the Pakistani military , was brought to the ship by American helicopters .
He was told about grave American disquiet over the help being given to the Taliban by elements of the Pakistani military and intelligence service , the ISI .
According to US officials an agreement was reached at the conclusion of the " heated " meeting with General Kayani , in which the Pakistanis promised to supply high - quality intelligence .
Rauf was initially wanted for questioning by police in England over the murder of his uncle in Birmingham .
He fled to Pakistan but was arrested in August 2006 by the Pakistani police for his alleged involvement in the airliner plot .
But in December 2007 he escaped .
Rauf 's parents , who live in the Ward End area of Birmingham , have not received confirmation of his death , a friend of the family confirmed .
The man , a shopkeeper who asked not to be named , said : " They do n't know anything about this ...
They have got no information and it's obviously not nice for them . "
A man who later emerged from the Rauf home , in a blue tracksuit and full beard , told reporters : " I am angry .
For your own safety , all I can say to you is goodbye . "
The Foreign Office could not confirm Rauf 's killing .
But Sherry Rehman , the Pakistani information minister , stated : " Sources have confirmed that Rashid Rauf and Masri were targets and have been killed . "
Other Pakistani officials said that the bodies of the two men , along with five others killed , would be collected for DNA tests .
However , Rauf's Pakistani lawyer , Hashmat Ali Habib , said that Taliban fighters appeared to have removed the bodies .
" We are still not sure , it 's all suspicious . "
If Barack Obama is to persuade Iran to negotiate away its illegal nuclear weapons program , he will first need to generate more leverage than what the Bush administration is leaving him with .
The current U.N. sanctions have proven too weak to dissuade Tehran 's leaders , and Russia and China seem determined to keep those sanctions weak .
Meanwhile , the regime continues to insist there are no incentives in exchange for which it would halt or even limit its nuclear work .
However , Tehran has an economic Achilles ' heel -- its extraordinarily ...
US Military May Kill Rescued Dog Of Deployed US Soldier

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
I ’m going to deviate from our regular celebrity - infused news to bring attention to this incredibly sad and distrubing story .
Apparently , there is an organization called Baghdad Pups that provides medical attention , clearance and transport for the animals U.S. soldiers have come to love during deployment in the Middle East .
Unfortunately , the US Military has intervened in their rescue operations and is now threatening to kill one the beloved pups named Ratchet .
Here ’s a bit from the SPCA press release ,
Today , the United States military committed a crime against their own mentally wounded U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq .
Commanding officers ordered the confiscation of a dog , Ratchet , befriended by a group of soldiers during a 15th month of deployment .
Ratchet has been a lifeline to Sgt. Gwen Beberg .
This morning , Ratchet was on his way to SPCA International rescue experts at the Baghdad Airport to be flown home to Gwen ’s parents in Minneapolis , MN when Sgt. Beberg ’s commanding officers ordered Ratchet confiscated and held in Iraq to face certain death .
It is against military regulations for active duty troops to befriend animals – Soldiers can face immediate court - marshal and some even see their animals brutally murdered by a direct gunshot to the head from commanding officers who will not bend the rules .
Hundreds of U.S. soldiers in the Middle East befriend animals in the war zone to help themselves cope with the hardship and terror they face every day .
These dogs and cats become their lifeline – saving them from deep depression and Post - traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) .
We here at Ecorazzi find this abhorrent and ask that everyone spread the new about Ratchet and the efforts of Baghdad Pups to bring animals like him home .

What hole did they find Santorum in ?
I 'm changing the channel .
I wonder who prepped Donald .
If it 's Jared , and Trump did as bad as he did in Tulsa , I wonder if he 'll be sent packing finally .
Some other CNN commentator just said this will be an evenly matched debate .
Seriously ?

The Army ’s internal study of the war in Iraq criticizes some efforts by its own psychological operations units , but one spur - of - the - moment effort last year produced the most memorable image of the invasion .
As the Iraqi regime was collapsing on April 9 , 2003 , Marines converged on Firdos Square in central Baghdad , site of an enormous statue of Saddam Hussein .
It was a Marine colonel -- not joyous Iraqi civilians , as was widely assumed from the TV images -- who decided to topple the statue , the Army report said .
And it was a quick - thinking Army psychological operations team that made it appear to be a spontaneous Iraqi undertaking .
After the colonel -- who was not named in the report -- selected the statue as a “ target of opportunity , ” the psychological team used loudspeakers to encourage Iraqi civilians to assist , according to an account by a unit member .
But Marines had draped an American flag over the statue ’s face .

“ God bless them , but we were thinking ... that this was just bad news , ” the member of the psychological unit said .
“ We did n’t want to look like an occupation force , and some of the Iraqis were saying , ‘ No , we want an Iraqi flag ! ’ ”
Someone produced an Iraqi flag , and a sergeant in the psychological operations unit quickly replaced the American flag .
Ultimately , a Marine recovery vehicle toppled the statue with a chain , but the effort appeared to be Iraqi - inspired because the psychological team had managed to pack the vehicle with cheering Iraqi children .

Soldiers who can communicate with each other telepathically .
Amputated limbs that grow back with the help of a nano - scaffold .
Equipment that can see through dense smoke or fog by exploiting quantum effects .
Your tax dollars are hard at work trying to create the most sci-fi military in the world .
U.S. military researchers will showcase their most outlandish initiatives at next month 's Army Science Conference , including photo - realistic holograms and virtual soldiers designed to infiltrate World of Warcraft .
In an interview with military blog Defense Tech , the Army 's Director of Research and Laboratory Management , Dr. John Parmentola described the military versions of some of the most advanced technology in development right now .
For example , using electrical signals from the brain to control a wheelchair or output words to a computer is the civilian way of doing things .
The Army envisions soldiers in contant , silent communication with each other , with the ability to silently activate and control machines just by thinking about it .
That 's a sci- fi action movie script that pretty much writes itself .
The quantum ghost effect is a little tougher to explain .
Basically , you 've got photons that pass across a smoke - obscured battlefield and simultaneously are and are not reflected by the smoke .
Special computers could see through the smoke by taking advantage of the quantum link between both versions of the photons .
Call it " Schrödinger 's Howitzer . "
Regarding the ultra- realistic holographic soldiers , the military wants them to act the part of enemies for more effective training exercizes .
They can't just look real , though .
They want AI that makes them act real .
Dr. Parmentola seemed a bit credulous about the current state of development , however , saying , " I actually interact with virtual humans in terms of asking them questions and they 're responding . "
Yeah , I was fooled by a bot on IM once too .
But what 's this about World of Warcraft ?
The Army thinks online games are a perfect testing ground for their nascent AIs .
They specifically mentioned WoW and EVE Online as games they want to infiltrate , sending in their " virtual soldiers " to see if they can deceive the human players .
I think Blizzard should open up a bot only server .

Earlier today , I came across an ad for Psystar which was advertising a 2GHZ computer running OS X with 2GB of Ram for only $ 554 .
Psystar likes to market itself as a cheaper alternative to Apple , but a closer look reveals that a Pystar computer running OS X is n’t as cheap as Psystar would lead you to believe , and that the $ 554 price tag is completely misleading .
Psystar likes to advertise a picture of a desktop tower , accompanied by a monitor showing Leopard , alongside a price tag that says “ From $ 554 ” .
In reality , to get the setup pictured in the ad costs almost 500 dollars more and is about the same price as a comparable iMac .
For starters , the $ 544 price tag does n’t include a monitor , and if you ’d like one , Psystar will add one on for 200 dollars more .
It also does n’t come with a mouse and keyboard , but Pystar will add one in for 29 bucks .
Their computers also do n’t come with FireWire , but you can get a FireWire port for only 40 extra bucks .
You want a wireless card ?
Add in another $ 100 .
Are you a bluetooth man ?
If so , chalk up another 40 bucks .
That brings the grand total to $ 961 for a complete desktop system .
And at this point , it still is n’t up to speed with what the iMac offers .
The entry level iMac offers a 2.4 GHZ processor , and if you want to upgrade the 2.0 GHZ processor that comes with your Psystar computer , you ’ll have to add in another 60 bucks .
This leaves us with a desktop configuration that comes in at $ 1,021.99 .
You can get an equivalent iMac from Apple for as low as $ 1098 after rebates .
All in all , Psystar saves you around 75 - 100 bucks , but carries a disproportionate amount of risk as future software upgrades from Apple might cripple your Psystar hardware .
Dropping more than a grand for a computer that might stop working if you want to keep it up to date does n’t seem wise .
To combat this , Psystar has turned off the automatic software updates , so you ’re essentially stuck with the version of Leopard that shipped with your computer .
Moreover , Psystar ’s setup involves a tower and a monitor , whereas the iMac has the monitor and CPU all in one case .
And one more thing , Psystar ’s version of OS X does n’t come with iMovie or iPhoto since iLife is n’t included in the retail version of Leopard .
iLife retails for around $ 79 bucks , so all in all , an iMac and equivalent Psystar system are essentially the same .
Psystar might claim that it ’s giving consumers more bang for their buck , what they ’re really offering is a Mac mini clone for $ 544 .
Only thing is , their version of the Mac mini is n’t so mini .
It ’s a tower .
The Legal Battle
Apple and Psystar have sued and counter - sued each other , but both recently agreed to enter into Alternative Dispute Resolution ( ADR ) , meaning that they will both try and avoid litigation and settle their claims via meditation or arbitration .
This is a move that caught many off guard as the crux of Psystar ’s allegation is that Apple has a monopoly in the OS X market , an argument that does n’t have any legal legs to stand on .
Clearly Psystar could n’t argue that Apple has a monopoly in the PC market as they have less than a 10 % market share .
So instead , Psystar came up with the somewhat specious argument that Apple has a monopoly in the OS X market since it wo n’t allow its operating system to run on any non-Apple hardware .
It ’s curious , though , how Apple can have a monopoly in a market that Psystar essentially made up out of thin air .
Think about it – there is no OS X market .
Apple puts OSX on computers that it sells in the computer market .
I mean , you ca n’t sue Coke for refusing to put its formula into a different can on the notion Coke has a monopoly over the coke formula .
Admittedly , its an original idea , but legally it should fall flat on its face .
But for some reason , Apple has chosen not to litigate .
Perhaps it did n’t want to spend the resources necessary to fight the lawsuit , or perhaps the risk , however small , that they would lose was n’t a risk Apple was willing to take .
If Apple lost , it would give every other company a green light to put a hacked version of OS X in whatever box they wanted , sell it for a little bit less , and take business away from Apple , much in the way that the clones did way back when Apple did , in fact , license its OS .
Psystar ’s questionable history
But did Apple have anything to fear at all ?
Psystar has been shrouded in shadyness since its inception , with the Miami Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau both showing no record of its existence .
The president of Psystar , Rudy Pedraza , also seems to be a shady fellow , and Psystar has previously run into trouble for taking Credit Card numbers but not actually processing them .
But that ’s not all .
The physical location of Psystar ’s supposed offices have changed at least three times ( all within a matter of days ) , with one of the locations having no trace of Psystar ever being there or leasing any space .
Psystar was founded by Roberto and Rodolfo Pedraza , two brothers from South Florida in their mid-20’s , and the two have been involved in a host of other corporations , many of which have since been dissolved by the state due to the lack of properly filed paperwork .

EVERY scholar of 20th - century history can tell you about the Communist International — usually called Comintern , and strictly speaking the third in a series of four global fraternities whose aim was to pursue the class struggle all over the world .
Is it possible to imagine an Anarchist International , a trans-national version of the inchoate but impassioned demonstrations that have ravaged Greece this month ?
( Perhaps because it is easier to say what Greece 's malcontents are against than what they are for , the word “ anarchist ” is an accepted catch - all term for the anti-establishment rebels who form the hard core of the Athenian protesters . )
By definition , anarchy is harder to propagate than rigid Leninism .
Whatever is spreading from Athens , it is not a clear programme for a better world .
The malcontents of Greece include ideological class warriors , nostalgists for the protests against the junta of 1967 - 74 and people ( including drug dealers and bank robbers ) with a grudge against the police .
Relations between police and the counter - culture have worsened recently ; the police are accused ( rightly ) of bullying migrants , the bohemians of dallying with terrorism .
A messy scene , with no obvious message .
But the psychological impulse behind the Greek protests — a sense of rage against all authority , which came to a head after a 15 - year - old boy was killed by a police bullet — can now be transmitted almost instantaneously , in ways that would make the Bolsheviks very jealous .
These days , images ( moving as well as still ) spread faster than words ; and images , of course , transcend language barriers .
E-communications are now a familiar feature in pro-democracy protests against dictators .
Equally fast - moving , say specialists , is the role of technology in what might be called “ undemocratic protests ” : violent acts in prosperous , networked societies .
This became obvious during the French riots of 2005 , when teenagers posted blogs that urged people to “ burn the cops ” — and made massive use of text messages to co-ordinate the protests .
The youths that trashed Budapest in 2006 relied on blogs to enlist supporters , and distribute an audio recording of the prime minister admitting government corruption .
Hungarian blogs were also used to aggregate visual evidence of police brutality .
There were novel online projects such as an “ Interactive Riot Walkthrough ” , which superimposed photos of the latest events on a map of Budapest , offering “ virtual tours ” of the city as it burned .
Already , the Greek riots are prompting talk of a new era of networked protest .
The volume of online content they have inspired is remarkable .
Photos and videos of the chaos , often shot with cellphones , were posted online almost in real time .
Twitter , a service for exchanging short messages , has brimmed with live reports from the streets of Athens , most of them in Greek but a few in English .
A tribute to the slain teenager — a clip of photos with music from a popular rock band — appeared on YouTube , the video - sharing site , shortly after his death ; more than 160,000 people have seen it .
A similar tribute group on Facebook has attracted more than 130,000 members , generating thousands of messages and offering links to more than 1,900 related items : images of the protests , cartoons and leaflets .
A memorial was erected in Second Life , a popular virtual environment , giving its users a glimpse of real - life material from the riots .
Many other online techniques — such as maps detailing police deployments and routes of the demonstrations — came of age in Athens .
And as thousands of photos and videos hit non-Greek blogs and forums , small protests were triggered in many European cities , including Istanbul ( see picture above ) and Madrid .
Some 32 people were arrested in Copenhagen .
The spread of sympathy protests over what began as a local Greek issue has big implications for the more formal anti-globalisation movement .
That movement has ignored the idea of spontaneous but networked protest , and instead focused on taking large crowds to set - piece events like summits .
Such methods look outdated now .
Governments are not the only things that networked “ anarchy ” threatens .

MEDGIDIA , Romania ( Reuters ) -
In the early 1900s , it took a steam train three hours to get from the Romanian capital Bucharest to the Black Sea .
Now an electric train does it in six .
It ’s not just the tourists who care .
Every party is writing road and rail investment large in its campaign for Sunday ’s election , knowing that decrepit transport threatens to cancel out some of Romania ’s few economic advantages : its location at a trading crossroads , and the low labour costs that have until now encouraged foreign investment .
The scale of investment and reforms needed is forbidding , but most economists know that without them , the foreign money that has been supporting Romania ’s consumption , already dwindling , may dry up altogether .
With a history of red tape , administrative failings , corruption and political reluctance to finance long - term projects , the outlook is grim .
There was a warning in June , when Germany ’s Daimler chose Hungary over Romania to site an 800 million euro ( 661 million pounds )
Mercedes plant , swayed in part by access to road links .
“ Transportation should be your number one priority , ” said U.S. ambassador Nicholas Taubman .
“ Romania will not be competitive with either your neighbours or western European trading partners until its ‘ road to Europe ’ is finished . ”
The new EU member should be a crossroads of major routes bringing resources from north and east Europe to the south and west , and bringing western - made goods to markets in the east .
Many manufacturers want to set up shop in Romania to take advantage of lower labour and production costs , even though fast salary growth and worker migration have already begun to narrow this window .
But its road and rail system let it down badly .
COMPETITIVITY SQUANDERED
“ Firms have a problem , ” said Florin Pogonaru , head of the Romanian Businessmen ’s Association .
“ Competitivity gains are eaten up by hard access to raw materials .
Islands of high productivity develop , but remain isolated unless infrastructure is brought up to their gates . ”
Nearly half of Romania ’s 10,000 km ( 6,000 miles ) of rail tracks need repair or replacement , and derailments and delays are the bane of rail travellers ’ lives .
The roads are even worse .
The World Economic Forum ranks Romania at 126 out of 134 states for road quality , between Nepal and Poland .
It has only 270 km of motorways .
To cross Romania , drivers navigate narrow roads that wind around the Carpathian mountains and cut through thousands of villages , vying for space with horse - drawn carts , cyclists and even herds of sheep or cows .
Many cities lack ring roads , leading inevitably to gridlock in their centres .
Experts say poor road conditions cost drivers half a billion euros in extra fuel and repair costs every year .
But attempts to improve matters have been stumbling at best .
The biggest motorway project , Autostrada Transilvania , meant to link Romania with Hungary , was begun in 2004 , but so far just 9 km have been built .
Delays from slow land expropriations , archaeological permits and intermittent financing flows mean it will not be finished before 2013 -- a year late -- at the earliest .
The project to renovate the main rail link from Bucharest to the Black Sea began in 2006 and is already 6 months behind .
Next to a 10 - foot ( 3 - metre ) mound of rail rubble at the outskirts of the small town of Medgidia , Florin Dila oversees workers replacing old tracks for an Austrian company involved in the 600 million euro project .
“ Delays on the route are caused by changes to the project when work is already under way ...
They ( the government ) raised the maximum speed for the trains .
We had to enlarge the rail bed , to lay new tracks , and this has taken time , ” he said .
GOVERNMENT THE PROBLEM
In fact , government turns out to be one of the obstacles .
“ As any major project takes 5 to 7 years to bear fruit , no government ... has been willing to spend big sums on infrastructure , afraid of the next cabinet reaping the benefits , ” said former transport minister Radu Berceanu .
“ You can be Jesus , but if a client gives you barely any money , you can only tailor shorts instead of trousers . ”
Undaunted , all parties make infrastructure their top priority ahead of the election , most pledging to build around 1,000 km of motorways .
They include the pro-business Liberal Party of Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu who has overseen the building of just 50 km of motorways since 2004 .
Experts estimate it will cost 4 - 6 percent of gross domestic product a year to fulfil these plans and ensure that Romania ’s borders are crossed by four - lane roads on main EU transport routes by 2013 .
In a global credit crunch that has boosted financing costs and seen Romania ’s sovereign borrowing rating downgraded , such plans seem hopelessly optimistic to many .
“ We ’ve seen nothing about financing , ” said Pogonaru .
While Romania has probably attracted around 8.5 billion euros of foreign direct investment this year , Ionut Dumitru , head of research at Raiffeisen Bank in Bucharest , says this will likely fall to 6 or 6.5 billion next , due to the credit crisis .
Economists say this will not only reduce the money available for big projects , but also leave a huge gap in state finances as a whole .

Top Republican lieutenants who have been toiling with John McCain to put him in the White House are starting to turn on each other as they calculate that every last wheel has come off their campaign wagon and there is no putting them back on again .
Even as some of his backers argue that Barack Obama 's lead in the polls is still not insurmountable , others in Mr McCain 's circle are reportedly succumbing to the instincts of professional survival and political buck - passing .
The fault for impending defeat must be assigned elsewhere .
A new Reuters - Zogby poll last night gave Mr Obama , who remained in Hawaii at the bedside of his ailing grandmother , a 10 - point lead nationally .
Meanwhile , new financial filings revealed that the make - up artist assigned to the running - mate , Sarah Palin , was paid more in the first half of October than any other employee of the campaign , including Mr McCain 's most senior advisers and strategists .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" If you really want to see what ' going negative ' is in politics , just watch the back - stabbing and blame game that we 're starting to see , " Mark McKinnon , a former McCain aide , told politico.com .
" There 's one common theme : everyone who was n't part of the campaign could have done better . "
There are still a number of things that could go wrong for Mr Obama , who will return to the campaign trail today .
He is relying on a high turn - out , particularly among blacks and first - time young voters .
Comments he has made on taxation and remarks by Joe Biden , his running - mate , on foreign affairs , have entered the McCain attack lexicon .
And no one knows , meanwhile , how accurate the polling really is .
Democrats do have reason to feel encouraged .
Early voting is under way in many of the battleground states and Democrats standing in line are outnumbering Republicans , sometimes by 2 to 1 margins .
Ohio , North Carolina , New Mexico , Iowa and Nevada are all states showing the trend .
Early voting is also pointing to the higher participation rate among African - Americans that Mr Obama needs .
Senator McCain – or McRage as Saturday Night Live now calls him – campaigned in Colorado , a normally red-leaning state that may already be lost to Mr Obama .
The Republican continued to lambast his rival for the promise he made to " Joe the plumber " to increase taxes on the very rich and " spread the wealth " .
Mr Obama told ABC yesterday , however , that he had no regrets about the comment .
" The American people understand that the way we grow this economy is from the bottom up , " he said .
The complaints from within the Republican Party about the McCain campaign are piling up fast .
Why , for instance , did he not stick with his earlier strategy of contrasting his experience with the relative inexperience of Mr Obama ?
Why did he go negative in attacking Mr Obama ?
Why did n't he go negative enough ?
Then there is Mrs Palin , who yesterday had to turn her attention away from the campaign and back to her Troopergate difficulties .
She was to give a deposition as part of a second inquiry into allegations the Alaska governor abused her power , by sacking a senior official because he refused to sack her estranged brother - in - law .
Mr McCain 's defenders argue that it was clear by the summer that only by taking risks did he have any hoping of winning and picking the Alaska governor was the most gutsy of all .
This week 's revelations denting Mrs Palin 's hockey - mom image have not helped though .
Two days ago we heard of the $ 150,000 ( £ 95,000 ) spent by the campaign on her fancy outfits .
As for the make - up artist , she is Amy Strozzi , who was formerly in the make - up trailers of the TV show So You Think you Can Dance .
In the first half of this month , cheques written to her amounted to a staggering $ 22,800 .
Some of the conservative movement 's most esteemed flag - bearers have turned against her .
David Brooks , the New York Times columnist , termed her " a fatal cancer " on the party .
Peggy Noonon in the Wall Street Journal called her selection " symptom and expression of a new vulgarisation in American politics " .
Only Mr McCain can stop the bickering .
" This looks like it 's reached a point where the candidate has to step in himself and crack some heads to remind everyone why they came to work for him , " said Dan Schnur , a former adviser .
A British museum curator has built a working replica of a 2,000 - year - old Greek machine that has been called the world 's first computer .
A dictionary - size assemblage of 37 interlocking dials crafted with the precision and complexity of a 19th - century Swiss clock , the Antikythera mechanism was used for modeling and predicting the movements of the heavenly bodies as well as the dates and locations of upcoming Olympic games .
The original 81 shards of the Antikythera were recovered from under the sea ( near the Greek island of Antikythera ) in 1902 , rusted and clumped together in a nearly indecipherable mass .
Scientists dated it to 150 B.C. Such craftsmanship would n't be seen for another 1,000 years — but its purpose was a mystery for decades .
Many scientists have worked since the 1950s to piece together the story , with the help of some very sophisticated imaging technology in recent years , including X - ray and gamma-ray imaging and 3 - D computer modeling .
Now , though , it has been rebuilt .
As is almost always the way with these things , it was an amateur who cracked it .
Michael Wright , a former curator at the Science Museum in London , has built a replica of the Antikythera , which works perfectly .
In the video from New Scientist below , Wright shows how the machine works .
In short , Antikythera 's user interface is deceptively simple , operated by a simple knob on the side .
This conceals the intricacy within , amounting to a complex mathematical model , tracking the movements of planetary bodies and incorporating a series of submechanisms to account for the eccentricities of their rotation .
A dial on the faceplace featured the Greek zodiac and an
Egyptian calendar ; pointers showed the location of the moon and the five planets known at the time .
On the machine 's back , an upper dial shows a 19 - year calendar ( matching the solunar cycle ) and the timing of upcoming Olympic games .
A lower dial shows a 76 - year cycle ( when the Olympic and solunar cycles coincide ) and indicates the months in which lunar and solar eclipses can be expected .
According to New Scientist , this is the first working model of the Antikythera computer to include all of the device 's known features .
And , like the original machine , it has been built of recycled metal plates .
That 's right :
The Antikythera mechanism is not only the world 's oldest computer , it 's also the world 's first green computer .

President invokes false flag event one more time to justify continuation of interventionist foreign policy
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Sept 3 , 2008
Speaking from the White House via satellite , the president told Republicans at the national convention in St. Paul , Minnesota that voters must elect John McCain because of 9/11 .
In a gut wrenching speech enforcing interventionalist neoconservative foreign policy Bush stated :
“ We live in a dangerous world … and we need a president who understands the lessons of Sept. 11 , 2001 : that to protect America , we must stay on the offense , stop attacks before they happen and not wait to be hit again . ”
Bush went on to explain how he “ stood in the ruins of buildings knocked down by killers and promised the survivors I would never let them down .
I know the hard choices that fall solely to a president . ”
He then stated that McCain has “ the judgment , the experience and the policies ” to continue on the same course .
Bush also continually spoke of McCain ’s consistent support for his policies on the Iraq war , praising the senator for his “ character ” in backing the White House ’s “ surge ” of tens of thousands of new U.S. troops in Iraq last year .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ That is the kind of courage and vision we need in our next commander - in - chief , ” Bush said .
Bush ’s comments serve as a clear indication that a vote for McCain represents a vote for the continuation of preemptive war and interventionalist foreign policy .

Bush had been scheduled to be the main speaker at the convention on Monday night in , but canceled those plans due to hurricane Gustav .
In attendance however were Laura Bush , Barbara Bush and George Bush Snr .
The president introduced the audience to his parents by stating :
“ I want to say hello to two people in the hall with you tonight .
I could have no finer examples of character , decency and integrity than my mom and dad , and I love you a lot . ”

Russia 's frosty ties with Nato were also on the agenda
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said that the era of US global economic dominance is over .
Speaking after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in St Petersburg , Mr Medvedev said the world needed a " more just " financial system .
Mrs Merkel 's visit is seen as an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and the West over the war in Georgia .
Russia is backing two breakaway regions there .
But Georgia 's territorial integrity " is non-negotiable , " Mrs Merkel insisted .
Mrs Merkel , like other Western leaders , has criticised Moscow 's actions in Georgia in August .
In the brief war Russian troops pushed well beyond the borders of breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
On Thursday Mrs Merkel called Russia 's intervention in Georgia " disproportionate " .
The talks come a day after European Union observers began patrolling in Georgia to oversee a withdrawal of Russian forces from " buffer zones " around the breakaway regions .
Russia has kept troops there since ousting Georgian forces .
It has promised to complete its troop pull - out by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Gas deal
In St Petersburg , Mrs Merkel and Mr Medvedev signed a long - awaited energy deal giving the German firm E.
On a stake in a Russian gas field that will supply the Nord Stream undersea pipeline the two countries intend to build .
Germany 's European Union neighbour Poland objects to the pipeline , which will deprive it of lucrative transit fees .
Some 40 % of the natural gas Germany imports comes from Russia .
Vellai Thamarai : imagine going to a school named White Lotus .
It ’s not yet entirely finished but is supposed to be by January .
Nearly every villager in Cinna Kattupalayam lines the road to greet our bus with cries of hello and bonjour .
On a Monday morning , the children are beside themselves at the prospect of going to school .
There are enough smiles for a thousand mornings .
We take our yoga classes on the roof of the new school , under a tall , thatched structure with open sides .
Most of the people in the assembly know their hat ha - style yoga ; others stumble a lot  but soon everyone gets into the flow , despite the great sensual distractions : banana groves to the north wavering in the gold sunlight ; rice paddies to the east where a few dozen women bend weeding at daybreak ; thick coconut trees to the west that invite the eye to enter and roam ; and to the south , the village , overlain with teak , drumstick and casuarina trees , where cooking - fire smoke rises and every dog yaps at everything .
There ’s a blessed break around 9 to boat a mile or so down a green stream , which takes us to the sea for an hour ’s swim in view of a towering blue Hindu temple .
The coast here was struck hard by the tsunami in 2004 .
In the tiny Pondicherry district alone about 600 lives were lost .
But the 10 - meter , or nearly 35 - foot , waves did n’t roll up to the future site of Vellai Thamarai , and the village was spared the worst .
By the time we return , school classes are under way , and the air rings with voices of children shouting out their ABCs .
The young Tamil teachers in dazzling saris instruct the little ones to greet the visitors as we fill the classroom doors and windows .
A few of them are still crying for their parents who ’ve left them for the day .
One or two sleep soundly on mats , others sip warm milk and sugar , still others reach out to shake our hands .
Classes in Indian culture , taught by Ajit or his wife , Selvi , guide us through the thickets of marriage , life in the Aurobindo ashram , techniques of meditation and the Hindu pantheon .
We discuss the future of the school , how the rice and bananas growing on adjacent fields help the bottom line , how financing from the government is sparse and how much the project depends on donors .
The director of the school works without pay .
He and the social worker and even the building superintendent follow the guiding principle of sharing the labor ; many a midday found all of them squatting in the kitchen with the cooks snapping green beans or peeling onions and ginger .
Hierarchy counts for nothing here ; helping one another is everything .
For much of the 20th century , bombings and assassinations have been the tools of ethnic groups fighting for their own nation - states .
The tactics were undeniably brutal , and the consequences global .
One of the most notable terrorist attacks of the century , the 1914 assassination of an Austro - Hungarian Archduke by a nationalist Serb , ignited World War I .
The aims of these groups could be politically delineated .
Bosnian Serbs , for instance , wanted to escape Austro - Hungarian rule and join Serbia , a desire that re-emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 .
The Irish were striving for independence from Britain , as were the Jews living in what was then Palestine .
Disputes about land and power were subject to political negotiation , and for most of these groups , terror ultimately helped them prevail .
As Walter Laqueur , a historian , noted in his 1987 book '' The Age of Terrorism , '' '' To succeed , terrorist demands have to be ' realistic ' ( i.e. limited in character ) . ''
Mr. bin Laden 's loosely organized Al Qaeda movement pursues goals far harder to define or satisfy .
Experts say it is part of a significant trend in which terrorist groups espouse millennial or religious ideologies that transcend politics or national borders .
In his rambling 1997 interview with CNN , Mr. bin Laden said his jihad against the United States would conclude only when Washington withdrew from Saudi Arabia and ended its '' aggressive intervention against Muslims in the whole world . ''
He invoked God and Islamic tradition , and reminded viewers that it was not permissible for non-Muslims to remain as protectors in Saudi Arabia .
He makes clear that his targets include the Egyptian and Saudi Governments , deemed insufficiently devout .
'' If you look at books written about terrorism 25 years ago , religion does n't appear , '' Mr. Laqueur said .
'' Statistics today show that more than half of terrorist activities are committed for religious or pseudo - religious reasons . ''
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Democrat - turned - independent Sen . Joe Lieberman managed to keep his Senate committee chairmanship in part because President - elect Barack Obama did n't want to punish him for supporting Sen. John McCain , Lieberman said Tuesday .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman speaks Tuesday after Democrats allowed him to keep his committee chairmanship .
The Senate Democratic caucus , following a lengthy and often heated debate , voted 42 - 13 Tuesday to let Lieberman continue chairing the Senate Homeland Security Committee .
The caucus did , however , strip Lieberman of his spot on the Environment and Public Works Committee .
A Democrat in the Senate for 18 years before going independent , Lieberman criticized Obama , the Democratic nominee , during the race for the White House .
" I know that my colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus were moved not only that Sen . [ Harry ]
Reid said about my longtime record , but by the appeal from President - elect Obama himself that the nation unite now to confront our very serious problems , " Lieberman said in the Capitol as those colleagues nodded in agreement behind him .
Watch Lieberman express regrets over past statements »
Democrats were angered by Lieberman 's speech to the Republican National Convention , where he praised his longtime friend McCain and criticized Obama for not reaching across the aisle to work with Republicans during his time in the Senate .
Reid , the Senate majority leader , said Lieberman 's criticism of the Democratic nominee had angered him .
" I would defy anyone to be more angry than I was , " he said Tuesday .
" But I also believe that if you look at the problems we face as a nation , is this a time we walk out of here saying , ' Boy did we get even ' ? "
Obama urged Reid privately to let bygones be bygones , sources said .
Reid dismissed vehement criticism of the decision from elements of the party 's more liberal base , which insisted Lieberman be punished .
Sen . Bernie Sanders of Vermont , the Senate 's other independent who regularly caucuses with the Democrats , told CNN's Dana Bash he was one of the 13 who voted against Lieberman because while millions of people worked hard for Obama , Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush 's policies .
But Sen .
Tom Carper of Delaware , one of four Democrats who proposed the motion to allow Lieberman to keep his chairmanship , said the caucus decided that it could forgive if Obama could .
" If Barack can move on , so can we , " Carper said .
Lieberman , of Connecticut , and Sanders consistently vote on most issues with the Democrats , who hold a 51 - 49 majority in the Senate including them .
Democrats picked up six more seats in the election two weeks ago .
Three more still are being contested in Alaska , Georgia and Minnesota .
Winning those three seats and counting Lieberman and Sanders could give Democrats a 60 - seat , filibuster - proof majority , which would allow them to advance legislation at will and prevent Republicans from blocking it from getting to the floor .
After serving three terms as a Democrat , Lieberman lost Connecticut 's Democratic 2006 primary to Ned Lamont , who was helped by bloggers and others angered by Lieberman 's support for the Iraq war .
But Lieberman ran in the general election as an independent and was re-elected .
Lieberman was the Democrats ' 2000 vice presidential nominee , running with Al Gore .
Along with McCain , Lieberman co-sponsored the 2002 resolution that authorized the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has resisted removing troops .
On the campaign trail with McCain this year , Lieberman strongly defended the Republican presidential nominee 's call for staying the course in Iraq .
He endorsed McCain 's bid in December 2007 before the first nominating contest of this year 's election cycle .
Before the convention speech , Lieberman angered Democrats when he said Obama was choosing to lose the Iraq war by planning to withdraw American combat troops .
" If Barack Obama 's policy in Iraq had been implemented , he could n't be in Iraq today , " Lieberman said , referring to a trip Obama was about to make to Iraq .
Lieberman added that Obama " was prepared to accept retreat and defeat . "
CNN 's Dana Bash , Ted Barrett , Evan Glass , John Helton and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .

Skating stunt for a video clip goes wrong as the skater bails out and falls through some roof in front of the cameras rolling .
Last week we showcased some of the more tasty moments from this very strange election season .
This week we have a brand new selection of images created by the prestigious Something Awful Forum Goons , showcasing some of the wilder and untamed moments from the campaign trail .
el Gran Poco is responsible for starting this week 's cavalcade of catastrophe .
Ramaroot is one of those people who had the phone number " 867-5309 " and got totally FUCKED by that one song .
And it 's even worse because his name is Jenny .
el Gran Poco places such a terrible burden upon each of us .

Products marketed for infants or billed as " microwave safe " release toxic doses of the chemical bisphenol A when heated , an analysis by the Journal Sentinel has found .
The newspaper had the containers of 10 items tested in a lab - products that were heated in a microwave or conventional oven .
Bisphenol A , or BPA , was found to be leaching from all of them .
The amounts detected were at levels that scientists have found cause neurological and developmental damage in laboratory animals .
The problems include genital defects , behavioral changes and abnormal development of mammary glands .
The changes to the mammary glands were identical to those observed in women at higher risk for breast cancer .
The newspaper 's test results raise new questions about the chemical and the safety of an entire inventory of plastic products labeled as " microwave safe . "
BPA is a key ingredient in common household plastics , including baby bottles and storage containers .
It has been found in 93 % of Americans tested .
The newspaper tests also revealed that BPA , commonly thought to be found only in hard , clear plastic and in the lining of metal food cans , is present in frozen food trays , microwaveable soup containers and plastic baby food packaging .
Food companies advise parents worried about BPA to avoid microwaving food in plastic containers , especially those with the recycling No. 7 stamped on the bottom .
But the Journal Sentinel 's testing found BPA leaching from containers with different recycling numbers , including Nos. 1 , 2 and 5 .
" There is no such thing as safe microwaveable plastic , " said Frederick vom Saal , a University of Missouri researcher who oversaw the newspaper 's testing .
The American Chemistry Council disputed the findings , saying publishing the results amounts to a " serious disservice by drawing a conclusion about product safety that simply cannot be drawn from either this study or the overall body of scientific research . "
Food company officials say the doses detected in the tests are so low that they are insignificant to human health .
" These levels are EXTREMELY low , " wrote John Faulkner , director of brand communications for Campbell Soup Co. Tests of the company 's Just Heat & Enjoy tomato soup showed its container leached some of the lowest levels of BPA found .
" In fact , you might just be able to find similar levels in plain old tap water due to ' background ' levels .
We are talking 40 to 60 parts per trillion ( ppt ) .
What is 40 to 60 ppt? 40 to 60 seconds in 32,000 years ! "
But the Journal Sentinel identified several peer - reviewed studies that found harm to animals at levels similar to those detected in the newspaper 's tests - in some cases , as low as 25 parts per trillion .
Scientists with an expertise in BPA say the findings are cause for concern , especially considering how vulnerable a baby 's development is and how even tiny amounts of BPA can trigger cell damage .
Harm done during this critical window of development is irreparable and can be devastating , they say .
" This is stuff that should n't be in our babies ' and infants ' bodies , " said Patricia Hunt , a professor at Washington State University who pioneered studies linking BPA to cancer .
Scientists say BPA and other chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system do not act like other toxins that become more potent as their doses increase .
BPA behaves like a hormone .
It mimics estrogen with effects that are ultra-potent .
Even tiny amounts can trigger cell change .
Nira Ben-Jonathan , a professor at the University of Cincinnati whose studies found that BPA interferes with chemotherapy , said the chemical 's effects might not be immediately obvious , but can be devastating over time .
" They used to say DDT was safe , too , " Ben-Jonathan said .
The Journal Sentinel 's tests were done to determine the prevalence of BPA in a typical modern diet for babies and small children .
Based on the test results , the newspaper then estimated the amount of BPA a child might consume and compared it with low - dose amounts of BPA used by researchers in animal studies .
In what is believed to be the first analysis of its kind by a newspaper , the Journal Sentinel found that an average 1 - month - old girl is exposed to the same amount of BPA that caused mammary gland changes in mice .
Those same changes in humans can lead to breast cancer .
Unregulated labels
The label " microwave safe " is stamped on thousands of products sold across the country .
But that is not an official designation regulated by the government .
Companies are able to place it on their products without any official testing by the Food and Drug Administration .
BPA makes its way into food from plastic packaging when those containers are heated .
In the Journal Sentinel 's tests , the highest amounts of leaching were found in two items : a can of Enfamil liquid infant formula and a Rubbermaid plastic food - storage container .
The lowest levels , trace amounts , were found to be leaching from disposable frozen - food containers .
Hunt , the Washington State University scientist , called the levels found leaching from the plastic food - storage containers " real doozies . "
It is likely that the newspaper 's tests underestimated the amounts of BPA that normally would be leaching from reusable products , BPA experts say .
All products the newspaper had tested were new .
Studies show that as products age and are repeatedly heated and washed , they are more likely to leach higher amounts of BPA .
" You ca n't see this happening , " vom Saal said .
" You can't taste it , you can't smell it , but you are getting dosed at a higher and higher amount . "
Also , testers did not examine the food in those containers for BPA levels .
They replaced food with a mixture of water and alcohol , a standard laboratory practice that makes measuring easier and more accurate .
But that also eliminates other variables that are in the food , such as fats and acids that are more likely to encourage BPA to leach .
BPA 's effects also can be magnified by other chemicals in the plastic .
This has been proved in one experiment after another , said vom Saal , who has become a vocal critic of the chemical industry .
While BPA is potentially dangerous to all humans , scientists are especially concerned about how the chemical affects fetuses and newborns , whose systems are not developed .
Babies up to age 12 months or so can't metabolize BPA as efficiently as adults .
But no one is more exposed to BPA than a newborn .
A newborn 's small size means that he or she gets a more concentrated dose of the chemical .
Many products that contain BPA - such as baby bottles , infant formula , some pacifiers and toys - are marketed for mothers and newborns .
Exposure for babies can be exaggerated by the fact that many have diets exclusively made up of liquid baby formula from cans lined with BPA .
Babies who drink liquid formula from bottles made with BPA are effectively getting a super - dose of the chemical , said Hunt , the Washington State University scientist .
The U.S. surgeon general has advised that breast milk is the healthiest food for newborns , though BPA has been found in breast milk , too .
Less than one - third of babies are breastfed until they are 3 months old , and just one in 10 is exclusively breastfed to 6 months , a 2004 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found .
Gail McCarver , a physician at the Medical College of Wisconsin who led the National Toxicology Program 's investigation of BPA earlier this year , declined to be interviewed for this article .
But McCarver said at an FDA hearing in September that she is particularly concerned about premature babies who are exposed to plastic tubing in hospitals .
The government should be protecting the smallest , most vulnerable baby , not just the average child , she said .
Four million babies are born in the United States each year , and roughly 500,000 are born prematurely .
Christina Deppoleto , 36 , of Hartland says she does her best to protect her 18 - month - old son , Carson .
Deppoleto , interviewed recently at the Milwaukee County Zoo , said she was troubled to hear about the newspaper 's test results - especially findings that showed BPA to be leaching from " microwave safe " containers .
" I try to be a good consumer and a good parent , " she said .
" But you have to be able to trust the labels . "
Reviewing scientific studies
The newspaper examined all the published literature on BPA spanning two decades .
A total of 21 studies have looked at effects on mammals at doses that were similar to the amounts found leaching from the products .
All but four concluded that BPA caused damage to animals .
In one 2006 study , pregnant mice were exposed to BPA from the eighth day of pregnancy to the 16th , a period critical for the development of neurons that regulate sexual behavior .
Scientists found the female offspring had fewer such neurons than usual .
Their activity levels dropped and mirrored that of their brothers .
In another experiment , newborn mice were fed BPA at doses common in human diets .
They were found to have changes in the patterns of their mammary glands at the time of puberty .
They had more ducts and duct extensions , more developed fat areas and additional cell changes associated with a more mature gland .
The consequences of this early alteration in breast tissue development are likely to increase vulnerability to breast cancer later in life , the scientists found .
Animals tested were fed BPA through pumps under the skin that regularly administered the chemical .
Some critics say that method exaggerates the chemical 's effects .
But others say it is an acceptable method because newborns are constantly feeding .
Scientists also add that the Journal Sentinel analysis of how much BPA a baby might ingest is just a small window into a child 's typical day of exposure .
Studies have shown the chemical can be absorbed through the skin .
And babies also put items other than food in their mouths , including pacifiers and toys that might contain the chemical .
The findings have disturbed and angered parents and consumer advocates who say the government needs to do a better job of protecting people from potentially harmful chemicals .
" The safety of this compound is in major question , and our government is not taking steps to address this , " said Urvashi Rangan , senior analyst for Consumers Union , a watchdog group that regularly tests products .
" Consumers should n't have to be the guinea pigs here . "
Canada has declared BPA a toxin and is moving to ban it from baby bottles , infant formula and other children 's products .
But U.S. regulators have been conflicted .
The National Toxicology Program has expressed concern about the chemical for fetuses , newborns and young children .
But the FDA has declared it to be safe .
That assessment , however , was found to be flawed , and the FDA since has reopened its examination .
The conflict has further heightened consumer anxiety about how much BPA , if any , is safe .
Bradley Kirschner , a pediatrician at Children 's Hospital of Wisconsin and the father of three young girls , said his patients are increasingly concerned about the chemical .
" If an entire country is banning it , that makes it hard to ignore , " he said .
Parents are confused , he said .
And he is not certain how to advise them .
" If you ask , ' Should a baby sleep on his back ? '
I can tell you what to do , " he said .
" But this is muddy . "
Kirschner said he would like a more definitive answer from U.S. regulators about whether BPA is safe .
Increasingly , consumer groups are calling for BPA to be banned .
Last month , the consumer watchdog Environmental Working Group sent letters to infant formula makers , asking them to stop packaging their products in containers made with BPA .
The attorneys general in New Jersey , Connecticut and Delaware sent letters to 11 companies that make baby bottles and baby formula containers , asking that they voluntarily stop using BPA .
Six U.S. senators have called for a federal ban on the chemical , and more than 35 lawsuits have been filed in recent years against companies using BPA , claiming the chemical has caused physical harm .
Companies are beginning to proactively back away from BPA .
In April , after Canada 's announcement of a ban , several corporations said they would stop producing and selling certain products made with BPA .
The companies and retailers include Nalgene , Wal - Mart , Toys " R " Us , Playtex and CVS pharmacies .
But plenty of products designed for heating food still contain BPA .
Many companies that use BPA now include safety information about the chemical on their Web sites .
But those sites maintain that BPA is safe at low doses .
Their claims are based largely on studies that were paid for by the chemical industry .
Jackie Chesney , a grandmother from Spring Grove , Ill. , said she assumes a certain level of safety in products that are allowed to be sold .
" You should think the things you are using would be safe , " Chesney said as she strolled through the Milwaukee County Zoo with her daughter and grandchildren .
Chesney said things have changed a lot since her children were small .
There is so much more plastic these days , and food is more likely to be individually wrapped , she said .
The proliferation of plastic worries her .
" Yes , it 's handy and convenient , " she said .
" But at what cost ? "
Like so many corporate executives , Ed Meyer dreamed of retiring to the countryside .
And so , seven years ago , he and his wife , Sally , left Cape Town to settle on the 3,500 - acre ranch that had been in Ed ’s family since 1916 .
It ’s not hard to see what fueled the dream .
Their Cape Dutch - style farmhouse , all curved gables and whitewashed walls , is perched on rust - colored savanna , dusted with the scent of 50 species of blooming aloe .
The view from their lawn is an oil painting of gentle hills , puffy clouds and long shadows .
“ This is such a beautiful , tranquil valley , ” Ed says , digging into a lunch of kudu pie , hot from Sally ’s oven .
The kudu was a gift ; the antelope “ was encroaching on our neighbor ’s fruit trees . ”
But their peaceful retirement was interrupted a little over a year ago when Andries Mahlungu , a gardener in nearby Marble Hall , said the farm belonged to him .
In a formal claim with the government , he contended that his ancestors were there first .
Now the white couple and the black man are locked in a battle over the farm -- and , in a sense , over the past and future of South Africa .
The legal pillars of white minority rule came tumbling down with South Africa ’s first democratic elections almost 15 years ago , and the oldest of those laws was the Natives Land Act , which had severely restricted black land ownership since 1913 .
The challenge that the new black - majority government faced was how to restore land to blacks , in a legal and orderly way , without creating a panic that would drive whites off productive farms and destroy the country ’s economy -- a scenario that was soon to strangle neighboring Zimbabwe .
The solution the government came up with was to create a Commission on Restitution of Land Rights to adjudicate land claims and , when valid , compensate the current owners .
So far , the commission has settled about 75,000 of 80,000 claims , returning hundreds of thousands of acres to blacks and paying white farmers market rates that have totaled more than $ 2 billion .
With the deadline for filing claims now past , the government has pledged to settle the 5,000 outstanding claims in the next two years .
But the commission is running short of money , and many of the remaining claims , like Mahlungu ’s against the Meyers ’ property , are being hotly contested .
All across post - colonial Africa , governments have struggled to correct past injustices , with mixed results .
In Zimbabwe , violent land seizures have driven away white farmers and sent the economy into a tailspin of mind - boggling inflation and catastrophic food shortages .
The South African government vowed to carefully investigate land claims and provide fair compensation to white farmers .
Many of the country ’s 40,000 white farmers willingly sold their property .
Even so , the effect on the country ’s agricultural economy has not been overwhelmingly positive .
Whereas the global trend is toward larger , more commercially successful farms , South Africa is breaking many of its large farms into smaller , less economically efficient pieces to meet the claims of new black farmers .
Partly as a result , South Africa in the last year has gone from a net exporter of food to a net importer .
And , in another worrying trend , some of the whites who sold their farms have been recruited by other African countries , where their skills are much in demand .
Now once - impoverished countries such as Mozambique are becoming more self - sufficient -- and taking a share of South Africa ’s export market .
Piet Kemp is the regional manager for the Transvaal Agricultural Union , which represents mostly white farmers in the province that includes the Meyer farm .
He is skeptical of many of the land claims .
“ You have a family that has farmed for 150 years and then you have a guy who worked on the farm for 12 or 15 years suddenly making a claim , ” he says .
“ It ’s not right .
But in the end , many farmers do n’t want to fight , so they sell . ”
In some cases , whites have sold their farms without a fight because a neighboring property was divided into small pieces for multiple black owners ;
Kemp says the whites felt it would be too difficult to run their farm “ next to a squatter camp . ”
In other cases , farmers have agreed to sell but the government has been slow to finalize the purchase .
“ Much of the farming has come to a complete stop , ” Kemp says .
“ In the end , we ’ll be the same as Zimbabwe . ”
Molefe Pulane , a spokeswoman for the national land claims office , acknowledges that the process is slow , hobbled in part by a corruption scandal at the Land Bank , which provides money for the purchases .
“ It ’s not going well , ” she says .
“ There are some problems , and we ’re addressing them . ”
But the land rights commission maintains that the country ’s redistribution of land is playing an important role in alleviating poverty and allowing the black majority , who outnumber whites 8 to 1 , to fully participate in the country ’s economy .
“ Everyone has got an obligation to ensure that there is restorative justice for those who suffered the loss of their rights to land in the country of their birth , ” the commission said in a recent statement .
“ It can not be business as usual until all the victims are compensated for their loss . ”
But as the Meyer case illustrates , it has n’t always gone smoothly .
The Meyers ’ land makes up just over half of a 6,000 - acre ranch known as Welverdiend , a name that means “ well earned ” in Afrikaans .
The other half is divided among four other white owners , who are also fighting to keep the land .
Mahlungu contends that his ancestors grazed their cattle on the entire farm .
Ed Meyer ’s grandfather , the son of a Lutheran missionary from Germany , bought his parcel from a white Afrikaner family nearly a century ago .
At the time , World War I was just beginning and , as a German immigrant in a British - controlled country , Meyer ’s grandfather figured the remote ranch -- in those days a three - day journey from Johannesburg -- would keep him and his family safely out of the government ’s sight .
Meyer ’s father built a cottage on the land in 1944 and later retired here .
When his father died in 1998 , Ed was running a company headquartered in Cape Town .
In 2001 , with their children grown , Ed and Sally retired to the farm , where Ed , now 67 , runs 700 head of cattle .
“ We wanted to spend our so - called golden years here , ” says Ed , a genial man with a shock of thick gray hair and a face burned brown by the sun .
“ I must say it ’s been a lot of fun . ”
But the Meyers ’ life suddenly was turned upside down when they learned that Mahlungu , a 59 - year - old father of five who earns about $ 550 a month working as a gardener , had filed a claim on the land .
Mahlungu ’s grandfather and father had been employed as workers on Welverdiend , from 1938 to 1955 , and Mahlungu had lived there as a youngster .
Mahlungu contends that his ancestors were grazing cattle on Welverdiend long before white Afrikaners made their trek here from the cape in the 1700s .
Mahlungu recalls his father saying that , generations before , the land had belonged to them .
“ My ancestors are buried there at Welverdiend , ” he says .
His claim illustrates the challenge the government faces in these cases .
No records exist from that long ago , and the land claims office often has to make its determination based on such things as old gravestones and the oral history passed from generation to generation .
Darius Masanabo , a project officer for the regional land claims office , investigated Mahlungu ’s claim a few months ago , and based his conclusion primarily on headstones he found on the ranch .
“ We inspected every part of that area , ” Masanabo says .
“ And the graves were there .
The man who made the claim is a direct descendant of the original farmers of the land .
It ’s a valid claim .
The Mahlungu family was there before the Afrikaners came . ”
Masanabo says he ’s sympathetic to the Meyers ’ situation .
“ They do n’t remember Mr. Mahlungu , and they were not the people who first evicted Mr. Mahlungu ’s ancestors , ” Masanabo says .
But , he adds flatly , “ if they keep on saying the claim is not valid , [ their land ] will be expropriated . ”
The Meyers acknowledge that the old grave sites on the ranch include Africans as well as the original Afrikaner owners .
But they contend that the dates on the graves , rubbed bare by the passage of time , are far from solid proof that whites drove blacks from this land .
In addition , they believe the land claims inspectors are predisposed to side with the claimants in such cases , flouting the protections for whites and other minorities that Nelson Mandela enshrined in the South African Constitution .
“ This goes against everything Madiba has stood for , ” Sally Meyer says , using the honorary title of elders in Mandela ’s clan .
“ The constitution just becomes another wishful dream . ”
A few months ago , Mahlungu , joined by some of the 27 relatives who now are part of his claim , met with the Meyers and Masanabo , the land claims official , to discuss the dispute .
“ These are difficult farm owners , ” Masanabo says of the Meyers .
“ They claim to understand but they do n’t .
The Mahlungu family was there before the Afrikaners came .
Some of the Afrikaners came to these farms with only a single cow .
They milked the cows belonging to the blacks and drove them away . ”
An expensive court fight is now likely .
The Meyers say they ’re worried about the fate of the black ranch hands who live on the property if they ’re forced to sell .
“ We ’re fortunate enough to have a home elsewhere that we could move into , ” Ed says .
“ But these farmworkers do n’t .
We ’re fighting for ourselves , but also for the people who have shown us loyalty . ”
But Mahlungu says he would allow the Meyers as well as the ranch hands to remain .

" This is a first .
Although I 've arranged to have several heirloom photographs preserved over the years , I 've never before experienced the level of satisfaction that I feel now that I 've received the photo of my maternal grandparents ' wedding back from Restoration by Heart .
And I am impressed not only by remarkable techniques of the artist who performed the service so that his work blends invisibly with the original , but also by the manner in which the service was arranged .
My naive questions were treated with consideration , and the available treatments and their prices were clearly explained so that I could proceed with the assurance that the work would be carefully done .
Even so , I could not have guessed that the work could have been so perfectly done as Restoration by Heart has managed to do it .
I 'm beyond pleased . "

Two words :
Bjork
Bacon
... mmmm .
Bjork with bacon .
... I could watch her all day .
... and bacon would make it all perfect .
... we could share the bacon , and play with it , in sunny , fragrant hillside fields of jonquils and lavender .
... and I could listen to her explain the pleasure of bacon , and why she 's not afraid of it because she read that Danish bacon book .
... and she could explain many more things about what I like .
That would be fine .
... yes , it is xanadu .
... Bjork and bacon .

Feeling nostalgic for the days of 17 cent gas in 1931 , 20 cent gas during WWI , the gas below 30 cents during the first half of the 1950s , or the $ 1.40 gas of the early 1980s ?
If so , you 'd be suffering from " money illusion , " the tendency to confuse nominal and real ( inflation - adjusted ) prices .
Gas is cheaper today in real dollars than any of those past prices .
The chart above displays real gas prices going back to 1919 ( EIA data here ) , showing that the current national average price of $ 2.12 is below the price of gas during the entire decades of the 1920s , 1930s , 1940s , 1950s , about the same as the average price during the entire 1960s , below the average price during the 1970s , and below the average real price of gas during the entire 1919 - 2008 period ( $ 2.36 ) .
In a guest article , Alan Greenspan says banks will need much thicker capital cushions than they had before the bust
Greenspan Associates
Alan Greenspan was the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1987 to 2006 .
He is now president of Greenspan Associates
GLOBAL financial intermediation is broken .
That intricate and interdependent system directing the world 's saving into productive capital investment was severely weakened in August 2007 .
The disclosure that highly leveraged financial institutions were holding toxic securitised American subprime mortgages shocked market participants .
For a year , banks struggled to respond to investor demands for larger capital cushions .
But the effort fell short and in the wake of the Lehman Brothers default on September 15th 2008 , the system cracked .
Banks , fearful of their own solvency , all but stopped lending .
Issuance of corporate bonds , commercial paper and a wide variety of other financial products largely ceased .
Credit - financed economic activity was brought to a virtual standstill .
The world faced a major financial crisis .
For decades , holders of the liabilities of banks in the United States had felt secure with the protection of a modest equity - capital cushion , allowing banks to lend freely .
As recently as the summer of 2006 , with average book capital at 10 % , a federal agency noted that “ more than 99 % of all insured institutions met or exceeded the requirements of the highest regulatory capital standards . ”
Today , fearful investors clearly require a far larger capital cushion to lend , unsecured , to any financial intermediary .
When bank book capital finally adjusts to current market imperatives , it may well reach its highest levels in 75 years , at least temporarily ( see chart ) .
It is not a stretch to infer that these heightened levels will be the basis of a new regulatory system .
The three - month LIBOR / Overnight Index Swap ( OIS ) spread , a measure of market perceptions of potential bank insolvency and thus of extra capital needs , rose from a long - standing ten basis points in the summer of 2007 to 90 points by that autumn .
Though elevated , the LIBOR / OIS spread appeared range - bound for about a year up to mid-September 2008 .
The Lehman default , however , drove LIBOR / OIS up markedly .
It reached a riveting 364 basis points on October 10th .
The passage by Congress of the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Programme ( TARP ) on October 3rd eased , but did not erase , the post - Lehman surge in LIBOR / OIS .
The spread apparently stalled in mid-November and remains worryingly high .
How much extra capital , both private and sovereign , will investors require of banks and other intermediaries to conclude that they are not at significant risk in holding financial institutions ' deposits or debt , a precondition to solving the crisis ?
The insertion , last month , of $ 250 billion of equity into American banks through TARP ( a two - percentage - point addition to capital - asset ratios ) halved the post - Lehman surge of the LIBOR / OIS spread .
Assuming modest further write - offs , simple linear extrapolation would suggest that another $ 250 billion would bring the spread back to near its pre-crisis norm .
This arithmetic would imply that investors now require 14 % capital rather than the 10 % of mid-2006 .
Such linear calculations , of course , can only be very rough approximations .
But recent data do suggest that , while helpful , the Treasury 's $ 250 billion goes only partway towards the levels required to support renewed lending .
Government credit has in effect acted as counterparty to a large segment of the financial intermediary system .
But for reasons that go beyond the scope of this note , I strongly believe that the use of government credit must be temporary .
What , then , will be the source of the new private capital that allows sovereign lending to be withdrawn ?
Eventually , the most credible source is a partial restoration of the $ 30 trillion of global stockmarket value wiped out this year , which would enable banks to raise the needed equity .
Markets are being suppressed by a degree of fear not experienced since the early 20th century ( 1907 and 1932 come to mind ) .
Human nature being what it is , we can count on a market reversal , hopefully , within six months to a year .
Though capital gains cannot finance physical investment , they can replenish balance - sheets .
This can best be seen in the context of the consolidated balance - sheet of the world economy .
All debt and derivative claims are offset in global accounting consolidation , but capital is not .
This leaves the market value of the world 's real physical and intellectual assets reflected as capital .
Obviously , higher global stock prices will enlarge the pool of equity that can facilitate the recapitalisation of financial institutions .
Lower stock prices can impede the process .
A higher level of equity , of course , makes it easier to issue debt .
Another critical price for the return of global financial stability is that of American homes .
Those prices are likely to stabilise next year and with them the levels of home equity — the ultimate collateral for global holdings of American mortgage - backed securities , some toxic .
Home - price stabilisation will help clarify the market value of financial institutions ' assets and therefore more closely equate the size of their book capital with the realities of market pricing .
That should help stabilise their stock prices .
The eventual partial recovery of global equities , as fear inevitably dissipates , should do the rest .
Temporary public capital injections into banks would facilitate this process and arguably provide far more benefit per dollar than conventional fiscal stimulus .
Even before the market linkages among banks , other financial institutions and non-financial businesses are fully re-established , we will need to start unwinding the massive sovereign credit and guarantees put in place during the crisis , now estimated at $ 7 trillion .
The economics of such a course are fairly clear .
The politics of draining off that much credit support in a timely way is quite another matter .

The Republican Dictionary As Necessary Today As It Was During the Bush Years
This was the website for the Republican Dictionary .
The Republican Dictionary ( RD ) was created to document the highly skilled twisting of the English language by the Republican Party and the inevitable hypocrisy that comes with it .
Content is from the site 's 2007 archived pages .
Enjoy an entertaining read and perhaps begin to understand what the Republicans were really saying in 2007 .
about the republican dictionary
Ever wonder what President Bush means when he says " freedom is on the march ? "
Now you do n't have to !
Party strategists have successfully modified terms like " family values " , " bias " , and " personal responsibility " in the minds of Americans from their basic literal meanings into campaign slogans or code words for specific policy positions of the Republican Party .
Who can doubt , for example , that the phrase " support the troops " has been so well controlled by Republicans that their political opponents hesitate to even utter this seemingly non-partisan phrase for fear of mimicking the Republican platform ?
This in turn makes it relatively simple for Republicans to accuse Democrats and Liberals of not caring about our soldiers , even as Republicans cut funding for veteran 's benefits and military housing .
At the very least , such language - crafting is a means to increase public support for Republican policies by describing them with deceptive terms .
At most , it is a campaign to modify the English language to have favorable terms be synonymous with Republican policies and negative terms be labels for the opposition ( call it Newspeak ? ) .
For example , the term " compassion " recently began its redefinition in the 2000 presidential campaign with George W. Bush 's platform of " compassionate conservatism " .
And who could forget Donald Rumsfeld gushing about the " humanity " of the U.S. military 's latest death - dealing technology at the outset of the Iraq War ?
Oh , the humanity !
Central to this campaign is the deliberate targetting of political messages directly into the emotional subconscious and the reactionary reptilian brain in order to circumvent critical thinking and more easily manipulate the American people into holding ludicrous and often contradictory beliefs ( call it doublethink ? ) .
As master Republican language crafter Frank Luntz said : " 80 % of our life is emotion and only 20 % is intellect .
I am much more interested in how you feel than how you think . "
1
Among other things , Luntz can be credited with advising Republicans to call the estate tax the " death tax " , change " global warming " to " climate change " , " tax cuts " to " tax relief " , and refer to the war in Iraq not as the " War in Iraq " , but as the " War on Terror " .
These and other simple language adjustments serve to modify public opinion for policies as needed without actually modifying the policies themselves .
Hmm , Iraq ?
Why would we start a war with them ?
They had nothing to do with 9 - 11 .
Oh , wait - You say it 's the War on Terror ?
Count me in !
Similarly , when the Bush Administration decided to push an anti-terrorism law enforcement act through Congress , it was not called the Anti-Terrorism Law Enforcement Act .
Such an accurate and honest description might have caused Americans to wonder how law enforcement activites would be modified in order to fight terrorism , and perhaps feel the need to know its contents .
Instead , the Justice Department called it the USA PATRIOT Act , appealing to our national pride and desire to support our country , and slam - dunked it through Congress and the American people without hardly anyone even reading it .
Easy as pie .
And if someone decided to read it , or even worse - gasp !
- criticize it , they must not be patriots !
Yes that 's it - they hate America !
The subsequent VICTORY Act , PROTECT Act , No Child Left Behind Act , and other government initiatives continue this trend , not the least of which being a war sold to the American people as a necessity to disarm a dictator called " Operation Iraqi Freedom " .
With such a simple and powerful tool at the government 's disposal , why stop at simply starting wars and passing laws ?
Why not amend that irritatingly secular Constitution to make it more consistent with the right - wing brand of Christianity ?
In order to institutionalize discrimination against homosexuals in America 's most sacred legal document , a constitutional amendment designed to prevent homosexuals from getting married would not be called the Anti Homosexual Marriage Amendment .
With that label , many people might get the unfortunate impression that American citizens should have equal protection under law regardless of their sexual orientation .
Therefore , it is called the Defense of Marriage Amendment .
With such an appeal to the reptilian brain , Americans are frightened into thinking that same - sex marriage is some kind of an attack on their own , and so they must act to prevent evil homosexuals from destroying their family .
Bar the doors , Honey !
The homos are coming to tear us apart !
In the near future , perhaps we can expect initiatives like the HAPPY CHILDREN
Act to slash funding for public education , the War On Evil and Bad Stuff to invade Canada and privatize their water supply , and the Super Duper Freedom Increasing Amendment to prohibit public demonstrations against government policies .
After all , you do n't hate freedom , do you ?

Right - wing embarrassment is actually a victory
The recent embarrassment ( that is , if they are capable ) of the right - wing blogosphere over their invented controversy about a recent AP story is actually a chilling and gruesome victory .
In November , the AP reported a story , citing an Iraqi police officer named Hussein as a source , that six people were shot and burned at a Sunni mosque in a particularly ghastly incident of the sectarian violence occurring in Iraq .
The U.S. Military and Iraqi government initially raised doubts about this supposed Hussein and the right - wing blogosphere used those doubts as a launching pad for their lunatic journey into the conspiracy theory that the AP had invented Hussein as a means to spread false information about the conditions in Iraq .
This is just what the right - wingnuts have needed for years - proof , even if derived from only one report among thousands , that everything in Iraq is going just dandy and that all the negative reporting is a product of liberal terrorist - loving bias and outright lies .
Just yesterday , however , the Iraqi government not only stated that this police officer does in fact exist , but that he might be arrested for speaking to the press without authorization .
One might think the right - wing blogosphere would suffer a propaganda defeat with a solid debunking of their most precious story .
But the message it sends Iraqis is different than the message it sends us here sitting safely at our computers in the United States .
While we chuckle at yet another incident of the wingnuts whipping themselves into a frenzy over something that they essentially pulled out of their ass , Iraqis who would 've felt tempted to speak to reporters might now instead feel more inclined to keep their mouths shut for fear of being exposed .
That is the message sent by the right - wing blogs :
If you speak to the media without government authorization , we will not rest until you are found and arrested .
If you fail to conform to the government - approved narrative of an Iraq getting better and better everyday with the promise of stable democracy , we will hound the press until you are exposed and placed in danger from retribution , possibly in the form of torture and murder , from militia groups you might have angered with your statements .
The right - wing blogosphere should be patting themselves on the back for sending out a warning to Iraqis : Keep your goddamn mouths shut and look happy for the cameras .
Edwards gets off to a Bushy start
Nice going , John .
Just when we thought George W. Bush was the king of photo - ops , what do we get to see when one of our favorite presidential hopefuls announces his run ?
You , wearing blue jeans and shoveling dirt with some - surprise !
- young black guys .
Note to John :
The tough workin ' man look would have been more effective if you were n't wearing your blackberry .
Do n't get us wrong , we 're aware of the unfortunate fact that in product advertising , images are frequently more important than words ( you being the product ) .
But your campaign team does n't seem to know the difference between effective stage decorations and a blatantly fake photo - op .
You see , this is the kind of thing we liberals ( your potential base ) are so sick of seeing for the past six years .
For us , such crafted images like these are indicative of a politician who puts image before substance and who thinks his target audience are a bunch of morons .
We 're not morons .
When we saw George W. Bush get out of a freakin ' navy jet in a flight suit , we hurled .
When we saw him trimming brush on his fantasy camp ranch and practically tripping over his own cowboy boots , we laughed our asses off .
And when he commandeered a group a firefighters for the sole purpose of posing with them with his sleeves rolled up after Katrina , we got pissed - really pissed .
Some in your campaign team may struggle with the difference between effective imagery and ridiculous photo - ops , and the line between the two is n't exactly crystal clear .
But here 's my best guess as to one of the basics :
When you are actually fabricating events for the sole purpose of having pictures taken of them , you 're crossing the line .
We all know George W. Bush is not a pilot , he does n't work on his ranch when cameras are n't present , and he was n't about to go save people from a burning building after the hurricane .
And yes , we know this shoveling business was n't for real .
It 's only for show - everyone knows it and it makes you look stupid .
We wo n't be voting for you for your shoveling technique - we'd be voting for you for your policies designed to prevent another community from being buried in the first place .
We 'll tolerate you posing in front of monuments and flags .
We wo n't even mind too much if you find some " Made in the U.S.A. " boxes for a backdrop like Bush did , but unless you plan on switching parties and battling McCain for the Republican nomination , do n't insult our intelligence .
If you want our vote , John , you 're going to have to get real , and fast .
The latest insight into the brain of George W. Bush
" I 've got so much on my mind , and this job is so exciting that it 's really hard to settle down and plan the next 10 years of our life . "
People 's interviewer also mentioned that readers had asked if he takes sleep aids .
Bush said generally not , but he does occasionally when he travels .
" I must tell you , I 'm sleeping a lot better than people would assume , " he said .
He said he drinks a couple of cups of coffee in the morning and drinks a lot of water and , of course , no alcohol .
" I do n't drink alcohol .
I can remember when I used to drink , I had trouble sleeping at night , " the President said .

Republicans dust off their " box turtle "
Newly elected Congressman from Minnesota and muslim Keith Ellison prefers that he take the Oath of Office with the Quran instead of the Bible .
This seems like a non-issue in a society that cheers freedom of religion as a central tenet of our national character .
And , of course , it happens to be in the First Amendment of that pesky Bill of Rights .
But predictably , right wing champions such as Sean Hannity and Dennis Prager are doing their best to help us understand that freedom sounds good on paper , but practicing it is dangerous .
In the video linked below at C&L ; you will see Sean Hannity warn that allowing officials to swear on the Quran could lead to someone wanting to swear on Hitler 's Mein Kampf !
This is because Hannity is incapable of defending his weak opinion that Ellison should not be allowed to swear on the Quran , so he instead changes the argument completely from the actual to the hypothetical in order to artificially weaken his opponent 's position into one of defending the use of Hitler 's infamous manifesto instead of a perfectly legitimate holy book of a religion held by billions of people .
This is one of the standard debate tactics used by right wing pundits when they know their argument is weak and must therefore change their opponent 's position into one even weaker than their own using dishonest hypotheticals .
It 's the same with Tucker Carlson and his famous argument that allowing same - sex marriage could lead to people wanting to marry box turtles .
Carlson can't defend his position with reason and logic , so he demands that supporters of same - sex marriage defend the marriage of people to box turtles instead .
He ends up looking reasonable in comparison .
Unfortunately this tactic usually works .
As you can see , Hannity 's guest , Mr. Shabazz , tries to deflect the analogy with a brief comment , walking right into Hannity 's trap and prompting Hannity to jump on Shabazz as if he were ducking a legitimate question .
This effectively put Shabazz on the defensive with a verbal sleight - of - hand when before he had the clearly stronger position in a no - brainer of an issue .
Bon Appetit !

Karl Rove Jumps the Shark
We have finally seen the inevitable failure of the Rovian strategy
The words " attack , attack , attack " have been uttered by many to describe the central tenet of Karl Rove 's campaign strategy .
He never plays defense , no matter what comes his way .
If his candidate is attacked , he responds with a stronger attack .
If his opponent has an edge on the issues , he never attempts to bolster his candidate 's positions , but instead attacks his opponent with personal smears and dirty tricks .
This strategy has worked with tremendous success in the past , but has finally met its inevitable fate .
If the game of politics can be described with war metaphors , which it is by pretty much everybody , then a strategy built around " attack , attack , attack " can be equated with constantly moving the front line forward , never retreating or holding position .
This " front line " of Rove 's has been constantly moving forward for the past six years , and in the literal world means that the Republican Party 's political rhetoric has gotten stronger and stronger to the point of finally jumping the shark into the realm of mind - blowingly ludicrous .
A few years ago , Republican politicians would never have gone so far as to suggest that Democrats want the terrorists to win .
Such allusions would have been considered highly offensive and way beyond the pale .
But Karl Rove and his lieutenants kept moving their front line forward until we finally saw what would eventually rear its ugly ass : Republicans openly and with a straight face practically accusing the Democrats of working in concert with the terrorists to achieve their shared agenda of attacking American values .
Orrin Hatch said the terrorists were laying low and hoping for a Democratic victory in order to strike , Donald Rumsfeld said that the terrorists in Iraq were increasing their violence in order to help the Democrats win elections , Dick Cheney equated the likely Democratic win to the terrorists successfully breaking the will of the American people , and every Republican from sea to shining sea clung desperately to their Rovian talking points designed to suggest that Democrats are cowards who want to surrender to Al Qaeda .
There is a depressingly large percentage of stupid , gullible voters in this country who will believe every talking point fed to them by Fox News and Clear Channel and obediently given the legitimacy of equal time by the rest of the mainstream media .
Karl
Rove knows this more than anybody .
But his tactics unintentionally caused many of these otherwise stupid people to have moments of clarity .
Ca n't you just picture it :
The loyal Sean Hannity fan driving in his car and considering for a moment how ridiculous it is for someone to suggest that the majority of Americans who criticize the war rejoice at the deaths of U.S. soldiers and want nothing more than terrorists to come to the United States and kill innocent people .
Maybe this moment of clarity opened up this guy 's mind to different opinions , or maybe it simply caused him to skip the long lines on Election Day and go straight home .
The Democrats did n't so much win this election as allow the Republicans to lose .
The Republican attack , attack , attack strategy finally became predictable for them , so they simply opened their ranks and allowed the Republican front line to march right on through and then jump over the cliff that always seems to be at the Democratic Party 's feet .
Hopefully the Democrats will learn from this .
They were smart enough not to defend themselves against the more ridiculous attacks by claiming that they do not in fact chuckle over their lattes whenever a U.S. soldier is killed by a terrorist .
They did respond however , as they must no matter how baseless the charge - a lesson they should hold dear after the Great Swiftboating of 2004 , but they were most effective when simply pointing out how insane the Republican political messages had become .
With their latest national campaign ad , the Republican Party has become the largest distributor of Al Qaeda video propaganda in the United States hoping to accomplish with it what the terrorists do : scare the shit out of as many people as possible with the goal of inhibiting rational thought and bending them to their will .
But just like Americans stood up fearless against the terrorists after 9 - 11 , yesterday we stood up fearless against the Republican Party 's fear campaign and said , " Fuck you , I am not afraid . "

A couple responses to less than stellar opinion pieces from the Right
First , Wal - Mart Drives Democrats Batty by National Review Online 's Brainiac At Large Jonah Goldberg , who borrows the tired use of " Bush haters " to craft " Wal - mart haters " as a means to characterize Wal - mart critics as blindly irrational crybabies .
This article is particularly stupid .
I highly recommend it .
Response :
Dear National Review ,
I am concerned for the perceived relevance of NRO regarding your news organization 's retention of the services of Jonah Goldberg .
His latest article , Wal - Mart Drives Democrats Batty , is proof of Mr. Goldberg 's lack of vigilance in participating in the Republican Party 's most current political machinations .
Supporting such incompetent leaders requires constant adaptation , and " Bush - haters " is so 2003 .
This particular political manipulation certainly had its value .
If you can effectively characterize critics of the Bush administration as simply having a mental illness , you can discredit everything they say without offering a rational counter argument .
After all , why argue with them ?
They 're crazy !
Nonetheless , this talking point has come and gone , despite Mr. Goldberg 's best efforts to assist President Bush , who , if poll numbers are any indication , is apparently a rather lonely sane man living in a nation populated by a majority of crazy people .
But Goldberg has also decided to lend this particular method of manipulation to his hero of the poor , Wal - Mart .
Mr. Goldberg is certainly an intelligent man ; I doubt NRO would publish his work otherwise .
But perhaps a consideration of Wal - Mart beyond a brief perusal of the corporation 's own website would assist Mr. Goldberg in understanding why an increasing number of Americans are falling under the influence of " Wal - Mart Derangement Syndrome . "
If I were under such influence , and hence unable to form rational thought , I might actually wonder how Wal - Mart is able to sell products for such cheap prices .
Just in case Mr. Goldberg reads this , I will make the case brief in order not to offend his short attention span due of course to his highly intelligent and active mind .
Wal - Mart is a colossus of American retail who can use its influence to force producers to sell their products to Wal - Mart at cheaper and cheaper prices .
In any business , the highest operating costs are payroll .
Therefore Wal - Mart is taking part , albeit indirectly , in the falling American working - class wage .
And since Wal - Mart can address nearly all purchasing needs of a community at cheaper prices , local businesses are doomed to fail when Wal - Mart comes to town .
When local businesses fold , the profits for doing business no longer stay in the community , but are shipped to Bentonville , Arkansas .
As a result , the economies of local communities are depressed as Wal - Mart works to realize its utopia - a nation of small communities in which everyone works at Wal - Mart , earns the small Wal - Mart wage , and can therefore only afford to shop at Wal - Mart .
Mr. Goldberg 's unimaginative mind , perhaps stricken with Jonah Goldberg 's disease , seems incapable of a train of thought longer than 5 seconds , which can only produce such simple conclusions as : Wal - Mart is cheap , therefore Wal - Mart is good for the poor .
I encourage NRO to more adequately review Mr. Goldberg 's work before embarrassing yourselves further .
Yours ,

And ' Islamic Fascism ' : What 's The Issue ? , an article by Weekly Standard contributor Joseph Loconte defending the Bush administration 's new creative use of the word fascism .
Response :
Dear Mr. Loconte ,
In your recent article , ' Islamic Fascism ' : What 's The Issue ? , you fail to address the actual definition of fascism and whether or not it is correctly applied to Islamic extremists .
This is the main contention with this new use of the word fascism , and not whether it hurts people 's feelings as you imply .
The Nazi brand of fascism does indeed share a few traits with today 's Islamic extremists such as its high degree of nationalism ( of a sort ) and its anti-liberalism and anti-individualism .
But most surely agree that fascism is not fascism without strong elements of corporatism - a marriage of government and powerful moneyed interests , usually corporate .
This aspect of Hitler 's fascism was attractive to many American business interests in FDR 's day , and seems all but an unofficial aspect of our own government with the massive influence that corporations have in Washington through campaign funding , lobbying , and the revolving door of corporate personnel serving as government officials , most significantly displayed by Dick Cheney 's adventure as Secretary of Defense , Halliburton CEO , then Vice President .
The application of the term " fascism " to the extremists of the Islamic world is grossly inaccurate and rightfully invites not only criticism , but questions about the motives behind this supposed attempt to redefine the word , especially when Donald Rumsfeld recently compared critics of the administration 's Iraq war policy to Nazi appeasers .
I also take particular exception to your implication in the last paragraph ( perhaps unintended ) that critics of the Bush administration 's use of the word fascism are somehow trying to minimize and ignore the threat of Islamic extremism .
This is also incorrect .
Yours ,
Ian Watson
Condi Rice 's " Birth Pangs " is a Rapture reference
Condi Rice 's infamous words on July 21 , 2006 :
" But I have no interest in diplomacy for the sake of returning Lebanon and Israel to the status quo ante .
I think it would be a mistake .
What we 're seeing here , in a sense , is the growing -- the birth pangs of a new Middle East . "
What a strange way to describe such extreme human suffering and violence .
Then again , it turns out our Secretary of State is n't the only one to use " birth pangs " in such an interesting way .
" Birth pangs " is a common term among End Timers to describe the turmoil that precedes the tribulation and rapture supposedly foretold by biblical prophecy :
From Pastor Ron Graff at Bible- prophecy.com :
BEGINNING OF BIRTH PAINS - Matthew 24:4-8
This is a picture of the times in which we are living .
This is the generation which has seen the rebirth of the nation of Israel , exactly as prophesied in Ezekiel , chapters 36 and 37 ...
The events of this period of time are like the onset of labor pains .
They are strong enough to let the mother know that the time of birth is near , but they are not as severe as they will be later .
Thus , the dreadful events of the Tribulation are prefigured by many smaller versions of the same things before the intense trouble of the Tribulation actually begins .
From Tribulation Forces , Signs of the times and Bible prophecy :
There are two periods that Jesus taught about the end of times .
During the first period we will experience the " birth pangs " , , and which are setting the stage , so to speak of things to come .
The second period will be the actual " signs " of the end .
Here are the " birth pangs " ( again , NOT signs of the end ) :
- Israel becomes a country again .
In 1948 Israel became a nation again for the first time in 1500 years .
- In 1967 after the 6 - Day War , Israel regained control of Jerusalem .
- Many people will claim to be the Christ ( the Messiah ) Since 1900 alone there have been over 1100 public figures claiming to be Christ .
- Among them Sun Myung Moon , Maharaj Ji and countless others .
- People will be decieved by these fakers .
- Wars and Rumors of wars , revolutions .
Since World War II there have been over 170 limited scope conflicts .
- Famines , earthquakes , pestilences .
Billions of people go to bed hungry each night .
Just view the happenings in Africa .
- The number of earthquakes has increased in both numbers and intensity within the last 30 years .
From 1960 to 1979 there were over 64 earthquakes measuring over 6.0 on the richter scale .
From 1980 to present there have been over 200 .
Compared to even the early 1900s when there was only 8 in a 30 year period .
- Nations and kingdoms at war .
It seems that on any given day somewhere in the world there is an ongoing armed conflict .
From Rapture Ready :
The unending avalanche of catastrophes has convinced me that they are part of the end - time warning signs called the birth pangs .
The Bible predicts they will increase in frequency as we get closer to the tribulation hour .
I expect the world media will soon be covering new calamities in the coming months .
The birth pang factor is not the only end - time indicator at work today .
Jesus told
His disciples that apathy would also be the calling card of His return .
In the Book of Mathew , the Lord repeated himself four times in the space of a few verses .
He obviously was trying to make a point of how slothfulness will relate to the last days .
And from the Rapture Ready Forums :
Guess what folks :
The birth pangs are still coming
pains ( sic ) are still coming .
Some thought things had quieted down for now but it looks like we were just in a lull before the next hard contraction .
With all that 's going on is the world today , it looks like the rider on the white horse of Revelation is busy taking peace from the earth .
Are we next .
We seen a glimpse of it in N.O .
Now its like a wild fire that 's spreading over the earth as people seemly goes nuts .
From a piece called Eschatology , Different Rapture Views by Greg Rugh :
" Essential to this view is the division of the Seventieth Week into three major , distinct , and identifiable periods of time ;
The beginning of " birth pangs , " the " great tribulation , " and " the day of the Lord . "
Ibid . p. 223
And finally from Max Blumenthal 's piece in The Nation , Birth Pangs of a New Christian Zionism , but he does n't mention Rice 's statement :
Brog 's recently published book , Standing with Israel : Why Christians Support the Jewish State , expands his case for Jewish acceptance of evangelical political goals .
Brog told National Review that his book has universal appeal and will help anyone to " better comprehend the birth pangs of what in time will be a very important alliance . "
The phrase " birth pangs " is clearly understood by evangelicals as a scriptural citation from Matthew 24 , which refers to the apocalyptic struggle that will usher in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ .
And hits from Google just keep on comin ' .
So , now the Bush administration has taken politically coded language to a new low by throwing a big , greasy bone out to the lunatics who are soiling their underwear at the prospect that we are witnessing the end of the world .
Steal this Act !
More and more , the people writing our nation 's laws are not the lawmakers in Congress .
It has become depressingly common for corporate lobbyists - and sometimes the Bush administration ( Patriot Act ) - to write our laws , which are then passed through Congress only as necessary formality .
Well if lobbyists can write laws , then so can we .
I humbly propose a work in progress :
Right to Vote Act of 2006
An Act
To ensure the intent of the electorate of the United States of America is faithfully executed in all aspects of the electoral process .
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled ,
(1) Every eligible American citizen who is registered to vote has a right to cast a ballot and to have said ballot counted according to his or her intent .
(2) Any action with the intent to suppress electoral participation directly or indirectly is a federal offense subject to prosecution .
Actions such as disruption of " get - out - the - vote " drives and similar initiatives , prevention of voters from reaching polling stations , disruption of political party operations , disseminating false information in order to discourage participation in the electoral process , and any and all other methods with the intent to discourage and suppress voter participation shall be punishable by a fine of $ 100,000 per instance .
(3) The number of available , operational , and legal voting facilities in each electoral precinct must be directly proportional to the number of registered voters of said precinct .
The voter wait time for any electoral precinct shall be no more than two hours .
Each electoral precinct must monitor wait times and when a wait time of over two hours is calculated , said precinct must make available additional legal voting facilities as required to comply with law .
(4) All voting machines , ballots , and tabulation methods , electronic and / or otherwise , shall be approved and certified by independent , nonpartisan , scientific review , the entire process of which open to public review .
Any instance of unauthorized machines , ballots , computer code , or other methods are punishable by a fine of $ 100,000 per instance , nulls the election affected , and requires another election to be held in its place in order to ensure compliance with law and voter intent .
(5) All polling stations must be attended by personnel trained and appropriately certified in the operation of the voting machines and methods of said precinct .
(6) Local and state governments and private business are subject to lawsuits by the public for any instance resulting in the disenfranchisement of a voter 's intent .
This includes erroneous denial of voter registration , miscalculated votes , illegal wait times at polling stations , illegal voting machines , ballots , and / or methods , and any and all instances resulting in a failure to accurately and legally count and record voter intent .
(7) All machines and methods must produce hardcopy records that accurately reflect the voter 's intent .
Said records shall be securely kept by each electoral precinct for no less than a period of ten years for each election .
No less than ten percent of election results for each electoral precinct must be audited with a hand - count of hardcopy records in addition to previously approved tabulation method in order to ensure electoral integrity .
The elections audited shall be selected at random by each electoral precinct .
(8) Any and all instances of noncompliance with the law described herein and the appropriate prosecution shall be a matter of public record .
I 've already gotten suggestions to add criminal penalties and jail time for violations , and to require observers at polling stations .
This is good stuff .
Got a suggestion ?
Please email it to me .
I plan to send this to my Congressman , Lloyd Doggett , every week until I get a meaningful response .

Twenty more signs that you might be a Bush Supporter

8 . You believe that as a Christian in the United States , you are a persecuted minority .
9 . The death of Israeli civilians at the hands of Palestinian militants or terrorists causes you to rage against the attackers , while the death of Palestinian civilians at the hands of the Israeli military causes you to rage against the liberal media for its anti-Semitic news coverage .
10 .
You believe that corporate executives care more about the condition of the working class than labor unions .
11 . You do n't understand the difference between being accused of terrorism and being guilty of terrorism , and therefore do not understand the need for due process in terrorism cases or the outcry against the torture of people who have never been convicted or charged of a crime .
12 . You do n't think the subjects discussed and the conclusions drawn at Dick Cheney 's secret meetings with Enron and other energy industry representatives to form our nation 's energy policy are any of your business .
13 . You 've never heard of the Office of Special Plans or the Project for the New American Century .
14 . The name " Hillary Clinton " sends you into a vitriolic diatribe against the senator , yet you cannot identify any of her policy positions .
15 . You despise Bill Clinton for not catching or killing Osama Bin Laden prior to the attacks of 9/11 , but excuse George W. Bush for not catching or killing Osama Bin Laden prior to or after the attacks of 9/11 .
16 .
In the Bible , you find no exception to the proclamation in the Book of Leviticus that it is an abomination for a man to lie with a man , but find a vast number of exceptions to the commandment " Thou shalt not kill . "
17 .
You find yourself willing to devote yourself to protecting the well - being of unborn children , but uninterested in the well - being of children after they 're born or their mothers at any stage .
18 . You do not believe that falling middle class income and rising corporate executive compensation is class warfare against the working class , but do believe that mentioning this fact is class warfare against the rich .
19 .
You despise the liberal media for its constant lies and distortions , but believe any and all reports from the media that sets President Bush in a positive light .
20 .
You proudly display a bumper sticker to " support the troops , " but consider discussions of inadequate body armor , strategy , veteran 's benefits , and soldier pay to be nothing more than liberal whining .
Just for Fun : Twenty signs that you might be a Bush Supporter
Friends , you might be concerned that you are afflicted with Bush Support .
We here at the Bush Support Rehabilitation Clinic have assembled twenty indicators of this degenerative mental illness .
If you find yourself agreeing with a majority of these indicators , please seek help as soon as possible .
And remember , if you do n't get help with us , please , get help somewhere .
1 . You believe that leaking the CIA status of Valerie Plame , a " NOC " working on nuclear proliferation issues , was a heroic act , while you believe that the publishing of Bush 's SWIFT monitoring activities by the New York Times was treason , eventhough it was a matter of public record .
2 . You believe that you will stop loving your husband or wife and get a divorce if the two gay dudes down the street are allowed to get married .
3 . You have no problem with voting machines being made by private corporations owned and operated by Bush supporters who claim that their programming code may not be inspected by anyone , make it impossible to perform recounts , operate elections in such a way that they can be manipulated while leaving no evidence whatsoever , and that we should all just " trust them . "
4 . You believe that the Jack Abramoff scandal is a bipartisan controversy .
5 . You believe that Mexicans are to blame for stealing your jobs when corporations export hundreds of thousands of manufacturing , textile , and service jobs to Mexico , South America , China , Taiwan , and India .
6 . You believe that " everyone " thought Saddam had WMD prior to the Iraq War .
7 . You believe that one day we will find the last terrorist on earth and kill them .
8 . You believe that in a time of war , the President may search and seize without a warrant , may deprive persons of life and liberty without due process of law , may detain persons indefinitely without trial or counsel , and keep all these actions away from the review of Congress and the Judiciary .
9 . You earn the minimum wage and applaud Republicans for rejecting proposals to raise it .
10 .
You blame high gas prices on environmentalists .
11 . You think President Bush should invade Iran , a country nearly four times the size and population of Iraq .
12 . You think NAFTA was good for America eventhough you have n't really noticed cheaper prices for cars or other products made in Mexico .
13 .
Even though men have been released from Guantanamo Bay with no charges against them , you think everyone in Guantanamo Bay is a terrorist who should stay there forever without trial .
14 .
You think the best way to improve public schools is to reduce their funding .
15 . You think Creationism is science .
16 .
You think liberals are responsible for all the troubles in the United States when all three branches of government are controlled by conservative Republicans , as is our economy .
17 .
You believe our nation 's forefathers desired to establish a Christian nation , but accidentally left that part out of the Constitution , and did n't really mean that part about not " respecting an establishment of religion . "
18 . You think American soldiers have died throughout our history to protect a colorful piece of rectangular cloth , and not the rights it symbolizes .
19 .
You can't locate Iraq on a world map .
And perhaps the most serious indicator :
20 .
You believe that the violence in the Middle East is the will of God acting though George W. Bush , His most cherished vessel , and that the turmoil portends the coming End Times , when you and other Bush Supporters will vanish and ascend to Heaven while the Anti-Christ establishes a worldwide peace back on earth .
Political Cartoon : Karl - Aid !
Article
Whatever happened to the conservatives ?
These days , when I gripe about the Right , or speak in general political terms , I no longer label the opposition as " the conservatives , " but instead refer to them as " the Republicans . "
This is because I have so rarely seen or heard an actual conservative on television or the radio that I wonder if they are nearly extinct .
Politically speaking , the great majority of people in the United States can be broken down into four groups : Democrats , liberals , Republicans , and conservatives .
Liberals and conservatives are people who hold a general philosophy about what our society should be and the role of our government .
Democrats and Republicans are partisans , who consider party loyalty more important than their own views ( that is , if they are cognitive enough to have their own views ) .
Remember what conservatives believed ?
Sure , the social conservatives always wanted to ban abortions and gay marriage and economic conservatives always wanted to empower the rich and corporations at the expense of everyone else with a faulty expectation of " trickle - down " economics .
But what about the conservative desires for small and limited government ?
A balanced budget ?
And " keeping the government out of the lives of ordinary citizens ? "
That was the good stuff !
The people currently running our government are about as conservative as they are liberal .
No , the people running our government are not conservative , they 're Republican .
And these Republicans lack the cushy philosophy of anything resembling traditional conservatism .
They have one belief : Power .
If they actually believed in banning gay marriage , why would they only bring it up in an election year ?
Sure , they enrich the wealthy and corporations in extreme fashion , but not for any philosophy .
They know that a substantial percentage of those riches will be reinvested into the Republican Party as a means to retain and extend their power .
And what is conservative about the biggest and growing government debt in the history of the country ?
What is conservative about unwarranted spy operations against Americans ?
What is conservative about imprisonment without trial ?
And signing laws enacted by Congress with legal gymnastics designed to exempt the Executive ?
Starting a war and lying in order to do it ?
Spreading taxpayer - funded covert propaganda in the form of fake news reports ?
Outing a CIA agent as a means to stifle dissent from within ?
And not to mention the legal declaration that the Executive knows no limits to its power as long as the Executive considers the nation to be at war ?
No laws bind them , they say .
The Constitution becomes meaningless and international treaties become " quaint . "
We should be begging for a conservative government when compared to what we have now .
So , what happened to this once proud group of people , the conservatives ?
How did the Church of Republicanism convert so many of them into their brainless cult ?
The answer seems clear :
The most effective media machine in the history of democracy .
Repetition .
Fear .
Scapegoating .
Anything in the news having even the slightest resemblance to facts or journalism is attacked as " liberal bias " again , and again , and again , until one day people start to believe it .
And soon only the most partisan Republican nonsense is accepted by the trained public as " fair and balanced " news .
Their intellect is eroded through repetition of simple phrases and their emotions are kept high with fear and scapegoating to prevent rational thought .
In another universe of possibility , could this have happened to us ?
The liberals ?
And perpetrated by the Democrats ?
It 's possible .
But for whatever reason , we have been spared the kind of mind rape that has been unleashed on the once proud conservative American .
But in the process , we sacrificed our power .
How can the Democrats possibly compete with the trained loyalty of the Republican Party ?
Liberals and disillusioned Democrats may feel inclined to withhold support from our politicians whenever we dislike their performance or disagree with their vision .
The Republicans have no such weakness .
Their electorate will support them at the expense of their own views , whatever is left of them .
The only hope the Democrats have to regain control without perpetrating the same crimes against the brains of their electorate is to crack the spell of Republicanism .
In the world of cults , this is called " deprogramming . "
Cult followers are removed from their brainless routine and presented evidence of the cult 's wrongdoing in the hopes they will " awaken " and begin to think clearly again .
It 's up to us .
Democrats and liberals are more and more allied in the mission to deprogram the American people .
You can hear it in their speeches in the Capitol when criticizing Republican talking points turned Congressional legislation .
While the Republicans are controlled from the top - down , we on the Left are more and more controlling the Democrats from the bottom - up .
Let 's keep pushing our party to do what 's right while we engage our Republican friends and family in the hopes of deprogramming them and restoring them to proud conservatives , conservatives with whom we will disagree on many issues , but at least be comforted by the fact that they are their own people , and no longer the useful idiots trained to support a party diametrically opposed to their own beliefs .
If poll numbers are any indication , we are beginning to have some success .
But we can not rest for one second or the forces pushing against us will steamroll us into another defeat this November .
So let 's get to work .

Political Cartoon : Bush Supports the Troops
THE REPUBLICAN DICTIONARY - Sorry only the " A "s
AARP
1. The American Association of Retired Persons , one of the most powerful political organizations in the United States with millions of members , which occasionally works against the interests of retired persons by opposing President Bush 's plan to privatize social security .
According to Republican organization USA Next , which has hired a former advisor to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , the AARP is somehow associated with the liberal agenda of hating our troops and supporting same - sex marriage .
abortion
1 . The thoughtless murder of an innocent child by his or her mother .*
* The harming and killing of unborn children should only be mourned and denounced when performed as a choice by the mothers .
The death of unborn children caused by war , lack of prenatal healthcare to poor mothers , or bodily contamination from environmental pollution is not a concern .
See also : pro-choice , pro-life
abstinence
1 . The only known method of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually - transmitted diseases such as AIDS which does not offend God or the Republican base .
Accordingly , so - called abstinence - only policies should be strictly enforced without any credence given to birth control , regardless of the actual success or failure of such policies .
The prospect of a diseased child being born to an unwilling mother in poverty is far less horrible than the ghastly possibility of people having sex for pleasure .
Abu Ghraib
1 . A prison near Baghdad , Iraq , which under the rule of Saddam Hussein was notorious for the torture and execution of its inhabitants , and its horrendous living conditions .
The prisoners tortured and executed at this facility were thought to include many political prisoners .
2 . A prison near Baghdad , Iraq , which under the rule of the United States was notorious for the unfortunate but necessary torture , execution , and sexual assault of its inhabitants though the course of bringing freedom to Iraq .
The prisoners held at Abu Ghraib were Iraqis taken while fighting Coalition Forces , or guilty by association for standing , sleeping , or bleeding in the general geographic area of people fighting Coalition Forces .
academic freedom
1 . The freedom of public school teachers and state college professors to teach the scientific theory of intelligent design to their students without fear of persecution .
See also : religious freedom
ACLU
1 . The American Communist Liberties Union , a fringe radical extremist organization of over 400,000 fringe radical extremist members , which seeks to weaken the United States by constantly crying and screaming about how all Americans should have " equal rights " , " civil rights " such as " due process " when charged with a crime , a so - called " separation of church and state " , and many other un-American fringe radical extremist ideals .
activist judge
1 . A judge who undermines the separation of powers described in the Constitution by declaring unconstitutional any laws passed by Republican majorities that may or may not be constitutional .
affirmative action
1 . A racist and unconstitutional policy of granting preference or special privileges to supposedly " disadvantaged " ethnic or minority groups in the academic or professional sectors .*
* Affirmative action should not be confused with the perfectly acceptable preferences obtained through family ties or other connections to powerful and influential people , which have been instrumental in providing opportunities for disadvantaged wealthy children to pursue higher education at places like Yale and Harvard and careers in the Texas Air National Guard , the oil business , and politics .
AIDS
1 . A disease of the immune system that has infected and killed millions all over the world at catastrophic levels , especially in Africa .
The realization that AIDS affects more than just homosexuals and blacks makes urgent the need to provide aid to countries that seek to curb the spread of the disease , as long as abstinence - only policies are used , condoms are never distributed , and birth control is never discussed .
Al Qaeda
1 . The terrorist organization behind the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Al Qaeda is headed by Osama Bin Laden , who is driven by a deep hatred for freedom and all things good and American like baseball and Wal - Mart .
The details of how Bin Laden and similar individuals were trained , funded and armed in previous decades are completely irrelevant .
Almighty , The
1. As President George W. Bush is known for giving his personal associates nicknames , Bush frequently uses " The Almighty " when referring to his personal Friend and Advisor , God .

alternative energy ( or clean energy )
1. Energy resources such as solar and wind promoted by Liberals and environmentalists as an alternative to traditional energy resources such as coal , oil , and natural gas , with the supposed intent to reduce negative environmental impacts and world aggression related to energy resources .
While these efforts might appear to have merit , the agenda to develop alternative energy should neither be funded nor taken seriously as it may yet be uncovered as a plot to bankrupt patriotic energy corporations and institute an authoritarian rule bent on preventing freedom - loving Americans from practicing their God - given right to consume enormous amounts of fuel .
anti
1 . A prefix indicating an opposing position to the term it precedes .
" Anti " should be placed in front of favorable terms to describe Liberals and Democrats .
For example , people who support same - sex marriage rights should be labeled anti-family , and people who support abortion rights should be labeled anti-life .
Labeling Liberals as " anti " also helps to persist the idea that they are pessimists and complainers while Republicans are forward - looking optimists .
Republicans are encouraged to break new ground with this tactic by labeling Democrats and Liberals who oppose Republican policies such as tax - cuts for the wealthy and social security privatization as anti-Jesus , anti-child , anti-freedom , and anti-good .
anti-family
1 . Of or having to do with an agenda in opposition families , such as advocating the right of same - sex couples to marry and adopt children .
See also : family values
anti-war
1 . A general philosophy of pacifism held by those on the fringe far - left who are incapable of understanding that the best way to achieve peace is through constant war .
ANWR
1. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , a federally protected wilderness in Alaska .
Oil exploration and drilling in the refuge is promoted by Republicans as a means to increase domestic oil production and decrease dependence on foreign oil .
According to geological review , if ANWR were drilled immediately it would produce nothing for approximately ten years , and then most likely produce only a trivial amount of oil , making its effect on the United States ' dependence on foreign sources insignificant and brief .
However , the potential for even a small amount of oil from ANWR is worth the cost of enormous government contracts for the energy corporations that would drill there , while carefully avoiding the dangerous prospect of funding alternative energy research .
Ashcroft , John
1. Attorney General of the United States for President George W. Bush during his first term .
Ashcroft is best known for his efforts to protect American freedoms from terrorists by allowing the government to search business and library records without cause , search and seize private property without a specific warrant , justifying the detainment of American citizens without trial or access to counsel , promoting the ability of the government to conduct secret arrests and strip Americans of their citizenship and constitutional rights when accused of terrorism , and ensuring that all Americans know that criticism of his actions is no different than aiding terrorists .
Ashcroft was a controversial figure whose centerpiece achievement , the Patriot Act , was deplored by the likes of terrorists and their allies in over 300 communities across America that passed resolutions challenging the law .
Upon resigning , Ashcroft boldly stated , " The objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror has been achieved , " proudly calling attention to his record of convicting exactly zero domestic terrorists , a number of which most certainly remain at large within our borders , despite weakening and sometimes nullifying constitutional protections in order to fight terror .
Suggested article : John Ashcroft and the War on American Freedom
Axis of Evil
1 . The label famously given by President George W. Bush in his 2002 State of the Union Address to Iraq , Iran , and North Korea to represent the combined threat these nations posed to the United States , and hence all good things in the world . *
* Iraq has since been removed as a threat due to the successful occupation by Coalition Forces despite reports by " experts " that the invasion of Iraq super - charged recruiting for worldwide terrorist organizations including Al Qaeda and has itself become a haven for terrorists .

Keep Your Information Secure : How to Dispose of Old Computers
Has the time come for your computers to retire ?
Unfortunately for computers , retirement does n’t mean starting a new life without work .
It means being thrown away as e-waste .
While getting rid of your old computer likely means you ’re ready to acquire a newer , more efficient machine , there are a couple of risks you ’ll be incurring .
Besides environmental concerns , you could throw away valuable personal and business data , which might end up in the wrong hands .
In this article , we ’re telling you how to dispose of old computers while keeping your information secure .
Backup Your Data
Your old computer hosts a lot of information about you , from account passwords to intimate files such as photographs and messages .
If you use your computer for business , there ’s a good chance you have stored trade information in it as well .
These could include business contracts , proprietary product info , and whatnot .
Before getting rid of your old computer , find a way to store any useful information you might need later on .
In other words , you should backup your data .
There a couple of data backup methods you can use .
You can transfer the information to an external storage device , typically a flash drive or hard disk .
There ’s also cloud storage .
With this method , you wo n’t worry about physical storage devices that you might misplace or get lost and end up in the wrong hands .
There are several reputable cloud storage service providers , all of which will give you substantial storage free of charge .
If your data exceeds that free storage limit , you ’ll have to pay a small charge for additional storage .
Deregister Your Accounts from the Computer
If you ’re anything like most people , you ’ve got several accounts registered to your old device .
This way , the account service automatically detects your computer , enabling you to log in without entering a password .
Be sure to deregister such accounts the computer before discarding it .
If you do n’t , someone might find the computer and access your accounts with ease .
And even if nobody ever uses it again , you might have trouble logging in to those accounts from a new , unrecognized device .
Erase Everything from the Computer ’s Hard Drive
Backing up data creates a copy of the data on your computer .
It does n’t transfer then delete the data from your device unless you choose that option .
Even if you opt for the delete option , it ’s possible that some bits of data could remain .
There are also programs or applications that store personal data without your knowledge .
Erasing everything returns the computer to its original state — at least as far as data storage is concerned .
Here ’s a guide on how to erase hard drive and leave no traces of data behind .
Choose a Disposal Method
With your computer wiped clean , it ’s time to dispose of it .
You have a number of options , but it ’s advisable to choose the most environmentally friendly option .
Instead of dumping it with your domestic waste , for instance , why not donate it to charity if it ’s still in working order ?
Or you can dismantle it and sell valuable parts online .
Regardless of the method you choose , you ’ll rest easy knowing your data is secure .
How to Dispose of Old Computers Made Easy
Computers are n’t designed to last forever , which means after several years , age will start taking a toll on yours .
When that time comes , make use of this guide on how to dispose of old computers .

An Open Letter Regarding the Upcoming G - 20 Meeting in Washington , D.C .

The International Monetary System Should Serve the People of the World , Not Enslave Them
We have noted with deep interest and concern that leaders of the G20 are meeting in Washington , D.C. , November 15th for the “ Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy . ”
Such a summit is surely needed , but not just to fix the catastrophically failing world financial system .
No matter how much tinkering around the edges the leaders might engage in or how many bailouts are provided to financial institutions , we all recognize that nothing worthwhile will have been accomplished without a paradigm shift in the relationship between finance and the daily lives of the citizens of the globe .
The world today is suffering under the crushing burden of a debt - based monetary system operated by privately owned banks .
The system 's main characteristic is to channel wealth upward from those who work for a living into the hands of those who lend money .
Financial profits are then supposed to work themselves downward through investment and spending .
We know it in the U.S. as " trickledown " economics , and it has failed .
This system by its nature is unjust and is the root cause of today 's crisis .
We demand that this system be changed into one that reflects real economic democracy .
In the words of President Abraham Lincoln in his December 3 , 1861 , address to Congress : “ Labor is prior to , and independent of , capital .
Capital is only the fruit of labor , and could never have existed if labor had not first existed .
Labor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration . ”
The monetary system should reflect these truths through the following changes :
● Monetary systems should be controlled by sovereign national governments , not the central banks which mainly serve private finance .
The main economic function of the monetary system should be to assure adequate purchasing power to consume an environmentally sustainable and optimal level of production whereby the basic needs of every person in the world community are satisfactorily met .
● Income security , including a basic income guarantee and a national dividend , should be a primary responsibility of national governments in the economic sphere .
A right to adequate purchasing power should be part of every national constitution .
● The primary function of international finance should be to assure fair transferability of
value among national economic systems , utilizing , to the extent possible , fixed and transparent exchange rates .
Speculative attacks on sovereign currencies should be outlawed .
● Private creation of credit for speculative purposes should be abolished , and capital markets should be regulated to assure fairness , openness , and freedom from predatory practices .
● Every national government should have the right to spend lowcost credit directly into
existence for public purposes — including infrastructure , environmental protection , education , and health care — without incurring new debt .
● The physical backing for every currency in existence should be the actual production of national economies .
● National governments should treat credit as a public utility — like clean air , water , or
electricity — and should assure its availability to all citizens as their social heritage and as a basic human right .
● National credit policies should favor the development of sustainable local and regional
economies , of small business , and of family farming .
● Credit should be regulated in order to encourage maximum ownership of property by
individuals without artificially inflating its price .
● The private banking system should be utilized to provide liquidity for business operations but should not be needed in a properly constituted system to finance consumption or capital formation .

Bush pardons 14 , cuts prison time for 2 others
Breaking a logjam of hundreds of pent - up clemency requests , President Bush granted pardons to 14 people on Monday and shortened the prison terms of two others .
The majority of the felons who won leniency from Bush are far from household names .
Andrew Harley of Falls Church , Va. , was pardoned for wrongful use and distribution of marijuana and cocaine after a court - martial by the Air Force Academy in 1985 caused him to forfeit his pay and prompted his dismissal from the service .
Leslie Collier of Charleston , Mo. , had been convicted of unauthorized use of a registered pesticide .
Obie Helton of Rossville , Ga. , was pardoned after conviction on charges of acquiring food stamps without proper permission and sentenced to two years ' probation in 1983 .
Several other offenders who won leniency Monday were convicted of run-of - the - mill white - collar crimes such as bank embezzlement , tax evasion or accounting violations .
Pardons give their recipients greater leeway to find jobs , live in public housing and vote , among other privileges .
Over seven years in office , Bush has been reluctant to use his near - absolute authority under the U.S. Constitution , awarding only 157 pardons and six commutations before Monday .
But that pattern could ease during the waning days of his term .
People close to the process say lawyers with political connections increasingly have approached the White House directly to seek relief for their high - profile clients , including former junk - bond king Michael Milken , former U.S. Rep.
Randy " Duke " Cunningham , R - Rancho Santa Fe ( San Diego County ) , and John Walker Lindh , an American from Marin County who pleaded guilty to serving with the Taliban .
No one who received clemency Monday approached that level of national renown .
But because of Bush 's actions , Grammy Award - winning rap artist John Forte of North Brunswick , N.J. , will be released after serving about half of a 14 - year sentence for aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine .
Forte , whose clemency bid was supported by Sen.
Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , has been scheduled for release Dec. 22 .
He had performed with the Fugees and is a friend of and former backup singer for Carly Simon , who lobbied senior lawmakers including Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass. , for his early release .
Each of the clemency decisions Monday moved through the normal course of business , which starts with an application to the Justice Department Office of the Pardon Attorney .
Applicants undergo an FBI check , prosecutors and judges often are consulted for their recommendations , and the submissions make their way to the deputy attorney general before moving to the White House counsel 's office and onto the president himself .
The LDS leadership is busted for targeting gay couples as far back as 1997 .
There 's a new memo that has come to light from late Mormon president Gordon Hinckley , carefully planning the assault on gay families , hoping to use the Catholic hierarchy as a p.r. front :
I moved this below the fold because it kept launching automatically .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Make money : not by building an internet company , but by using the net as a tool to create value and get paid .
Use the internet as a tool , not as an end .
Do it when you are part of a big organization or do it as a soloist .
The dramatic leverage of the net more than overcomes the downs of the current economy .
The essence is this : connect .
Connect the disconnected to each other and you create value .
Connect advertisers to people who want to be advertised to .
Connect job hunters with jobs .
Connect information seekers with information .
Connect teams to each other .
Connect those seeking similar .
Connect to partners and those that can leverage your work .
Connect people who are proximate geographically .
Connect organizations spending money with ways to save money .
Connect like - minded people into a movement .
Connect people buying with people who are selling .
Some examples ?
I think it ’s worth delineating these so you can see that the opportunity can be big , if that ’s your taste , or small if you do n’t want to invest heavily just yet .
Connect advertisers to people who want to be advertised to .
Dani Levy did this with Daily Candy , a company she recently sold for more than a hundred million dollars .
Daily Candy uses simple email software , there ’s no technology tricks involved .
Instead , it ’s a simple permission marketing business … hundreds of thousands of the right people , getting an anticipated , personal and relevant email every day .
( Note !
This only works if you earn true permission , not that sort of fake half and half version that ’s so common ) .
Connect job hunters with jobs .
My friend Tara has made hundreds of thousands of dollars ( in good years ) working as an executive recruiter .
But what did she actually do all day ?
She stayed connected with a cadre of people .
She kept track of the all stars .
She connected with the right people , invested time in them that her clients never thought was worth it .
So , when it was time to hire , it was easier for them to call Tara than it was for them to start from scratch .
The best time to start a gig like this is right now , when no one in particular wants to connect with and help out the superstars .
Later , when the economy bounces back , your position is extremely valuable .
( Note !
This only works if you have insane focus and the people you interact with are the true superstars , not just numbers ) .
Connect information seekers with information .
At a large scale , this is what Bloomberg did to make his fortune .
Spending $ $$ on a Bloomberg terminal guarantees a user at least a fifteen minute head start on people who do n’t have one .
But consider how many micro markets where this connection does n’t occur .
Michael Cader offers it to book publishers and does quite well .
Which industry needs you to channel and collect and connect ?
On a micro level , there are now people making thousands of dollars a month running their pages on Squidoo .
That ’s almost enough to be a full time job for a curious person with the generosity to share useful information .
Connect teams to each other .
How much is on the line when a company puts ten people in three offices on a quest to launch a major new product in record time ?
The question , then , is why would n’t they be willing to spend a little more to hire a team concierge ?
Someone to manage Basecamp and conference calls and scheduling and document source control to be sure the right people have the right information at the right time …
I do n’t think most organizations can hire someone to do this full time , but I bet this is a great specialty for someone who is good at it .
Connect those seeking similar .
Who ’s running the ad hoc association of green residential architects ?
Or connecting the hundred CFOs at the hundred largest banks in the US ?
It ’s amazing how isolated most people are , even in a world crowded with people .
I know of a guy who built an insanely profitable business around connecting C level executives at the Fortune 500 .
After all , there are only 500 of them .
They want to know what the others are doing …
( Consider this example )
Connect to partners and those that can leverage your work .
Freelances had no power because they depended on the client to hook them up with the rest of the team that could leverage their work .
But what if you do that before you approach the client ?
What if you , the graphic designer , have a virtual partner who is an award winning copywriter and another partner who is a well - know illustrator ?
You could walk in the door and offer detailed PDFs or other high - impact viral electronic media in a turnkey package .
Connect people who are proximate geographically .
We all know that newspapers are tanking .
Yet news , it appears , is on the rise .
This paradox is an opportunity .
Who is connecting the 10,000 people in your little community / suburb / town / zip code to each other ?
One person who spends all day at school board meetings , breaking stories about a dumping scandal , profiling a local business person or teacher ?
If you did that , and built an audience of thousands by RSS and email … do you think you ’d have any trouble selling out the monthly cocktail party / mixer ?
Any trouble finding sponsors among local businesses for a media property that actually and truly reaches everyone ?
Connect organizations spending money with ways to save money .
During the last recession , plenty of entrepreneurs scored by selling businesses on doing a phone bill audit .
They took 30 % of the first year ’s savings and did the work for free .
Today , there are countless ways businesses can save money using technology and outsourcing , but few take full advantage .
You can train them to do this and keep a share of the savings .
Connect like - minded people into a movement .
We ’ve seen plenty of headstrong bootstrapped entrepreneurs turn a blog into the cornerstone of a multi-million dollar empire .
The secret : they do n’t write their blog for everyone .
Instead , they use the blog as the center connecting point for a niche , and then go from there .
It ’s easy to list the tech successes , but there are literally 10,000 other niches just waiting for someone to connect them .
Connect people buying with people who are selling .
Sure , you know how to use Craigslist and eBay to buy and sell … but most people do n’t .
How about finding people in your town with junk that needs removing , items that need selling , odd jobs that need filling … and then , for a fee , solve their problems using your laptop and these existing networks ?
Imagine the power , just to pick one example , of building an email alert list of 500 garage sale bargain hunters .
Every time you email them , they show up .
Now , you can walk into any home in any town and guarantee the biggest garage sale success they ’ve ever seen … and you have the photos to prove it .
As long as you protect the list and do for them , not to them , this asset increases in value .
The best time to do any of these projects was five years ago , so that today you ’d be earning thousands of dollars a week .
Too late .
The second best time to start : now .
WASHINGTON 
It ’s the capital ’s newest parlor game , literally :
How much is your parlor worth ?
More precisely , how much is it worth to someone who is coming to town for President - elect Barack Obama ’s inauguration in January and needs a place to stay ?
One three - bedroom house in suburban Virginia is said to have gone for $ 57,000 for inauguration week .
A week at a four - bedroom in suburban Maryland was listed at $ 60,000 , though that , like other offerings , may be wishful thinking .
As Washington gears up for the historic inauguration of the first African - American president , more than one million people are expected to descend on the capital .
The five - county metro area has 95,000 hotel rooms .
You do the math .
The demand for hotels outstripped the supply more than two months before the Jan. 20 inauguration , not just in Washington and environs but as far away as Pennsylvania and West Virginia ; even campsites are filling up .
Some people are renting RVs ; others are offering apartment swaps .

The questions were submitted by readers to Steven Dubner ’s Freakonomics Blog at the New York Times and answered by Dr. Paul .
Q : What was your first thought when you found out McCain chose Palin as his running mate ?
A : At first , I thought it was a pretty savvy choice from a political perspective .
I also knew that she had said some nice things about me in the past .
At the same time , I knew that to be on the ticket , she would have to toe the line on foreign policy and the war , so that tempered a lot of my enthusiasm .
Q : Who in Congress would you consider to be your closest peer(s ) ?
A : There are a lot of members who I work with on a variety of different issues .
Walter Jones is a good friend and works with me on foreign policy .
Often on spending , if there is a 432 - 3 vote , the other two congressmen voting with me are Jeff Flake and Paul Broun .
A lot of times , I work with Democrats on civil liberties issues .
I guess my point is that people from all over the political spectrum can side with liberty and the Constitution .
The goal is to get a majority to vote that way most of the time .
Q : It was mentioned you were in favor of getting rid of the Department of Education .
Is this true , and if so , how do you feel this would benefit the country ?
A : I do believe in eliminating the Department of Education .
First , the Constitution does not authorize the Department of Education , and the founders never envisioned the federal government dictating those education policies .
Second , it is a huge bureaucracy that squanders our money .
We send billions of dollars to Washington and get back less than we sent .
The money would be much better off left in states and local communities rather than being squandered in Washington .
Finally , I think that the smallest level of government possible best performs education .
Teachers , parents , and local community leaders should be making decisions about exactly how our children should be taught , not Washington bureaucrats .
The Department of Education has given us No Child Left Behind , massive unfunded mandates , indoctrination , and in come cases , forced medication of our children with psychotropic drugs .
We should get rid of all of that and get those choices back in the hands of the people .
Q : What active steps would you take toward reducing the size of the government ?
A : The first thing I would do , which could be done rather quickly , is change our foreign policy .
If you add up all of our overseas expenditures , we spend nearly $ 1 trillion every year .
We have bases in 130 countries , 50,000 troops in Germany , and our brave military men and women bogged down in two wars in the Middle East .
By announcing that America will pursue a foreign policy of non-intervention , where we have trade , diplomacy , and travel — but where we do n’t police the world and stay out of the internal affairs of other nations — we could cut that $ 1 trillion in half and still have a strong national defense to keep us safe .
All that money we save could be used to address the entitlement system , making sure there will be funding there for people who have become dependent , while allowing young people to get out .
Secondly , I would begin to reassert respect for the Tenth Amendment .
The Constitution does not authorize so many things that the federal government currently does .
I would look to phase out entire departments and return these functions to the states as the Constitution intended .
The Departments of Education and Energy would be on the top of my list .
Finally , I would look to our monetary system .
Government can only tax its people so much before they say no .
So the government expands the money supply when it has taxed and borrowed all it can .
This inflation is a hidden tax that falls squarely on the middle class .
Sound , honest money would go a great way towards reining in the big- spending politicians .
Q : Even before the primaries , you said you would not run in the general election .
Why specifically did you not run ?
A : I was running for the Republican nomination , and I would have run in the general if I had won .
I had little interest in running third party due to the inherent biases against such efforts .
I also signed legally binding agreements not run third - party in 2008 if I failed to win the G.O.P. primary .
That was the cost for ballot access in several states , 11 total I believe .
So even I had wanted to , it would not have been possible to run in the general after I lost the primary .
Q : What would your plans for economic stimulation look like during this slumping economy ?
A : Let ’s start with what I would n’t do , which is make the problem worse .
We can not solve our problems with what we ’ve been doing — borrowing money from overseas and creating money and credit out of thin air .
Distorting interest rates and inflating the monetary supply sometimes provides short - term relief , but it will only make the pain worse in the long run .
During the presidential campaign , I released the following four - point plan , and would stick by it while at the same time listening to experts for advice on how to improve it :
The Four - Point Plan
Tax Reform : Reduce the tax burden and eliminate taxes that punish investment and savings , including job - killing corporate taxes .
Spending Reform : Eliminate wasteful spending .
Reduce overseas commitments .
Freeze all non-defense , non-entitlement spending at current levels .
Monetary Policy Reform : Expand openness at the Federal Reserve and require the Fed to televise its meetings .
Return value to our money .
Regulatory Reform : Repeal Sarbanes - Oxley regulations that push companies to seek capital outside of U.S. markets .
Stop restricting community banks from fostering local economic growth .
Q : Do you still believe that the financial industry needs no regulation because markets are inherently stable and always act rationally ?
A : The free market is the most stable and fair system .
Government intervention and manipulation of interest rates are at the heart of the whole mess we are currently in .
Government intervention causes unintended negative consequences .
Artificially low interest rates help out special interest and elites , not the common person , all the while creating malinvestment and booms and busts in our economy .
Q : Do you think people who relate more to the libertarian ideals of the Republican Party have a role to play in the Republican Party of the moment , and do you see a role for them in the coming ( hopeful ) rebuilding of the Republican Party ?
A : I certainly hope so .
The Republican Party has traditionally been the party of liberty and limited government .
Republicans like Robert Taft , Barry Goldwater , and Ronald Reagan had very libertarian qualities .
If the G.O.P. gets back to its roots , they can appeal once again to liberty - minded Americans .
Q : Do you think the efforts of the libertarian - minded are better spent forming a third party or joining the actual Libertarian Party ?
A : I never try to tell people exactly what to do , so that ’s up to them .
However , I think the fact that I have remained in the Republican Party shows where I stand .
Q : What do you think are the most important steps to seeing greater access for third - party candidates ?
Is the root of the bipartisan problem more national or local in scope ?
A : Bipartisan dominance exists at all levels , but it ’s even more pronounced at the national level .
The biggest obstacle , I think , is inclusion in the national debates .
To take part , you basically have to be a Democrat or a Republican .
Unless that changes , a national third - party presidential candidate has little chance .
Q : What role should the United States play on the world scene ?
A : I believe we should treat everyone the same .
We should be friends with all willing parties , talk and trade with everyone we can , have diplomacy , and travel .
At the same time , we should not subsidize foreign governments with money or weapons ; this comes back to hurt us more times than not .
We should not have separate and different policies for Europeans or Latin America , Israelis or Palestinians .
We should set a good example here at home and stay out of the internal affairs of other countries .
Q : Did Bob Barr ‘s failure to appear at your press conference endorsing the third - party vote cause a rift between you and him ?
Are you still friends with him ?
A : That ’s old news as far I ’m concerned .
I ’m more interested in focusing on positive things Americans can accomplish moving forward .
Q : Do you believe that it is possible to make positive incremental changes to our monetary policy , entitlements , taxes , etc. within the system , or is it just a matter of waiting for failure and then coming in with a solution ?
A : Yes , I do believe we can make successful changes .
And I want to start making those changes now so that we can avoid a devastating collapse .
But we need to start quickly before it ’s too late .
If we can cut spending and balance budgets , beginning with our overseas expenditures , we can do a lot to fix this mess .
We also need monetary reform .
I would begin with the incremental step of repealing legal - tender laws and legalizing the use of gold and silver to act as a currency alongside the dollar .
That would help stabilize the dollar and strengthen our monetary system .
Q : How has the recent economic turmoil affected your views regarding deregulation ?
A : It has reinforced my belief that massive central planning does not work , whether it be in for the economy , education , or energy policy .
Q : How do you propose we restore people ’s faith in free - market ideas ?
A : Well , we need to start by making sure politicians who talk about free markets practice what they preach .
One of the reasons why people may have lost faith in freedom is that leaders used limited - government rhetoric while expanding the size and scope of government .
Free markets got a black eye even though the actual policy was intervention and central planning .
So again , leaders who profess to support markets need to act like that once in power .
If we do that , we ’ll prove that freedom really does work .
Q : How much money was left over from your campaign donations and what will be the next step with those funds ?
A : We had about $ 4 million left , which we are using to launch the Campaign for Liberty .
You can learn more about that group here .
Q : What is the first thing the country should do about its monetary policy ?
A : We should immediately audit the Federal Reserve .
I am the ranking member of the Monetary Policy subcommittee in the U.S. Congress , yet I can get more information about the internal workings of the C.I.A. than I can about our central bank .
This secrecy is fundamentally wrong , and I believe that people from all over the ideological political spectrum can agree on that .
Bloomberg
News this month has gone to court compel the Fed to disclose securities the central bank is accepting on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for trillions of dollars of loans to banks .
Expanding transparency is critical and could be done very quickly .
Q : What are your expectations for the next four years under an Obama administration ?
How might President Obama ’s interventionist economic policies impact our lives ?
A : Unfortunately , I do n’t expect many good things .
I do expect a lot of spending and even more debt .
To really cut spending and balance our budget , we need to change foreign policy .
Obama ’s rhetoric on foreign policy is better than what we have gotten recently , but do n’t expect any real change .
He may be more likely to wind things down in Iraq , but he ’s still planning on keeping troops there for a least 16 more months .
He wants money for Georgia and more troops in Afghanistan .
He is n’t going to bring home our 30,000 troops from Korea or our 50,000 soldiers in Germany , and he wo n’t close any of our 700 foreign bases .
At the same time , he is planning even bigger spending here at home .
I hope I ’m wrong , but if this spending and debt continue , the dollar is going to crash and we will see the middle class in this country take a grave hit .
Q : Do you deny global warming ?
Is Obama right to invest money in green technology ?
If you do n’t deny it , and do n’t think Obama is right , what is your solution ?
A : I try to look at global warming the same way I look at all other serious issues : as objectively and open - minded as possible .
There is clear evidence that the temperatures in some parts of the globe are rising , but temperatures are cooling in other parts .
The average surface temperature had risen for several decades , but it fell back substantially in the past few years .
Clearly there is something afoot .
The question is :
Is the upward fluctuation in temperature man-made or part of a natural phenomenon .
Geological records indicate that in the 12th century , Earth experienced a warming period during which Greenland was literally green and served as rich farmland for Nordic peoples .
There was then a mini ice age , the polar ice caps grew , and the once - thriving population of Greenland was virtually wiped out .
It is clear that the earth experiences natural cycles in temperature .
However , science shows that human activity probably does play a role in stimulating the current fluctuations .
The question is : how much ?
Rather than taking a u201Csky is falling u201D approach , I think there are common - sense steps we can take to cut emissions and preserve our environment .
I am , after all , a conservative and seek to conserve not just American traditions and our Constitution , but our natural resources as well .
We should start by ending subsidies for oil companies .
And we should never , ever go to war to protect our perceived oil interests .
If oil were allowed to rise to its natural price , there would be tremendous market incentives to find alternate sources of energy .
At the same time , I ca n’t support government u201 Cinvestmentu201D in alternative sources either , for this is not investment at all .
Government cannot invest , it can only redistribute resources .
Just look at the mess government created with ethanol .
Congress decided that we needed more biofuels , and the best choice was ethanol from corn .
So we subsidized corn farmers at the expense of others , and investment in other types of renewables was crowded out .
Now it turns out that corn ethanol is inefficient , and it actually takes more energy to produce the fuel than you get when you burn it .
The most efficient ethanol may come from hemp , but hemp production is illegal and there has been little progress on hemp ethanol .
And on top of that , corn is now going into our gas tanks instead of onto our tables or feeding our livestock or dairy cows ; so food prices have been driven up .
This is what happens when we allow government to make choices instead of the market ; I hope we avoid those mistakes moving forward .
Q : Will you run for a leadership position in the House Republican caucus ?
A : I have no plans to do so .
I do n’t cut deals and trade votes , which is exactly what a role like that requires .
Q : What are your thoughts on abolishing America ’s income tax and switching over to a consumption tax such as the fair tax ?
A : I want to abolish the income tax , but I do n’t want to replace it with anything .
About 45 percent of all federal revenue comes from the personal income tax .
That means that about 55 percent — over half of all revenue — comes from other sources , like excise taxes , fees , and corporate taxes .
We could eliminate the income tax , replace it with nothing , and still fund the same level of big government we had in the late 1990’s .
We do n’t need to u201 Creplaceu201D the income tax at all .
I see a consumption tax as being a little better than the personal income tax , and I would vote for the Fair - Tax if it came up in the House of Representatives , but it is not my goal .
We can do better .
Q : Did former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan really believe in free markets or did he fail to practice what he preached ?
A : In my book The Revolution : A Manifesto I talk about an encounter I had with Greenspan when he was still Fed chairman .
I had come across an old Objectivist newsletter Greenspan had written in the 1960 ’s supporting a real gold standard .
It was great stuff !
At a gathering we both attended , I presented the booklet and asked if he still believed in its subject .
He said he remembered the piece and still believed every word .
I ca n’t profess to know what is in Mr. Greenspan ’s heart , but his own words lead me to believe that he knew better than to pursue the policies he did .
Q : What policies should have been put into place in 1932 to stimulate the economy instead of the confiscation of monetary gold ?
A : A trust in free markets and sound money would have made the 1930 ’s much less rough .
Inflation caused the Depression , and the big government policies of Roosevelt exacerbated the problem .
Murray Rothbard wrote a masterpiece on the cause of the 1929 crash and the Great Depression , and I highly recommend it to anyone with a deep interest who wants to read the authoritative view .
Q : Is there any part of the Republican Party reaching out to you ?
At what point do we dump the G.O.P. and leave it for dead ?
A : The leadership in the House of Representatives and at the N.R.C.C. has been cordial , and I as a ranking subcommittee member am myself in leadership .
Other national leadership bodies largely ignore me .
Where I get the most attention , though , is from rank - and - file members .
Dozens of Republican congressmen from across the country asked me for money and support in November ’s election .
I was happy to support and contribute to several deserving individuals through my Liberty PAC .
As far as quitting or staying with the Republicans , everyone will have to make up his or her own mind .
There can be value in choosing either path .
I myself have no plans to leave the G.O.P .
Q : Why is it that , even in the midst of unimaginable deficits and an economic crisis , both our enormous military and our policy of drug prohibition remain sacrosanct ?
Do you think this reflects actual democratic opinion , or is it the work of powerful , but numerically small interest groups ?
A : I think that it might reflect democratic opinion , but only because each issue has been demagogued .
Take military spending .
I believe in a strong national defense .
I want our troops here , defending our territory ; I want nuclear submarines and an adequate arsenal of weapons that can repel any conceivable attack .
What I do n’t want to do is spend a trillion dollars a year maintaining an empire .
Today , our troops are in 130 countries .
We have 700 foreign bases .
We can spend far less and have a stronger national defense than we do right now .
But if you question our foreign policy , you are branded as un-American .
And we ’re told that if we do n’t u201 Cfight them over there , we ’ll fight them over here .
u201D
That ’s absurd .
On your second example , the federal war on drugs has proven costly and ineffective , while creating terrible violent crime .
But if you question policy , you are accused of being pro-drug .
That is preposterous .
As a physician , father , and grandfather , I abhor drugs .
I just know that there is a better way — through local laws , communities , churches , and families — to combat the very serious problem of drug abuse than a massive federal - government bureaucracy .
There are certainly some powerful special interests that benefit from our flawed foreign and drug policies .
Now , do I think they openly conspire together to deceive and manipulate ?
No I do n’t .
The system is much to complicated to think a few puppet masters control the strings .
But I do think we’d be a lot better off if we listened to our founding fathers and obeyed the Constitution .
The founders would never have formed a D.E.A. , and they would be horrified if they saw our troops spread thin around the globe .
Q : What do you think were your biggest mistakes in the primary race , and what would you now do differently ?
A : I was always pessimistic and never thought we would get to where we did .
My regret is that we could n’t see how quickly things would grow and were not adequately prepared for the explosion in money and support when they came .
There are dozens , hundreds of things we could have done better , but we all worked hard and did our best .
And I know we built something that will only get stronger in the years to come .

Unlike GA 's Still - Undecided Senate Race , At Least the Public Has Something on Which to Determine the Results in MN ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/22/2008 , 12:05 pm PT
As of the end of Day 3 of hand counting paper ballots in the MN U.S. Senate race between Democratic challenger Al Franken and incumbent Republican Norm Coleman , the total number of challenged ballots by both camps has now ballooned to more than 1500 , even as the official gap of ballots that have now been tallied ( versus the challenged ballots that will be adjudicated later by the state Canvassing Board ) shrank slightly to 115 .
Franken 's camp , however , now puts that number at less 100 , based on their calculations of how election officials initially judged a number of those challenged ballots .
After Day 2 on Thursday night , when the gap had stood at just 129 votes , we noted the quickly growing number of challenged ballots by each party , which would likely end up determining the final results of the election .
The numbers of those challenged ballots has now increased exponentially , with just over 60 % now counted out of 2.9 million originally cast .
Unlike Georgia , where another U.S. Senate race from November 4th is still undecided , at least there are ballots to be challenged ...
Here 's a look at a handful of some of those challenged ballots from Minnesota Public Radio , which has been posting some of them , and allowing readers to decide which way they should be adjudicated in a readers ' poll .
MPR also asked readers whether they thought " these ballots make the case for electronic voting ? "
We 're happy to note that , almost to a person , the response from readers was akin to : " Are you frickin ' kidding us ?!
Of course not !!! "
Naturally ,
The BRAD BLOG heartily concurs with those smart readers , and by way of emphasis points you to these disputed ballots from the still - undecided U.S. Senate race in Georgia , which will have a run-off on December 2nd :
... ... ...
... Oh , wait , there are no such ballots posted for transparent debate by the public or anybody else , because none exist .
They use 100 % invisible , unverifiable , reviewable - by - no - one , faith - based electronic " ballots " cast on touch - screen Diebold machines across the entire state .
So nobody is able to determine if even one of them was recorded accurately as per any voter 's intent .
That unfortunate fact has once again re-opened still more debate about the 2002 U.S. Senate race there , where Saxby Chambliss was reported by Diebold to have defeated incumbent Sen .
Max Cleland , despite pre-election polls showing he should have lost , and despite the company having installed uncertified software patches , secretly , just days before the election .
Unlike this year 's MN race , the GA race in 2002 , as well as the still - undecided 2008 race , will likely never be resolved to the public 's satisfaction .
But back to MN , where every citizen can watch how things are going , and can ultimately have confidence one way or another in the results .
Here 's how the Minnesota Independent rounded up Day 3 of counting ...
On Day Three of Minnesota ’s U.S. Senate recount , the Al Franken and Norm Coleman campaigns again increased the number of challenged ballots by more than 40 percent over the previous day .
In fact , both campaigns increased their challenged - ballot total by 48 percent .
Ballots that failed to satisfy Coleman ’s crew today numbered 404 , for a three - day total of 778 .
Franken ’s forces found 387 ballots questionable , for a grand total ( so far ) of 747 .
That makes a combined total of 1,525 challenged ballots with only 60 percent of ballots recounted statewide — already surpassing the 1,500 mark which Secretary of State Mark Ritchie predicted only yesterday would be the number of challenged ballots from the entire recount that the State Canvassing Board would have to review .
It ’s a number that represents an arms race of ballot - attrition that both Coleman 's and Franken ’s camps condemned today — even as their campaigns ramped up the rejections .
It ’s also a number that already dwarves by a factor of 13 the dwindling gap between Franken and Coleman , which now stands at 115 .
Unless the margin takes a giant leap over the remainder of the recount , the Canvassing Board looks to be the decider in Minnesota ’s senate - election drama .
...
On Friday the Franken campaign claimed its gap with Coleman stood at fewer than 100 votes , counting election officials ’ initial decisions on ballots that were later challenged .

An alternative fusion project has been kicked off in Europe that would seek abundant clean energy using a colossal laser the size of a football stadium .
The laser would tap the energy by squeezing together atoms of hydrogen - a process very similar to the one that powers the Sun .
Europe is already engaged in the Iter fusion venture that aims for the same outcome but via magnetic confinement .
The Hiper programme is seen as a necessary complementary route .
" We have two approaches because of the prize that is out there ; fusion energy is the holy grail of energy sources , " said Hiper project leader Professor Mike Dunne .
" It offers energy security because the fuel comes from seawater ; it offers abundant supply , it 's clean and it 's safe .
So the prize is huge and we believe we need as many approaches as possible to make that prize a reality , " he told BBC News .
' Spark plug '
The technical challenge of making fusion happen , however , is huge ; and a viable solution has eluded scientists for 50 years .
The Hiper ( High Power Laser Energy Research ) study has been instigated by the European Commission and involves the participation of 26 institutions from 10 countries .
Keys players are the UK , the Czech Republic and France .
The intention is to establish the practicalities of building an experimental facility to demonstrate so - called Inertially Confined Fusion Energy .
This would see a high - powered laser - pulse compress a ball - bearing - sized pellet of " heavy " hydrogen - the atomic forms , or isotopes , known as deuterium and tritium - to achieve a density 30 times that of lead .
A second pulse of light would then raise the temperature in the compressed pellet to more than 100 million Celsius .
In these conditions , the hydrogen nuclei would fuse to form helium .
According to theory , a small amount of mass would be lost and a colossal amount of energy would be released .
" Think of it as a car engine , " said Professor Dunne .
" First of all you inject the fuel and then in a car engine , a piston will compress the fuel .
In our case , we use a big laser to compress our fusion fuel .
" Then , just like in a car engine , you have a spark plug that lights the fuel .
We also use a spark but in our case , we use another laser - a very high - powered , very short - pulsed laser .
You then exhaust the products and repeat the cycle again , and again , and again - just like in your car engine . "
Doughnut approach
The " proof of principle " of laser fusion is anticipated in the next few years based on two very large - scale lasers currently nearing completion - at the National Ignition Facility in California , US , and at Laser Megajoule in Bordeaux , France .
It is hoped these facilities will show in single experimental events that more energy can be got out of the process than is required to initiate it .
Hiper 's role will be to demonstrate the technical practicalities of exploiting the principle , of turning those single events into a continuous cycle that will make commercial power plants are reality .
Last week , the legal documentation was signed to start the current phase of Hiper .
It is being funded with 13 m euros of hard cash and approximately 50 m euros of what is termed in - kind assistance - the provision of hardware and expertise from member parties .
Assuming all goes well , the feasibility study will be followed by a period of prototyping , leading to the building of a demonstration unit towards the end of the next decade .
The timescales involved are not dissimilar to the other type of fusion now being pursued by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , or Iter , under construction at Cadarache in France .
It will try to initiate fusion in a super - heated volume of gas constrained by magnetic fields in a doughnut - shaped vessel .

Researchers from the University of Ulm in Germany have discovered a new use for red LEDs ( light emitting diodes ) that is potentially much more valuable than their current use as indicators in electronics or clusters for modern lighting .
The scientists have successfully shown that after several weeks of high - intensity treatment with the red glowing diodes , patients had rejuvenated skin with reduced wrinkles .
High - intensity light has been used in medicine for more than 40 years to speed the healing of skin , but until now , the nature of the physicochemical changes has been unknown .
The scientists , Andrei Sommer and Dan Zhu , discovered that the light strips away any molecules that inhibit the flow of elastin – the protein responsible for providing elasticity to our skin and body tissues .
When the figurative road blocks are removed , the elastin can flow into the formerly blockaded areas ( the wrinkles ) and restore elasticity .
As much of our body ( including our organs ) utilizes elastin , it is thought the treatment could be used not only for superficial treatments , but also for deep internal rejuvenation , which could be as radical as regenerative medicine .
It is a fascinating discovery which may lead to some new life - enhancing / prolonging treatments that are uninvasive and that could potentially be marketed as an unobtrusive , regular - use , personal - therapy product .
I ’m thinking some sort of LED - embedded balaclava that you wear to bed … there ’s an idea for American Inventor if it returns .

• " the goal is to create products that bridge the gap between Research In Motion 's ( RIMM ) BlackBerry devices , oriented to work and e-mail , and Apple 's iPhone , oriented to fun . "
• The article implies that the platform would be capable of acting as an OS for not only smartphones , but gameboy like consoles and e-book readers .
• Palm believes they can grab 2 % of the market ; that RIM will dominate the majority of share and the iPhone will have 10 % .
• The OS would also help phones make " smarter use of data about you .

Dennis Kucinich continues to be , for me , the epitome of what a politician should be , and of what I would love to see more of in American politics .
He focuses little on what is wrong , and focuses much on how to make things right .
In the last couple of days , two OEN articles : Barbara Fredrickson 's " Keep Stoking the Positivity - Our Future Depends on It " , and Sandy Sand 's " Omigawd , Obama Sparkled on 60 Minutes Interview , " focused on the benefits of the positive .
Sitafa Harden 's diary today was about gratitude .
I 'm thrilled to see these " feel - good " messages grace the space on OEN .
Kucinich exemplifies these positive qualities for me .
I have heard him live dozens of times , and he always begins with appreciation , and leaves his listeners uplifted , instilling his exciting vision of forward movement toward progressive goals .
In his victory speech ( see video below ) he said :
" What we ran is a campaign based on principle , a campaign based on service , because that 's what our politics represents .
We have a politics that tries to connect with people 's hearts , that tries to relate to people 's practical aspirations .
So we never got into the exchanges that people were trying to bait us into ... "
" ... We have to get ready to help create a new nation here ... the last time that the United States had this potential for dramatic change was 1932 ... we have to be ready to catch this wave ... and that 's what I intend to be part of ... I am so fortunate to have your support ... thank you , thank you , thank you . "
The man knows the value of positive focus and appreciation .
Here 's hoping Obama understands the value of including Kucinich in his cabinet .
Ohio's loss can only be the country 's - and the world 's - gain .
Yesterday 's CNN segment , " Obama is Practicing Peace " included Obama , John Ridley , and Kucinich and the topic of intra-national as well as international peace .
Kucinich says ,
" ... this is what politics should really be about ... the art of drawing in new possibilities ... " and he goes on to respond with heartfelt vision to an excellent question about the Department of Peace .

Hypothesis Testing : The Basics
Say I hand you a coin .
How would you tell if it 's fair ?
If you flipped it 100 times and it came up heads 51 times , what would you say ?
What if it came up heads 5 times , instead ?
In the first case you'd be inclined to say the coin was fair and in the second case you'd be inclined to say it was biased towards tails .
How certain are you ?
Or , even more specifically , how likely is it actually that the coin is fair in each case ?
Hypothesis Testing
Questions like the ones above fall into a domain called hypothesis testing .
Hypothesis testing is a way of systematically quantifying how certain you are of the result of a statistical experiment .
In the coin example the " experiment " was flipping the coin 100 times .
There are two questions you can ask .
One , assuming the coin was fair , how likely is it that you 'd observe the results we did ?
Two , what is the likelihood that the coin is fair given the results you observed ?
Of course , an experiment can be much more complex than coin flipping .
Any situation where you 're taking a random sample of a population and measuring something about it is an experiment , and for our purposes this includes A/B testing .
Let 's focus on the coin flip example understand the basics .
The Null Hypothesis
The most common type of hypothesis testing involves a null hypothesis .
The null hypothesis , denoted H 0 , is a statement about the world which can plausibly account for the data you observe .
Do n't read anything into the fact that it 's called the " null " hypothesis — it 's just the hypothesis we 're trying to test .
For example , " the coin is fair " is an example of a null hypothesis , as is " the coin is biased . "
The important part is that the null hypothesis be able to be expressed in simple , mathematical terms .
We 'll see how to express these statements mathematically in just a bit .
The main goal of hypothesis testing is to tell us whether we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis .
In our case we want to know whether the coin is biased or not , so our null hypothesis should be " the coin is fair . "
If we get enough evidence that contradicts this hypothesis , say , by flipping it 100 times and having it come up heads only once , then we can safely reject it .
All of this is perfectly quantifiable , of course .
What constitutes " enough " and " safely " are all a matter of statistics .
The Statistics , Intuitively
So , we have a coin .
Our null hypothesis is that this coin is fair .
We flip it 100 times and it comes up heads 51 times .
Do we know whether the coin is biased or not ?
Our gut might say the coin is fair , or at least probably fair , but we can't say for sure .
The expected number of heads is 50 and 51 is quite close .
But what if we flipped the coin 100,000 times and it came up heads 51,000 times ?
We see 51 % heads both times , but in the second instance the coin is more likely to be biased .
Lack of evidence to the contrary is not evidence that the null hypothesis is true .
Rather , it means that we do n't have sufficient evidence to conclude that the null hypothesis is false .
The coin might actually have a 51 % bias towards heads , after all .
If instead we saw 1 head for 100 flips that would be another story .
Intuitively we know that the chance of seeing this if the null hypothesis were true is so small that we would be comfortable rejecting the null hypothesis and declaring the coin to ( probably ) be biased .
Let 's quantify our intuition .
The Coin Flip
Formally the flip of a coin can be represented by a Bernoulli trial .
A Bernoulli trial is a random variable X such that
Pr\left ( X = 1 \right ) = 1 - Pr\left ( X = 0 \right ) = 1 - q = p
That is , X takes on the value 1 ( representing heads ) with probability p , and 0 ( representing tails ) with probability 1 - p .
Now , let 's say we have 100 coin flips .
Let X i represent the ith coin flip .
Then the random variable
Y = \sum_{i=1} ^ { 100} X_i
The Statistics , Mathematically
represents the run of 100 coin flips .
Say you have a set of observations O and a null hypothesis H 0 .
In the above coin example we were trying to calculate
P\left ( O \mid H_0\right )
i.e. , the probability that we observed what we did given the null hypothesis .
If that probability is sufficiently small we 're confident concluding the null hypothesis is false
We can use whatever level of confidence we want before rejecting the null hypothesis , but most people choose 90 % , 95 % , or 99 % .
For example if we choose a 95 % confidence level we reject the null hypothesis if
P\left ( O \mid H_0 \right ) \le 1 - 0.95 = 0.05
The Central Limit Theorem is the main piece of math here .
Briefly , the Central Limit Theorem says that the sum of any number of re-averaged identically distributed random variables approximates a normal distribution .
Remember our random variables from before ?
If we let
p = \frac{Y}{N}
then p is the proportion of heads in our sample of 100 coin flips .
In our case , it is equal to 0.51 , or 51 % .
But by the central limit theorem we also know that p approximates a normal distribution .
This means we can estimate the standard deviation of p as
\sigma = \ sqrt{\frac{p(1- p) }{N}}
Wrapping It Up
Our null hypothesis is that the coin is fair .
Mathematically we 're saying
H_0 : p_0 = 0.50
Here 's the normal curve :
A 95 % level of confidence means we reject the null hypothesis if p falls outside 95 % of the area of the normal curve .
Looking at that chart we see that this corresponds to approximately 1.98 standard deviations .
The so - called " z- score " tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our sample is , and it 's calculated as
z = \ frac{p-0.50}{\sqrt{\frac{0.50(1-0.50 ) }{ N}}}
The numerator is " p - 0.50 " because our null hypothesis is that p = 0.50 .
This measures how far the sample mean , p , diverges from the expect mean of a fair coin , 0.50 .
The Data
Let 's say we flipped three coins 100 times each and got the following data .
Data for 100 Flips of a Coin Coin Flips Pct. Heads Z-score Coin 1 100 51 % 0.20 Coin 2 100 60 % 2.04 Coin 3 100 75 % 5.77
Using a 95 % confidence level we 'd conclude that Coin 2 and Coin 3 are biased using the techniques we 've developed so far .
Coin 2 is 2.04 standard deviations from the mean and Coin 3 is 5.77 standard deviations .
When your test statistic meets the 95 % confidence threshold we call it statistically significant .
This means there 's only a 5 % chance of observing what you did assuming the null hypothesis was true .
Phrased another way , there 's only a 5 % chance that your observation is due to random variation .
Recap
Hypothesis testing is a way of systematically quantifying how certain you are of the result of a statistical experiment .
You start by forming a null hypothesis , e.g. , " this coin is fair , " and then calculate the likelihood that your observations are due to pure chance rather than a real difference in the population .
The confidence interval is the level at which you reject the null hypothesis .
If there is a 95 % chance that there 's a real difference in your observations , given the null hypothesis , then you are confident in rejecting it .
This also means there is a 5 % chance you 're wrong and the difference is due to random fluctuations .
The null hypothesis can be any mathematical statement and the test you use depends on both the underlying data and your null hypothesis .
In our coin flipping example the underlying data approximated a normal distribution and we wanted to test whether the observed proportion of heads was different enough to be significant .
In this case we were measuring the sample mean .
We can measure anything , though : the sample variance , correlation , etc .
Different tests needs to be used to determine whether these are statistically significant , as we 'll see in coming articles .
What 's Next ?
Now that we understand the innards of hypothesis testing we can apply our knowledge to A/B tests to determine whether new features actually effect user behavior .
Until then !
Report : US spied on Blair , Iraqi president John Byrne
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email This
It 's not just warrantless wiretapping anymore .
The National Security Agency spied on British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Iraq 's first interim president Ghazi al - Yawer , according to a report Monday .
A former Army Arab linguist at the NSA told ABC News that he saw and read a file on Blair 's " private life " and listened to " pillow talk " phone calls of Iraq 's first president while working at a secret NSA facility in Georgia .
Last month , David Murfee Faulk and another former military intercept operator assigned to the NSA facility " triggered calls for an investigation when they revealed U.S. intelligence intercepted the private phone calls of American journalists , aid workers and soldiers stationed in Iraq , " ABC News ' Brian Ross reported Monday morning .
Faulk told the network he saw Blair 's file in 2006 , but refused to provide details , other than saying it had information about Blair 's personal life .
Intelligence services and governments sometimes keep files on elected officials -- known as control files -- in order to blackmail or force the hands of governments .
A spokeswoman for Blair had no comment on the report .
Unlike spying in the United States , collecting private information about foreign leaders is a common practice by US intelligence .
According to ABC , the US and Britain have pledged " not to collect [ information ] on each other . "
" If it is true that we maintained a file on Blair , it would represent a huge breach of the agreement we have with the Brits , " one former CIA official told ABC .
Faulk , the linguist , said the intercepts regarding Iraq 's former president included calls made to his fiance -- whom he later married .
He said the calls were recorded by NSA employees in Georgia and posted on the agency 's computer system for others to hear .
Faulk described the calls to ABC as " courting , wooing and pillow talk . "
In a statement to the network , an NSA spokesman said the agency follows all laws .
Blair has also been fingered in some spying of his own .
In 2004 , one of his former cabinet members , Clare Short , accused the Bush and Blair Administrations of spying on former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in the run up to the Iraq war .
Blair refused to confirm or deny the accusation .
The 1958 film of Dracula was recently celebrated on a Royal Mail stamp
Hammer Films has begun shooting in Donegal on its first production in almost 30 years - a horror thriller entitled The Wake Wood .
The film - about a couple who try to resurrect their dead daughter - stars Timothy Spall and Aidan Gillen .
It is the first feature from the cult British company since it was bought last year by a Dutch consortium .
Hammer became synonymous with the horror genre in the 1950s thanks to films like Dracula and The Mummy .
Other famous Hammer films include The Curse of Frankenstein and The Curse of the Werewolf .
Commemorative
Hammer 's last feature production was The Lady Vanishes in 1979 , a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic starring Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd .
Its last horror title , To the Devil a Daughter starring Christopher Lee , came out three years earlier .
Backed by the Irish Film Board , The Wake Wood is tentatively scheduled for a UK release in autumn 2009 .
Earlier this year , the Royal Mail released a series of commemorative postage stamps celebrating the 50th anniversary of Hammer 's first Dracula film .

Freddie Mercury died 17 years ago today .
Note : homophobic slurs will be deleted .
So STFU in advance .
A federal judge Friday angrily ordered Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman to stop deleting names from the state ’s voter registration rolls .
The judge ’s order came in a telephone hearing this afternoon that was the latest clash between Coffman and a trio of advocacy groups who had sued Coffman over the purging of the voter rolls so close to the election .
Wednesday night , the two sides reached a settlement designed to ensure voters whose registrations were wrongfully canceled within the 90 days before the election would n’t be disenfranchised on Election Day .
But state officials acknowledged today that 146 more names had been purged since the settlement was reached .
U.S. District Judge John Kane said that was a violation of federal law .
Kane warned that if Coffman does n’t stop the practice , “ he ’ll be listening to me personally . ”
He ordered the 146 voters to be put back on the rolls .
“ The court , ” said Jenny Flanagan , the executive director of Colorado Common Cause , one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit , “ has now sent a clear and binding message to state and local election officials that every legitimate voter should be able to vote , every vote should be counted , and anyone who interferes with the voting process should be held accountable . ”
In a statement , Coffman said he believed the judge ’s original order did not require him to stop the purges but rather said the settlement left the “ processes leading up to Election Day ” unchanged .
“ My office and the county clerks were in full compliance with the judge ’s original order , ” Coffman said .
“ As required after today ’s court order by Judge Kane , I ’m instructing the county clerks to reinstate the registrations canceled since 9 p.m. Wednesday evening . ”
Colorado Common Cause , Mi Familia Vota and the Service Employees International Union — all groups Coffman today called “ left - leaning ” — argued in federal court that federal law prohibits Coffman from canceling voters from the voting rolls close to the election .
The groups claim tens of thousands of voters may have been impacted by the purges , a number Coffman has vigorously disputed .
Coffman has said previously that he has followed the law and is allowed to cancel voter registrations this close to the election for a variety of reasons .
Attorney General John Suthers , who , like Coffman , is a Republican , has said Coffman was legally allowed to cancel 2,454 duplicate voter registrations close to the election .
In his statement today , Coffman said that , of the 146 registrations ordered to be reinstated , 66 were canceled because of duplications , 62 were canceled because the voter moved out of state and 12 were canceled because the voter died .
The remaining six registrations were canceled either because the potential voter was a convicted felon , was not a U.S. citizen or withdrew the application , he said .
Flanagan disputed Coffman ’s interpretation of the settlement , calling the continued voter cancellations , “ brazen . ”
“ The agreement reached on Wednesday provided a critical safeguard for voters who were wrongfully removed from Colorado ’s registration list , ” she said .
“ … Thankfully , the court has once again stepped in to put voters first . ”
The settlement in the court case , reached Wednesday , requires Coffman to put together a list the day after the election of voters whose registrations were canceled within the 90 days before the election .
Voters on that list who show up to vote on Election Day will cast provisional ballots , and those ballots will be given the presumption of eligibility , which gives them a clearer path to being counted than other provisional ballots .
Provisional ballots are counted after all the other ballots and only after they are verified as having been cast by an eligible voter .
In 2004 , about a quarter of the 51,529 provisional ballots cast in Colorado were thrown out .

Rising carbon dioxide levels will make oceans more hostile to life .
Oxygen content of the world 's oceans .
Regions with low oxygen are shown in red .
IFM - GEOMAR
Rising levels of carbon dioxide could increase the volume of oxygen - depleted ' dead zones ' in tropical oceans by as much as 50 % before the end of the century — with dire consequences for the health of ecosystems in some of the world 's most productive fishing grounds .
At depths between several tens and hundreds of metres , large parts of the tropical oceans are poorly supplied with dissolved oxygen , and are therefore hostile to most marine life .
Scientists suspect that these zones are sensitive to climate change , but previous studies have arrived at conflicting conclusions regarding exactly how and why a more CO 2 - rich world affects oceanic oxygen content .
A team led by Andreas Oschlies of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel , Germany , has now used a global model of climate , ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling to extrapolate existing experimental results of the effects of altered carbon and nutrient chemistry on dissolved oxygen to the global ocean1 .
They found that a CO 2 - rich world will only have a small impact on waters at middle and high latitudes .
But in all tropical oceans the volume of ' oxygen - minimum ' zones will substantially increase as ocean bacteria feed on the algae that will flourish as a result of the elevated CO 2 levels .
" Carbon dioxide fertilizes biological production , " says Oschlies .
" It 's really like junk food for plants .
When the carbon - fattened excess biomass sinks it gets decomposed by bacteria which first consume the oxygen , and then the nutrients . "
Dramatic result
Sporadic measurements in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific suggest oxygen - depleted zones have been slowly expanding over the past 50 years2 .
But none of the previously assumed physical causes , such as ocean warming and reduced circulation , completely accounts for the effect .
This prompted Oschlies and his colleagues to examine how the ocean 's biology would be affected by rising CO 2 levels .
Their results are published in the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles .
" Nobody really has ever modelled the feedback of rising CO 2 on oceanic oxygen concentrations in such a credible way , " says Gian - Kaspar Plattner , a carbon - cycle modeller at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich ( ETH ) .
" A 50 % volume increase of oxygen - poor zones is much more than I would have expected .
But further studies , with different climate parameters , are needed to add robustness to these results and reduce uncertainty . "
Meanwhile , researchers aboard two German research vessels , the Meteor and the Maria S. Merian , are investigating the matter further .
In the waters off western Africa and Peru , which are rich in marine life , teams from the University of Kiel and the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences , also in Kiel , will study the physical and biological processes that are thought to drive oxygen loss in tropical oceans .
The coastal economies in these regions rely heavily on fishing .
For now , says Oschlies , local fisheries may not feel any downturn because fish stocks can probably evade the dead zones by moving further up in the water column .
But if oxygen and nutrient levels continue to drop , that could hit the region hard within a few decades .
Oceanic oxygen levels have varied considerably throughout Earth 's past .
During the end of the Permian period , around 250 million years ago , catastrophic oxygen losses triggered mass extinction of terrestrial and marine life .
FEW modern surgical texts have been as contentious as “ War Surgery in Iraq and Afghanistan ” .
Rumours of its graphic content were circulating in surgical circles well before the book came out .
The American military censors reportedly tried to have the book refused an ISBN code , which would have prevented it being sold commercially .
A retired US Army surgeon general said the military command was concerned that the book 's graphic images “ could be spun politically to show the horrors of war ” .
Horrors there are : the shredding lacerations of blast ; cavitating high - velocity ballistic wounds ; injuries from “ biological projectiles ” formed of body fragments from other victims dismembered in explosions .
Civilian casualties include children riddled with shrapnel and a pregnant woman shot through her belly .
Each case is laid out in detail ; the raw verity of digital photographs from the operating table beside surgical notes written up in the immediate aftermath of resuscitation .
The book 's publication earlier in the summer coincided with complaints by American news photographers that they were being refused access to combat operations lest they depict American casualties .
There has never been a surgical reference like it , for several reasons .
Throughout the text are graphic colour photographs : phosphorus bursts white against black sky , a Humvee aflame on a bleak highway .
The section on “ high energy orthopaedic polytrauma ” ( high - velocity multiple bone injuries ) places a scan of a shattered pelvis beside a close - up of a belt of machine - gun bullets , highlighting the irony of striving to save life in the moral vacuum of war .
The book 's introduction categorises different types of casualties and the care that is available to them .
For example , American soldiers and “ embedded ” American journalists ( such as Bob Woodruff of ABC News , who has written in the foreword about his own experience of being wounded ) receive optimal treatment at each step through the military medical and rehabilitation system .
Enemy combatants , who are denied the protection of the Geneva Convention , are treated in American military hospitals until they are fit enough to be transferred to Bagram air base or Guantánamo Bay .
“ Host - nation nationals ” , Iraqi and Afghan soldiers and civilians , receive emergency care before being passed back to whatever facilities exist in their own health services .
“ The dichotomy of different pathways of care for American versus host - nation casualties ” , observes the introduction , “ remains an ongoing challenge . ”
The diversity of cases makes the book unique as a reference of war surgery practice .
The collection of wound data by the Borden Institute , the co-publisher , and the rigorous analysis of response to injury , allow prompt assessment of treatment and resuscitation techniques .
In the course of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan the number of deaths that result from haemorrhage has been hugely reduced by improved tourniquets , new compounds to stop bleeding and fundamental changes in the types of fluids transfused to treat shock .
New surgical approaches to complex injuries are being rapidly evaluated and applied .
The book is dense — about the size and mass of the chest - plate in a set of body armour — and will save many lives .
“ War Surgery in Afghanistan and Iraq ” should be part of every front - line surgeon 's armoury .

In the second part of the series , I use a simulation approach to test the likely adequacy of natural gas supplies during the upcoming heating season .
In these simulations , I use data from the UK Department of Business , Enterprise , and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) , UK National Grid , as well as information about recent UK Continental Shelf ( UKCS ) and Norwegian Continental Shelf ( NCS ) develpments .
Based on what I refer to as the reference scenario , it seems likely that the UK will increasingly have to rely on Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) imports to secure adequate supplies .
In recent years , natural gas consumption in the United Kingdom has grown rapidly .
At the same time , there has been an abrupt change in UK natural gas supplies , brought about by depletion and decline .
In the first part of this two part series , I look at historical developments in EU and UK natural gas consumption , production and imports and the challenges posed by declining production .
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In recent years , the UK has become increasingly dependent on natural gas as its primary energy source .
This strategy may soon be found to be based upon poor assumptions / perceptions regarding development of domestic and neighbouring natural gas reserves and , in general , regional and global supply capabilities .
UK marketable nat gas production ( also gross ) peaked in 2000 close to 110 Gcm /a .
During the last three years , UK nat gas production has declined at an annual rate of 8 - 10 % , which many energy analysts expect will continue .
Nat gas constituted more than 38 % of the UK primary energy consumption in 2007 .
Several analyses expect UK to import 80 % of their nat gas consumption by 2020 .
UK was a net exporter of nat gas for a brief period .
In 2007 , more than 38 % of the UK 's primary energy consumption came from nat gas .
Of the EU / OECD countries , only Italy has a higher portion of nat gas consumption .
In comparison , the USA gets 25 % of its primary energy consumption from natural gas ; France , 15 % ; and Germany , 24 % .
In general , high nat gas usage is primarily found among countries with huge nat gas reserves like Russia , where nat gas amounted to more than 57 % of primary energy production in 2007 .
Russia is the world ’s largest exporter of nat gas and second largest exporter of oil , so this high domestic usage frees up oil for export .
Since oil generates more income than nat gas , based on units of energy exported , this approach maximizes export revenue .
The UK and Continental Europe have both benefitted from the bidirectional Interconnector that since 1998 has allowed for increased flexibility in nat gas supplies .
Due to the decline in UK indigenous supplies and a tighter supply situation on Continental Europe , the importance of the Interconnector is expected to slowly diminish unless future Russian supplies are shipped through the system to UK .
NAT GAS WITHIN EU
Nat gas production within EU was on a plateau from 1996 to 2004 and has now entered into terminal decline .
Increased nat gas production from Norway ( which is not a full EU member ) has slowed the decline .
The balance of consumption within EU has been secured through increasing imports , primarily from Russia , North Africa and LNG .
The diagram above suggests that imports into EU will need to grow quickly , from 200 Gcm / a at present to projected 400 Gcm / a by 2020 , to fill the rapidly growing gap between declining supplies and projected growth in consumption .
If projected growth in EU nat gas consumption by 2020 is to be met , it will be necessary to double present imports of 200 Gcm / a from Russia , North Africa and LNG , a challenging task .
With the ongoing credit crisis still unfolding , an increase in imports that allows maintenance of present EU consumption levels may turn out to be a major accomplishment .
As of 2007 , 25 % of EU ’s nat gas consumption was imported from Russia .
Russian nat gas exports to the EU grew substantially after the completion of pipelines between Western Siberia and Europe by the mid 80’s .
There are good reasons to believe that the Russians ( meaning Gazprom ) planned their exports to the EU based upon available official data and forecasts from amongst others , EU members and Norway .
This is of course a sensible thing to do if the goal is to maximize the profits from the Russian resource base and to optimize the allocation of investment funds .
Why invest in expansions of production and infrastructure , if these investments are likely to contribute to an oversupply and a subsequent downward pressure on prices ?
Perhaps what is needed is an energy czar .
I think it was Matt Simmons who first used the expression “ energy czar ” , perhaps with a hidden meaning that Russians leaders far better understand the strategic nature of energy than their western counterparts , even though their access to data is not as good .
In 1995 - 1998 , the UK exported nat gas to Ireland .
In 1998 , the Interconnector , the bidirectional pipeline between Bacton in UK and Zeebrugge in Belgium , started to flow .
After that , the UK became a moderate exporter of nat gas to Continental Europe .
EU production of natural gas has peaked , and is expected to decline .
EU exclusive of UK nat gas production peaked in 1996 .
Since then , natural gas production has been in a general decline and is expected to continue to decline .
Recently Dutch authorities confirmed that their nat gas production is set to decline .
These milestones were passed without much attention .
For the next several years , projected increases in Norwegian nat gas production are expected to partly offset declines in production in the EU , but the overall production trend is expected to remain downward .
UK has for some years had an important role in securing a unique flexibility with respect to the EU nat gas supply chain .
The combined effect of the declining nat gas production in UK and the rest of the EU has already tightened the supply situation for EU ( ref the recent price growth within the liberalized UK market ) , and has the potential to develop into a severe nat gas supply crunch .
Such a supply crunch could have cascading effects , and may affect other energy systems .
These interrelationships seem to be poorly understood among those responsible for developing energy supply strategies .
THE UK ENERGY MIXTURE
There is no doubt that nat gas is an efficient , cleaner source of energy when it comes to cooking and heating .
More recently , it has also gained popularity for electric peak shaving and electricity production due to the low initial investment required and its responsiveness .
Figure 2 also illustrates how slowly changes in the energy mix take place .
It is often stressed that investment in energy infrastructure is a long term undertaking .
A homeowner who buys a new appliance or a business that invests in an industrial application will have to live with the decision for decades .
If the chosen energy source becomes less available or loses price competitiveness over time , it becomes hard to switch to alternatives .
Imagine a household that has based its cooking and heating needs on nat gas -- what would it take ( meaning cost ) to change to electricity or coal or any combination of other energy sources ?
THE UK NAT GAS PRODUCTION HISTORY
UK nat gas production grew rapidly in the 70s and 80s , with a steep build - up towards 100 Gcm / a in the 90’s .
The UK had a high degree of energy self - sufficiency during this period .
In the late 70’s and early 80’s , UK production was mainly complemented with nat gas from the Norwegian part of the Frigg field , which has now closed production .
The projected decline in indigenous production will have to be met with a steep growth in imports to maintain or grow consumption .
It is now estimated that imports will have to grow from the present 20 Gcm / a to 60 Gcm / a by 2015 .
Most of this growth is now expected to come from LNG .
NOTES : The remainder of the diagrams in this post are based upon the most recent monthly data from BERR converted to daily volumetric figures .
The conversion applied is 1 Scm nat gas approximates 11 kWh , based on an industrial standard .
The monthly figures from BERR are divided by the number of days ( thus creating daily averages ) in the respective months .
This means that the consumption / supplies on any day may be higher or lower than depicted in the diagrams .
THE DYNAMICS OF UK NAT GAS PRODUCTION
For the upcoming heating season , National Grid expects the indigenous supplies to decline by 10 % relative to the heating season of 2007 / 2008 according to this article from Forbes .
This suggests increased reliance on imports and increased storage withdrawals during the upcoming heating season if consumption remains close to what has been reported in recent years .
THE SEASONAL SWINGS IN UK NAT GAS CONSUMPTION
Because of the use of nat gas for heat , nat gas consumption typically shows considerable variation in seasonal consumption .
As UK indigenous supplies decline , winter supplies are expected to become increasingly dependent on imports and storage withdrawals .
THE UK AS A NAT GAS IMPORTER
UK imports have recently shown strong growth , but nat gas imported through the Interconnector has not grown proportionally .
Imports from Norway have grown substantially in recent years .
For the upcoming heating season , there is reason to believe that that Norwegian imports will not grow because of a pipeline leakage affecting production from the Kvitebjørn and Visund fields .
The operator of the Ormen Lange field ( second largest on NCS and in build - up phase ) feeding into Langeled that terminates at Easington has indicated that the drilling program has experienced delays .
The Bacton - Balgzand pipeline ( in Netherlands ) started to flow in November 2006 .
It is not clear where this natural gas originates from , but in the recent past , these deliveries have played an important role in UK nat gas supplies .
LNG imports started in 2005 and grew for a while , but have recently added little to UK nat gas supplies .
If the UK is to have adequate nat gas this heating season , greater LNG imports are likely to be required .
THE UK AS A NAT GAS EXPORTER
Figure 7 shows that nat gas exports from UK to Continental Europe have taken place mainly during the summers .
These exports are shrinking , and at some point will come to an end .
This loss of supply can be expected to increase Continental Europe 's demand for gas by a corresponding amount .
The loss of UK exports to Continental Europe will put additional pressure on other sources of imported nat gas ( North Africa , Norway , Russia and LNG ) .
As long as the UK had a surplus from indigenous production , it exported a small amount to the Netherlands , which is itself an exporter of nat gas .
The UK exports nat gas to Ireland year - around .
Ireland is at the end of the pipeline , and depends on UK 's exports .
Ireland has recently seen strong growth in its nat gas consumption .
Presently more than 28 % of Ireland ’s primary energy consumption comes from nat gas .
THE INTERCONNECTOR
The diagram above illustrates the diminishing flows in the Interconnector and may serve to illustrate that even if the transport capacities are there , nat gas does not necessarily need to be there .
During the heating season , UK nat gas supplies have benefitted from imports from Continental Europe .
THE UK AS A NET NAT GAS IMPORTER AND EXPORTER
UK has for some time simultaneously acted as both an exporter and importer of nat gas .
For the upcoming heating season , it is expected that UK net imports of pipelined nat gas will remain at pretty much the same level as the previous heating season .
May the UK reliance on and dominance of nat gas within its energy mix soon prove to become its Achilles heel ?
That will be further explored in the second part of this post .

Daddy will the lights go out this Christmas ?
Additive combinatorics is largely focused on the additive properties of finite subsets A of an additive group .
This group can be finite or infinite , but there is a very convenient trick , the Ruzsa projection trick , which allows one to reduce the latter case to the former .
For instance , consider the set inside the integers .
The integers of course form an infinite group , but if we are only interested in sums of at most two elements of A at a time , we can embed A ininside the finite cyclic group without losing any combinatorial information .
More precisely , there is a Freiman isomorphism of order 2 between the set in and the set in .
One can view the latter version of as a model for the former version of .
More generally , it turns out that any finite set A in an additive group can be modeled in the above set by an equivalent set in a finite group , and in fact one can ensure that this ambient modeling group is not much larger than A itself if A has some additive structure ; see this paper of Ruzsa ( or Lemma 5.26 of my book with Van Vu ) for a precise statement .
This projection trick has a number of important uses in additive combinatorics , most notably in Ruzsa ’s simplified proof of Freiman ’s theorem .
Given the interest in non-commutative analogues of Freiman ’s theorem , it is natural to ask whether one can similarly model finite sets A in multiplicative ( and non-commutative ) groups using finite models .
Unfortunately ( as I learned recently from Akshay Venkatesh , via Ben Green ) , this turns out to be impossible in general , due to an old example of Higman .
More precisely , Higman shows :
Theorem 1 .
There exists an infinite group G generated by four distinct elements a , b , c , d that obey the relations ; ( 1 ) in fact , a and c generate the free group in G .
On the other hand , if G ’ is a finite group containing four elements a , b , c , d obeying ( 1 ) , then a , b , c , d are all trivial .
As a consequence , the finite set in G has no model ( in the sense of Freiman isomorphisms ) in a finite group .
Theorem 1 is proven by a small amount of elementary group theory and number theory , and it was neat enough that I thought I would reproduce it here .
— No non-trivial finite models —
Let ’s first show the second part of Theorem 1 .
The key point is that in a finite group G’ , all elements have finite order , thanks to Lagrange ’s theorem .
From ( 1 ) we have
and hence by induction
(2)
for any positive n .
One consequence of ( 2 ) is that if , then , and thus .
Applying this with n equal to the order of b , we conclude that
.
As a consequence , if is divisible by some prime p , then is divisible by p , which forces p to be odd and to be divisible by the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p .
This is at most p - 1 ( by Fermat ’s little theorem ) , and so is divisible by a prime strictly smaller than the prime dividing .
But we can cyclically permute this argument and conclude that is divisible by an even smaller prime than the prime dividing , and so forth , creating an infinite descent , which is absurd .
Thus none of can be divisible by any prime , and so a , b , c , d are trivial as claimed .
Remark 1 .
There is nothing special here about using four generators ; the above arguments work with any number of generators ( adapting ( 1 ) appropriately ) .
But we will need four generators in order to establish the infinite model below .
Remark 2 .
The above argument also shows that the group G has no non-trivial finite - dimensional linear representation .
Indeed , let a , b , c , d be matrices obeying ( 1 ) , then b is conjugate to , which by the spectral theorem forces the eigenvalues of b to be roots of unity , which implies in particular that grows at most polynomially in n ; similarly for .
Applying ( 2 ) we see that grows at most polynomially in n , which by the Jordan normal form for a implies that a is diagonalisable ; since its eigenvalues are roots of unity , it thus has finite order .
Similarly for b, c,d .
Now apply the previous argument to conclude that a , b , c , d are trivial .
— Existence of an infinite model —
To build the infinite group G that obeys the relations ( 1 ) , we need the notion of an amalgamated free product of groups .
Recall that the free product of two groups and can be defined ( up to group isomorphism ) in one of three equivalent ways :
( Relations - based definition ) is the group generated by the disjoint union of and , with no further relations between these elements beyond those already present in and separately .
( Category - theoretic definition ) is a group with homomorphisms from and into , which is universal in the sense that any other group G’ with homomorphisms from will have these homomorphisms factor uniquely through .
( Word - based definition ) is the collection of all words , where each lies in either or , with no two adjacent lying in the same ( let ’s label here to be disjoint to avoid notational confusion ) , with the obvious group operations .
It is not hard to see that all three definitions are equivalent , and that the free product exists and is unique up to group isomorphism .
Example 1 .
The free product of the free cyclic group with one generator a , and the free cyclic group with one generator b , is the free ( non-abelian ) group on two generators .
We will need a “ relative ” generalisation of the free product concept , in which the groups are not totally disjoint , but instead share a common subgroup H ( or if one wants to proceed more category - theoretically , with a group H that embeds into both and ) .
In this situation , we define the amalgamated free product by one of the following two equivalent definitions :
( Relations - based definition ) is the group generated by the relative disjoint union of and ( which is the same as the disjoint union but with the common subgroup H identified ) , with no further relations between these elements beyond those already present in and separately .
( Category - theoretic definition ) is a group with homomorphisms from and into that agree on H , which is universal in the sense that any other group G’ with homomorphisms from that agree on H will have these homomorphisms factor uniquely through .
Example 2 .
Let be the group generated by two elements with one relation .
It is not hard to see that all elements of can be expressed uniquely as for some integers n , m , and in particular that is a free cyclic group .
Let be the group generated by two elements with one relation , then again is a free cyclic group , and isomorphic to the previous copy of H .
The amalgamated free product is then generated by three elements with two relations .
It is not hard to see that the above two definitions are equivalent , and that exists and is unique up to group isomorphism .
But note that I did not give the word - based definition of the amalgamated free product yet .
We will need to do so now ; I will use the arguments from this 1954 paper of Neumann ( who I briefly overlapped with , actually , at ANU ) , though the basic result I need here ( namely , Corollary 1 ) dates all the way back to the work of Schreier in 1927 .
In order to analyse these groups , we will need to study how they act on various spaces .
If G is a group , we define a G - space to be a set X together with an action of G on X ( or equivalently , a homomorphism from G to the permutation group of X ) .
Thus for instance G is itself a G - space .
A G - space X is transitive if for every , there exists such that .
A morphism from one G - space X to another G - space Y is a map such that for all and .
If a morphism has an inverse that is also a morphism , we say that it is an isomorphism .
The first observation is that a G - space with certain properties will necessarily be isomorphic to G itself .
Lemma 1 . ( Criterion for isomorphism with G ) Let G be a group , and let X be a non-empty transitive G - space , and suppose there is a morphism from the G - space X to the G - space G .
Then is in fact an isomorphism of G - spaces .
Proof .
It suffices to show that is both injective and surjective .
To show surjectivity , observe that the image is G - invariant and non-empty .
But the action of G on G is transitive , and so as desired .
To show injectivity , observe from transitivity that if are distinct elements of X then for some non-identity , thus , thus , establishing injectivity .
Now we can give the word formulation of the amalgamated free product .
Lemma 2 . ( Word - based description of amalgamated free product )
Let be two groups with common subgroup H , and let be the amalgamated free product .
Let , be some partitions of into right - cosets of H. Let X be the space of all formal words of the form , where , each lies in either or , and no two adjacent lie in the same .
let be the obvious evaluation map .
Then there is an action of G on X for which becomes an isomorphism of G - spaces .
Proof .
It is easy to verify that and act separately on X in a manner consistent ( via ) with their action on G , and these actions agree on H .
Hence the amalgamated free product G also acts on this space and turns into a morphism of G - spaces .
From construction of X we see that the G- action is transitive , and the claim now follows from Lemma 1 .
Corollary 1 .
Let be two groups with common subgroup H , and let be the amalgamated free product .
Let and be such that the cyclic groups are infinite and have no intersection with H .
Then generate a free subgroup in G .
Proof .
By hypothesis ( and the axiom of choice ) , we can find a partition where contains the infinite cyclic group , and similarly we can find a partition .
Let X be the space in Lemma 2 .
Each reduced word formed by then generates a distinct element of X , and thus ( by Lemma 2 ) a distinct element of G .
The claim follows .
Remark 3 .
The above corollary can also be established by the ping - pong lemma ( which is not surprising , since the proof of that lemma uses many of the same ideas , and in particular exploiting an action of G on a space X in order to distinguish various words in G from each other ) .
Indeed , observe that map those words in X with into words with , and similarly for , which is the type of hypothesis needed to apply the ping - pong lemma .
[ Thanks to Ben Green for this observation . ]
Now we can finish the proof of Theorem 1 .
As discussed in Example 2 , the group is the amalgamated free product of and relative to .
By Corollary 1 , a and c generate the free group here , thus contains as a subgroup .
Similarly , the group also contains as a subgroup .
We may then form the amalgamated free product
and another application of Theorem 1 shows that b,d generate the free group ( and are in particular distinct ) ; similarly a , c are distinct .
Finally , the group embeds into , which embeds into G , and so a , b , are also distinct ; cyclically permuting this we conclude that all of the a , b , c , d are distinct as claimed .
As the Treasury embarks on its unprecedented recapitalization , it is becoming clear that the
government wants not only to stabilize the industry , but also to reshape it .
Two senior officials said the selection criteria would include banks that need more capital to finance acquisitions .
“ Treasury does n’t want to prop up weak banks , ” said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity , because of the sensitivity of the matter .
“ One purpose of this plan is to drive consolidation . ”
With bankers traumatized by the credit crisis and the loss of investor confidence , officials said , there are plenty of banks open to selling themselves .
The hurdle is a lack of well - capitalized buyers .
Stable national players like Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , and Wells Fargo are already digesting acquisitions .
A second group of so - called super - regional banks are well positioned to take over their competitors , officials said , but have been reluctant to undertake or unable to complete deals .
By offering capital at a favorable rate , the government may encourage them to expand .
In this category , industry analysts point to regional leaders , like KeyCorp of Cleveland ; Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati ; BB&T of Winston - Salem , N.C. ; and SunTrust Banks of Atlanta .
With $ 125 billion left over after investing in the nine largest banks , the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , said there was enough capital to invest in every qualified bank .
“ We have received indications of interest from a broad group of banks of all sizes , ” he said at a news conference .
“ This program is not being implemented on a first - come , first - served basis . ”
Mr. Paulson did not address the issue of bank mergers in his remarks , but officials say it has been widely discussed within the Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which has been burdened in recent months by having to support teetering banks like Wachovia .
( See Paulson 's statement in the video below )
Providing capital to help facilitate a merger , officials say , is also a way to track how the capital is used .
Some analysts have questioned how much control the government can exert over its investment , when it is injected into banks in return for nonvoting preferred shares .
“ We think there will be pressure behind the scenes by Treasury to push together companies that should have merged months or years ago , ” said Gerard Cassidy , a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Portland , Me . “ If you can create stronger companies , that is a positive . ”
In selecting banks , Mr. Paulson said the Treasury would also rely on advice from the quartet of regulators who oversee the banking industry : the Fed , the F.D.I.C. , the comptroller of the currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
But Mr. Paulson made clear that the final decision of who gets federal money rests with the Treasury .
And he reiterated that the government expected the banks that got money to lend it out rather than hoard it — putting in a special plea for homeowners with troubled mortgages .
“ We expect all participating banks to continue to strengthen their efforts to help struggling homeowners , ” he said .
“ Foreclosures not only hurt the families who lose their homes , they hurt neighborhoods , communities and our economy as a whole . ”
Feature trailer for Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince .
Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was .
Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle , but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching .
Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort 's defenses and , to this end , Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague , the well - connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn , whom he believes holds crucial information .
Meanwhile , the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts .
Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny , but so is Dean Thomas .
And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her , only she had n’t counted on Romilda Vane 's chocolates !
And then there 's Hermione , simpering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings .
As romance blossoms , one student remains aloof .
He is determined to make his mark , albeit a dark one .
Love is in the air , but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again .
Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince is the sixth of eight movies in the Harry Potter film franchise , though J.K. Rowling only wrote seven books .
The final book , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , is split into two films .
The Half - Blood Prince contains flashbacks to a younger Tom Riddle -- who would go on to become Lord Voldemort -- and his parents .
In the movie , the role of young Tom Riddle is played by Hero Fiennes - Tiffin , the nephew of Ralph Fiennes , who plays Lord Voldemort .
Tom Riddle 's mom is played by Martha Fiennes , Ralph 's sister .
The scene shown in the trailer , where the Death Eaters cause the collapse of Millennium Bridge in London , is not in the book .
Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince is directed by David Yates , who directed four of the eight Potter films .
Once again we return to the Wizarding World for this , the sixth Harry Potter installment .
Just as the books have gotten darker each time , so too have the films , and the Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince feature trailer certainly has a dark foreboding which is evident from the footage shown here .
Many events are happening in the movie , most of which are hinted at in the trailer , but the main thread once again is Harry trying to defeat Lord Voldemort .
The only problem is ; Voldemort is getting stronger and his army is rising .
Death Eaters now freely roam and those with the Dark Mark are no longer forced to hide in the shadows .
Harry finds himself under the personal tutelage of Dumbledore , who takes him on a strange journey , culminating in truly heartbreaking and epic events that will have severe lasting effects on all concerned .
Aside from the darkness , there is , as always , some light .
Our trio- Harry , Ron and Hermione - are all growing up and hormones abound .
Harry is hung up on Ginny , sure , but we all know the real love story happening is between Ron and Hermione .
We also meet Professor Slughorn ( played by Jim Broadbent ) , whom you might remember from the book liked to show favor towards the more able pupils , especially Harry .
This causes further friction between Harry and Professor Snape ( Alan Rickman ) .
This feature trailer is brilliant for many reasons ; fantastic visual effects , great hints at some gripping storylines as well as lots of humor .
Let 's face it though , trailer or no trailer , we 'd all still flock to the movies for this one .
It 's Harry Potter , after all .
Bill Gates joined forces with the United Nations yesterday to unveil a $ 76 m ( £ 41 m ) initiative to haul hundreds of thousands of small farmers out of poverty by buying up their surplus production to feed the world 's hungriest .
" The world 's poor are reeling under the impact of high food and fuel prices , and buying food assistance fromdeveloping world farmers is the right solution at the right time , " said Josette Sheeran , executive director of the UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) , which is spearheading the scheme .
The scheme , known as Purchase for Progress , will be implemented in 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America , initially aiming to increase the incomes of up to 350,000 farmers .
Lead participants at a New York press conference yesterday said that the WFP would purchase directly from small farmers – who are mainly women – and will also offer improved access to technology , fertilisers and seeds .

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is contributing the lion 's share of the funding , $ 66 m over five years .
The rest will come from the Howard G Buffett Foundation and the Belgian government – which is to pay farmers in Democratic Republic of Congo .
" Purchase for Progress is win-win .
We help our beneficiaries who have little or no food , and we help local farmers who have little or no access to markets , " said Ms Sheeran .
The WFP has recently been overhauling its purchasing system to source more emergency food regionally .

RIAA Abandoning Mass Lawsuits In Favor Of Backroom 3 Strikes Policy

It really was just three days ago that we suggested that if the record labels actually wanted anyone to take them seriously concerning their desire to come up with more constructive solutions to the business model challenges they face , they should at least stop suing folks as a gesture of trying something new .
The usual recording industry defenders in the comments claimed this was a ridiculous suggestion , but it appears that the RIAA is at least taking astep in that direction .
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the recording industry ( the WSJ mis-labels it " the music industry " ) is abandoning its strategy of mass lawsuits
First off , thisa step in the right direction -- and we think it 's great that the record labels have agreed to do this , even if it 's many , many years too late .
And , it 's hardly a huge concession .
The lawsuits have been an unmitigated disaster .
They have done nothing to slow file sharing ( in fact , the publicity generated from the lawsuits has often been credited with alerting many people to the possibility ) .
The strategy has also splintered the file sharing space into many , many different players , many of them way underground , unlike in the early days when there were a manageable number of players who could be worked with proactively .
It 's also done tremendous damage to the brands of the major record labels ( Universal , Warner , EMI and Sony ) and the RIAA itself -- leading many to swear off buying any of their products .
Finally -- and most importantly -- the strategy didto help musicians adapt to a changing market that was opening up tremendous new opportunities both to spread their music and to profit .
So , kudos to the folks at the RIAA forrealizing how backwards this strategy has been .
But , of course , this is the RIAA , so you can rest assured that the details are n't anything to be happy about .
In exchange for not filing mass lawsuits , the RIAA has worked out backroom deals with numerous ISPs ( brokered by Andrew Cuomo -- who has a history of using baseless threats to get ISPs to censor content they have no legal responsibility to censor ) .
The exact details are a bit sketchy , but it sounds like a variation on the ridiculous three strikes policy that has been ( mostly ) rejected in Europe as a violation of basic civil rights .
Basically , these ISPs will agree to be the RIAA enforcers .
Based solely on the RIAA 's flimsy evidence , the ISPs will either pass on , or directly email subscribers with , warning letters .
Depending on the specifics of the agreement , the users will get one or two more warning letters before the ISP will start limiting their internet access or potentially cutting them off entirely .
If you think this sounds suspiciously like what Europe just rejected , you 're right .
And , of course , the RIAAsays it may sue those who do n't stop file sharing after all of this .
They 're just backing away from thelawsuit filings that they 've been doing .
Okay , so over the past few weeks , recording industry defenders have said that we were jumping the gun in criticizing a potential plan because it was n't final .
Our point was that since the record labels claim they want a " conversation , " these deals should n't be negotiated in backrooms not involving substantial stakeholders .
So what happened here ?
Yup , a backroom deal was negotiated without any involvement from users .
And it was done under the direction of Andrew Cuomo , who just spent many months browbeating ISPs into agreeing to censor content .
So , hopefully , we wo n't be told that we 're being premature in criticizing this plan -- but somehow I find it unlikely .
This plan is hardly a major concession by the record labels and the RIAA .
The lawsuit strategy was a massive failure in almost every facet .
Giving them up is hardly a big deal .
It 's admitting what pretty much everyone else knew from the beginning : that suing your fans and customers is a monumentally dumb move .
Ending a brain - dead , self - defeating policy is worthy of kudos , but only for finally recognizing the obvious -- not as some magnanimous gesture .
And in exchange for the RIAA stopping its policy of shooting itself in the foot , we get ISPs making athemselves , agreeing to become RIAA enforcers , despite thesafe harbors they have via the DMCA .
These ISPs will now be heavily involved in the process of policing their users , increasing their expense , which of course will be passed on to users .
But the biggest problem is the fact that this allows private organizations to judge users without any significant defense on their part .
The stories of falsely accused file sharers are widespread at this point .
IP address - based evidence is notoriously unreliable .
Yet , the RIAA will be basing its notifications on such evidence .
Sure , plenty of the IP addresses dug up by the RIAA are probably accurate , but we live in an innocent - until - proven - guilty world , and this does away with that completely .
Also , as the EU noted in rejecting this proposal , the " punishment " hardly fits the crime .
These days , an internet connection is a necessity -- and taking it away from people because someone is sharing the gift of music with others not for any sort of commercial gain is totally unbalanced .
It takes away an individual 's civil and privacy rights , all because the big record labels refuse to recognize that there are other business models out there that already work .
And that final point may be the most important .
As we noted in explaining why the music tax is a bad idea , none of these moves by the RIAA are actually necessary .
Musicians are figuring out plenty of fantastic business models that work wonders , and many of them actually involve embracing file sharing and using that to help grow their markets .
What 's wrong with letting those business models establish themselves , without brokering a totally unnecessary backroom deal that will almost certainly harm innocent people thanks to flimsy evidence ?
So , yes , we 're thrilled that the record labels have finally progressed to the point of realizing that mass lawsuits were a bad idea , but working out a backroom deal for a type of three strikes policy is not a particularly good solution .
It 's more of the same : trying to prop up an obsolete business model by a private industry unwilling or too stubborn to change with the market .
That NY's Attorney General felt this private business model issue should involve his efforts in the midst of a huge financial crisis , including the largest Ponzi scheme ever , makes little sense .
If these are the " new leaf " and " open conversations " the record labels are insisting they 're about these days , they 've got an awful lot of work to do still .

It is official .
Mats Sundin signed Thursday with the Vancouver Canucks , ending months of speculation and marking a major coup for rookie general manager Mike Gillis .
Contract terms were not disclosed , but J.P. Barry , Sundin 's agent , confirmed it was a one - year contract , presumably pro-rated to the remainder of the season .
" We 're still working on a couple of structures that will still be better for both Mats and the team , " Barry said .
" I 'm truly excited to be joining the Canucks , " Sundin said .
" Once I made the decision to return to play a few weeks ago , the Vancouver opportunity was simply the best overall fit . "
Sundin , an unrestricted free - agent forward , is expected to join the Canucks on Dec. 27 , when the NHL 's holiday roster freeze expires .
" He will tell us when he is ready to play , " Gillis told reporters during a media conference at General Motors Place .
" He has been training for several months off ice and skating almost every day this month , " Barry said .
" I think the team will have to decide when he is ready and that would be anywhere from one to two weeks . "
' Character and integrity '
Sundin had spent the past nine months mulling over whether to retire or to return for an 18th NHL season , but the Canucks remained steadfast in their pursuit of him .
" I think we 'll see a big , strong centre - ice man who skates really well and averages a point a game , " Gillis said of Sundin .
" He has been the captain of a team in a [ Toronto ] market that is really challenging and he has handled it impeccably .
" I think the quality we try and get from every player , in terms of character and integrity , are absolutely there . "
Sundin reportedly was offered $ 20 million US over two years in the summer by Gillis , who acknowledged " our objective was to stay as consistent as possible in this process . "
" He did a very good job , " Barry said of Gillis .
Sundin earned $ 5.5 million US last season , when he led the Toronto Maple Leafs with 32 goals and 78 points in 74 games .
He became an unrestricted free agent on July 1 , and reportedly whittled the field of interested teams from a dozen to two — the Canucks and New York Rangers , who would have needed to clear millions in salary cap space to sign Sundin .
" I think it ended up being the Canucks because the Rangers could n't make it happen cap wise , " said Scott Morrison of Hockey Night In Canada .
" Ultimately , he may never have had to decide between the two because the Rangers could n't come back and they had everything in place .
" But Vancouver handled things well from the beginning and had a great $ 10 - million offer on the table .
It is a team that is close and now is much better . "
' A top three or top six player '
Sundin has played the last 13 of his 17 NHL seasons with the Maple Leafs , who acquired him from the Quebec Nordiques in a blockbuster trade on June 28 , 1994 .
The former Maple Leafs captain has posted 555 goals and 766 assists for 1,321 points in 1,305 NHL games since he was drafted first overall by Quebec in 1989 .
A nine - time all - star , he is Toronto 's all - time leader in goals ( 420 ) and points ( 987 ) .
" He , obviously , is a top three or top six player , " Morrison said .
" He gives them more offence , experience , leadership and options up front .
" Now they have three lines that are pretty darn good . "
Good enough to make Vancouver a Stanley Cup contender ?
" I do not think I would be comfortable calling any team a contender other than San Jose and Detroit , " Gillis said .
" What we want to do is get in the playoffs and win round - by - round .
" For me , it is the process of how the team plays and the integrity it plays with .
I know we will get results if we play that way .
" I think Mats is a great player that joins a good group of players that are committed to winning .
I think we 're a better team , for sure . "

MEDICAL MIRACLE : Marko Dutschak was paralysed from the chest down by a cyst ( Europics )
Marko Dutschak from Murau , central Austria , was paralysed from the chest down after the procedure to remove the cyst that had crushed his spinal cord .
Chief neurosurgeon Hans Georg Eder said : " The condition had left him with a spinal cord as thin as a piece of cotton thread .
There was virtually nothing left . "
He added : " In medical terms we do n't talk of miracles , but the boy ’s recovery was not medically expected and is really a sensation .
The cyst had completely surrounded the spinal cord , which was as thin as a thread inside it .
" Yet now he has learned to walk again .
It illustrates to a remarkable extent the healing abilities of the very young that greatly surpass that of adults . "
His mum Sandra recalled how she arrived for a visit one morning and found Marco strolling around the balcony of his private hospital room , as reported by the Austrian Times .
As CSS styling is becoming more and more popular in application design , I ’ve been experimenting at work with applying this to Clutter .
We already have an experimental widget set built on top of Clutter called Tidy .
Using Robert Staudinger ’s css selection engine and libcroco , I was able to apply style information from a stylesheet to Tidy widgets .
.
Images are also supported using the “ background - image ” property .
One big question for us was how many properties do we expose to CSS and how does it interact with the JSON functionality .
For the moment , we are concentrating on using CSS to allow developers and designers to assign the same properties on many widgets .
Internally , this is achieved using a “ Stylable ” interface and a Style object .
The Style object is simply a data store that holds all the data associated with the CSS style sheet .
The Sytable interface can be implemented by any GObject and used to install hooks for CSS properties .
The Stylable object can query the Style and retrieve the values it needs .
An interesting aspect of this approach is that it does n’t limit theming to just Widget derived classes .
Any object can be made Stylable and obtain style data .
This would be useful for other toolkits such as GTK + , where objects like CellRenderers currently cannot be styled in the theme because they do not derive from GtkWidget .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday ordered preparations for rising sea levels from global warming , a startling prospect for the most populous U.S. state with a Pacific Ocean coastline stretching more than 800 miles .
Recorded sea levels rose 7 inches during the 20th century in San Francisco , Schwarzenegger said in the executive order for study of how much more the sea could rise , what other consequences of global warming were coming and how the state should react .
California is considered the environmental vanguard of government in the United States , with its own standards for car pollution and a law to cut emissions of carbon dioxide , the main gas contributing to global warming .
“ The longer that California delays planning and adapting to sea level rise the more expensive and difficult adaptation will be , ” Schwarzenegger said , ordering a report by the end of 2010 .
Many economists skeptical of bailout
Many of the same economists and opinion - makers who'd provided a bipartisan sheen of consensus to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's previous moves have quickly begun casting doubts on the wisdom of a policy that would allow Treasury to purchase without oversight hundreds of billions of dollars of difficult - to - price assets from financial institutions .
Under the proposal , Paulson would not have to report to Congress until December , and the only safeguard for taxpayers was a provision that the “ Secretary shall take into consideration means for — ( 1 ) providing stability or preventing disruption to the financial markets or banking system ; and ( 2 ) protecting the taxpayer . ”

Skepticism toward the plan reflected more than the predictable desires of the left to spread the wealth to Main Street or of the right to reject government bailouts , although those sentiments were also expressed .
" We need to take a bold move .
In that sense I think Paulson is right , " Luigi Zingales , a Professor at the University of Chicago School of Business who wrote a widely circulated short essay titled " Why Paulson is Wrong , ” told Politico .
Zingales fears that the Treasury bailout would effectively turn the entire financial sector into a Government Sponsored Enterprise , complete with the same murkiness and moral hazard that sunk Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
“ It might achieve the final outcome , but it will do so at an enormous cost , " he said .
" All the troubles we ’ve seen with Fannie and Freddie would be seen again and again across the entire financial sector . "
Former Clinton Secretary of Labor and informal Obama advisor Robert Reich , writing in Politico 's Arena forum , added that " [ I ] f you are a member of Congress , you just might be in a position to demand from Wall Street certain conditions in return for the blank check , " and suggested that the government take an equity stake in financial institutions , provide homeowner relief , and instill the outlines of a new regulatory regime .
" Wall Streeters may not like these conditions , " Reich went on .
" Well , you should tell them that the public does n’t like the idea of bailing out Wall Street . "
President Bush is “ asking for a huge amount of power , ” said Nouriel Roubini , an economist at New York University who was among the first to predict the crisis .
“ He 's saying , ‘ Trust me , I 'm going to do it right if you give me absolute control . '
This is not a monarchy . ”
( Roubini told the New York Times that despite these concerns , he also thought the plan could help stave off a recession . )
Paul Krugman , the Princeton University economist and liberal columnist for The New York Times who had until now been cautiously supportive of Paulson 's and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ’s efforts to prop up the system , wrote that the new plan would be a taxpayer rip - off .
“ I hate to say this , but looking at the plan as leaked , I have to say no deal , ” he wrote on his blog at 4:46 p.m. Saturday .
“ Not unless Treasury explains , very clearly , why this is supposed to work , other than through having taxpayers pay premium prices for lousy assets . ”
Yves Smith , a longtime banker and contributor to the influential finance blog Naked Capitalism , published an angry post there titled , " Why You Should Hate The Treasury Bailout Proposal " :
" Given that continuing to buy U.S. assets will come under increasingly harsh scrutiny overseas , the U.S. needs to bend over backwards to devise a plan that at least looks credible in terms of directing the funds that come from taxpayers and lenders to their highest and best uses and implementing reforms that will restore active and prudent oversight of financial firms , " she wrote .
" The administration 's demand for a free pass , even if Congress unwisely goes along , is likely to backfire with our foreign creditors . "
Gregory Mankiw , a professor at Harvard University and a former chairman of Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers who was the economic guru for Mitt Romney 's campaign , favorably linked to Smith 's post under the headline " A Blank Check " and approvingly quoted a correspondent who wrote , " Has more money ever been given with fewer restrictions on how it is used ?
Ever ? "
Sebastian Mallaby , the center - right economic columnist for The Washington Post and scholar of the modern financial system , was equally dubious .
“ The plan is being marketed under false pretenses , " he wrote in his Sunday column , rejecting comparisons of the plan to the Resolution Trust Corporation , which the government formed in response to the savings and loan crisis to purchase and sell off the bad loans made by bankrupted thrifts .
“ The administration proposes to buy up bad loans before the lenders go bust , ” Mallaby noted , keeping the banks alive but doing little to solve the problem infecting the markets .
“ Bad loans are weighing down the financial system precisely because private - sector experts can't determine their worth .
The government would have no better handle on the problem . ”
Justin Fox ,
Time magazine 's top financial writer and columnist , also worried about the lack of an upside for the taxpayer .
" What I still can't figure out is how Treasury hopes to structure the bailout so there 's at least a chance of getting a fair return on that risk - taking , " he wrote on his blog .
" How on earth will these things be priced ? " Portfolio's Felix Salmon asked about the bad debt Paulson plans to purchase .
He also pointed out that Treasury would need to stock its office with bond - trading professionals .
" All we know so far is that it 's going to be set up as a reverse auction , but that raises more questions than it answers . "
One notable proponent of the plan was The Financial Times ' unsigned Lex column , which acknowledged the lack of oversight but mostly praised the plan :
" This bailout is necessary and the bill should be pushed through quickly .
…
Nor is the package necessarily a disaster for the taxpayer or the U.S. dollar .
If the Treasury buys assets well , and confidence is restored , there is [ a ] chance that Mr. Paulson could win fund manager of the year . "
Zingales , though , writes in " Why Paulson Is Wrong " that " For somebody like me who believes strongly in the free market system , the most serious risk of the current situation is that the interest of a few financiers will undermine the fundamental workings of the capitalist system .
The time has come to save capitalism from the capitalists . "
Mohammed Taha is pushed to school by his brother Amjad
By Jeremy Bowen
Middle East editor , BBC News
More than 40 years of Israeli occupation distorts everything in Hebron , even the school run .
Two brothers , Mohammed and Amjad Taha , live in the narrow lanes and covered courts of the old town centre .
Until a few years ago their quarter was crumbling , but it has been renovated with Swedish aid money .
The alleys have been paved , and the ancient stones scrubbed and repointed .
Half close your eyes and you could imagine yourself in a place where tourists might want to stroll .
And how wrong you would be .
This is no place for a holiday .
You can see Mohammed and Amjad 's school from their front door , about 200 yards away , just down the alley .
When I was there last week the school 's windows were catching the morning sun as Mohammed , eight , teetered in the entrance of his home , holding on to the doorframe .
He has cerebral palsy , so his big brother Amjad , 12 , parks his wheelchair , puts on the brake and lifts him in .
Israeli troops protect the Jewish settlers , and impose restrictions on Palestinians
He 's been doing it since Mohammed started school two years ago .
They wave goodbye to their mother and set off .
Concrete barrier
But they do n't turn down the alley to get to school , which should be only two minutes away , even for a boy in a wheelchair .
About the time that Mohammed was born , the Israeli army blocked the alley with a high concrete barrier .
Last week Mrs Taha told the BBC that the Israelis had ignored requests to open it to make it easier for him to get to school .
The barrier was put there by the army , to make life easier and safer for the Jewish settlers who sometimes use the street on the other side .
A small community of Israelis lives in the centre of Hebron , in defiance of international laws that forbid an occupying power to settle its own people on the territory it has captured .
A strong force of Israeli combat troops protects the settlers , and has imposed years of restrictions on the Palestinians who live near them .
Anger and hatred simmer on both sides .
Both sides recall massacres : of Jews in 1929 , of Palestinians in 1994 .
So we filmed the boys going to school .
Instead of the direct route , Amjad had push him up into the tangle of alleys to take him the long way round .
Hebron is a city of steep hills .
Luckily Amjad is a strong boy , and judging by his shoulders , the workout he had been getting every school day for two years was making him stronger all the time .
The morning after the pictures of the two boys were broadcast by the BBC , Palestinian workers employed by the Israeli civil administration turned up at Mohammed Taha 's alley and demolished the wall .
In a statement the army said that after a request from the family , the wall was taken down " to facilitate easier movement for the child , it was a gesture of goodwill " The building workers told the BBC that the wall would be rebuilt with a gate inside it , which only Mohammed and his family will be able to use .
Self - inflicted wound
In occupied Hebron , the abnormal has become normal .
The Taha brothers are not the only people there who have tough lives .
Palestinian police have recently deployed on Hebron 's streets Living under occupation is hard enough for Palestinians , but their leaders are making matters even worse with a wound that they are inflicting on themselves .
The split between their two main factions , Hamas , the self - styled Islamic Resistance Movement , and Fatah , the heirs to Yasser Arafat , is so bitter that reconciliation talks arranged by the Egyptian government in Cairo were cancelled at the last minute .
Hamas said it would not go because police loyal to Fatah have been arresting its people .
In the last few weeks a new detachment of Palestinian police , armed and trained by Americans and Europeans , has been deployed on the streets of Hebron .
They are there with the permission of Israel , on the understanding that they will stay away from the Jewish settlers and will co-ordinate their operations with the Israeli authorities .
Outside the headquarters of Palestinian intelligence in Hebron , families were waiting to visit some of the arrested men who are being held in the building 's cells .
Tense - looking men dragged on their cigarettes .
Women , all modestly dressed in the Islamic style , some completely veiled , stood together .
Tea and weaponry Inside in the deputy chief 's office a small cache of weapons and bombs , mainly home - made , was arranged in the corner .
Tea was offered by an intelligence man carrying an American - made M - 16 assault rifle , and wearing a holster containing a nickel - plated pistol , its butt covered in mother - of - pearl - effect plastic .
Palestinian police seized weapons from Hamas during recent raids
The deputy chief , who does n't want his name published , said the small pile of weapons came from the previous night 's raids .
He spoke in between signing papers , making phone calls , and sipping his tea .
" It is illegal for other factions to carry weapons .
Hamas says we work for the Israelis to keep their people on side .
This is a political and PR struggle as well .
" But we signed an agreement with Israel and we are serious about applying it to get a Palestinian state . "
For the Fatah leadership in Ramallah , who have been negotiating with the Israelis , the raids and arrests in Hebron and elsewhere are the meaning of the phrase " cracking down on terror " that is often used by Israeli and western leaders when they are listing what Palestinians need to do if they want a state .
But some of the people who have been raided say it is more to do with settling scores .
A number of Hamas supporters who spoke to the BBC said that the Palestinian police who raided their homes threatened them by saying that they would get the same medicine that Hamas inflicted on Fatah people in Gaza when they seized control last year .
Weakened by division Charitable institutions funded by Islamic charities and run by Hamas sympathisers or activists have also been raided , and sometimes closed down , by Palestinian police .
The deputy intelligence chief in Hebron shrugged and said that it is impossible to separate the political and military activities of Hamas from its charitable work , which for some Palestinians is the nearest they have to a welfare state .
Hamas denies any of the charities were fronts for what the police say are illegal activities .
The irony of all this for Palestinians is that they know that their divisions weaken them .
Both Fatah and Hamas have talked about the need for national unity .
But for now , they cannot even find a way to sit down together .
And for if they are not united they will not be able to create a proper state .
This week the Taha family had some good news about Mohammad 's trip to school .
But the collapse of the reconciliation talks before they had started is not just bad news for Palestinians , it is bad for anyone who wants peace in the Middle East .

Goldman , Sachs & Co. urged some of its big clients to place investment bets against California bonds this year despite having collected millions of dollars in fees to help the state sell some of those same bonds .
The giant investment firm did not inform the office of California Treasurer Bill Lockyer that it was proposing a way for investment clients to profit from California ’s deepening financial misery .
In Sacramento , officials said they were concerned that Goldman ’s strategy could raise the interest rate the state would have to pay to borrow money , thus harming taxpayers .
“ It could exaggerate people ’s worries about our credit , ” said Paul Rosenstiel , head of the public finance division of the treasurer ’s office .
Such worries would tend to drive down the price of California bonds .
That , in turn , would drive up the interest rate the state and its municipalities pay to borrow money .
An increase of a single percentage point on a $ 1 - billion bond issue would cost taxpayers an additional $ 10 million a year in interest .

That ’s especially troublesome at a time of severe budget turmoil and tight credit .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has warned that the state could run out of cash as early as February .
Some experts said the investment bank ’s actions , while not illegal , might be inappropriate .
“ That ’s not a good way to do business , ” said Geoffrey M. Heal , professor of public policy and business responsibility at Columbia University .
“ They ’ve got a conflict of interest and they ’re acting against the interest of their customers .
. . .
You act in the interests of your clients .
You do n’t screw them , to put it bluntly . ”
Goldman declined to discuss the details of its trading strategy .
“ We continue to support our clients and underwrite transactions , ” spokesman Michael DuVally said in an e-mail response to written questions on Oct. 28 .
He said Goldman “ as a firm ” was no longer giving the trading advice to clients .
He declined to elaborate .
Goldman ’s strategy was embodied in a 58 - page report presented to institutional investors in September .
The document , stamped “ Proprietary and Confidential , ” was obtained by ProPublica , a New York - based nonprofit organization specializing in investigative reporting .
This article was reported jointly by ProPublica and the Los Angeles Times .

Goldman stood to profit from several aspects of California ’s borrowing , which involves the sale of bonds to investors .
First , it collected millions of dollars in fees for bringing the bonds to market and finding buyers .
Then it marketed a financial instrument known as a credit default swap that is essentially an insurance policy against a bond default .
The bond investor buying the instrument pays a fee in exchange for a promise of a full refund of the bond ’s face value should a state such as California abruptly refuse to pay back what it owes .
Such defaults are extremely rare -- California , for example , has never defaulted -- but the swaps ’ prices rise as states or municipalities slide into tough times economically .
Goldman , according to sources familiar with municipal bond trading , has been a leading dealer in municipal credit default swaps .
The New York - based firm was trying to expand that niche market into one with broader appeal to major investors .
The company also is an important underwriter of California municipal securities .
Over the last five years , it has earned about $ 25 million in underwriting fees from California issues .

The 58 - page document advised big investors how they could profit from -- or hedge against losses in -- financial markets that had become extremely volatile and unpredictable .
The firm advised “ shorting ” -- that is , betting on a price decline -- in markets for corporate junk bonds , European banks , the euro and British pound currencies , and U.S. municipal bonds .
Several large states , including California , faced “ worsening fiscal outlooks , ” the report said .
It cited the recent bankruptcy of the Bay Area city of Vallejo as evidence of the “ worsening fundamentals of municipal finances . ”
Meanwhile , muni bond insurers were suffering credit downgrades , it noted , which undermined the quality , and therefore the prices , of the bonds they had insured .
And the credit crunch was forcing big investors such as hedge funds to dump their muni bond portfolios , driving down the bonds ’ prices .
Goldman recommended making the short bets via credit default swaps , a market in which it played a major role .

These instruments are designed to allow investors and speculators to hedge , or insure against , the risk that bond issuers or other debtors might default on their obligations .
In their customary form , they are contracts that require their sellers -- in this case Goldman Sachs -- to buy back from a swap holder a defaulted bond at 100 cents on the dollar , thus insuring against any loss .
In that way , the swaps could be beneficial to the market , encouraging risk - averse investors to buy more municipal bonds .
But like derivative securities in general , they can be dangerous to hold .
That ’s because they are often highly leveraged .
A small investment can buy coverage on bonds worth much more .
If defaults rise to unexpected levels , the swap sellers could be hard - pressed to make good on their promises .
The perils of the credit default swap market were brought home this year , when they were instrumental in the collapse of Lehman Bros .
Holdings , American International Group and Bear Stearns .
Lehman and AIG were rumored to owe far more than they could pay on swaps they had sold .
Meanwhile , the prices of default swaps on the three firms soared , signaling to investors that the firms might be in trouble .
Investigations continue into whether those swaps may have been manipulated to undermine confidence in the firms and drive them out of business .
“ By encouraging people to buy swaps , you ’re pushing up the price of those and making it more expensive to insure against the default on the bond that you ’re buying , ” Heal said .
“ The fact that such coverage has gone up in price will signal to the investor that the riskiness of the bond has increased , even if that ’s not true .
Even if the underlying financial situation of the state has not , in fact , changed . ”

Indeed , what some traders found perplexing about the push for a market in municipal credit default swaps was that muni defaults almost never happen .
Goldman was a leader in the effort to build up the market for the muni swaps .
In May , when the financial information firm Markit introduced a municipal CDS index to give swap traders a benchmark to set prices , Goldman was listed as one of the seven dealers participating in the rollout .
For some time before that , Lockyer told The Times , Goldman had “ regularly urged ” California to trade in the municipal swaps itself , ostensibly to hedge the state ’s risks as a bond issuer .
Lockyer refused .
The trading strategy that Goldman pitched to institutional investors was apparently crafted in the spring and summer .
The company may have hoped to parlay the swaps market into more activity in municipal bond trading , which is traditionally light because muni investors tend to hold the bonds to maturity .

Theoretically , the swaps index could lure speculators into the muni market , a development that would create much more fluctuation in daily prices , which in turn would generate revenue for trading desks at Goldman and other investment firms .
Lockyer and Rosenstiel said they became aware of the introduction of the muni swaps index but had not detected an effect on trading or pricing of California bonds .
But they also said the market was so complex , and the conditions affecting municipal bond prices so numerous , that it might be difficult to identify any specific cause for a given price change in California debt issues .
“ The existence of the credit default swap market in muni bonds has the potential to hurt muni issuers , ” Rosenstiel said , “ but it also has the potential to help muni issuers , and I do n’t think we have enough experience to know which is which . ”

He acknowledged that it was not unusual for a full - service investment firm such as Goldman Sachs to have to navigate among potential conflicts of interest .
“ Investment banks bring issuers and investors together , ” he said .
“ Securities law has recognized the potential for a conflict of interest in playing both roles . ”
Under the law , the solution is for the parts of the firm dealing with either side to be isolated from each other so that information does not improperly flow between them to benefit one set of clients more than another .
There is no evidence that the wall was breached in this case .
Assuming such protection was in place , Lockyer said that fear of market manipulation was unfounded .
Still , Heal said he was surprised by Goldman ’s actions .
“ Goldman Sachs has a reputation as behaving in a responsible manner . . . and I do n’t think this is consistent with their traditions , ” he said .

“ States are going to have to cut back on education , social services , a whole range of things because of the lack of credit .
This is not just a Wall Street thing .
This is going to affect the lives of less affluent people in the states that are affected . ”
In any case , there are signs that the muni swap index has been a bust .
Tom Graff , managing director of Baltimore - based Cavanaugh Capital Management , said that by the end of August the index had failed to attract much business .
It was destined “ for oblivion , ” he said , in part because muni defaults were so rare .

That or all of the following programs are complete bullshit .
Want to get rich , but do n't have the time or energy to start a business ?
Or get a job at one ?
Do n't worry !
In the era of the internet , any old dumbass can log on and make piles of cash with no effort or skill !
5 Sell " The Greatest Vitamin in the World "
Don Lapre is that annoying hobbit - looking dude you might have seen a few years back trying to tell people they could get rich by placing classified ads , even if they did n't involve sexual services .
This time he is back selling " The Greatest Vitamins in the World , " because subtlety is another of Lapre 's strengths .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The vitamins are supposedly the result of millions of dollars of testing and development and over 100 studies by the New England Journal of Medicine .
Lapre claims the vitamins can help with diabetes , heart disease , and cancer .
Cancer !
Holy shit !
Nothing some vitamins can't fix .
For $ 35 you get a chance to make millions because Lapre will sell you one of his websites so you , too , can sell the vitamins .
Then if 20 people buy vitamins from that website , Lapre pays you $ 1,000 that month .
This seems a lot less efficient than just having one website and selling the pills himself but , like others on this list , Lapre obviously has no more room in his house to store cash so now he wants to help you .

This is all explained in this video .
It left us badly confused but what it lacks in clarity it makes up for in boobies .
Kapow !
What You Will Really Get :
A website no one will visit , that sells something the FDA has warned is being falsely advertised .
You mean it wo n't cure cancer ?!?!
But do n't worry if you do n't get any sales from your site ( and you wo n't ) , because Lapre 's company will sell you some marketing help , for just a few thousand dollars .
Of course the problem may be there are thousands of these websites he has sold to other people competing with yours for a product no one wants and that does n't work .

Yea , but ...
Even when people manage to sell a few bottles of this junk , it turns out they still can't get paid by the company .
This is probably because Lapre 's math skills pretty much suck as he promised to pay people $ 1,000 each time they sold $ 900 worth of his product .
Kids selling lemonade in front of their homes have a better business model than this .
Okay , yes , but , still ...
It may have been Lapre 's inability to count that caused him to file bankruptcy and get slapped by the IRS for failing to pay almost a million dollars in taxes .
Or it could be it was because he is a con artist .

It is not clear who carried out the attack Attackers in Afghanistan have sprayed acid in the faces of at least 15 girls near a school in Kandahar , police say .
They say the attack happened shortly before at least six people were killed in a bomb blast near a government building in the city .
Doctors say the six girls were wearing Islamic burkas or veils which provided them with some protection .
Correspondents say the attack is likely to have been carried out by those opposed to the education of women .
A spokesman for the Taleban denied involvement in the attack .
The former Taleban government - ousted from power in 2001 - banned girls from attending school .
' Not safe ' " We were going to school on foot when two unknown people on a motorcycle came close to us and threw acid in our faces , " 16 - year - old Atifa told the BBC .
" I want to ask the government why they cannot protect us , we girls want to study but the government is not helping us .
We want better security . "
She said the attack took place on Wednesday morning outside the Mirwais Nika Girls High School .
Officials say that two attackers used a toy gun to spray the acid and fled as soon as people came to the assistance of the girls .
Atifa said she did not know why anyone would have attacked her and the others .
" I do n't know why they did it , " she said .
" Kandahar is not safe .
But we can't stay at home , we want an education . "
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul says the incident has shocked ordinary Afghans .
Nato - led forces in Afghanistan condemned the attack as cowardly .

Amazon UK has barred the sale of a new Scientology exposé penned by a former member of the church 's " elite paramilitary group . "
The British incarnation of the world 's most popular etailer is no longer offering The Complex : An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology , a 318 - page tome from John Duignan , who spent 22 years inside the top secret organization .
In a recent post to an anti-Scientology discussion forum , an Anonymous Brit says that after pre-ordering the book , he received an email from Amazon announcing it had been " removed from sale for legal reasons " .
Amazon UK has yet to respond to out request for comment .
But the book - published on October 7 - is no longer listed on the site .
A Google search reveals it was available for sale as recently as October 23 .
Amazon listing retrieved via Google time machine
For the moment , The Complex is still available from UK booksellers WH Smith and Waterstones .
And it 's available on Amazon 's US incarnation - though it 's listed as " out of stock " .
We 're also awaiting a response from Amazon US .
The US listing describes the book like this :
For the first time ever , a former high - ranking member of the Church of Scientology is lifting the lid on life inside the world s fastest growing cult .
The Complex reveals the true story behind the religion that has ensnared a Who 's Who list of celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta , and convinced thousands of ordinary people to join up .
Duignan describes how two years ago he staged a dramatic escape from the elite paramilitary group at the core of the Church , the Sea Organisation , and how he narrowly evaded pursuit by Scientologists from the Office of Special Affairs .
He looks back on the 22 years he served in the Church 's secret army and describes the hours of sleep deprivation , brain - washing and intense auditing or religious counselling he endured , as he was moulded into a soldier of Scientology .
He talks about the money - making - machine at the heart of the Church , the Scientology goal to Clear the Planet and Get Ethics
In , the training programmes , the Rehabilitation Project Force and the punishments meted out to anyone who transgresses , including children .
We follow his journey through the Church and the painful investigation that leads to his eventual realisation that there is something very wrong at Scientology 's core .
The Complex was published by the Dublin , Ireland - based Merlin Publishing .
Famously , Andrew Morton 's unauthorized biography of American film star Tom Cruise - which also served as a Scientology exposé - was published in the US , but not in the UK , Australia , or New Zealand , thanks to stricter libel laws . ®
Update
Amazon US says " we 're awaiting arrival of the inventory into our fulfillment networks .
As soon as we get the books in our fulfillment centers , we 'll start shipping them out to customers . "

When the great freethought orator Robert Ingersoll died in 1899 , the New York Times eulogized him thusly :
… there is something more in the orator ’s art than the power of expression .
There must also be sympathy in the sense of an electrical connection which is set up between speaker and hearers .
And eminently Ingersoll had this .
He never misjudged , more properly , he never misfelt his audience .
… He held the keys of laughter and of tears , and there are many passages , mostly , indeed , detached sentences or even phrases , in his addresses which move even the reader and which strangely thrilled the hearers .
And yet , despite its praise for Ingersoll ’s oratory , the obituary goes on to say :
Of the chief use to which these remarkable gifts were put there is really nothing to be said in favor …
He went about denying and ridiculing for the joy it gave him to agitate dignitaries and bigwigs .
The effect upon the public could not be otherwise than bad .
The irony , by a stroke of justice , of fate , was that the lack of respect in which he exalted was his bane , that by reason of it and of his free exhibition of it he never took that place in the social , the professional , or the public life of his country to which by his talents he would otherwise have been eminently entitled .
In Ingersoll ’s day , just as today , outspoken freethinkers were scorned as “ disrespectful ” and accused of not paying the proper deference to the delicate sensibilities of believers .
But what I find interesting is the Times ’ admission that Ingersoll could have had a long and successful political career , if not for his habit of speaking his mind honestly about religion .
It is still the case today that open nonbelievers are more or less shut out of politics .
Although we are making gains , it seems to me that we ’re destined to remain outsiders for the foreseeable future .
I doubt I ’d ever run for office ; I can only imagine the kind of attack ads an opposing candidate could create against me , just by lifting snippets out of context from this website .
We still have a lot of progress left to make before an openly atheist candidate would stand a chance .
Even so , I ’m not too regretful about that .
For two reasons , I think atheism stands a better chance of achieving real progress out of office , rather than in it .
First is that except in rare instances , politicians do not lead public opinion , they follow it .
This is as it should be in a democracy , since we ’d expect people to vote for candidates who will represent their views .
But it also means that , other than in exceptional circumstances , politicians ca n’t be the drivers of real social change .
That kind of change must begin with the grass roots and work its way up .
It also means that those in the vanguard of reform are rarely elected to public office .
Only once those views have prevailed and become popular do their successors stand a chance .
If there comes a time when open atheists can be elected to office , then we ’ll know that our goals have largely been achieved .
The real work of changing people ’s minds is being done now , during the first generation of activism .
The other reason is that politicians , unlike private citizens , have to take into account the views of all their constituents .
The necessity of winning elections means that candidates must often take the politically expedient position rather than what they truly believe , and this makes it far more difficult for them to express their own views .
We all know countless examples of this , of politicians expressing themselves in bland language carefully parsed to offend no one , or blatantly pandering to influential lobbying groups or wealthy special interests .
Here on Daylight Atheism , I do n’t have that problem .
I do n’t have to pander to religious groups or flatter their beliefs , and I do n’t have to be concerned about getting a majority to agree with me .
I can speak my mind precisely as I believe .
The nature of the blogosphere is as a source of independent and unfettered commentary , while the world of political discourse is always carefully shaped and tailored to appeal to popular sensibilities .
The two do n’t mix well , as Amanda Marcotte and Melissa McEwan unfortunately found out in their ill - fated tenure at the John Edwards campaign .
The genius of democracy , and also its greatest failing , is that people get the government they deserve .
As easy as it is to satirize the clumsy pandering and overheated rhetoric of politicians , the fact remains that they do it because it works .
Our government is a reflection of the popular will .
If government is saturated with Bible - thumping fundamentalists , it ’s because that ’s what people want to see in their officeholders .
If government is corrupt and run by moneyed interests , it ’s because ordinary people are apathetic and easily led by expensive ad campaigns .
To complain about the hypocrisy and corruption of politicians is to treat the symptom without addressing the cause .
The best way to bring about real reform , real progress and justice in society , is not to create more regulation or more rules .
The way to do this is to educate the voting public so that they demand it .
That is the role atheists should take – not to win office and bring change by fiat , but to focus on educating and persuading the public , poking holes in popular delusions and countering bad arguments with reason .
As Ingersoll knew , if we can achieve that , all the rest will follow naturally .
Documents linking Iran to nuclear weapons push may have been fabricated Gareth Porter
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has obtained evidence suggesting that documents which have been described as technical studies for a secret Iranian nuclear weapons - related research program may have been fabricated .
The documents in question were acquired by U.S. intelligence in 2004 from a still unknown source -- most of them in the form of electronic files allegedly stolen from a laptop computer belonging to an Iranian researcher .
The US has based much of its push for sanctions against Iran on these documents .
The new evidence of possible fraud has increased pressure within the IAEA secretariat to distance the agency from the laptop documents , according to a Vienna - based diplomatic source close to the IAEA , who spoke to RAW STORY on condition of anonymity .
The laptop documents include what the IAEA has described in a published report as technical drawings of efforts to redesign the nosecone of the Iranian Shahab - 3 ballistic missile to accommodate a nuclear warhead . 
The documents are also said to include studies on the use of a high explosive detonation system , drawings of a shaft apparently to be used for nuclear tests , and studies on a bench - scale uranium conversion facility .
These technical papers , along with some correspondence related to the alleged secret Iranian program -- referred to by the IAEA as alleged studies  -- have been the primary basis during 2008 for the insistence by the US - led international coalition pushing for sanctions against Iran that the Iranian case must be kept going in the United Nations Security Council .
Handwritten Notes
At the center of the internal IAEA struggle is an Iranian firm named Kimia Maadan , which is portrayed in the documents as responsible for studies on a uranium conversion facility , called the green salt project , as part of the alleged nuclear weapons program under the Iranian Ministry of Defense .
According to a February 2006 Washington
Post article , the United States and its allies believe that Kimia Maadan is a front for the Iranian military .
One of the communications included in the laptop documents  a letter allegedly sent to Kimia Maadan from an unnamed Iranian engineering firm in May 2003  is at the center of the authenticity argument .
This letter is described in the May 26 , 2008 IAEA report as a one page annotated letter of May 2003 in Farsi . 
According to a US source who has been briefed on the matter , the letter has handwritten notes on it which refer to studies on the redesign of a missile reentry vehicle .
Last January , however , Iran turned over to the IAEA a copy of the same May 2003 letter with no handwritten notes on it .
This was confirmed by the director of the IAEA Safeguards Department , Olli Heinonen , during a February briefing for member states .
Heinonen referred to correspondence related to Kimia Maadan that is identical to that provided by Iran , with the addition of handwritten notes . 
Notes on the Heinonen briefing , compiled by unnamed diplomats who attended it , were posted on the website of the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security .
The copy of the letter without the handwritten notes was part of a larger collection of documentation concerning Kimia Maadan provided to IAEA by Iran in response to a request for an explanation of that firms role in the management of the Iranian Gchine uranium mine .
After the IAEA received the copy of the letter without notes from Iran , some officials began pushing for an acknowledgment by the Agency that there were serious questions about the whether the laptop documents were fabricated , according to the Vienna - based source close to the IAEA .
 There was an effort to point out that the Agency isnt in a position to authenticate the documents ,  said the source .
Heinonen and other IAEA Safeguards Department officials have continued , however , to defend the credibility of the document in question .
According to an American source briefed on the dispute , the defenders of the authenticity of the version of the letter with the handwritten notes say that the appearance of the clean copy can be attributed to Kimia Maadan making multiple copies of the original which have been circulated to various staff members .
Only an Ore-processing Plant Further evidence damaging to the credibility of the letter and the handwritten notes was provided to the atomic energy watchdog last January by the Iranian government .
According to Iran , Kimia Maadan was not working for the Defense Ministry but for the civilian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .
The new Iranian documentation , described in the February 22 , 2008 IAEA report , proved to IAEAs satisfaction that the Kimia Maadan Company had been created in May 2000 solely to carry out a project to design , procure and install equipment for an ore processing plant .
The documents also showed that the core staff of Kimia Maadan was able to undertake the work on ore processing only because the nuclear agency had provided it with the technical drawings and reports as the basis for the contract .
 Information and explanations provided by Iran were supported by the documentation , the content of which is consistent with the information already available to the agency ,  the IAEA concluded .
Marie Harff , a spokesperson for the CIA , declined to comment .
Additional Doubts About the Letter Other questions surround the letter with the handwritten notes .
The subject of the letter was Kimia Maadan 's inquiry to the engineering firm about procurement of a programmable logic control ( PLC ) system , according to the IAEA 's May 26 report .
A PLC system is one of many types of technology that the United States has long sought to deny to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran .
Iran had informed the IAEA even before 2006 that Kimia Maadan had assisted the AEOI in getting around that denial strategy by procuring various technologies for the planned uranium conversion facility at Esfahan .
Given that Kimia Maadans role in procurement for the conversion facility was both unrelated to its technical work for the AEOI and part of a covert effort to get around U.S. restrictions , it seems unlikely that they would have made multiple copies of the letter .
Even if multiple copies were made , the firm would certainly have taken normal security precautions for a document of that type , marking each copy with a number or name .
A security procedure of that kind would have identified any missing copies .
However , this was not the case with the 2003 letter .
The United States , as its reason for refusing to provide a copy of the document to Iran , has argued that it would allow Iranian security personnel to identify the person who wrote the notes from their handwriting , according to the US source who has been briefed on the matter .
Another problem with the handwritten letter is the absence of any logical link between the subject of the letter and the alleged work on redesign of the missile .
PLC systems , which are used for automation of industrial processes , such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines , would have been irrelevant to the technical studies on redesigning the Shahab - 3 missile .
Other Documents Also Under Suspicion
Other documents from the laptop collection , allegedly showing that Kimia Maadan was working closely with the team trying to redesigning the Shahab - 3 missile , have also come under suspicion of fraud .
The IAEAs May 2008 report describes a flowsheet under Kimia Maadans name , showing a process for bench scale conversion of uranium oxide to UF4 ( uranium tetraflouride ) , also known as green salt . 
The project number shown in the disputed documents for the green salt subproject is 5.13 .
However , Heinonen stated that the number given to the Gchine subproject was 5.15 .
According to the documents obtained by the IAEA from Iran last January , this was the number of the uranium ore processing project that was assigned in 1999 by the civilian AEOI , not by the Iranian Defense Ministry .
This would mean that the author of the document used the project number 5.13 for the green salt subproject based on their knowledge of the AEOI numbering system and not on a military designation .
In his February 25 briefing , Heinonen additionally referred to an alleged letter sent by Kimia Maadan  as manager of three subprojects  to the missile re-entry vehicle project , asking for a technical opinion on the plans for equipment for a proposed green salt conversion facility .
However , it is difficult to understand why the team working on redesigning the missile would be asked for a technical opinion on equipment for a uranium conversion facility .
A spokesperson for the State Departments Office of Arms Control and International Security , which is responsible for IAEA affairs , said in an e-mail that specialists in the office arent able to comment on the subject of the intelligence documents now being considered by the IAEA .
The IAEA also declined to comment .
Toward a Showdown on the Contradictions
As the contradictions between the new Iranian evidence and the laptop documents relating to Kimia Maadan became apparent , some IAEA officials argued that the Agency should distance itself from what they now suspect are forgeries .
Despite that argument , the May 2008 report contained no reference to the issue .
The next IAEA report , due out in mid-November , will include the first response by the Agency to a confidential 117 - page Iranian critique of the laptop documents , according to the Vienna - based source .
In the past , IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei has shown an ability to face off with the United States when evidence has been called into doubt .
The infamous  Niger forgeries   documents that purported to show an agreement between Niger and Iraq for the purchase of uranium oxide  were used by the White House as part of its case for war against Iraq .
In response , ElBaradei sent a letter to the White House and the National Security Council in December 2002 , over three months before the US launched the Iraq War , warning that he believed the documents were forgeries and should not be cited as evidence of Iraqi intention to obtain nuclear weapons .
When ElBaradei received no response from the Bush administration , he went public to debunk the Niger forgeries .
In a speech at the United Nations in March 2003 , he declared that the IAEA , after thorough analysis ,  had concluded that the documents alleging the purchase of uranium by Iraqi from Niger are in fact not authentic . 
The anomalies that have been revealed by the Iranian documents obtained from Iran last January may not be as obvious as the ones that made it clear the Niger documents were fabrications .
Nevertheless , they appear to be red flags for IAEA analysts concerned with the issue .
Suspicion has surrounded the alleged studies  documents from the beginning , because the United States has refused to say who brought the collection to US intelligence four years ago .
Gareth Porter is an investigative journalist and historian who has authored numerous foreign policy analyses and is the author of the book , Perils of Dominance : Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam .
In a 2006 article in the American Prospect , he revealed Iran 's spurned diplomatic outreach to the Bush Administration in 2003 .
MOUNTAIN HOUSE , Calif . 
This town , 59 feet above sea level , is the most underwater community in America .
Because of plunging home values , almost 90 percent of homeowners here owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth , according to figures released Monday .
That is the highest percentage in the country .
The average homeowner in Mountain House is “ underwater , ” as it is known , by $ 122,000 .
A visit to the area over the last couple of days shows how the nationwide housing crisis is contributing to a broad slowdown of the American economy , as families who feel burdened by high mortgages are pulling back on their spending .
Jerry Martinez , a general contractor , and his wife , Marcie , an accounts clerk , are among the struggling owners in Mountain House .
Burdened with credit card debt and a house losing value by the day , they are learning the necessity of self - denial for themselves and their three children .

The Republican ACORN Hoax ACORN and election fraud .
Hang on .
As soon as I can get the alligator that crawled out of my toilet back into the New York City sewers where it belongs , I can turn my attention to this very important topic .

You see , the ACORN “ election fraud ” story is one of those urban legends , like fake moon landings and alligators in the sewers , and it appears three or four weeks before every recent national election with the regularity of the swallows returning to Capistrano .
First , the basics : ACORN , which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , is an activist group working with low - and moderate - income families that , among many other things , registers voters .
To do this they hire people to go around signing up the unregistered , killing two birds with one stone – giving employment to people who need it ( some with criminal records ) and providing the opportunity to vote to members of minority communities whose voices all too often go unheard .
What happens is that some of those hired to do the registering make people up .
As a result , you ’ll discover that among the registrants are such obvious fakes as Mickey Mouse and the starting line - up of the Dallas Cowboys , among others .
This is where the Republican meme kicks in .
As they have in past elections ( although now louder and more angrily than ever ) , the GOP has made ACORN the red flag du jour as the party tries to mobilize its conservative base and , allegedly , attempts to suppress the vote and distract attention from accusations of election tampering made against them , too .
The charge is that these fake registrations will create havoc at the polls .
On Tuesday morning , former Republican Senators John Danforth and Warren Rudman , chairs of Senator McCain ’s Honest and Open Elections Committee , held a press conference and described the results of the bad seeds in ACORN ’s registration program as “ a potential nightmare . ”
Danforth said he was concerned “ that this election night and the days that follow will be a rerun of 2000 , and even worse than 2000 . ”
John McCain raised it at Wednesday night ’s final debate and went further , adding , “ We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama 's relationship with ACORN , who [ sic ] is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
Obama replied , “ ACORN is a community organization .
Apparently , what they have done is they were paying people to go out and register folks .
And apparently , some of the people who were out there did n't really register people ; they just filled out a bunch of names .
Had nothing to do with us .
We were not involved . ”
Which is not to say Obama has not been associated with ACORN in the recent past .
He has .
As he said in the debate , as a lawyer , he joined with the group in partnership with the U.S. Justice Department to implement a motor - voter registration law in Illinois – allowing folks to register to vote at their local DMV .
His work as a community organizer bought him into contact with ACORN , the organization received money from the Woods Fund while he was a board member there and his presidential campaign gave ACORN more than $ 800,000 to help with get out the vote campaigns during the primary season – but not , apparently , for registration drives .
All of this distracts from several important points .
ACORN has registered 1.3 million voters , and maintains that in virtually every instance they are the ones who have reported the incidents of fraud .
As the organization asserted in a response to Sen. McCain , “ ACORN hired 13,000 field workers to register people to vote .
In any endeavor of this size , some people will engage in inappropriate conduct .
ACORN has a zero - tolerance policy and terminated any field workers caught engaging in questionable activity .
At the end of the day , as ACORN is paying these people to register voters , it is ACORN that is defrauded . ”
Arrests have been made , as well they should be .
Add to this the simple fact that registration fraud is not election fraud .
Seventy - five made - up people who are registered as , say , “ Brad Pitt , ” are not likely to show up at some polling place on Nov. 4 to vote in the election .
Because they do n’t exist .
( Besides , Angelina would never give them time off from babysitting duties . )
Granted , there are ways to mail in an absentee ballot under a fake name and , too , from time to time some joker is going to come to the polls and try to bluff his or her way in .
But despite the charge that thousands and thousands of fakes will flood the machines and throw the count , it does not happen very often .
And according to ACORN , “ Even RNC [ Republican National Committee ]
General Counsel Sean Cairncross has recently acknowledged he is not aware of a single improper vote cast as a result of bad cards submitted in the course of an organized voter registration effort . ”
Not that this has stopped the GOP from banging the same drum every national election .
And amnesiac members of the media and some government agencies from buying into it every time .
Last year ,
The New York Times reported that the federal Election Assistance Commission , created by the Help America Vote Act , legislation enacted after the Florida debacle , was told by a pair of experts – one Republican , the other described as having “ liberal leanings ” -- that there was not that much fraud to be found .
But their conclusions were downplayed .
As per the Times , “ Though the original report said that among experts ‘ there is widespread but not unanimous agreement that there is little polling place fraud , ’ the final version of the report released to the public concluded in its executive summary that ‘ there is a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud . ’ ”
Which raises the ongoing investigation of the Justice Department ’s firing of those eight US attorneys shortly after President Bush ’s re-election .
It should n’t be forgotten that despite official explanations , half of them were let go after refusing to prosecute vote fraud charges demanded by Republicans .
The attorneys had determined there was little or no evidence of skullduggery ; certainly not enough to prosecute .
( In an interview with Talking Points Memo on Thursday , one of those fired , David Iglesias , reacted to reports that the FBI has launched an investigation of ACORN : " I 'm astounded that this issue is being trotted out again .
Based on what I saw in 2004 and 2006 , it's a scare tactic . " )
What ’s equally if not more scary are continued allegations of Republican attempts at “ caging ” minority voters – making challenge lists of African - and Hispanic - Americans registered in heavily Democratic districts .
Just this week , a Federal judge in Michigan ruled that voters could not be purged from the rolls in that state simply because their mailing address was invalid – this followed a failed attempt by a Michigan Republican county chairman to use a list of foreclosed homes as the basis of voter challenges .
This comes on the heels of a recent report from the Brennan Center at New York University documenting how state officials -- often with the best of intentions -- purge huge numbers of perfectly legal voters from the rolls .
As my colleague Bill Moyers reported , “ Hundreds of thousands of legal voters may have been dumped in recent years , many without ever being notified . ”
The report describes a " process that is shrouded in secrecy , prone to error , and vulnerable to manipulation . "
Hardly reassuring words if you want democracy to work , and sadly , not an urban legend , but the simple truth .

We seem to know less about methane emissions than we thought .
After a decade of stability , methane concentrations in the atmosphere have been rising strongly in the last 18 months .
Early research work suggested that this rise was concentrated in the northern latitudes of the northern hemisphere and was consistent with greater emissions from decaying organic matter in melting permafrost or from the melting of Arctic sea ice .
Now this result has been called into question by the publication of a new study showing the concentrations of methane are rising almost everywhere .
Since methane takes some time to diffuse around the globe , the later work suggests that the rise in methane may not be directly due to enhanced emissions from biological sources .
Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas , producing about 20 % of the radiative forcing of all the main gases .
Its concentration in the atmosphere has risen about two and half times since the industrial revolution to about 1750 parts per billion .
Although it is present in very much smaller concentrations than CO2 , each molecule has a more powerful global warming effect .
It also lasts much less long in the atmosphere , typically reacting with the hydroxyl radical ( * OH ) to form carbon dioxide and water .
The average life of a molecule of methane in the atmosphere is about 8 years compared to about a century for carbon dioxide .
The growth rate of methane concentrations in the atmosphere slowed in the second half of the last century .
The period between 1999 and early 2007 showed virtually no increase , leading to optimism that methane emissions were under control .
Deep coal mines were an important source and much of the industry was closed down in the northern hemisphere in the 1980s and 1990s .
Rice farming practices , which floods vegetated areas , allowing plant matter to rot anaerobically and produce methane , were changed in some parts of Asia to reduce emissions .
Natural gas is largely methane and pipeline leaks were also reduced .
The recent rise surprised many researchers .
In the past , methane concentrations have tended to increase in periods of marked El Niño ( high sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific ) , resulting in greater dieback of vegetation and more methane production from the rotting plant matter .
But the last year or so has been a period of lower than average temperatures in the Pacific ( La Niña rather than El Niño ) .
So this is n't a good explanation for the sudden jump of about 10 parts per billion , or about 0.5 % increase in the average concentrations .
Dr Rebecca Fisher of Royal Holloway College , University of London , published work with colleagues early this year showing that the rise in methane was particularly great in the Arctic .
Some measuring stations saw increases of twice the average global rise .
Since methane takes time to diffuse around the world , this suggested a regionally specific source .
It could be from the sea or from rotting vegetation exposed by melting .
Dr Fisher 's work was , in a sense , comforting .
It suggested we might have an explanation for why methane concentrations were rising .
In particular , she showed that increased methane concentrations were associated with rises in the percentage of gas containing the lighter carbon isotope , C12 , which is associated with emissions from methane - producing bacteria .
It looked as though we could be reasonably confident that at least part of the source of increased emissions was rotting plant matter .
More recent work has dented this belief .
MIT scientists have just published work with scientists from Australia and elsewhere that shows that the rise in methane levels has been quite uniform across the globe .
This should n't happen if methane was produced by plant sources , since there is far more organic matter in the northern hemisphere .
Concentrations should be temporarily higher in the north in the months and years it takes methane to spread uniformly across the globe .
The MIT team speculate that the rise in methane may be a function of decreasing concentrations of hydroxyl , the scavenger radical that mops up methane , perhaps as well as increasing emissions .
But we do n't yet have good monitoring of * OH concentrations and it will be some time before we are able to tell if this hypothesis is correct or , indeed , what is causing this change .
The scientific debate about the cause of increased methane is important because it suggests that we do not yet have a good model for what determines changes in concentrations .
One of the primary worries about global warming is that it will eventually trigger the eruption of untold millions of tonnes of methane from deep sea water .
( This is usually known as the ' clathrate gun ' hypothesis . )
The gas is currently locked into a stable bond with the extremely cold waters in the deep oceans .
Continued world temperature increases will eventually cause the methane to burst from its chemical locks within the cold liquid and rise to the surface .
This probably happened at times of rapid warming in the far - distant past .
The fact that we cannot immediately know today why the methane rise is occurring , and whether it is likely to continue , raises worries that our understanding of methane 's role in the global carbon cycle is simply not very good .

ALBANY 
As Caroline Kennedy embarked on a tour of upstate New York this week , camera crews and reporters in tow , the state ’s attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , was announcing a $ 2.7 million settlement with the operator of an illegal dump in Lackawanna .
Ms. Kennedy ended up on the cable television networks , in national newspapers and on blogs everywhere .
Mr. Cuomo got a story in The Buffalo News .
Since he returned to the state capital two years ago , Mr. Cuomo , son of a former governor , has thrown himself into his job , tackling issues large and small .
And he has softened the in - your - face style that earned him enemies years ago .
So when it became clear that the Senate seat held by Hillary Rodham Clinton would become open , Mr. Cuomo restrained himself from overt campaigning and retreated to the background .
That left the stage to Ms. Kennedy , who has marched out front and become the candidate everyone is talking about  and the favorite for the appointment .
Often you want to give the user the ability to delete objects but enable them to recover them if they change their mind .
One way to do this is to have a boolean flag on the model .
The problem with this is
you have to have the flag on all associated models involved in the object graph to be deleted
you have to then filter all your queries based on that boolean flag ( error prone and inefficient )
An alternative is to have a separate model for the deleted objects .
i.e. Deleted Foo alongside Foo , DeletedBar alongside Bar .
The schemas are similar ( although some foreign keys are to their deleted counterparts instead ) and objects are moved from one table to another when deleted ( or undeleted ) .
This has certain advantages over the first approach , but does mean you have to create twice as many models .
A third approach which just occurred to me is to serialize the object graph to be deleted and store that in the database in a single table row .
With Django 's existing ability to calculate object graphs for deletion and also to load and dump json , this may be fairly straightforward to implement in a generic fashion .
Pinax is currently using the first approach but I 'm interested if people have tried the third approach or secret option number four I do n't know about yet .

Election Day Information

BBC News , Brussels
The financial downturn has hit EU greenhouse gas emission targets Anxiety about national budgets dominated an EU summit where the rescue and supervision of banks vied with climate change as the most pressing issue .
The severity of the financial crisis has had an impact on the EU 's ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which look likely to be watered down under pressure from a new " eastern bloc " , along with Italy .
The billions of euros required to adapt large enterprises to the emissions targets threaten to put further strain on budgets already groaning under the weight of bank bail - outs and rising unemployment .
Poland , heavily reliant on coal - fired power stations , teamed up with seven other former communist countries to demand a reassessment of the burden imposed by the targets .
Then Italy 's Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , struck a protectionist note , saying Italian firms were " in no state to take on costs like those we thought about last year " .
Fiercely debated The European Commission will now look at the specific problems that some countries face in meeting the targets .
But it is determined - along with the French EU presidency - to clinch a deal on the targets before next year .
The proposed changes to the EU 's pioneering Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) will be fiercely debated in the European Parliament and by ministers , who are supposed to hammer out a deal strong enough to inspire the rest of the world .
The EU is gearing up for major international talks next year on climate change .
For those who want the European Union to walk with power and purpose on the world stage this summit is both triumph and tragedy
BBC 's Mark Mardell in his blog
Mardell 's Europe
One of the parliament 's chief negotiators on the climate package , Green MEP Satu Hassi , urged EU leaders to " keep firm with the commitments already given " .
" The financial crisis does not blow away climate change , " she said , adding that the crisis " teaches us that early action is always wiser than emergency action " .
Yet in the absence of a clear roadmap on the climate package , EU leaders were keen to show a united response to the banking crisis .
The turmoil in Wall Street , with the freezing of inter - bank lending , triggered emergency bank bail - outs by individual European governments before the 15 eurozone countries announced a joint multi-billion - euro plan to recapitalise banks and guarantee loans .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown basked in his fellow Europeans ' praise for showing the way , with his rescue plan for British banks , estimated to be worth £ 500bn ( 641bn euros ) .
But , in contrast with his famously low - key appearances at EU summits , he joined the chorus of calls for more co-ordinated EU action .
' Crisis cell '
The EU plans to set up a " financial crisis cell " - a rapid response team tasked with co-ordinating EU action in any future financial crises .
Any member state in trouble will be able to trigger the new alert system .
The idea is to prevent any country 's state intervention harming the interests of another EU member .
But France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy also stressed the need for global solutions , to refashion the world 's financial system and make it " fit for the 21st century " .
He and commission president Jose Manuel Barroso will meet US President George W Bush on Saturday to prepare for a global crisis summit - a " G8 plus " , including emerging powers like China and India .
President Sarkozy wants a tighter rein on the financial sector Mr Sarkozy 's priority is tighter financial supervision , with action on hedge funds , tax havens , executive pay and ratings agencies .
Maintaining the international competitiveness of European industry is looming as the next big challenge , once some stability returns to the banking system .
Mr Sarkozy says he wants to see the same joint EU effort applied to that problem as to the banking crisis .
Energy security is highlighted as another EU priority in the summit conclusions - though it was overshadowed by the urgent economic and climate agenda .
The fuel protests across Europe earlier this year - triggered by surging oil prices - and worries about the reliability of Russian gas supplies made energy security a pressing issue .
The EU wants to diversify its sources of supply , make the energy market more transparent and improve the Baltic region 's pipeline network .
As for the Lisbon Treaty , which dominated the last EU summit in Brussels , the Irish government has pledged to come up with a plan by December .
But the bank crisis has forced the EU 's controversial institutional reforms onto the back - burner .

Contributing Writer , [ GAS ]
I saw this being announced on German TV last night and I knew right away that this was a candidate for a story on GAS !
A tiny notebook is being developed and released by a British company called the iKIT – and “ tiny ” really is the operative word here .
It has a 2.8 inch screen and as the following picture shows , it sits very snugly on a regular computer keyboard :
It is n’t able to run Microsoft Word but as this Yahoo article says , it is capable of doing a LOT of other things .
With 64MB of RAM , it will run Linux and will come pre-loaded with lots of useful apps such as IM programs , a media player , and the Opera Mini web browser to get you onto the internet .
It also has a webcam , a mini-USB port , offers WI - FI and Bluetooth connectivity , and is priced at 99 British pounds ( US $ 161 . )
If I ever found myself in need of a tiny mobile computer , this is something I might consider buying someday .
What do you think of it ?
As Detroit waits to see how much financial help it will get from the White House and how that aid will be structured , we keep hearing one thing over and over .
The Bush administration wants to avoid a " disorderly bankruptcy " in the auto industry .
This is not good news for GM and Chrysler .
When the Bush administration announced on Friday that it would make sure the auto industry did n't collapse , Detroit breathed a sigh of relief .
After all , there was the implication GM and Chrysler would avoid bankruptcy .
Now , that 's not entirely certain .
The White House says it 's looking at a number of options , including some type of " pre-packaged bankruptcy . "
So is this really a possibility ?
Could we see GM and Chrysler go into chapter 11 ?
The answer to both is yes .
It 's clear President Bush and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson are extremely reluctant to give $ 14 billion to the automakers .
So they are looking at a number of options for how to keep GM and Chrysler from going under without having to us the last $ 15 billion in the TARP fund .
Like everything else swirling around this process , it 's political .
Bush Warns Automakers A Deal Is Not Imminent
So Detroit waits .
Those of you who have e-mailed me saying GM and Chrysler should go into bankruptcy are likely watching this play out and saying to yourselves , " Good .
We should n't bail them out . "
Meanwhile those of you who think Detroit automakers should be kept from going bankrupt are wondering why Washington keeps talking about but not acting on a bailout .
Happy Holidays Motown .
Wells Fargo has passed the $ 2 billion mark in lending for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ® ) certified buildings .
Maybe not too surprising , the bank was one of the first to be LEED pre-certified for New Construction .
The company said that “ of the buildings financed by Wells Fargo , 28 percent are LEED - rated , 37 percent are LEED - silver , 21 percent are LEED - gold and 9 percent are LEED - platinum , the highest rating available . ”
Since May 2007 , Wells Fargo has doubled its commitment for LEED building .
By doing so , the number of LEED buildings it has financed has increased by 125 - percent .
The bank has also expanded its green building efforts from 11 states to 19 , and it now supports buildings with the following : cold storage facilities , data center and community center , in addition to office , mixed - use , industrial , retail , schools , and multifamily .
The U.S. Green Building Council President , CEO and Founding Chair Rick Fedrizzi said , “ We applaud Wells Fargo ’s leadership efforts .
Buildings are responsible for 39 percent of CO2 emissions in the U.S. , which directly impacts global climate change – however LEED buildings consume half the energy of conventional buildings . ”
Wells is a member of the EPA ’s Climate Leaders program , it is also a leader on the EPA ’s list of green power purchaser .
The company has also adopted the Carbon Principles guidelines for banks to evaluate and address climate change risks in the financing of electric power projects and companies .

Prayer Needed for Global Economies
By Ivorie Anthony
The 700 Club
CBN.com  WALL STREET
In January of this year , Cindy Jacobs was in a worship service when the Lord spoke to her , “ Cindy , the strongman over America does n’t live in Washington , DC – the strongman lives in New York City !
Call My people to pray for the economy . ”
This word so shook Cindy ; she knew she had to call the people of God to converge on New York City the week of October 29 for an emergency prayer rally to cry out against economic collapse in the midst of shaking .
The Lord further said , “ October 29 was Black Tuesday , the day the stock market crashed , and Satan wants to do it again . ”
We must be proactive in prayer .
At the beginning of the year many intercessors began to hear from the Lord that without divine intervention , a major shaking was coming to Wall Street .
This would spread until there were food shortages .
Some think that 2009 would be worse than 2008 .
Of course , it goes without saying that this would affect markets around the world .
Many people are fasting and praying for the upcoming elections , Cindy says .
We do n’t want to let up in this final press , we need to P.U.S.H. ( pray until something happens ) to avert financial judgment .
On September 29 last month , the US stock market went down 777 points in one day .
Cindy says it was no coincidence that this happened on the first day of the Jewish New Year , Rosh Hashanah .
“ This is so severe in the economic area because we are facing judgment from the actions , not only for our stance towards Israel , but our blatant sin against Him in passing laws such as the one allowing homosexual marriages , ” Cindy said .
NO MORE BUSINESS AS USUAL
In early August in her prayer time Cindy heard the Lord say , “ There will be no more business as usual . ”
Little did she know the scope of what this meant on a worldwide scale .
God is on the move .
She and many others have taken this as a major point of intercession .
She believes that just as there came a time when God judged the gods of Egypt , He is now judging the god of mammon .
Nations are standing on the cusp of history that will determine their course for generations to come .
God is judging the ideologies of nations .
He is moving to put the fear of the Lord not only on His church ; but upon the nations of the world .
For these and other reasons Cindy is calling for a Day of Prayer for the World ’s Economies on Wednesday , October 29 , 2008 .
They are calling for prayer for the stock markets , banks , and financial institutions of the world on the date the stock market crashed in 1929 .
They are meeting at the New York Stock Exchange , the Federal Reserve Bank , and its 12 principal branches around the US that day .
“ We are going to intercede at the site of the statue of the bull on Wall Street to ask God to begin a shift from the bull and bear markets to what we feel will be the ' Lion ’s Market , ' or God ’s control over the economic systems , ” she said .
“ While we do not have the full revelation of all this will entail , we do know that without intercession , economies will crumble . ”
Cindy is encouraging prayer groups to intercede for banks and financial institutions in your area .
Cindy says each of us has to be accountable to the Lord .
“ Do n’t think you ’re going to be in sin and that God will take care of you in these hard economic times .
Holiness is key , ” Cindy said .
Each of us has a part to play and should not think that God will indiscriminately bless us without us dealing with personal areas that are wrong .
We must repent of any misuse of money , think before we spend , get out of debt , etc. , and allow God to do a course correction for us .
CBN IS HERE FOR YOU !
Are you seeking answers in life ?
Are you hurting ?
Are you facing a difficult situation ?

Jack Black strips down to his Y - fronts ( but thankfully porky Mike Tyson did n't ) at Video Game Awards extravaganza
Grand Theft Auto 4 won game of the year , but Jack Black was definitely the biggest hit of the evening .
The actor put on a hilarious performance as he hosted the Spike Video Game Awards ceremony yesterday - in his Y - fronts .
Stripped : Comedian Jack Black hosted the sixth annual Video Game Awards at Sony Picture Studios in Los Angeles yesterday
One award was presented by an out - of - shape Mike Tyson , who revealed an expanding waistline as he took to the stage .
The stars were joined by a host of celebrities , including stunners Megan Fox and Kim Kardashian .
Out of shape : Former boxer Mike Tyson appears to have let himself go over the years
The Transformers actress dazzled in a red strapless frock - while a curvier Kim , from the reality show Meet the Kardashians , sported a metallic gold dress as she posed on the red carpet
Rap stars LL Cool J and 50 Cent also made an appearance as they performed or the award show .
Beauty queens : Megan
Fox dazzles in red , left , while a curvier Kim Kardashian opts for gold
Despite being surrounded by a massive entourage , 50 Cent took time out to discuss his favourite games with reporters .
' Right now it has to be Blood On The Sand , ' said the rapper , referring to his own video game , which he 'll be releasing on PlayStation 3 and Xbox in 2009 .
Action man : 24 star Kiefer Sutherland picks up the ' Big name in the Game ' award
He also flirted outrageously on his way into the show at Sony Studios .
' Do n't look at me like that - that 's how you get pregnant , ' he joked to a female reporter .
24 star Kiefer Sutherland accepted the ' Big Name in the Game ' male award for Call Of Duty : World At War .

Hoover Sings His Own Praises By Bryan Caplan
Murray Rothbard opened my eyes to the real story about Herbert Hoover , but his quotation splicing makes me wince .
In my next two posts , I ’m going to dissect one of Hoover ’s last major speeches before the 1932 election – his November 5 , 1932 address in St. Paul .
In this speech , Hoover gives two long lists :
The first about “ our long - view policies to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in our country for the future ” , the second about “ the measures , lack of measures , or destructive measures proposed by our opponents . ”
In this post , I ’m going to review all 21 items on Hoover ’s list of what he did right ; in the next , I ’ll turn to all 19 items on his list of what his opponents did wrong .
Ready ?
OK , here are the 21 policies Hoover wanted the whole country to know about :
1 . The revision of the tariff :
By this act we gave protection to our agriculture from a world
demoralization which would have been infinitely worse than anything we
have suffered , and we prevented unemployment of millions of workmen .
2. Extension of the authority of the Tariff Commission …
by
which the adjustments can be made to correct inequities in the tariff ,
and to make changes to meet economic tides and emergencies , thereby
avoiding the national disturbance of general revision of the tariff
with all its greed and logrolling …
3 . Informal pressure to maintain wages and control strikes :
At the outset of the depression we brought about an understanding
between employers and employees that wages should be maintained .
They
were maintained until the cost of living had decreased and the profits
had practically vanished .
They are now the highest real wages in the
world .
With the concurrent agreement of labor leaders at that
time to minimize strikes , we have had a degree of social stability
hitherto unknown in the history of any depression in our country .
We
have not once in this depression had Federal troops under arms to quell
conflicts which is the first time in 15 depressions over a century …
4. Informal pressure to “ share the work ” :
An agreement to a spread of work where
employers were compelled to reduce production was brought about in
order that none might be deprived of all their living and all might
participate in the existing jobs and thus give real aid to millions of
families …
5. “ Mobilization ” of private charity and local and state government relief .
6 . An increase in Federal construction spending ( plus an attempt to claim credit for other construction spending ) :
By the
expansion of State , municipal , and private construction work as an aid
to employment , and by the development of an enlarged program of Federal
construction which has been maintained at the rate of $ 600 million a
year throughout the depression , we have given support to hundreds of
thousands of families .
7 . Debt renegotiations with Germany :
By the negotiation of the German
moratorium and the standstill agreements upon external debts of that
country , we saved their people from a collapse that would have set a
prairie fire and possibly have involved the whole of our civilization .
8. Creation of the National Credit Association :
We created the National Credit Association by cooperation of the
bankers of the country , with a capital of $ 500 million which prevented
the failure of a thousand banks with all the tragedies to their
depositors and their borrowers .
9 . Trying to balance the budget by cutting “ ordinary operating expenses ” of the Federal government and raising taxes ( with the top rate rising from 25 % to 63 % , though Hoover does n’t specify ) :
By drastic reduction in the
ordinary operating expenses of the Federal Government , together with
the increasing of the revenues in the year 1932 , we contributed to
balancing the Federal budget and thus held impregnable the credit of
the United States .
10 . Creation of the RFC :
We created the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation , originally with $ 2 billion of resources , in order that ,
having maintained national credit , we should thrust the full resources
of public credit behind private credit of the country and thus
reestablish and maintain private enterprise in an unassailable
position ; that with this backing of the Federal credit , acting through
existing institutions , we might protect depositors in savings banks ,
insurance policyholders , both lenders and borrowers in building and
loan associations …
11 . Using the RFC to strengthen Federal land banks and other lenders :
In
addition to strengthening the capital of the Federal land banks by $ 125
million we have , through the Reconstruction Corporation , made large
loans to mortgage associations for the same purpose , and lately we have
organized all lending agencies into cooperative action to give the
farmer who wants to make a fight for his home a chance to hold it from
foreclosure .
12 . Extending authority under the Federal Reserve
Act to protect the gold standard :
We extended authorities under the Federal
Reserve
Act to protect beyond all question the gold standard of the
United States and at the same time expand the credit in counteraction
to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawals of gold .
13 . Creation of home loan discount banks :
We created the home loan discount banks with direct and indirect
resources of several hundred millions , also acting through existing
institutions in such fashion as to mobilize the resources of building
and loan associations and savings banks and other institutions …
14 . Using the RFC to help depositors in closed banks :
We secured further authorities
to the Reconstruction Corporation to assist in the earlier liquidation
of deposits in closed banks in order that we might relieve distress to
millions of depositors …
15 . Using the RFC to subsidize state - level relief :
We secured increased authorities to the
Reconstruction Corporation to loan up to $ 300 million to the States
whose resources had been exhausted , to enable them to extend full
relief to distress , and to prevent any hunger and cold in the United
States over this winter .
16 . Using the RFC to fund public works ( which are going to pay for themselves ! ) :
We increased the resources to the
Reconstruction Corporation by a further $ 1,500 million for the
undertaking of great public works which otherwise would have been
delayed awaiting finance , due to the stringency of credit .
These works
are of a character which by their own earnings will enable disposal of
the repayment of these loans without charge upon the taxpayer .
17 . Creation of a new system of agricultural banks :
We have erected a new system of agricultural credit banks with indirect
resources of $ 300 million to reinforce the work of the intermediate
credit banks and our other financing institutions in the financing of
production and livestock loans to farmers …
18 . Using the RFC to make agricultural commodity loans :
We have extended the
authority to the Reconstruction Corporation to make loans for financing
the normal movement of agricultural commodities to markets both at home
and abroad .
19 . “ Mobilization ” of banking , industry , business , labor , and agriculture :
We have systematically mobilized banking and
industry and business of the country with the cooperation of labor and
agricultural leaders to attack the depression on every front …
20 .
Developing a worldwide economic conference :
… with view to
relieving pressure upon us from foreign countries , to increase their
stability , to deal with the problems of silver , and to prevent
recurrence of these calamities if it can be humanly done .
21 . Disarmament .
We
have given American leadership in development of drastic reductions of
armament in order to reduce our own expenditures by $ 200 million a year
and to increase the financial stability of foreign nations and , above
all , to relieve the world of fear and political friction .
Now I ask you :
Out of Hoover ’s full list of 21 policy achievements , how many remotely resemble the “ do - nothing ” “ laissez - faire ” stereotype of the history textbooks ?
# 12 , where he says
he tried to protect the gold standard , and # 21 –
disarmament .*
You might also count part of # 5 , where he talks about mobilizing private charity ( in the same breath as local and state government relief ) , and parts of # 9 , where he brags about fighting to balance the budget ( and only hinting at his massive tax increase ) .
In short , out of 21 measures , we have two matches with Hoover ’s stereotype , plus two partial matches .
The remaining 17 measures directly contradict the stereotype .
If liberal historians focused on policy instead of party , they would cast Hoover as John the Baptist to FDR ’s Jesus – not Satan .
* Although Rothbard must have supported Hoover ’s disarmament policies , America ’s Great Depression never even mentions the word .
HONOLULU - State officials say there 's no doubt Barack Obama was born in Hawaii .
Health Department Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino said Friday she and the registrar of vital statistics , Alvin Onaka , have personally verified that the health department holds Obama 's original birth certificate .
Fukino says that no state official , including Republican Gov. Linda Lingle , ever instructed that Obama 's certificate be handled differently .
She says state law bars release of a certified birth certificate to anyone who does not have a tangible interest .
Some Obama critics claim he was not born in the U.S .
Earlier Friday , a southwest Ohio magistrate rejected a challenge to Obama 's citizenship .
Judges in Seattle and Philadelphia recently dismissed similar suits .
General characteristics
Fire sign ruled by Mars and Pluto .
Arians possess great force and energy , and they are always ready to take the initiative .
They are instinctive and dynamic , sometimes they make big mistakes because of their impulsiveness .
It is the first sign of the Zodiac , symbol of springtime , of impulse , energy independence and courage .
Often Arians are accused of being self - centred , but it is not so .
They can be romantic , they need love and reassurances .
They tend to be leaders both in private life and in their working life .
Among their possible careers there are : designer , agent , writer , lawyer , politician , actor and all those jobs which give the possibility to lead or live in an off - beat way .
This is the most vital sign of the Zodiac and Arians often give vent to their energy in sports .
Sometimes they express themselves in a rude and violent way , they live love passionately , but they are not a good example of faithfulness .
Arians love speed and shivery actions .
The concept of ' order ' is not familiar to them .
Their fascination is due to their being unforeseeable : this characteristic sometimes leads to a behaviour which is aggressive and weak at the same time .
This makes them charming .
Lucky number 8 Number Eight symbolises infinity .
It is linked to spiritual dimension but also has a strong concrete character .
It precedes Nine where birth is symbolised , so Eight indicates the end of something .
Number Eight has a double value : positive if linked to infinity and opens up to spirituality , negative when an evil action is repeated endlessly like a vicious circle .
Number Eight has a strong astrological link to Uranus , a planet which can stimulate originality .
You tend to be competitive but are never disloyal .
You often have ingenious ideas and brilliant finds which always help you in your intent .
You always understand when it is the right time to act and this is a really rare gift .
Colours Red
The colour red , the symbol of passion , vitality and action , sweeps you away with its energy and power .
Red represents light , power , joy and ambition .
It transmits positivity , determination and warmth .
If the colour red represents you , you are usually an optimistic , competitive , extroverted and courageous person .
Red manages to give a sense of security , strength and self confidence .
Traditionally , the colour red is that of the heart and thus of Love but it has always been linked to Mars , the God of War , as it is also connected to a combative nature .
Orange Orange symbolises mental openness , dynamism and optimism .
If orange represents you , you tend to be a sincere person who is never hypocritical or who takes advantage of others .
You never give up , not even when faced with huge difficulties : courage is your main skill .
You reason brilliantly , but also in a simple , linear and especially coherent manner .
So many people want to be in contact with you as you can emanate positivity and a good mood .
Orange has a strong astrological link with Mars .
そろそろ落ち着いて来たころ合いなので、はてなブックマーク全文検索機能の裏側について書いてみることにします。
PFI 側は、8月ぐらいからバイトに来てもらっているid:nobu-qと、id:kzkの2人がメインになって進めました(参考 : 制作スタッフ)。数学的な所は他のメンバーに色々と助言をしてもらいました。
はてな側は主にid: naoyaさんを中心に、こちらの希望や要求を聞いて頂きました。開発期間は大体1〜2か月ぐらいで、9月の上旬に一度id:naoyaさんにオフィスに来て頂いて合宿をしました。その他の開発はSkypeのチャットで連絡を取りながら進めてました。インフラ面ではid:stanakaさん、契約面ではid:jkondoさん、id:kossyさんにお世話になりました。
全文検索エンジ ンSedue 今回の検索エンジン はSedue ( セデュー ) という製品をベースにして構築しています。SedueはCompressed Suffix Arrays ( 圧縮サフィックスアレイ , CSA ) というアルゴリズムを核にする検索エンジンです。元々は岡野原さんが未踏で作ったものをベースにしています。
CSA はテキストを圧縮した状態で保持しながら、かつ検索が出来るという面白いデータ構造です。これを使用すると検索用インデックスのサイズが小さくなり、通常は元文章に加えて検索用インデックスが必要なところが、元文章のサイズより少し小さいぐらいのインデックスで検索と文章復元が行えます。本当は情報限界まで縮むのですが、速度とのトレードオフでこのぐらいになっています。
複数台に簡単に分散できるのも特徴です。先ほどのサイズ見積もりから、100Gのデータを高スループットで検索するためには、8Gのメモリを積んだマシンが15〜20台程度で済みます(カーネルが使用するメモリ分多めに取る必要が有る)。文章が増えてきたら、その都度マシンを足せば、自動的にに使用メモリ量をリバランシングします。落ちた時も、そのマシンが担当していたインデックスを他のマシンに移動させます。
はてなブックマーク とSedueのつなぎこみ はてなさんに はWebUIと、はてなブックマークシステムからSedueへの繋ぎこみの部分を作成していただきました。また、インフラも用意して頂いています。
Sedueに は" 文章登録 " と " 検 索 " の2つの操作ができます。 誰もブックマークされていない記事を誰かがブックマークすると、JobQueueサーバー( TheSchwartz ) にそのurlが挿入されます。挿入されたurlについて、順次ページの取得と本文抽出を行い、Sedueに登録要求を送信します。
Sedueは文章が更新されると、定期的にインデックスを自動アップデートします。この際、より早く多くのブックマークが付いたものから優先的にインデクシングする仕組みを入れてあります。すぐにホットエントリーになったものについては、2〜3分で検索に反映されていると思います。
検索のほうは、言うまでもないですがUIに単語を入力した時にSedueにクエリーを投げます。検索結果としてヒットしたエントリのIDリストを返すので、それを使用してUI側で色々な情報(お気に入りユーザー等)を表示して頂いています。
登録・検索をするにはSedueのサーバーにSocketで繋いで独自のプロトコルでデータを送ってもらう形になっているのですが、id:naoyaさんがサクっとPerlのクライアントライブラリを作ってくれました。この辺りの仕事の速さは流石すぎました。
Sedueの改良 当初はそのま まSedueをインストールすれば終わるんじゃねぐらいに思っていたのですが、そう甘くも行きませんでした。
一番問題となったのは登録時のパフォーマンス。Sedueでは今まで適当に本文を1文章1ファイルで格納していたのですが、バッチで全文章を登録するとなるとこれでは遅すぎたので、TokyoCabinetを使用して本文を保存する事にしました。
APIが簡単
4G以上のデータも扱える
スレッドセー フ
mixiでの高負荷運用実績が有る な辺りが決め手でした。これで劇的に速度が改善し、色々と作業が進め安くなりました。mikio先生++。あとは統計情報を各プロセスから収集する機能を作ったりもしました。
Sedueのインストール 現状では、はてなのデータセンター にSedue用クラスタを用意して頂いて、そこで検索エンジンを運用して頂いています。id:stanakaさんを始めとするインフラチームの方々にお世話になっています。 起動時にUDPのブロードキャストで他のサーバーを見つける形になっているので、インストールして設定ファイルをばらまき、各ノードにプロセスを1個立てるだけでセットアップが終了します。各サービスの監視や、万が一落ちた際の再起動も、ノード管理機能が勝手にやってくれます。
今後の予定 というわけで、無事に全文検索機能を実装する事が出来ました。個人的には便利に使っているのですが( 主に技術系のワードを調べる)、まだまだ検索までの導線が足りないという所が課題と感じているので、まずはこの辺りをはてなの方と議論しながら改善していく予定です。先日リリースした関連エントリ機能については相当な方に使用して頂いているようで、今回もそれを目指して頑張りたいと思います。より良い情報を効率的に得るための施策を色々と練りたいと思います。
もちろんランキング精度については、地道に向上させて行く予定です。また、ブックマークされたページを起点としてその周りをクローリングする事で、超低コストで良質なWeb検索エンジンを作れないかという事も試みています。ブックマークされたページは、Webという膨大な空間の良いサンプリングになっていると思っていて、これを利用しない手はないわけです。
I actually got out of bed to get this up .
Wow .
there was a follow up bit at his desk after this that was also great .
I 'll try and find it - from the YouTube description .
On the Sept. 10th edition of The Late , Late Show with Craig Ferguson , a new American citizen preparing to vote in his first US election asks , " Are we so lost we have to be sold our own democratic right ! ? "

View hosts chastise Olbermann for not voting David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This When MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann accepted an invitation to appear on ABC's The View on Monday , he may have felt he had ample reason to be nervous .
" Wish me good luck , " he told his own audience in announcing the upcoming inquisition .
" No wonder you 're afraid , " crowed Barbara Walters .
" For years , Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- and MSNBC -- has been Republican - bashing headquarters .
But what is the future of the show now , now that your people are in ?
What are you going to do , Keith Olbermann ? "
" Welcome , by the way , " Walters added more cordially .
" Are you scared to death to be with us ?
We hope so . "
" Then good , yes , I am , " Olbermann replied obligingly .
The program 's hosts then began to lay into Olbermann over everything from his on - air partisanship to his attempts to avoid partisanship by not voting .
Elisabeth Hasselbeck led off , asking " What do you say to critics who claim you 've been particularly soft on Democrats ? "
" I run that question past Senator Clinton , because she did n't think I was easy on her , " Olbermann replied .
" She 's still kind of mad at me .
...
They do n't invite me to the parties any more , " he added , hanging his head in mock - sorrow .
" Bill O'Reilly hates you , " suggested Joy Behar .
" Who ? " asked Olbermann .
" He does n't hate you , he says you hate him , " Behar amplified .
" I said to him , ' Why does Keith Olbermann hate you , ' and he said ' Because he 's jealous of me . '
How do you respond to that ? "
" What was the name again ? " Olbermann responded , causing the show 's hosts to break up .
Hasselbeck , however , was quick to return to the attack .
" I was watching a football game one time and you snuck in there this Palin comment , " she noted , referring to an incident in October which was publicized by Michelle Malkin and widely repeated by conservative bloggers .
" I thought , ' You know , even in my football game , Keith , why ? '
You just can't hold back at all ? "
" I actually said , ' Would I say this if I was still just being a sportscaster ? ' "
Olbermann replied .
" Is it enough of a cultural reference ? ...
And I said , ' I think so . ' "
He added , " There was some restraint involved . "
" You 're going to have trouble now , are n't you ? "
Walters asked , as she had at the start of the show .
" Now that the people you like most are in . "
" They could easily screw up , " Olbermann retorted , insisting that he will say so if they do .
However , he readily admitted that he hopes Sarah Palin will stick around because " she 's an unending font of material . "
" I was reading that you do n't vote , " Behar stated .
" Did you really mean that , and did you vote this time ? "
" I do n't vote , " Olbermann confirmed .
" It 's the only thing I can do that suggests , even , that I do n't have a horse in the race . "
" Then how can you be angry and have a platform if you do n't vote ? " asked Sherri Shepherd .
" It 's a symbolic gesture , " Olbermann explained .
" It 's a bad role model , I 'm sorry " commented Behar tartly .
As the hosts began talking over one another , Walters shushed them to give Olbermann a concluding plug for his show .
" Oh , forgive me , master , " she begged .
" I just do n't want to be the Worst Person this week . "

In 2001 , I was in a bar in Kigoma , on the Tanzanian side of Lake Tanganyika .
As I sipped my beer , I could hear the clipped tones of a South African speaking into a radio transceiver .
He was ordering supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping mission known as Monuc , then operating out of Kalemie on the lake 's Congolese side .
At the time , Monuc 's blue berets were just about managing to keep a lid on things in eastern Congo , but already the strain was showing .
Earlier that year Congolese president Laurent Kabila was shot by his bodyguard .
He was replaced by his son Joseph , largely as a result of pressure brought to bear by Robert Mugabe .
Zimbabwe was one of a number of nations then taking part in the second Congo war ( 1998 -2003 ) .
It was allying itself , along with Angola , Namibia , Chad and Sudan , with the Kabilas .
On the other side , though sometimes fighting each other , were Uganda and Rwanda .
All sides in this many - phased conflict , which has claimed more than five million lives during the past decade , have been engaged in extraction of Congo 's rich mineral deposits .
These have been a cause of bloodshed in the region right back to the 1960s , following Belgium 's messy exit from its former colony .
These riches are one reason why regional collaborations to end the conflict have so far failed ; another is the historical effects of the 1994 Rwandan genocide .
Since the official end of the second Congo war , fighting has been concentrated in the eastern region - the Congolese borders of Uganda , Rwanda and Sudan - with mainly Rwandan proxies fighting a circumstantial alliance of the Congolese army and Hutus .
The most recent focus is on the territorial ambitions of " General " Nkunda , a Rwandan - backed warlord accused of massacring 150 civilians in Kivu last month .
Last week Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , wrote to European leaders asking the EU to intervene in Congo .
The recent collapse of the Congolese army in the eastern region has caused hundreds of thousands of people to be displaced and an eruption of mass killings and rapes .
The letter was an admission that Monuc had failed , having too few troops to deal with a conflict that could potentially again spread over an area as large as the EU itself .
The UN has authorised more troops , but they will not be deployed for at least four months .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , who met Ban yesterday in New York , has proposed four options to EU leaders : sending a rapid response " battle group " of 1,500 troops ; dispatching within several months a 3,000 - strong mission ; simply reinforcing Monuc with forces from European countries ; or achieving a concrete objective , such as securing the all - important Goma airport and other sites .
The second proposal has already been rejected by France .
On Friday , Nicolas Sarkozy said African forces should reinforce Monuc .
He also questioned whether an increase in the number of troops was the answer .
Britain , too , is adamant the EU should not get involved , and Germany is not keen .
These big EU players cite practical or tactical reasons , but underneath the shilly - shallying is a collective failure of moral leadership .
The long - term lack of proper response to the scale of this fluid , deadly conflict is part of the same narrative that saw western governments fail to respond to genocide in Rwanda .
It is eminently possible that a tragedy of a larger scale could now take place .
Ordinary Africans are already suffering on a scale that dwarfs casualties from terrorist outrages and conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In particular , the harrowing reports of mass rape in the Congo demand a response - a military one .
There are good political as well as human rights reasons why stopping mass rape should be the platform for this intervention .
Women are the " glue " in central African society .
They are the carers , the food providers .
If many in several generations of women are damaged , injured or killed , the chances of a return to civil society are extremely slim .
In the immediate term , pressure should be put on the Rwandan leadership itself to rein in Nkunda ; in the short term , Monuc should be supplemented by a large EU force ; in the longer term , as eastern Congo seems ungovernable from Kinshasa , I see no option but the creation of a buffer state on the western shores of Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika .
This could be achieved by regional forces with Monuc - EU backup .
Geopolitically , the Great Lakes region is a hornet 's nest - but unless someone puts smoke in that nest , the world could soon be living with a greater shame than the Rwandan genocide .

Rep. Paul Broun ( R - GA ) says Obama is planning to create a American Gestapo .
“ It may sound a bit crazy and off base , but the thing is , he ’s the one who proposed this national security force .
I ’m just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may — may not , I hope not — but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism .
That ’s exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it ’s exactly what the Soviet Union did .
When he ’s proposing to have a national security force that ’s answering to him , that is as strong as the U.S. military , he ’s showing me signs of being Marxist . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Remember " drill , baby drill " ?
In its last weeks in office , the Bush administration is starting to make it happen by quietly starting the process of exploration and drilling off the coast of Virginia .
As the price of gas surged past $ 4 a gallon this summer , U.S. drilling became a hot political issue .
The move means that President - elect Barack Obama and brand new interior secretary nominee Ken Salazar -- a Democratic senator from Colorado -- will have to jump feet - first into the decades - old debate over offshore oil drilling .
It 's an issue where the two disagreed at one point .
Wait .
Virginia ?
The state is ground zero for the drilling debate because of possible reserves off the coast and what energy experts see as a friendlier government than elsewhere .
The U.S. Interior Department has completed the first step , closing a public comment period on the proposal to lease 2.9 million acres of ocean to natural gas and oil companies .
The pie-shaped area begins 50 miles off Virginia 's coast , straight out from Virginia Beach on the south and across from Virginia 's boundary on the Delmarva peninsula to the north .
" The East Coast really has not been looked at for 30 years , " said Randall Luthi , who heads up the drilling plan as director of Interior 's Minerals Management Service .
Luthi spoke from his Washington office to CNN Radio .
" Our best guess is that area could contain about 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , " he said .
Such an oil find would be small compared with the estimated 40 billion barrels in the Gulf Coast .
The natural gas is more substantial .
But both are symbolic of a rare window of opportunity for the energy industry .
A two - fold ban on Outer Continental Shelf drilling ended in just the past two months .
As the price of gas surged past $ 4 a gallon this summer , U.S. drilling became a hot political issue .
President Bush responded by repealing a presidential offshore drilling ban put in place by his father .
Then in October , a gridlocked Congress let a separate drilling moratorium expire after 26 years on the books .
Back in Virginia , environmentalists echo their Southwestern counterparts , calling the offshore push a last - ditch energy grab .
" We 've got an administration on its way out , trying to make its last deal for the oil and gas industry , " said Glenn Besa , director of Virginia 's Sierra Club chapter .
Besa pointed to what he sees as a platoon of red flags .
" The Navy has a lot of operations out there , in the area where this drilling takes place , " he said , " And the North Atlantic right whale , there 's only 300 or 400 of those individual whales left , and they migrate through that area as well . "
The Navy has expressed concern about the prospect of drilling rigs in the area where much of its Norfolk fleet trains .
NASA has objected as well because it launches satellites and low - altitude rockets from its facility on Wallops Island , Virginia .
The state 's Democratic governor , Tim Kaine , asked the Interior Department to let Virginia research possible natural gas reserves .
But the agency went further , opening the process for oil and gas leasing .
Luthi defends the move without hesitation .
" Oil and gas are going to continue to be a major part of our energy needs in this country , " he said , " for at least the next generation . "
The Minerals and Management chief calls this the start of a long research and regulation period .
He said that under ideal conditions , actual leasing of the ocean area could not begin until 2011 .
But , the next administration could either promote or stop the process cold .
Obama could simply direct the Department of the Interior to freeze the offshore process .
He could also issue another presidential ban on offshore drilling .
Or he could let the idea go forward , something his new nominee to head the Interior Department has favored .
Earlier this year , Salazar was part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers that wanted to open up Outer Continental Shelf drilling in exchange for more investment in low - carbon technology .
Watch : Salazar pick criticized »
At the time , then - Sen .
Obama was in the other camp , sharply opposed to offshore drilling .
But that changed during the campaign , when gas prices were high and politically explosive .
Candidate Obama said that he rethought his position and that " responsible " offshore exploration is part of the total energy picture .
The bold - faced question mark is , where will Obama stand on January 20 when he takes office ?
Besa is counting on the incoming president to lean left and stop Virginia drilling .
" I do think that the environmental community 's voice will be heard , " he said .
But in the Bush camp , Luthi is trying to turn the change in power to his advantage , " That 's one reason we started [ this process ] , was to give the new administration an option . " he said .

All About Oil Production and Refining • U.S. Congress
POSTED BY : Bowzer
The post Election Day climate in this country is a unique and fascinating thing that I ’m glad I only have to relive once every four years .
That last month leading up to the election is pretty intense : attack ads flying multiple times every commercial break , non -stop cable news coverage , political debates amongst everyone ( even those that normally could n’t care less about politics ) .
The tension and hatred between the supporters of Democrats and Republicans really reaches a tipping point by the time Election Day rolls around .
It ’s a recipe for a tremendous uplifting feeling of joy for the winners , and a bitter cold emotional letdown for the losers .
There is no better time to bang a Republican girl than in the next week or so .
Anyone who has seen Wedding Crashers learned from Will Ferrell ’s character that the total money spot for picking up chicks is at a funeral .
The pain , the sorrow , that frozen feeling of empty in the pit of your soul ; these are feelings that I equate with the loss of a loved one or the defeat of your party in a presidential election .
What this means is that essentially there are millions of Republican girls out there that are emotionally ripe for a lay .
These are girls , mind you , that will be totally willing to dress up as Sarah Palin before fucking you .
Do not underestimate the value of this .
That conservative girl at the bar that just passes your minumum Area Code threshold is much like a wounded antelope in the grasslands of Africa .
Like any self - respecting lion , men need to pounce on the kill while the opportunity is there .
I do n’t want to hear any B.S. about staying loyal to your party ’s beliefs , either .
The last time I checked , guys will spit ungodly amounts of bullshit to get into a girl ’s pants , and this will be no exception .
Sex transcends all party lines , at least on the path between the bar and the bedroom .
Here ’s how you are going to star in your own version of “ Nailin ’ Palin : ”
The first task you have is to figure out which girls are the Republicans .
While this may seem like a difficult task , it ’s actually much easier than you think .
Just walk up to her and after figuring out your in , say to her , “ Can you believe that Obama won ? ”
As long as you add the emphasis in a neutral manner , her reaction will be a dead giveaway .
The next step is to determine how political this girl is , as your approach will vary depending upon the answer .
Her response to the Obama question should tell you whether she ’s a diehard neo-con or whether she ’s just regurgitating what the money machine ( i.e. Daddy ) has been telling her .
If she knows what she ’s talking about , then you need to use the phrases “ Ronald Reagan , ” “ pork - barrel spending , ” and “ the evils of socialism ” as frequently as possible .
Also , slip in a “ trickle - down economics ” sex joke to let her know that you mean business .
If she ’s just some dumb girl that voted for McCain for god knows what reason , then congratulations , because this is going to be a cakewalk .
Just use the words , “ Obama , ” “ terrorist , ” and “ 9/11 ” in the same sentence and you will captivate any uninformed Republican .
Once you ’ve gotten through all of the usual small talk that Republicans engage in about the laziness of the poor and such , you will need to make a power move to seal the deal .
Here is where you really need to exploit the post-election vulnerability in the Republican girl .
Play to her emotional side by lamenting how painful and difficult the next four years are going to be .
You have to imagine that you are gaming a girl that just got out of a relationship with her boyfriend , as your approach will be quite similar .
You are the one and only vessel that can navigate her out of the depths of despair .
You want your Republican girl to feel like you are the Karl Rove to her George W. Something as simple as a personal invitation to come back to your place and read Drudge Report could go a long way .
Now that you ’ve talked her into coming home with you , make sure to rip out an Obama yard sign on the way back for dramatic effect .
This is what we in the industry call “ the clincher . ”
Once she ’s in the door , grab a couple of drinks and make a toast to 2012 as you look deep into her eyes and give her your best “ maverick ” face .
I think I can leave the steps that will inevitably follow up to you .
Just make sure you leave Fox News on while you bang , it ’ll keep her coming back .
Guys , now is the time to put aside our partisan differences , and come together as countrymen .
Whether you are a Democrat , Republican , or Independent , we need to extend our hands across party lines and do what ’s best for this nation : give these Republican women the rogering that they truly deserve .
Our window of opportunity is limited , as the sting of McCain ’s loss will begin to wear off in about a week or so .
And then you may never get that unforgettable opportunity to screw a girl in a Palin costume .

Sharing X Sessions
I want to be able to share an X - session with multiple users in a training scenario with 10 - 15 students .
Only the instructor really needs the keyboard and mouse to work .
Although it would be nice if the instructor could temporarily delegate keyboard and mouse control to a student , it is not essential .
I 'd also be interested in knowing about other that scaled well to larger class sizes or worked well only with smaller class sizes .
I 've tried googling , but have not found the right words to search for .
Package names , etc .
Thanks , -- Drew Einhorn -- Drew Einhorn

Newswise — Australian and New Zealand researchers have used ancient DNA from penguin fossils to make a startling discovery that may change the way we view species extinctions .
A team from the University of Adelaide , the University of Otago and Canterbury Museum in New Zealand , has identified a previously unknown penguin species while conducting research on New Zealand 's endangered yellow - eyed penguin , one the world 's rarest penguin species and the subject of an extensive conservation effort .
The Waitaha penguin became extinct after Polynesian settlement but before 1500 AD , creating an opportunity for the yellow - eyed penguin to subsequently colonise the New Zealand mainland from its base in the sub-Antarctic islands .
" Our findings demonstrate that yellow - eyed penguins on mainland New Zealand are not a declining remnant of a previous abundant population , but came from the sub-Antarctic relatively recently and replaced the extinct Waitaha Penguin , " said team member Dr Jeremy Austin , deputy director of the Australasian Centre for Ancient DNA .
" Previous analysis of fossil records and anecdotal evidence suggested that the yellow - eyed penguin was more abundant and widespread in the past , but it now appears they have only been around for 500 years , " he said .
The team , led by University of Otago PhD student Sanne Boessenkool , identified the large - bodied Waitaha Penguin using ancient DNA from prehistoric bones , combined with traditional morphological techniques
" Competition between the two species previously prevented the yellow - eyed penguin from expanding northwards but environmental changes in the predator population , such as the severe decline of sea lions , may have facilitated their colonisation in the South Island . "
Researchers say the surprising finding demonstrates the unexpected ways in which species can respond to human and environmental impacts , and the role of extinction events in shaping our current environment .
Other University of Adelaide members of the research team include Dr Trevor Worthy and Professor Alan Cooper from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences .
The team 's findings have been published this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences , an international biological research journal .
If one is to judge the efficacy of an institution by the policies it promotes , the decisions it makes and the results of its actions then the Federal Reserve Bank System has been one of the most dismal failures in history .
Aside from the side - effects of an absolute fiat monetary system , such as the drastic depreciation of the purchasing power of the currency ; the FED has not preformed well in the prevention of instability in the economy , just the opposite , it has created a long list of boom and bust cycles since the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 .
Just look at its record : 3 Depressions in the 20th Century ; the first was in 1920 - 1921 , the next was 1929 - 1933 and the next was 1937 - 1938 .
There were sharp Recessions : 1923 - 1924 , 1948-1949 , 1953-1954 , 1957-1958 , 1973-1975 , and 1981 - 1982 .
1987 .
Then there were 7 mild Recessions : 1926 -1927 , 1960-1961 , 1969-1970 , 1980 , 1990 - 1991 , 1999 and then 2001 brought on by the events of 9/11 and of course the latest FED fiasco that we are now witnessing .
That is not the best record in the world for the Federal Reserve System and Keynesian Economics .
The long - term monetary policy promoted by the FED , this government and other countries , is ruinous .
It is based on a game that relies solely upon the illusion of value , the deception of debt wealth .
It is , simply a catastrophe that is literally unfolding before our very eyes .
Any dependence by any society upon such an inconspicuous system of gradual monetary depreciation is , to say the very least , unwise , shortsighted and poses a very real danger to the future well being of the People .
Of course , such an inflationist fiat monetary system allows the government to expand everything politicians can dream up without resorting to a drastic increase of taxes on the People , this helps the government avoid such nasty and potentially dangerous acts of over - taxation ; nevertheless , inflation is , perhaps the most insidious means of tax ever devised .
It not only drains a great deal of productive wealth from the country , but it promotes government expansion , poor decision making and misguided polices .
The loss of productive wealth is probably the most damning result of fiat money ; it impedes progressive commerce in ways that few understand .
It is so damaging to the ability to judge the time value of our money that businesses , particularly those involved with long - term capital investments cannot accurately rely upon the future value of their money .
Thus the true cost of capital always evades commerce , encouraging malinvestments and bad decisions ; it is a sloppy system of money .
Since there is never a clear signal upon which businesses can draw upon , especially when it comes to the manipulation of interest rates by the FED , it is an unreliable indicator of time preferences which , under a free - market system , coupled with sound money , would give such indicators and allow for far better decision making with both monetary and business movements .
Based upon the monetary and credit polices of the FED , commerce should have experienced a steady growth due to the injection of money and credit into circulation however , this does not appear to be the case .
Now , based of FED figures , monetary growth and credit there has been an increase close to a factor of 90 % between the periods of 1950 and 2008 , yet we do not see a comparable rate of economic growth , the truth is that we see just the opposite , a declining growth rate and a drastic decrease in the purchase power of the dollar .
In fact , judging other indicators , such as the amount of debt it now takes to generate even a dollar 's worth of economic growth our country is on a precipice from which there can be no retreat , at least as long as this monetary system continues to drain away all viability from the economic system .
Without doubt , there are those apologists for the currency fiat monetary system and the economy that has been built upon it who sing the praises of its elasticity , its flexibility when just the opposite is true .
What they actually heap their praise on is government intervention through the implementation of the Federal Reserve Bank .
It is not , nor can it be a long - term solution , such systems always fails in the end .
They shout that in order for the economy to keep going , for it to grow there must be a constant and consistent supply of money injected into circulation .
While that is perfectly true for a fiat monetary system , it does not hold true for a sound monetary system .
It is not the number of dollars floating around in the economy that matters , but the effective purchasing power of each dollar that assist in the productive creation of commerce and , in turn , wealth .
With fiat money , central banking intervention and manipulation always depreciates the purchase value of money to the point that the only impetus for economic growth is the injection of even more money and credit into the system .
This is , of course , a precarious road to travel upon .
Eventually , of course , this great inverted pyramid of debt that they have helped create can no longer be balanced .
The debt and inflation become impossible to maintain to the point that the FED will be increasingly unable to create more debt to create more money to effect its balancing act .
Thus far , the only thing keeping the entire system afloat is the fact that up until now they have been able to continue the process , but as you and I will soon see , that will no longer be possible .
It is becoming evident that as the debt looms larger and larger , it will siphon all profitability from the economy because the economy can simply not service that galactic degree of debt .
There is currently an effort by the FED , the Treasury and this government of a great postponement ; one that will barely slow the crisis , for it is systemic not only in its nature but the flaws within the system are inherent .
There is a very real dual deterioration taking place at the moment , one involves a deflationary trend in banking , credit and business , the other is a massive inflationary trend taking place as the FED injects truly unbelievable amounts of credit liquidity and money into the system .
There are other even more ominous threats to our economic survival on the horizon , of which there will be few options left the FED in its ability to divert disaster .
Soon , there will be massive defaults , on such a scale that this country has yet to see in its history .
It has assisted in creating a vast black hole of debt one that has been steadily sucking the life from this country and its people .
The only thing , and I mean the only thing that is keeping the entire system hobbling at the moment is the ability of the FED to keep the “ printing - press ” running at full speed .
The problem of course is that the debt is multiplying faster than the FED can print itself out of the hole .
The FED is constantly attempting to push that event horizon out in time , creating a lag - time between now and the “ Reckoning ” .
It is , of course , becoming more and more difficult for the FED to keep the spread from narrowing .
As we know , the people of this country are woefully unaware of just what is taking place and because there is a delay between the actions of the FED and the reactions within the economy this allows problems to go unnoticed until they are upon us .
Eventually , the entire system becomes unmanageable , stress - cracks simply become too common and too deep to contain with the normal actions taken by the FED , as we are seeing .
At this point , the decision - making process is much more akin to a stab in the dark than anything resembling sound monetary and economic policy .
We are seeing signals of a monetary system that is heading for the bone yard .
The expansion of bank credit an money , thus more debt , all sponsored by a central bank which has proven itself incompetent since its inception in 1913 , will begin to demand far more than the economy will be able to produce .
As I have stated , time and again , this fiat monetary system and the economy it supports will end in a massive insolvency .
Instead of taking appropriate actions to combat this , the FED is doing exactly the same thing that brought about every boom and bust cycle our country has seen since the 1920s .
It is lowering interest rates , pumping mind - boggling amounts of fiat currency into the system and thus they are simply distorting an already inflated economic and monetary distortion by their actions .
All of this leads to a very unsustainable level of debt and that debt will begin to demand even more service the larger it becomes .
The central banks of the world now find themselves in the classic Catch 22 , a circular equation with no solution .
We are at the point that the FED , the Treasury , the Government will no longer be able to mitigate the cascade of problems with any real effectiveness .
The problems are now much larger than the institutions which seek to control them .
In fact , the problems are now larger than the government which seeks to maintain its power and control , it will also be a victim of its own creation .

The complete movie is now available on YouTube :
Although this blog is about medicine , specifically the scientific basis of medicine and threats to the scientific basis of medicine regardless of the source , several of us also have an interest in other forms of pseudoscience and threats to other branches of science .
One branch of science that is , not surprisingly , critical to medicine is the science of biology , and the organizing theory of biology is the theory of evolution , which was first reported by Charles Darwin and subsequently synthesized with the developing science of genetics in the early 20th century and then with our increasing knowledge of molecular biology , genomics , and proteonomics whose rise ushered us into the 21st century .
However , the implications of evolution , namely that humans and apes both evolved from a common ancestor and that humans , for all their belief of being different and superior to animals , are in fact related to animals in the great chain of life going all the way back to single - celled organisms , does not go down well with certain religious fundamentalists , particularly Christian fundamentalists .
Whereas I ( and I daresay several of my cobloggers ) find the interconnectedness of life , including humans , implied by Darwin ’s theory to be beautiful and uplifting , many fundamentalists see it as a profound threat to their world view .
Consequently , they have attacked the theory of evolution at every turn and tried to insert creationism , particularly the latest incarnation of creationism known as “ intelligent design , ” into science classes as an “ alternative ” to “ Darwinism . ”
The manner in which they torture science , logic , and reason to try to cast doubt on a theory that is every bit as rock solid in terms of massive quantities of experimental and observational evidence to support it as any other theory in science , if not more so , is legendary and well documented at blogs such as The Panda ’s Thumb and websites such as Talk Origins .
Although one day I plan on writing about how insights from evolutionary theory have led to deeper understandings of human disease and strategies to improve human health in the future , this time I want to concentrate on the similarities in techniques of spreading disinformation between creationists and purveyors of unscientific medical “ treatments . ”
For background , first , you need to be aware of a movie that was released in April .
The movie , Expelled ! : No Intelligence Allowed was released .
Starring Ben Stein at his most unctuous sporting a bullhorn and styling himself as a conservative , buttoned - down version of Angus Young through his choice of apparel in its promotional material , the movie ’s main theme is that any academic who “ questioned Darwinism ” is “ expelled ” from academia .
The basic idea is that “ intelligent design ” creationism is being “ suppressed ” by biologists who just ca n’t accept the thought of the existence of a “ designer ” ( i.e. , God ) .
Indeed , the movie goes so far as to equate biologists and scientists who accept the theory of evolution as the best current explanation for the diversity of life to Hitler and the Nazis and their “ suppression ” of “ alternatives ” ( word choice intentional ) to “ Darwinism ” to Nazi and Stalinist persecution of dissidents and perceived threats to the regime .
The movie even features a sequence where Ben Stein visits Dachau and Auschwitz , as though to imply that biologists are busy firing up the ovens for the Brave Maverick Scientists who “ dissent from Darwin . ”
These Brave Maverick Scientists are a lot like the Brave Maverick Doctors who champion unscientific medicine .
After all , Kevin Trudeau has made a cottage industry and sold millions of books based on the claim that there are “ natural cures ” that “ they ” ( as in doctors , pharmaceutical companies , and the government ) do n’t want you to know about and that as a consequence the full forces of these groups are being marshalled to “ suppress ” them and “ persecute ” the Brave Maverick Doctors who dare to question the “ orthodoxy ” of “ allopathic medicine , ” up to and including claims of “ Nazi ” - like suppression .
( Just read those repositories of quackery NaturalNews.com and Whale . to if you do n’t believe me . )
For the “ alternative medicine ” movement , it ’s all there , in websites , blogs , and books .
But one thing that the movement pushing unscientific treatments has lacked , and that ’s a movie to call its own , a movie to spread the same message .
That is , until now .
The ( Not - So - ) Beautiful ( Un ) Truth
A number of readers have e-mailed to me links and references to a new movie , which recently completed a run in New York City from November 14 through 20 and is scheduled to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles and show there through December 4 .
I ’m referring to a movie entitled The Beautiful Truth .
Before the e-mails started , I had had no inkling that this movie was being made or that its release was on the horizon .
Maybe it ’s because the movie is only showing in New York and Los Angeles and has n’t made it out of the media enclaves of those cities out to the rest of us in flyover country , or maybe its release is so limited that I just had n’t heard of it .
Or maybe it ’s because it did n’t have the multimillion dollar marketing push from religious fundamentalists , coupled with a famous face like that of Ben Stein fronting it .
However , what this movie reminds me of , more than anything else , is Ben Stein ’s pseudoscience - and lie - filled bit of “ intelligent design ” creationism propaganda Expelled !
.
The similarities are eerie , at least in terms of the message .
The Beautiful Truth may not have the marketing muscle or celebrity behind it that Expelled ! had ( and still has behind its release as a DVD ) , but it does have slick website , not to mention a lot of trailers and clips from the movie on YouTube and elsewhere .
These trailers and clips make it quite obvious that The Beautiful Truth is nothing less than a credulous paean to cancer quackery in much the same way that Expelled ! was a credulous paean to “ intelligent design ” creationism coupled with a conspiracy theory casting advocates of pseudoscience as brave “ skeptics ” of scientific orthodoxy .
Specifically , it ’s a paean to the quackery known as the Gerson therapy , mixed in with a veritable cornucopia of dubious and fraudulent cancer treatments .
If the dozen or so clips on the website and YouTube are any indication , this movie is nothing less than a tour into the dark heart of American quackery led by a credulous guide who has drunk deeply from the Kool Aid on sites like Whale .
to , NaturalNews.com , and Mercola.com .
Just as Expelled !
claims that academics are “ suppressing ” any criticism of “ Darwinism ” or research into “ intelligent design , ” The Beautiful Truth postulates a grand suppression of this “ alternative ” cure for cancer that “ they ” do n’t want you to know about .
The movie is described thusly :
Garrett is a 15 - year old boy living in the Alaskan wilderness with a menagerie of orphaned animals .
Growing up close with nature has given him a deep understanding of nutritional needs required by diet sensitive animals on the reserve .
Unfortunately , the untimely and tragic death of his mother propelled him into a downward spiral and he risked flunking out of school .
This led to his father ’s decision to home - school Garrett .
His first assignment was to study a controversial book written by Dr. Max Gerson .
Note the religious overtones to this plot device holding the movie together .
Indeed , this is nothing less than a conversion story , of which we hear many from religious fundamentalists , the kind where after a tragedy a troubled youth falls into a pit of despair , complete with substance abuse , bad grades , and falling in with the “ wrong ” crowd .
Either as a result of his fall or as the cause of his fall , the youth rejects Jesus .
Then , in such stories , inevitably someone shows the troubled youth the Bible and tells him all about Jesus again , and eventually the youth “ sees the light ” and is saved from the darkness .
This movie sounds exactly like this , except with “ alternative ” medicine being the savior and Max Gerson providing the “ miracles ” in the form of a “ miraculous cure ” for cancer .
This is not surprising , because so much of “ alternative ” medicine is more like religion than anything else–and a cult religion at that , as has been argued by my cobloggers at various times .
No amount of evidence or science deters its adherents from their belief .
But , if you really , believe , the Messiah Max Gerson will cure you–yes , you !–of your cancer , no matter how advanced
The description of the movie continues :
Written over 50 years ago , Dr. Gerson found that diet could , and did , cure cancer .
Controversial at the time ( and even today ) , Garrett took on the challenge of researching this amazing therapy , which drew the interest of his neighbors in the small Alaskan community .
With the help of Dr. Gerson ’s daughter , Charlotte Gerson , and grandson , Howard Strauss , they gave him the ammunition needed to go in search for the truth – a truth that would affect not only him , but his entire Alaskan village – all of whom wanted to know if these claims were true .
After a number of cancer patients , who were diagnosed as terminal , shared their stories and their medical records with Garrett , it became abundantly clear that , contrary to the disinformation campaign spear - headed by the multi-billion dollar medical and pharmaceutical industry , a cure for virtually all cancers and chronic diseases does exist – and has existed for over 80 years !
Of course it has .
It always has–at least , if you listen to people like Mike Adams , that is .
Indeed , I wonder if he had a hand in this movie .
Alas for my speculation , according to the press kit , at least , he did n’t .
In any case , if you believe purveyors of many , many forms of quackery , there is always a cure for cancer out there that big pharma and the government have been “ suppressing ” because–well , it ’s never entirely clear exactly why they would keep such a cure a secret or , more incredibly , how they could possibly keep such a secret .
Indeed , these cancer “ cures ” strike me as being either the world ’s most well - kept conspiracies of all time ( after all , I ’m a cancer surgeon and researcher and I ’ve never heard from my colleagues even a hint of such an amazing cure for cancer in general or any specific cancer ) or the worst - kept ( after all , filmmakers like Steve Kroschel , writer , producer , and director of The Beautiful Truth , seem to have very little difficulty finding out all about it ) .
In actuality , whether the secret of these “ natural cures ” is well or poorly kept seems to vary with the needs of the advocate telling the story .
Moreover , none of these claims makes much sense on a strictly logical basis .
Think about it this way :
So many people die of cancer every year that virtually every person in developed countries , doctors and cancer researchers–and , yes , even big pharma executives –included , have known , know , or will know someone with cancer .
Many have seen or will see someone they love die of cancer , sometimes in horrific ways .
Certainly over the more than four decades of my existence , I have had multiple family members who have died of cancer .
In fact , right now my wife and I are dealing with the heartbreak of a close family member recently diagnosed with widely metastatic breast cancer , and I ’ve been trying to work every contact I know to get her to the best oncologist in order to provide her with the best possible palliation .
Do the makers of this movie think that I or any other cancer researcher ( or even big pharma executive ) would withhold knowledge of such a “ cure ” or keep it from others if I knew of it ?
Indeed , because cancer kills so many people , many of these very same doctors and researchers will end up battling the disease at some point in their lives , and many of them will end up dying of it themselves .
I might even end up dying of cancer someday .
You might end up dying of cancer someday .
Does it make any sort of sense logically that every single one of these doctors , executives , and bureaucrats would dismiss or conspire to suppress ( or even blindly ignore the evidence for its existence because of dogma and “ business as usual ” of ) such an amazingly effective cure , if it really existed ?
No , it does not .
Someone would talk , probably a lot of people .
I know I would .
Again , given how cancer has recently touched our family , I assure you , if such a cure existed , I would make damned sure that family member got it , no matter what it was , and if it truly worked as advertised I would make sure everyone else knew about it too .
You can be sure that quite a few of those supposedly nefarious cancer researchers , government bureaucrats , and big pharma executives would too .
So now , not surprisingly , the filmmaker ( through Garrett ) has a mission :
Garrett ’s mission now is to tell the world .
Of course it is .
It always is .
Because he ’s been converted and is now an evangelist .
The Gerson “ Therapy ”
Let ’s review a bit about just what the Gerson therapy is .
It ’s a so - called “ nutritional ” therapy for cancer that involves consuming large quantities of fruit and vegetable juices , raw liver , coupled with a “ detoxification ” regime that involves frequent coffee enemas .
It is described thusly on the movie ’s website :
The Gerson Therapy is a powerful , natural treatment that boosts your body ’s own immune system to heal cancer , arthritis , heart disease , allergies and many other degenerative diseases .
One aspect of the Gerson Therapy that sets it apart from most other treatment methods is its all - encompassing nature .
An abundance of nutrients from thirteen fresh , organic juices is consumed every day , providing your body with a super dose of enzymes , minerals and nutrients .
These substances then break down diseased tissue in the body , while enemas aid in eliminating the lifelong buildup of toxins from the liver .
With its whole - body approach to healing , the Gerson Therapy naturally reactivates your bodys magnificent ability to heal itself with no damaging side - effects .
Over 200 articles in respected medical literature and thousands of people cured of their incurable diseases document the Gerson Therapy ’s effectiveness .
The Gerson Therapy is one of the few treatments to have a 60 year history of success .
Although its philosophy of cleansing and reactivating the body is simple , the Gerson Therapy is a complex method of treatment requiring significant attention to detail .
While many patients have made full recoveries practicing the Gerson Therapy on their own , for best results it is recommended to begin treatment at a Gerson Institute licensed treatment center .
For more information , visit www.gerson.org.
All the usual buzz words are there , the “ naturalness ” of it ( although I ’ve never been able to figure out how advocates of these sorts of “ natural detoxification ” regimens can think that pumping coffee up one ’s posterior is in any way “ natural ” ) ; the vague and scientifically meaningless “ boosting the immune system ” claim ; and , above all , the “ detoxification ” claim .
Apparently believers in the Gerson therapy ( not to mention many other forms of “ alternative medicine , ” believe that our bodies ( and colons ) are packed with hideous toxins that are making us ill .
Once again , how shoving coffee up one ’s posterior removes “ toxins ” I fail to understand , but then I ’m thinking about this scientifically rather than religiously .
Adherents who believe in detoxification appear to me to do so more out of a belief analogous to religion that they are “ unclean ” and need “ purification , ” much the same way that some fundamentalist Muslims engage in ritual self - flagellation or the manner in which in Christian religions Baptism is believed to cleanse the soul .
The Gerson protocol provides that “ purification , ” just as a wide variety of “ colon cleansers ” and “ liver flushes ” beloved of “ alternative medicine ” mavens .
Unfortunately , they do not work against cancer and can lead to delays in treatment and , even worse , can rob patients with fatal cancer of effective palliation when they usurp scientific medicine .
Actually , the Gerson protocol was a precursor to the now more commonly discussed and more ( in ) famous Gonzalez protocol , which my co-blogger Dr. Kimball Atwood IV deconstructed in such exquisite detail over the course of several posts right here on this very blog a while back ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
Grafted onto the therapy by his daughter Charlotte since Max Gerson ’s death have been other forms of woo , such as liver extract injections , ozone enemas , “ live cell therapy , ” thyroid tablets , castor oil enemas , clay packs , laetrile , and “ vaccines ” made from influenza virus and killed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria .
Gerson ’s “ evidence ” in the form of his case series was examined by the National Cancer Institute back in the 1950s , and this is what was found :
In 1947 , the NCI reviewed ten cases selected by Dr. Gerson and found his report unconvincing .
That same year , a committee appointed by the New York County Medical Society reviewed records of 86 patients , examined ten patients , and found no evidence that the Gerson method had value in treating cancer .
An NCI analysis of Dr. Gerson ’s book A Cancer Therapy : Results of Fifty Cases concluded in 1959 that most of the cases failed to meet the criteria ( such as histologic verification of cancer ) for proper evaluation of a cancer case [ 16 ] .
A recent review of the Gerson treatment rationale concluded : ( a ) the “ poisons ” Gerson claimed to be present in processed foods have never been identified , ( b ) frequent coffee enemas have never been shown to mobilize and remove poisons from the liver and intestines of cancer patients , ( c ) there is no evidence that any such poisons are related to the onset of cancer , ( d ) there is no evidence that a “ healing ” inflammatory reaction exists that can seek out and kill cancer cells [ 17 ] .
And :
Charlotte Gerson claims that treatment at the clinic has produced high cure rates for many cancers .
In 1986 , however , investigators learned that patients were not monitored after they left the facility [ 19 ] .
Although clinic personnel later said they would follow their patients systematically , there is no published evidence that they have done so .
A naturopath who visited the Gerson Clinic in 1983 was able to track 21 patients over a 5 - year period ( or until death ) through annual letters or phone calls .
At the 5 - year mark , only one was still alive ( but not cancer - free ) ; the rest had succumbed to their cancer [ 20 ] .
The cancer doctor in me knows that this is pretty much what would be expected if one were to follow 21 patients with advanced cancer who were being given no treatment .
The exact timeframe for their deaths would vary depending upon the mix of cancers , but one could be pretty confident that very few , if any , of them would be alive after five years–or even two or three years .
Moreover , because the Gerson regimen , like the Gonzalez regimen , is quite onerous and difficult to follow , only patients in relatively good shape to begin with can follow it , thus selecting for patients more likely to live longer with their metastatic cancer anyway .
But Back to the Quackery Propaganda …
If the clips posted to YouTube are any indication , this movie wastes no time in plunging down the rabbit hole of paranoid conspiracy - mongering .
For example , here is its account of what happened to a reporter in the 1940s after reporting on Gerson ’s claims :
And here is an interview with Gerson from 1957 in which he claims so many patients that “ you ” ( meaning doctors ) had “ sent home to die ” whom he “ cured ” :
I have worked with injured and orphaned wild animals and have been moved by the rcovery of wildlife from illness and disease by the nutritional therapies that I used .
So when I was introduced to the work of Dr. Max Gerson on human nutrition by an associate , I wanted to investigate these amazing claims .
I was startled by these discovereds , and , frankly , it has changed my life–especially when I was able to meet the people who should have been dead due to terminal cancer .
Since I am a filmmaker , I wanted to meet Dr. Gerson ’s family and do a short film for charity .
The fallout from that earlier work was so controversial , far - reaching , yet uplifting ; I decided to make a feature length film .
I ’ve spoken with hundreds of people about Gerson ’s therapy and many people related their recovers , their skepticism and bias–most of which came from the medical community .
But what I quickly found out that those who dismissed the therapy did not have conclusive evidence that it did n’t work .
In doing more investigation , it quickly became evident that an almost criminal set of priorities has been in play when it comes to treating human disease .
In fact , as was the case for Expelled ! , unacknowledged conspiracy or even outright dogma is at the heart of the movie .
Be sure to check out this trailer for The Beautiful Truth as well .
It ’s got it all , including a leading question : “ If your doctor knew of a cure for cancer that did n’t require expensive drugs , he would tell you , would n’t he ? ”
In the typical “ science has been wrong before ” combined with “ doctors will say anything if they ’re paid enough ” gambit , there are also the obligatory excerpts from cigarette ads from the 1940s and 1950s asking “ What cigarette do you smoke , doctor ? ” Then there ’s a woman who ( I assume ) is Charlotte Gerson ranting about how doctors can’t afford to let patients see “ alternative ” doctors because “ alternative ” medicine cures people when “ conventional ” medicine can’t and about how people have been “ so brainwashed for so long . ”
In other words , it ’s the same , tired old propaganda that so many quacks have been claiming for so long .
It is propaganda that the esteemed director of this film seems perfectly predisposed to believe , as he appears not to have an ounce of skepticism in him , at least if his Director ’s Statement is any indication :
In other words , Steve Kroschel is a credulous soul who has n’t the slightest clue about how to evaluate scientific evidence relating to the efficacy of a cancer therapy ( or any therapy , for that matter ) .
He clearly has no idea how scientists and doctors determine whether any given therapy has any activity against cancer and assumes that they dismiss the Gerson therapy because of their bias against “ unconventional ” therapies .
In other words , he ’s a clueless wonder .
In fact , he ’s so credulous that the Gerson therapy and cancer are n’t enough for him .
Here ’s where the next similarity to Expelled !
comes in , as Kroschel descends to the same level as Ben Stein did in Expelled !
in an anti-fluoridation segment that ’s replete with images of Hitler and his concentration camps , along with claims that Hitler wanted to use sodium fluoride as a technique for mass sterilization , presumably of the Jews :
Calling Mr. Godwin !
Your presence is requested in the movie theater immediately !
Kroschel also delves into dental amalgam quackery .
The deconstruction of this particular form of “ alt - med ” is beyond the scope of this post , but Quackwatch and our very own Harriet Hall have provided excellent discussions for why the claims that the mercury in dental amalgams is some sort of horrific health threat is nonsense and why dentists and “ alternative ” practitioners who insist that people need to have their amalgam fillings removed in order to “ detoxify ” are almost invariably quacks .
Suffice it to say that there is a widespread and paranoid belief that somehow the mercury in dental amalgams is causing all sorts of horrific health problems , much the same way that the mercury militia thinks that mercury in vaccines causes autism , and clearly Kroschel believes this pseudoscience as well :
Hilariously , there ’s a segment in the video above of the dreaded “ smoking tooth ” video which in reality caught nothing more than water vapor .
It ’s one of the most amusingly silly bits of extravagant quackery that I ’ve ever seen and always good for a hearty belly laugh ( or a cry when I realize that there are a number of people who actually believe this sort of stuff ) whenever I watch it .
Unfortunately , Kroschel actually seems to think that this video is slam - dunk evidence of anything other than the video maker ’s utter credulity .
Now , like Harriet , I ’m not saying that it is n’t possible that small amounts of mercury may escape from amalgams over many years , but no one has yet produced any remotely convincing evidence that ( 1 ) it is any more than trace amounts ; ( 2 ) that any significant amount is actually absorbed at significant levels ; or ( 3 ) that amalgams are linked with any health problems at all .
In reality , the crowd that believes that dental amalgams cause all sorts of horrific chronic health problems is very much like the anti-vaccine crowd known as the “ mercury militia , ” which clings to the scientifically discredited belief that mercury in the thimerosal preservative that used to be common in childhood vaccines was a major cause of autism or people who try to link mercury from the smokestack emissions from power plants with autism .
Both rely on misunderstandings , confuse correlation with causation , and a studied ignorance of the principle that the dose makes the poison .
Yes , mercury is toxic , but not at all doses and not at the doses that were in vaccines and are in dental amalgams .
As amusing ( in a warped way ) as I find the dreaded “ smoking tooth ” clip , my favorite segment is this next clip .
Really , if you watch only one of the clips in this post , make this next clip the one .
You wo n’t regret it .
You really wo n’t .
I swear .
It has that sort of paranormal buzz about it that I find irresistable :
I do n’t know about you , but I could n’t stop laughing after I watched this clip .
In it , two pictures are shown .
One , we are told , is of a cooked baby carrot .
The other , we are told , is of an uncooked baby carrot .
The narrator proclaims , “ The uncooked carrot has a startling line of strong energy ” that –surprise , surprise !
–the cooked carrot obviously lacks .
Never mind that we have no idea what techniques were used to take these pictures or even what this “ energy ” is supposed to be .
The conclusion ?
Pasteurized food is “ dead , dead , ” apparently just like the parrot in a certain famous Monty Python sketch and not unlike Steve Kroschel ’s brain .
Now , whatever negative nutritional changes cooking may induce in food , which may include the breakdown or degradation of some nutrients , this sort of nonsense is simply nothing more than superstitious vitalism , an ancient belief that there is a “ life force ” or “ life energy ” that animates life and is the difference between living matter and dead matter .
It turns out that belief in vitalism is at the heart of many unscientific “ alternative medicine ” practices , for example , virtually any “ energy healing ” modality , such as reiki , therapeutic touch , acupuncture , or any other therapy that claims to manipulate qi .
Those who believe in vitalism also often believe that it is somehow better to eat “ live ” food , as if we can somehow absorb its life force by eating it .
It also looks no different than the hilarious quackery of “ aura ” cameras for humans or perhaps so - called “ bioluminal ” photography .
Call me psychic if you want ( or say I have delusions of being a psychic ) , but I ’ll hazard a prediction here , not having seen the whole movie and noting the fact that there is n’t any information about all the cancer patients “ cured ” with Gerson therapy .
My prediction ?
I predict that there will be the usual “ testimonials ” by people who say they were “ sent home to die ” by their oncologists , only to be “ saved ” by Gerson or his daughter .
There will be Messianic overtones ( with Gerson as the Messiah , of course ) and a strong similarities to religious conversion stories in the testimonials , as I ’ve pointed out before about such stories .
Most importantly , though , in not a single one of the testimonials in the movie will there be sufficient detail or evidence presented to allow one to draw any reliable or convincing conclusions whatsoever regarding whether the Gerson therapy , in fact , cured the patient ’s cancer .
( There never is . )
Key information will be missing from each and every such testimonial .
( It always is . )
I realize I ’m going out on a limb here , but what ’s the point of being a blogger if you do n’t take outrageous risks from time to time ?
In any case , I ’ve seen enough testimonials and observed how they are used to sell “ alternative ” medical therapies to know what to expect without even having to watch the movie .
Unfortunately , it ’s too late for those of you in New York , as the film ’s run there is over , but here ’s one good thing about this movie for readers living in L.A .
After some of the shows during the film ’s L.A. run over the Thanksgiving weekend , there will be question - and - answer sessions featuring Howard Straus , Charlotte Gerson , and Polly Emery .
This looks to me like an excellent opportunity for any enterprising medical skeptical doctors to try to put Gerson ’s offsprings ’ feet to the fire and try to get them to provide answers consisting of more than just the usual testimonials and claims that “ they ” are “ suppressing ” the “ Truth . ”
Certainly , were I still living in New Jersey , I would have been highly tempted to make an appearance .
On the other hand , it takes a hearty soul to do this sort of thing and plunge into the proverbial lions ’ den .
After all , people likely to make up the audience for such a movie want to believe , and likely the reaction to skeptical questions would be about the same as the reaction from the audience of the screening of Expelled ! at which Richard Dawkins showed up .
After all , on The Beautiful Truth blog , all I find are glowing “ reviews ” and posts about how popular and well - received the movie supposedly was in New York , not to mention a testimonial or two about “ natural ” cures .
The Beautiful Truth and Expelled ! :
The differences are only skin deep
The more I watch the clips from this movie , the more appropriate I think the comparison between The Beautiful Truth and Expelled ! is .
All the elements are there : Outrageous pseudoscience .
Check .
A scientific orthodoxy supposedly so blinded by greed and ideology that it ca n’t accept that Max Gerson “ cured ” cancer and therefore treats the Gerson protocol it as a challenge to its medical hegemony , just as in the eyes of ID creationists those evil “ Darwinists ” supposedly can’t stand challenges to “ Darwinism ” and treat them as a challenge to their scientific hegemony .
Check .
And , of course , there is at least one Godwin - worthy gratuitous comparison to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis .
( Whether there are more or not , I ca n’t know without seeing the whole movie . )
Check .
From these clips and the descriptions of the movie on its website , it seems to me that all The Beautiful Truth lacks is Ben Stein in an Angus Young - style British schoolboy shorts walking up to oncologists and hospitals with a bullhorn and demanding why they do n’t offer the Gerson therapy to their patients or , sans schoolboy pants , looking deeply contemplative and horrified at the ruins of Dachau or Auschwitz , and implying that doctors , the FDA , and the government are busy firing up the ovens for Dr. Gerson ’s descendants , metaphorically speaking at least .
I suppose we can be grateful for that small mercy , at least .
Ben Stein looks ridiculous in a British schoolboy uniform .
Be that as it may , as a cancer surgeon , I find such promotion of the most obvious and blatant cancer quackery to be utterly despicable and fear that it will lead some patients to believe that the Gerson therapy really does cure cancer and to abandon effective cancer therapies .
Also as distressing , the manner in which Kroschel uses his son Garrett as the vessel into which he pours his “ alternative ” medicine agenda and his defense of quackery is profoundly creepy .
One hopes he is not damaged by the experience .
Even better would be if in a year or two Garrett rebels against his father , as so many teen boys do , and decides to become an oncologist ( or , better yet , a surgical oncologist ) who rejects the Gerson protocol as the quackery it is and dedicates himself to using only the best science - based cancer therapy .
The irony would be delicious .
Sadly , I realize that such an outcome is highly unlikely .
After all , the apple usually does n’t fall too far from the tree .
But a science - based medicine boosting surgical oncologist can always dream , ca n’t he ?
The grip that the Israeli lobby has over both political parties means that any real shift in U.S. Middle Eastern policy is unlikely , whoever is elected president today .
It might also be argued that no change in policy outside the Middle East is likely either , except that Obama might talk before he bombs .
Given Joe Biden ’s warning that Obama will respond decisively to a foreign policy test in his first six months , it might even be suggested that a new regime could prove more trigger - happy than the current one .
That said , there is a real substantive difference between the Obama ’s foreign policy team and John McCain’s .
The latter is neocon - dominated , with advisers such as Bill Kristol , John Bolton , Robert Kaplan , and the Kagan brothers , not to mention key spokesman Randy Scheunemann .
Such an administration would be virtually guaranteed to see the world in Manichean terms and use the military as the preferred foreign policy option .
When McCain ran against George Bush in 2000 , he was the choice of the neocons , who saw him as the candidate mostly likely to engage in an assertive foreign policy that would , inter alia , be " good " for Israel .
He is still their man , and , since it has also become clear that the choice of Sarah Palin originated with the neocons at National Review and The Weekly Standard , McCain - Palin is very much their ticket .
Barack Obama has inherited much of the old Bill Clinton foreign policy team , including Richard Holbrooke , Susan Rice , Anthony Lake , and Madeleine Albright .
One might reasonably critique much of Clinton ’s foreign and security policy  most particularly the horrific sanctions against Iraq , war in the Balkans , invasion of Haiti , and chaotic counterterrorism efforts  but his advisers were mostly old - school realists who believed that there was such a thing as a national interest and that dealing with other nations required the give - and - take of diplomacy in addition to the threat of force .
If Obama wins , it is generally believed that the position of Secretary of State will go to Richard Holbrooke .
Holbrooke is not shy when it comes to the use of force , having been the architect of U.S. military engagement in Bosnia in the mid-1990s , but his current views on Iran , Pakistan , and Afghanistan are not completely clear .
Regarding Iraq , he initially supported removing Saddam Hussein but has lately called for a " new strategy " for redeployment of U.S. forces in the region .
Holbrooke ’s aggressiveness combined with Joe Biden ’s prediction that there will be a major challenge together suggest that Obama will quite likely be supported by his advisers if he is keen to prove that he is not a wimp , so the first six months or so could be a wild ride .
But what is really scary about a possible Obama administration is Dennis Ross .
Ross claims that he believes in diplomacy and has even written a book on the subject , though his one major foray in that area , Camp David in 2000 , demonstrated that he was more interested in advancing Israeli interests than he was in creating a viable peace with the Palestinians .
He was the architect of so - called " no surprises " negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis in which all positions supported by the U.S. had to be cleared by Israel before they were even placed on the table .
If the Israelis said " no , " the U.S. would back down .
Ross was also one of the most vocal critics of former Democratic President Jimmy Carter after Carter wrote Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid .
Ross has most recently been in the news for his participation on a task force organized by the Washington - based Bipartisan Policy Center , headed by ex-senators George Mitchell , Daniel Coats , and Charles Robb .
In this case , bipartisan most definitely does not mean objective .
The task force included Ross ; Steve Rademaker , husband of Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) ; Michael Rubin , also of AEI ; Kenneth Weinstein of the Hudson Institute ; Kenneth Katzmann of the Congressional Research Service ; as well as two generals , an admiral , two former Defense Department officials who worked for Paul Wolfowitz and Doug Feith , and a Lehman Brothers economist .
Rubin drafted the report assisted by the project director Michael Makovsky , who is the brother of David Makovsky , senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) , a pro-Israeli think - tank that was founded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
No one on the task force was an independent expert on Iran who might have been willing or able to express Iran ’s concerns or point of view .
Indeed , apart from Rubin , no one on the task force knew anything about Iran at all , except possibly that it was part of the axis of evil .
Not surprisingly , the task force ’s report , " Meeting the Challenge : U.S. Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear Development " [. pdf ] , issued in September , concluded that Iran has no right to enrich nuclear fuel for any purpose .
It advocated talking to Tehran to give it a chance to surrender on all key issues before attacking it , urging the next president to build up forces for the assault from day one of the new administration .
The task force recommended that U.S. forces should remain in the area after Iran is bombed into submission , vigilant and ready to react to any possible resurgence by the mullahs .
On Oct. 23 an op - ed appeared in the Washington Post by Coats and Robb that summarized the " bipartisan " conclusions without identifying the members of the task force itself , as many readers would certainly have realized from the names that the report was the latest neocon snow job .
The Washington Post apparently did not care that it was being exploited to promote a bad policy wrapped in a deceptive fog of bipartisanship .
Ross is a commentator for Fox News and the Ziegler distinguished fellow at WINEP , which he helped found in the 1980s .
He is also chairman of the Jerusalem - based Jewish People Policy Planning Institute .
He would only be a spear - carrier in the latest neocon absurdity if it were n’t for the fact that he is a major player in the Obama campaign as Obama ’s top adviser on the Middle East and a key link to AIPAC .
Ross reportedly has been helping the Obama campaign formulate positions that AIPAC would be comfortable with .
It has been reported that Ross has aspirations to become secretary of state , but he lacks the seniority for that position and may instead focus on the Middle East , either at the State Department or the National Security Council .
Ross - watchers believe that if he is put in charge of Middle Eastern policy , he will guarantee that only Israeli security concerns will matter to the new administration , because that is the position he has always taken in the past .
If the bipartisan report is any indication , he will be particularly interested in defanging Iran , a position that he has made clear in speeches to Israeli audiences .
My focus on Dennis Ross and what he represents is not intended to single him out for demonization .
Rather , it is a word of caution to the electorate not to expect too much from Obama if he is elected , as he is surrounded by people who already have agendas .
There are many Dennis Rosses out there , and they are scattered throughout the government bureaucracy , Congress , and the media .
For some of them , Israel is a key issue , but there are many others intent on returning to a Cold War with Russia and thwarting China , starting new quarrels over issues unrelated to the national interest .
Closer to home , Obama and McCain both made a point of disparaging Venezuela in their last debate .
President Hugo Chavez is a despicable clown in many respects , but his country provides much of the oil Americans consume .
Does Washington need to go after him too ?
Looking for new dragons to slay in an unstable world has brought the Bush administration to its knees .
Americans do not need four more years of the same kind of policies from Obama or McCain .
In an attempt to make BitTorrent more secure , and to reduce some of the load on their own tracker , The Pirate Bay has started to remove all duplicate , dead and anti-pirate trackers from the torrents they host .
These changes will improve the trackers ' performance , and increase ' security ' for its users .
Running the largest BitTorrent tracker on the Internet requires a lot of expensive hardware .
To keep this hardware running smoothly , The Pirate Bay is constantly optimizing their setup .
One of the latest changes is that they have started to automatically remove duplicate trackers from torrent files , to keep unnecessary connections between BitTorrent clients and their tracker to a minimum .
Pirate Bay co-founder TiAMO explained to TorrentFreak : “ It ’s totally unnecessary to have more than one of our tracker URLs when they all have the same peers , they just ask the tracker for the same data lots of times . ”
“ Also , now we can strip out all bad trackers from anti-p2 p companies , as well as old ones that stopped working years ago , ” he added .
So , while they were at it , they have also decided to remove dead trackers , and BitTorrent trackers that are run by anti-piracy organizations .
This makes it less likely that the MPAA and RIAA , often though companies like Mediasentry , can keep tabs on the download habits of Pirate Bay users .
Another advantage , of course , is that the number of fake files and spam from companies such as MediaDefender are kept to a minimum .
Fake torrents are often used to trick people into downloading useless data instead of Hollywood ’s latest blockbuster .
The Pirate Bay already had quite a good track record when it comes to removing fakes , and this will only improve with these latest changes .
The Pirate Bay currently has 13 servers dedicated to the tracker , and another 14 servers for the website itself .
Yesterday , the tracker broke a new record , with close to 18 million active users on “ TV - torrent Tuesday “ , and at the current rate , they will be tracking 20 million peers a few weeks from now .
The rich have always felt a vague guilt about being rich , which is what the charity - party circuit is all about .
But it 's incredibly annoying to have them jumping on the cutting back / scrimping n' saving bandwagon even though they do n't have to — these are the people who benefitted so hugely when we were in boom times .
And their children are even worse : listen to Bee Shaffer , daughter of Vogue editrix Anna Wintour 's , fake - whine about how she does n't think she 'll be able to find a media job after graduating from Columbia : " I finish in May , and I 'm really nervous about the fact nobody 's hiring right now , " she told New York mag at the fancy CFDA Fashion Awards , presumably while fluttering her hands and wearing an obscenely expensive designer dress .
Being " responsible " is the new trend !
Of course Thomas Friedman has to chime in via his NYT column , as he does with every trend .
He 's stopped yapping about " going green " and instead :
" So , I have a confession and a suggestion .
The confession : I go into restaurants these days , look around at the tables often still crowded with young people , and I have this urge to go from table to table and say : " You do n't know me , but I have to tell you that you should n't be here .
You should be saving your money .
You should be home eating tuna fish .
This financial crisis is so far from over .
We are just at the end of the beginning .
Please , wrap up that steak in a doggy bag and go home . "
So you 're allowed to be there and we 're not ?
Not even if we 're on a date or treating ourselves to a night out ?
Hey , Friedman : please put your thoughts and ideas in a doggy bag and take them home .
Meanwhile , Womens Wear Daily asked celebs what they 're not ready to go without in these recessionary times .
Sample answers : both Hilary Swank and Rosanna Arquette can't go without facials , Jessica Biel needs " first - class travel , " Amy Smart cannot live without organic foodstuffs , and Kim Raver sagely suggested , " Instead of buying 10 extravagant items , you maybe buy one or two extravagant items and mix it up with the Gap . "
Mind - jarring .
Of course , there was last month 's " recession chic " piece in the Times Styles section to help us out and suggest that buying Hermes purses is now considered tacky .
Remember that " going green " media - trend from a while back ?
This is sort of like that .
It was so comical to watch fashion magazine editors with six - figure salaries pace around their offices in $ 500 dresses freaking out about " doing something green with this issue " when producing a fashion magazine is the most wasteful process ever .
We imagine the same scene is playing itself out in the offices of Hearst , Conde Nast , and Time Inc right this minute , only with the word " recession " replacing " green . "
Same song , different name .
Apple is still hard at work on the next version of Mac OS X 10.5.6 according to published reports on the hmbt.org .
The latest Mac OS X 10.5.6 ( 9G35 ) build appears to focus heavily on testing of MobileMe syncing features for notebook computers in various scenarios .
MobileMe is the online mail , calendar , contact and sync services available to Mac or PC users .
MobileMe 's initial rollout in July was marred by poor performance , downtime and some data loss .
Mac OS X 10.5.6 also incorporates the usual laundry list of big fixes and other tweaks to the 10.5 operating system .
Apple release the last update to Mac OS X in September .
There is no timeframe for 10.5.6's release , but it will be a free update to all Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) customers .
Last night , hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people gathered for a protest outside the Church of Latter Day Saints ' Manhattan Mormon Temple and march down Broadway to Columbus Circle .
The planned and peaceful event shut down many streets , drew many cops to the area as the march winded through streets with spirited chants .
Earlier on Wednesday and not too far from New York City , gay marriage legally began in Connecticut to which one Gothamist commenter asked " Should n't New Yorkers be celebrating what happened in Connecticut today rather than protesting something in a state we have nothing to do with ?
Not only that , but NY itself will likely legalize gay marriage soon . "
Earlier this summer , New York Governor Paterson issued a memo telling all state agencies to recognize legally performed , out - of - state same - sex marriages as valid marriages even though the state does not license or perform said marriages .
The memo was based on a February 2008 Appellate Court ruling that said gay marriages " should be afforded the same recognition as any other legally performed union . "
Update : Towleroad is reporting crowd estimate from 7 -10,000 , contrary to AP reports .

The Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at US President George W Bush has a broken arm and ribs after being struck by Iraqi security agents , his brother told AFP on Tuesday .
Durgham Zaidi was unable to say whether his brother Muntazer had sustained the injuries while being overpowered during Sunday 's protest against Bush 's visit to Baghdad or while in custody later .
He said he had been told that his brother was being held by Iraqi forces in the heavily fortified Green Zone compound , in central Baghdad , where the US embassy and most government offices are housed .
" He has got a broken arm and ribs , and cuts to his eye and arm , " said Durgham .
" He is being held by forces under the command of Muwaffaq al - Rubaie , " Iraq 's national security adviser , he added .
Armistice Day ( 11 November – dedicated by King George V ) is the day in which the nations of the World War I allies remember the brave who died .
It is known as Veterans Day in the United States and Remembrance Day in some countries .
It seems fitting that we should have a list on the topic as our own way to say thank you to the many men and women who gave their lives for the protection of our way of life .
In Flanders Fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses row on row ,
That mark our place ; and in the sky
The larks , still bravely singing , fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below .
We are the Dead .
Short days ago
We lived , felt dawn , saw sunset glow ,
Loved and were loved , and now we lie
In Flanders fields .
Take up our quarrel with the foe :
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch ; be yours to hold it high .
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep , though poppies grow
In Flanders fields .
Motoring giant Toyota is normally ahead of the curve when it comes to technology .
The company is known for innovations like the Synergy Drive in the Prius , as well as long term reliability .
However , if you take pride in your Toyota , and have it as a wallpaper on your system , Toyota does n't want you sharing .
Toyota , one of the biggest car companies in the world , is often a name synonymous with quality .
There is even a philosophy of doing business , called “ The Toyota Way ” , which emphasizes that the right result will come from the right process , and that solving the root problems brings the organization the greatest benefit .
This ‘ Way ’ is probably not communicated to its lawyers in great detail , which is why Desktopnexus , a site that provides desktop backgrounds , has been contacted by them .
In perhaps one of the most wildly arrogant demands in DMCA history , Toyota ’s lawyers are demanding the withdrawal of all wallpapers that feature a Toyota , Scion , or Lexus .
The site ’s owner , Harry Maugans contacted Toyota to clarify .
He was told that all images featuring Toyota vehicles should be removed , even images with copyright belonging to others .
Speaking to TorrentFreak , Maugans said : “ Their lawyer , Garrett Biggs , told us that if we wanted them to specifically identify their images , we would have to pay for them to do so ” .
Maugans also said he was afraid it would come to a lawsuit , fearing the attrition effect that is so common now in copyright disputes .
Toyota , with cash assets of over $ 23 Billion can surely afford to spin out the legal costs in an attempt to bankrupt the site – the same strategy that is often used to ‘ encourage ‘ a settlement in RIAA cases .
Yet , Toyota has also been cagey .
These demands have not been sent in the form of a DMCA notice .
While sending such a notice would require the takedown , it also requires that the person sending the notice legally certify that they are legal representatives for the copyright holders at issue .
Making a false statement is ‘ punishable under penalty of perjury ‘ , which is not taken lightly in US courts .
That copyright holders should be properly identified is also not lost on Mr. Maugans .
“ What if Toyota comes back and says “ yes , we own the copyright to all of those [ Toyota images on site ] ” .
How can we know if they ’re lying to get us to take them all down ?
How can we prove they do in fact own the copyrights on those wallpapers ?
Some are very hard to believe , such as this which looks more like Fan Art than a professionally designed marketing photo .
Or this one which they ’re claiming they own , but it has a “ Created by : ” line at the bottom by someone who does n’t seem to have any connection to the actual Toyota company . ”
The ‘ huh what ? ’ value of Toyota ’s position has been noticed by others as well .
On the FreeCulture News site , one comment questions the action saying “ What are they trying to accomplish by attacking free advertising ? ”
Indeed , this is what it comes down to .
Instead of embracing free advertising and word of mouth , Toyota seems desperate to control and micromanage every aspect of it ’s publicity .
At the end of the day , the best question is that asked by Mr Maugans , “ Has DMCA abuse really gotten this bad ? ”
At the time of press , Toyota Inc. did not respond to requests for comment .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Paraguay 's Defense Ministry reported a second cross - border incursion by the Brazilian troops on Friday .
It was the second similar incident in a week after the Brazilian troops entered Paraguayan district La Paloma with tanks and other armaments , allegedly by mistake , in military exercises on Wednesday .
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo tried to communicate with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to ask for explanations about the troops ' movements , Paraguayan daily ABC Color reported .
Paraguayan Interior Minister Rafael Filizzolla said Friday that what occurred on Wednesday infringed Paraguay 's sovereignty and the events worried and irritated the Paraguayan government .
" The events are acts that do not contribute to the good environment that must be maintained between neighboring countries , especially those who are involved in an integration process , " Filizzolla said .
Brazil has not commented on the military events so far .

Bionic Knee Brace Harvests Energy From Walking
November 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Time Magazine has named the Bionic Energy Harvester , a knee brace that harnesses energy from walking , as one of the Top 50 Inventions of 2008 .
The 3.5 lb brace works by generating power using the same technology that lets hybrid cars harvest energy from braking .
One minute of walking with a single brace generates enough power for half an hour of talking time on a cell phone .
The harvester is capable of generating seven watts of electricity from each leg — enough to operate 14 cell phones .
The brace , developed by researchers at Simon Fraser University , uses the energy put into slowing down the knee joint at the end of a person ’s step .
While commercialization is many years away , the Canadian military plans on testing the device next spring .
Eventually , The Bionic Energy Harvester could be used to power prosthetic limbs , medical devices , and communication devices for rescue workers .
The device is one of a number of recent inventions that aim to harness the energy of everyday activities .

How is it , that this country is saddled with the likes of Princess Pelosi ?
Tens of thousands have lost their jobs and will loose their homes this year , we are being asked to sacrifice while Princess Pelosi lives it up in style .
Hard to believe this dullard is third in line for presidential succession .
Hat tip to Bud Simmons for bringing this warm engaging photo to our attention .
And she has the balls to confront the Big Three CEOs for flying their corporate jets to Washington !
Nancy Pelosi , Democrat from California , current Speaker of the House .
The Pentagon provides the House speaker with an Air Force plane large enough to accommodate her staff , family , supporters , and members of the California delegation when she travels around the country .
But , Pelosi wants routine access to a larger plane .
It includes 42 business class seats , a fully - enclosed state room , an entertainment center , a private bed , state - of - the - art communications system , and a crew of 16 .
Pelosi wanted “ carte blanche for an aircraft any time ” , including weekend trips home to San Francisco .
Pretty nice but very expensive perk !
Her Air Force C - 32 costs approximately $ 15,000 an hour or approximately $ 300,000 per trip home .
Maybe I should giving awards to the political hack with the most chutzpah .
For those in search of a definition of chutzpah see “ balls ” .
Remember how she told us , “ We believe America should work for everyone – not just the privileged few – by building opportunity and prosperity for all and guaranteeing real security . ”
AH , yes . . .
Change we can believe in .
There is time to change course , but not much .
What is needed is a new vision of a just society and the political will to implement it .
Diaspora Jews for whom Israel is a central pillar of their identity must pay heed and speak out .
The opposition does not exist , and the coalition , with Ariel Sharon at its head , claims the right to remain silent .
In a nation of chatterboxes , everyone has suddenly fallen dumb , because there 's nothing left to say .
We live in a thunderously failed reality .
Yes , we have revived the Hebrew language , created a marvellous theatre and a strong national currency .
Our Jewish minds are as sharp as ever .
We are traded on the Nasdaq .
But is this why we created a state ?
The Jewish people did not survive for two millennia in order to pioneer new weaponry , computer security programs or anti-missile missiles .
We were supposed to be a light unto the nations .
In this we have failed .
It turns out that the 2,000 - year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements , run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies .
A state lacking justice cannot survive .
More and more Israelis are coming to understand this as they ask their children where they expect to live in 25 years .
Children who are honest admit , to their parents ' shock , that they do not know .
The countdown to the end of Israeli society has begun .
It is very comfortable to be a Zionist in West Bank settlements such as Beit El and Ofra .
The biblical landscape is charming .
You can gaze through the geraniums and bougainvilleas and not see the occupation .
Travelling on the fast highway that skirts barely a half - mile west of the Palestinian roadblocks , it 's hard to comprehend the humiliating experience of the despised Arab who must creep for hours along the pocked , blockaded roads assigned to him .
One road for the occupier , one road for the occupied .
This can not work .
Even if the Arabs lower their heads and swallow their shame and anger for ever , it wo n't work .
A structure built on human callousness will inevitably collapse in on itself .
Note this moment well : Zionism 's superstructure is already collapsing like a cheap Jerusalem wedding hall .
Only madmen continue dancing on the top floor while the pillars below are collapsing .
We have grown accustomed to ignoring the suffering of the women at the roadblocks .
No wonder we do n't hear the cries of the abused woman living next door or the single mother struggling to support her children in dignity .
We do n't even bother to count the women murdered by their husbands .
Israel , having ceased to care about the children of the Palestinians , should not be surprised when they come washed in hatred and blow themselves up in the centres of Israeli escapism .
They consign themselves to Allah in our places of recreation , because their own lives are torture .
They spill their own blood in our restaurants in order to ruin our appetites , because they have children and parents at home who are hungry and humiliated .
We could kill a thousand ringleaders a day and nothing will be solved , because the leaders come up from below - from the wells of hatred and anger , from the " infrastructures " of injustice and moral corruption .
If all this were inevitable , divinely ordained and immutable , I would be silent .
But things could be different , and so crying out is a moral imperative .
Here is what the prime minister should say to the people : the time for illusions is over .
The time for decisions has arrived .
We love the entire land of our forefathers and in some other time we would have wanted to live here alone .
But that will not happen .
The Arabs , too , have dreams and needs .
Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority .
And so , fellow citizens , it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price .
We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East .
There can not be democracy without equal rights for all who live here , Arab as well as Jew .
We cannot keep the territories and preserve a Jewish majority in the world 's only Jewish state - not by means that are humane and moral and Jewish .
Do you want the greater land of Israel ?
No problem .
Abandon democracy .
Let 's institute an efficient system of racial separation here , with prison camps and detention villages .
Do you want a Jewish majority ?
No problem .
Either put the Arabs on railway cars , buses , camels and donkeys and expel them en masse - or separate ourselves from them absolutely , without tricks and gimmicks .
There is no middle path .
We must remove all the settlements - all of them - and draw an internationally recognised border between the Jewish national home and the Palestinian national home .
The Jewish law of return will apply only within our national home , and their right of return will apply only within the borders of the Palestinian state .
Do you want democracy ?
No problem .
Either abandon the greater land of Israel , to the last settlement and outpost , or give full citizenship and voting rights to everyone , including Arabs .
The result , of course , will be that those who did not want a Palestinian state alongside us will have one in our midst , via the ballot box .
The prime minister should present the choices forthrightly : Jewish racism or democracy .
Settlements , or hope for both peoples .
False visions of barbed wire and suicide bombers , or a recognised international border between two states and a shared capital in Jerusalem .
Why , then , is the opposition so quiet ?
Perhaps because some would like to join the government at any price , even the price of participating in the sickness .
But while they dither , the forces of good lose hope .
Anyone who declines to present a clear - cut position - black or white - is collaborating in the decline .
It is not a matter of Labour versus Likud or right versus left , but of right versus wrong , acceptable versus unacceptable .
The law - abiding versus the lawbreakers .
What 's needed is not a political replacement for the Sharon government but a vision of hope , an alternative to the destruction of Zionism and its values by the deaf , dumb and callous .
Israel 's friends abroad - Jewish and non-Jewish alike , presidents and prime ministers , rabbis and lay people - should choose as well .
They must reach out and help Israel to navigate the road map toward our national destiny as a light unto the nations and a society of peace , justice and equality .

Just trying to to make any sense of the Greta van Susteren interview is beyond my cognitive skill - set , but it does confirm what has been clear for two months : Sarah Palin is seriously out there in a connecting to reality kinda way .
She cannot actually deny anything factually , so she keeps plowing through in her Bush - style post - modern fashion .
Here we go again :
" When I arrived at the convention , there were clothes waiting for me , and clothes being ordered for me and the family , for eight of us .
And ever since then , those clothes , knowing that they did n't belong to me ... we boxed them all up , sent them back to the rightful owners , the Republican National Committee , and that 's the story on the clothes . "
Try and construct some kind of chronology from those sentences and you realize it 's useless .
She lives in her own world , doin ' some things , sayin ' others , leavin ' it for the rest of us to sort it all out .
She 's the kind of person you inch carefully away from if they start talking to you on the bus .
And when she is trapped in an obvious , airtight lie , as she has so many times , she simply declares the subject over :
" It just seems like such an irrelevant issue when you consider what is going on in the world today and how a new administration is being ushered in and people being concerned about the direction of the nation and policies that will be adopted .
Clothes just seem irrelevant . "
It 's not true ; it 's not true ; it 's not true ; it 's irrelevant .
Kinda like Clinton with a few dozen IQ points shaved off the top .

President Bush arrived in South America on Friday for the final scheduled foreign trip of his presidency , hoping to bolster confidence in efforts to rescue the global economy and move forward on North Korean nuclear disarmament .
The 21 member nations of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , whose summit Bush is attending , account for nearly half of all global trade and 55 % of the world ’s gross domestic product , reflecting in part the ascendance of East Asia and China .
Among the organization ’s members are China and Russia .
The Latin American members are Peru , Chile and Mexico .
“ APEC is an important meeting at this time , particularly given the financial situation in the world , ” Bush said in a pre-summit interview with Peru ’s America Television .
Bush is expected to urge support for the consensus that he and other world leaders backed last weekend in Washington .
The leaders of the so - called Group of 20 , composed of major countries with developed or emerging economies , signed off on a blueprint to spur economic growth and resist new trade barriers , while also calling for improved oversight and regulation .

The president “ will be seeking to build on the results ” of the Washington conclave , Dan Price , assistant to Bush for international economic affairs , told reporters en route to Lima .
Most APEC members appear likely to back the Bush administration ’s argument that nations should not turn to protectionism in the midst of economic turmoil .
“ At APEC , we hope the leaders will endorse and support the declaration adopted at the [ Washington ] summit , ” Price said .
The economic news from the United States has grown worse over most of the last week .
The number of unemployment claims soared , the battered auto industry sought a bailout and Wall Street losses mounted before a strong rally Friday .

Dana Perino , the presidential press secretary , did n’t answer directly when asked whether the economy was going in the right direction .
“ We did n’t promise immediate results , ” she said .
Bush is to take part in a number of one - on - one sessions in Peru , including a private meeting held Friday with Chinese President Hu Jintao .
The issue of North Korean nuclear disarmament was expected to come up in discussions with Hu and the leaders of Japan and South Korea .
China hosts the so - called six-nation talks on North Korea ’s nuclear program .
North Korea is seeking economic and diplomatic concessions in exchange for dismantling its nuclear operations .
“ Our primary goal is to get back to the negotiating table in Beijing , ” Dennis Wilder , senior director for East Asia at the National Security Council , told reporters on Air Force One .

The hope , Wilder said , is to have a date set in early December for a meeting on North Korea .
Bush leaves office Jan. 20 , and the North Korean nuclear issue will be a major challenge facing President - elect Barack Obama .
“ What I hope we leave in place for the next administration , and what I think we can , ” Wilder said , “ is a very viable six - party process , a commitment on all parts that this is the way to negotiate the ultimate de-nuclearization of the North Korean peninsula and the normalization of relations in Northeast Asia . ”
It was unclear whether Bush would meet one - on - one with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a time when relations between the former Cold War rivals are again strained .
Russia ’s recent war with Georgia and U.S. plans to install a missile defense system in Eastern Europe are among the controversies that have chilled diplomacy between Moscow and Washington .
Bush , on his ninth trip to Latin America , is also seeking to blunt criticism that his administration is bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan and has ignored the region .
Polls in Latin America indicate that the president is extremely unpopular there .
Advertisement
Bush said in the America Television interview that he had traveled frequently to Latin America to dispel the idea that he was focused only on the Middle East .
In central Lima , protesters held signs calling Bush a war criminal and telling him that he was n’t welcome .
But security was tight and demonstrators could not get near the seaside Marriott hotel where he and his entourage were staying .
Hosting Bush is Peruvian President Alan Garcia , a onetime leftist who is now a dedicated free - trader and one of Washington ’s closest allies in the region .
Peruvian and U.S. officials are hoping to conclude a free - trade agreement before Bush leaves office .

Soldiers and police continued their curfew crackdown last night when they visited three nightclubs in the Thong Lor district of Bangkok to ensure they would be closing well before the curfew to allow party - goers enough time to return home before midnight .
CH3 News Video Report
This follows on from a similar outing by authorities to the RCA district issuing the same orders to bars and clubs who had been closing at midnight thus meaning patrons were out on the streets when curfew time had passed .
It is hoped that the army will announce further relaxing of the curfew in entertainment and tourist areas of the capital ahead of the World Cup .
That will make for some very happy bar and club owners if they do .
America ’s Best Companies wishes to join the rest of the American People in offering our heartfelt congratulations to President - Elect Barack Obama .
We know that there will be challenges ahead , both for the new President and for the nation as a whole .
However , we hope that the divisions that have plagued our nation will heal and that the nation will come together behind our new President to face those challenges as a single nation and a single people .
Tories claim police tried to entrap Shadow Minister with phone calls from Home Office mole
' Snared ' : MP Damian Green was the victim of an entrapment plot , Westminster sources say
The police used a Whitehall whistleblower to try to lure Conservative frontbencher Damian Green into incriminating himself , it was claimed last night .
The Mail on Sunday understands that the Shadow Immigration Minister , who was controversially arrested for allegedly leaking information embarrassing to the Government , may have been the victim of an entrapment plot .
However , the allegations were firmly denied by Scotland Yard last night .
Senior Westminster sources believe that police tried to persuade the alleged whistleblower , Home Office aide Christopher Galley , to call Mr Green .
The civil servant made contact with the MP on more than one occasion , but Mr Green declined to be drawn into conversation .
The sources say they suspect Mr Galley 's calls - made soon after his own arrest 11 days ago - were being secretly monitored by the police in an attempt to gather evidence against Mr Green .
The claims come as The Mail on Sunday reveals shocking details about the affair , including :
• Mr Green was arrested in a car park - in full view of the public - near to his home in Kent .
• Mr Galley was arrested in a 5.50 am dawn raid and is now being accommodated in a Home Office ' safe house ' to prevent him talking to the media .
• It was alleged that police intercepted Mr Green 's mobile phone messages after Mr Galley 's arrest .
The disclosures raise disturbing new questions about the abuse of parliamentary privilege and the creeping growth of surveillance , adding to the existing outrage over Mr Green 's arrest from MPs on all sides and prompting further questions over the conduct of the police , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Speaker Michael Martin .
Mr Galley - a Conservative supporter who stood as a Tory candidate in the 2004 elections for Sunderland Council - was seized at his home in a 5.50 am raid on November 19 .
Shortly afterwards , and , crucially , before Mr Green had been contacted by police , Mr Galley contacted the MP .
The Mail on Sunday has been told that the call may have been an attempt by police to use Mr Galley to extract more information from Mr Green , without the MP being aware of the ploy .
Mr Green declined to get involved in a conversation with Mr Galley , partly through fear that the police were bugging the conversation .
Instead he advised the 26 - year - old aide to obtain legal advice .
Some sources say the police may have attempted to persuade Mr Galley to give evidence against Mr Green .
Senior police sources last night confirmed that Mr Galley had called Mr Green shortly after his arrest , but firmly denied any suggestion that he had been forced to make the call .
It is also believed police may have intercepted the MP 's mobile phone messages without informing him .
Laws governing the police tapping of phones are complex .
Legal experts say officers need the Home Secretary 's permission to intercept live messages - but not if they approach phone companies to check past messages .
A Home Office spokesman said last night : ' As the Home Secretary has made clear , she has had no involvement in any aspect of this investigation . '
Scotland Yard also denied monitoring Mr Green 's messages .
The controversy has raised questions over the conduct of Speaker Michael Martin and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith
If Mr Green 's communications had been intercepted it would be a breach of the so - called Wilson doctrine , named after Prime Minister Harold Wilson , who pledged that MPs ' phones would never be tapped .
Subsequent Prime Ministers , including Gordon Brown , have stated that the doctrine still stands .
The row took another dramatic turn last night with reports that police had claimed privately that they already had enough evidence to charge Mr Green .
Last night , Scotland Yard refused to discuss the case .
An official said : ' This is an ongoing investigation and it would be inappropriate to discuss any details . '
But she added : ' We strongly refute any suggestion that any officer has acted improperly . '
Mr Galley had allegedly given Mr Green secret information about a number of Home Office scandals , many involving illegal immigrants .
Police arrested Mr Green on suspicion he had broken an obscure law which bans the ' procurement ' of Whitehall secrets .
Among documents taken from Mr Green 's home were bank statements , apparently in an attempt to find out if he had paid Mr Galley for information .
The MP denies offering money or any other kind of inducement .
As well as raiding Mr Green 's home and Commons office , police seized his mobile phone and BlackBerry and froze his Commons email account , which was reinstated only yesterday .
The Tories insist Mr Green has done nothing wrong and that he was acting in the public interest to expose Government incompetence and cover-ups .
They have also raised questions about ministerial involvement in the arrests .
A Tory insider said : ' The more we learn about this , the more disturbing it becomes .
The police treatment of Mr Green has been a disgrace and the Government 's fingerprints are all over it . '
Mr Green 's contacts with Mr Galley were approved by his former boss , ex-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis .
Yesterday it emerged that Mr Galley had applied for a job with another Shadow Minister but was turned down .
The Home Office is now paying for Mr Galley to stay in a ' safe house ' .
A spokesman said : ' When it became clear that a large number of journalists would be camped outside his door , he was offered the chance to move somewhere else and accepted the offer . '
Both Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith have insisted that the police acted ' without either ministerial involvement or authorisation ' .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve has released more than 50 questions he said the Government had to answer , including who initiated the original leak inquiry and whether Commons Speaker Michael Martin authorised the raid on Mr Green 's office .
God Is an Asshole Shalom Auslander 's painfully comic memoir deals with the aftermath of a fundamentalist upbringing
Growing up in the orthodox Jewish community of Monsey , New York , Shalom Auslander had a tremendous fear of God instilled in him by his fundamentalist parents .
Foreskin's Lament details his relationship with God , family , and religion , and how his anger forced him to reject all three .
I spoke to Auslander — on Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day of Atonement , no less — about his hilarious and moving memoir , newly issued in paperback .
Sponsored Enter to WIN a free Hapy Kitchen Tour & Swag Bag !
Win a behind - the - scenes tour of our kitchen , see how we make our artisan edibles , and get some swag .
MERCURY : Was it a difficult to write such a brutally honest memoir ?
AUSLANDER : Yeah , and not just because fiction wins all the awards .
Deciding to write a memoir is like deciding you 're going into porn in the literary world .
The thing that pushed me over the edge was finding out my wife was pregnant .
It brought back all this stuff ; it made me have to look at myself and say , " You 're going to be a father and you walk around in terror of God all day long , and maybe we should look at that before the baby gets here . "
I decided I needed to write what that terror was like .
Do you still believe in God ?
I 'm still terrified on the billion - to - one chance that everything they told me was true .
Intellectually no , I do n't — I 'm not an atheist , because I think we ought to have a bit more respect for our ignorance — but if what they told me is right , that we are just pawns of an omniscient douchebag , we might as well just fuck it and have fun now because we 're all going to die and spend eternity with that asshole .
And that just can't possibly make any sense .
Based on the response I 've gotten , a lot of Catholics were taught this , and a lot of Muslims and a lot of Calvinists ; regardless of what nouns you use , the story 's the same and it's a bullshit story that should n't be taught to kids .
Were you surprised the book turned out as funny as it is ?
Honestly , that 's the only way I 've ever found of dealing with these things .
Life is just too serious to be taken seriously sometimes .
The only way I can deal with it is to look at the problems and laugh at them .
That 's Vonnegut 's way through it , and Beckett 's and Kafka 's and Bill Hicks ' way through it ; it seems to be the way I get through it , too .
What kind of world will we live in without Russian billionaires ?
But more importantly how scared for his life was that bank employee to make that call ???
Can you imagine ?
We 'd go into hiding .
Actually , we want to go into hiding after writing this item .
Wealth Bulletin : Deutsche Bank has hit a second Russian businessmen in less than a month with a billion - dollar margin call as some of the country ’s richest men continue to struggle with the double problem of falling share prices and large bank debts .
Alexander Zanadvorov , the owner of Russian supermarket chain Seventh Continent , which is partly owned by US buyout firm TPG , faces having to hand over a 74.8 % holding in the company to Deutsche Bank and Nordea Bank Finland after being served with a $ 1bn ( €786 m ) margin call by the banks .
Seventh Continent shares have lost half their value this year , nearly all of which has come in the last month as the Russian stock markets collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis .
... Several prominent Russian billionaires have faced margin calls in the last two months , including the country ’s richest man Oleg Deripaska , who had to give up a holding in a Canadian autoparts company as well as being forced to borrow from the government to refinance loans collateralised against his holding in aluminium giant RusAl .
F.A.Q .
Are there plans to create a full game out of NOTC ?
We have returned to the world of Cephalopods in other games and will defiitely do so again however there are currently no plans to expand directly on NOTC .
As you can tell from the ' preview ' on the title screen there were plans for an expanded version of NOTC , however we were busy on other game projects at the time .
Since it was released in 2008 the sort of audio heavy storytelling techniques used in it have also become more common .
Will there ever be a Mac / Linux version ?
Unlikely .
As much as we'd like to have it available for all operating systems the older version of GameMaker it was created in does n't easily support porting to Mac or Linux .
I 'm Getting an " XINPUT1_3.dll not found " error /
My gamepad is n't working .
You 'll need to update your copy of Direct X from here .
The game does n't quit when I hit Esc .

Mozilla has announced the availability of Fennec alpha 2 , a new prerelease of the organization 's evolving mobile browser .
This version includes some much - needed performance optimizations that improve the responsiveness of the program .
The Fennec project , which aims to bring the full power of Gecko and Firefox 3 to handheld devices , was first announced last year .
Mozilla 's successful effort to reduce memory consumption during the Firefox 3 development cycle finally made the browser a viable choice for resource - constrained mobile environments .
Mozilla also built an improved JavaScript engine this year called TraceMonkey that has delivered big performance gains .
Despite all of that heavy optimization work , the first Fennec alpha , which was released in October , was very sluggish .
Our tests on the Nokia N810 found it to be promising , but still far from usable .
The situation has improved considerably in the new alpha release , which offers faster loading and scrolling .
" While we focused much of the previous alpha on getting the user experience how we wanted , we 've spent much of the time since focused on improving performance , " wrote Mozilla developer Stuart Parmenter in a blog entry .
" We 've made major strides improving startup performance , panning and zooming performance , and responsiveness while pages are loading . "
Mozilla XUL guru Mark
Finkle also wrote about the new release and published a blog entry that provides insight into some aspects of the underlying implementation and several of the specific optimization techniques that were used to increase the browser 's responsiveness .
Fennec 's main content area is rendered on a canvas element instead of using a conventional browser element .
The content is painted on the canvas with the drawWindow method , a nonstandard function that Mozilla added to its own implementation of the canvas JavaScript API .
Fennec uses the canvas in order to improve panning and zooming performance , but the developers discovered that it incurs a high overhead during display updates .
Finkle explains that they switched to using the drawImage function for updating thumbnails when possible , which is quite a bit faster .
The new version also hooks into the MozAfterPaint event so that canvas regions can be updated conditionally as needed instead of repainting the entire canvas after every change .
In addition to the rendering performance enhancements , Finkle also describes File I/O optimizations that improve startup time .
As Fennec development continues to move forward , the value and significance of having the complete Firefox stack in a mobile environment is becoming increasingly apparent .
Developers have already started creating innovative add - ons for the new browser that increase its functionality in various ways .
For example , the TwitterBar extension allows users to post to Twitter directly from the Fennec address bar .
An early Fennec port of Mozilla 's Weave framework is also underway .
The new version is available for download from the Mozilla web site .
A package is provided for Nokia N810 devices that are running OS2008 .
There is also a XULRunner - based version that can be used to test the browser on desktop computers .
For download links and more details about Fennec alpha 2 , see the official release notes .

The experts dissed John Sergeant .
Ergo , the British public loved him .
Were viewers just making mischief , or has reality TV witnessed an outbreak of genuine civil disobedience ?
He hardly looked capable of inspiring mass insurrection , this portly , unassuming ex-hack shuffling ineptly across the dancefloor .
The judges ' low opinion of Sergeant was not shared by viewers Strictly Come Dancing 's judges certainly had no fear of John Sergeant .
He was n't up to the job , they told him .
He was the " dancing pig in Cuban heels " who should make way for the truly talented contestants .
But it did n't seem to bother the Saturday tea - time viewing public that the former political correspondent 's abysmal dancing made David Brent look like Rudolf Nureyev .
He was their man .
They would carry on voting for him to stay on the show no matter what the judges said .
And when the bashful Sergeant himself bowed out of the contest , howls of protest reverberated in newspaper letters pages and internet messageboards across the nation .
Call it sheer wilfulness , call it a blow against metropolitan elitism .
But defying the professionals and backing the underdog appears to be a peculiarly British expression of mass psychology .
Power to the people Strictly 's ITV rival , The X Factor , witnessed a grass - roots revolt of its own when audiences kept voting for 38 - year - old pool cleaner Daniel Evans over singers favoured by the show 's judging panel .
This was the country , after all , that took useless ski-jumper Eddie " The Eagle " Edwards to its heart .
Sergeant 's partner , Kristina Rihanoff , laboured patiently alongside him
It would be tempting to assume Strictly 's viewers were being deliberately perverse , that they simply enjoyed the wind - up .
One survey of 3,000 voters suggested 41 % of those who backed Sergeant did so purely because they wanted to annoy the judges .
But Dr David Giles , a senior lecturer at the University of Winchester who specialises in the psychology of fame , suspects there was more at stake .
For him , Strictly Come Dancing 's viewers had been growing increasingly sceptical about a format whose credibility had been dented by phone - in scandals .
In Sergeant - an imperfect everyman pitched against glamorous actors , singers and sports stars - they recognised themselves , and took the harsh words directed against him by the judges personally .
" There 's a real sense of empowerment for the audience , " Dr Giles says .
" They 've witnessed a growing culture of malice on television that began with Anne Robinson .
The British do n't like bullying , and they do n't like people who take themselves too seriously
Kevin O'Sullivan , Sunday Mirror
" But now viewers realise they can get one over on these all - powerful judges - they do n't have to just sit back and do what they 're told . "
Kevin O'Sullivan , the Sunday Mirror 's TV columnist , agrees .
He believes viewers were making a very serious point by backing Sergeant .
At the dawn of reality TV , he says , audiences tended to defer to on - screen experts .
But as they grew more familiar with the format , so too did they become more confident about asserting what they wanted .
According to O'Sullivan , backing Sergeant was a way of demonstrating you disagreed with the judges over their heavy - handed criticism of the ex-hack , and their apparent belief that the show should be a serious competition rather than a bit of light - hearted fun .
" What we are seeing now is Britishness in all its glory , " O'Sullivan adds .
Enter our caption competition " The British do n't like bullying .
They do n't like people who take themselves too seriously .
" The judges seem to think this is a proper dancing contest .
The viewing public know better . "
None of which is to say that mischief did n't play a part in Sergeant 's longevity .
Dr Aric Sigman , of the British Psychological Society , believes wilful defiance of one 's social betters is hard - wired into the nation 's psyche .
And this , he argues , is no bad thing .
" Because Britain has traditionally been a much more class - ridden society , people have much less respect for their superiors than somewhere like the United States , " Dr Sigman says .
" It 's all about siding with the underdog .
Sticking two fingers up to authority has a real therapeutic benefit . "
Sergeant might have carried both his left feet off into the wings for good .
But if a different set of experts are right , he has done more for the nation 's wellbeing than his modesty would allow him to admit .

Over the past several weeks , engineers and technicians working at General Motors Corp .'s sprawling proving grounds west of Detroit started noticing a curiosity : an increasing number of wall clocks had the wrong time , or stopped working altogether .
The reason :
As part of a drive to cut $ 15 billion in costs , GM is no longer keeping the 562 clocks in working order , which will eliminate the expense of replacing and disposing of the clock 's batteries and the cost of resetting them twice a year for daylight - saving time .
It 's not the only new measure GM is taking to save every last nickel .
In its Renaissance Center headquarters , employees working late have to climb stairs when navigating its labyrinth of lower floors -- the company now stops the escalators at 7 p.m .
In designated cleanup areas of certain offices , the company has changed the type of wipe - up towels it buys .
In a memo to employees , a staffer explained this will lower GM's " cost per wipe . "
Like GM , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC are slashing costs .
Earlier this month , Ford said it will cut its North American salaried work force by approximately 10 % , and is trimming its capital spending , manufacturing , information - technology and advertising costs .
GM and Chrysler have both halted or slowed work on new vehicles to cut development expenditures .
Neither company held news conferences at the Los Angeles Auto Show last week , a standard function at such shows .
At GM , though , the penny - pinching is visible at the microscopic level , from cheaper pencils to elimination of voice mail in the plants .

The Reactive library implements functional reactive programming ( FRP ) in a data - driven and yet purely functional way , on top of a new primitive I call “ unambiguous choice ” , or unamb .
This primitive has simple functional semantics and a concurrent implementation .
The point is to allow one to try out two different ways to answer the same question , when it ’s not known in advance which one will succeed first , if at all .
This post describes and demonstrates unamb and its implementation .
What ’s unamb ?
The value of a `unamb` b is the more defined of the values a and b .
The operation is subject to a semantic precondition , which is that a and b must be equal unless one or both is bottom .
It ’s this precondition that distinguishes unamb from the ambiguous ( nondeterministic ) choice operator amb .
This precondition also distinguishes unamb from least upper ( information ) bound ( “ lub ” ) .
The two operators agree where both are defined , but lub is much more widely defined than unamb is .
For instance , consider the pairs ( 1 , ⊥ ) and ( ⊥,2 ) .
The first pair has information only about its first element , while the second pair has information only about its second element .
Their lub is ( 1,2 ) .
The triples ( 1, ⊥,3 ) and ( ⊥, 2,3 ) are also consistent and have a lub , namely ( 1,2,3 ) .
Each of these two examples , however , violates unamb ‘s precondition , because in each case the values are unequal and not ⊥ .
In the examples below , I ’ll use “ ⊥ ” in place of “ undefined “ , for brevity .
Parallel or
In spite of its limitation , unamb can do some pretty fun stuff .
For instance , it ’s easy to implement the famous “ parallel or ” operator , which yields true if either argument is true , even if one argument is ⊥ .
por :: Bool -> Bool ->
Bool a `por` b = ( a || b ) `unamb` ( b || a )
This use of unamb satisfies the precondition , because ( || ) is “ nearly commutative ” , i.e. , commutative except when one ordering yields ⊥.
This game is useful with any nearly commutative operation that does n’t always require evaluating both arguments .
The general pattern :
parCommute :: ( a -> a -> b ) -> ( a -> a -> b ) parCommute op x y = ( x `op` y ) `unamb` ( y `op` x )
which can be specialized to parallel or and parallel and :
por :: Bool -> Bool ->
Bool por = parCommute ( || ) pand :: Bool -> Bool ->
Bool pand = parCommute ( && )
Let ’s see if por does the job .
First , here ’s sequential or :
* Data .
Unamb > True || ⊥ True * Data .
Unamb > ⊥ || True *** Exception : Prelude.undefined
Now parallel or :
* Data . Unamb >
True `por` ⊥
True * Data .
Unamb > ⊥ `por` True True
Short - circuiting multiplication
Another example is multiplication optimized for either argument being zero where the other might be expensive .
Just for fun , we ’ll optimize for an argument of one as well .
ptimes :: ( Num a ) => a -> a -> a ptimes = parCommute times where 0 `times` _ = 0 1 `times` b = b a `times` b = a*b
There ’s an important caveat : the type a must be flat .
Otherwise , the precondition of unamb might not hold .
While many Num types are flat , non-flat Num types are also useful , e.g. , derivative towers and functions ( and indeed , any applicative functor ) .
Testing :
* Data . Lub > 0 * ⊥ *** Exception : Prelude.undefined * Data.Lub > ⊥ * 0 *** Exception : Prelude.undefined * Data.Lub > ⊥ `ptimes` 0 0 * Data.Lub > 0 `ptimes` ⊥ 0
Implementation
Let ’s assume we had ambiguous choice
amb :: a -> a ->
IO a
which applies to any two values of the same type , including fully defined , unequal values .
Ambiguous choice nondeterministically chooses one or the other of the values , at its own whim , and may yield different results for the same pair of inputs .
Note that the result of amb is in IO because of its impure semantics .
The resulting IO action might produce either argument , but it will only produce bottom if both arguments are bottom .
Given amb , unambiguous choice is easy to implement :
unamb :: a -> a -> a a `unamb` b = unsafePerformIO ( a `amb` b )
The unsafePerformIO is actually safe in this situation because amb is deterministic when the precondition of unamb satisfied .
The implementation of amb simply evaluates both arguments in parallel and returns whichever one finishes ( reduces to weak head normal form ) first .
The racing happens via a function race , which works on actions :
race :: IO a -> IO a -> IO a amb :: a -> a ->
IO a a `amb` b = evaluate a `race` evaluate b
( The actual definitions of unamb and amb are a bit prettier , for point - free fetishists . )
The race function uses some Concurrent Haskell primitives .
For each action , race forks a thread that executes a given action and writes the result into a shared mvar .
It then waits for the mvar to get written , and then halts the threads .
a `race` b = do v <- newEmptyMVar ta <- fork
Put a v tb <- forkPut b v x <- takeMVar v kill Thread ta kill Thread tb return x forkPut :: IO a -> MVar a ->
IO Thread
Id forkPut act v = forkIO ( act >>= putMVar v ) -- naive version
This implementation of forkPut is a little too simplisitic .
In Haskell , ⊥ does n’t simply block forever ; it raises an exception .
That specific exception must be caught and neutralized .
fork
Put act v = forkIO ( ( act >>= putMVar v) `catch` uhandler ) where uhandler ( ErrorCall " Prelude.undefined " ) = return ( ) uhandler err = throw err
Now when act evaluates ⊥ , the exception is raised , the putMVar is bypassed , and then the exception is silenced .
The result is that the mvar does not get written , so the other thread in race must win .
But , oops — what if the other thread also evaluates ⊥ and skips writing the mvar also ?
In that case , the main thread of race ( which might be spun by another race ) will block forever , waiting on an mvar that has no writer .
This behavior would actually be just fine , since bottom is the correct answer .
However , the GHC run-time system wo n’t stand for it , and cleverly raises an BlockedOnDeadMVar exception .

The airline diet : Couple lose 12st after plane could not take off because they were too heavy
The plane was on the runway ; the holidaymakers in good spirits .
And when the stewardess came down the aisle towards Jan Coupe and her husband , she thought the flight attendant was going to check their seatbelts .
Then came the moment Mrs Coupe wished the earth would open up and she could disappear .
Too heavy : Alan and Jan Coupe weighed too much for their plane to take off
For the stewardess had to tell the couple - who weighed 38st between them - that they were too heavy for the plane to take off .
As his wife cringed with embarrassment , 20st Alan Coupe moved to the front of the aircraft to help even out the weight .
While it was a scene they would n't have wished on their worst enemies , some good has come of it .
The couple , who run a bed and breakfast business , were so shocked they started to diet and have now lost 12 1/2st between them .
Mrs Coupe , 49 , said : ' It was a decent - sized plane full of holidaymakers - it was n't a small plane - so it was devastating to be told that even a big plane like that could n't cope with all our weight being at the back .
' The stewardess asked one of us to get up and move to the front , so Alan volunteered to move which I was thankful about as I was so embarrassed I just could n't look up . '
Slimline :
The couple have now lost over 12st through healthy eating
She added : '
We could n't believe that we were too heavy for the plane to take off . '
The couple married in 1980 and Mrs Coupe said they settled into a routine of eating late at night .
' We ate takeaways at least three times a week , and had our favourite Chinese or pizza , ' she said .
Mrs Coupe , from Stubbington , Hampshire , was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in January 2005 .
In April that year , the couple decided to go on a week 's holiday to Guernsey with son Chris - and that 's when the plane from Southampton could n't take off .
It was n't the first time their weight had caused a problem .
A few years earlier they had been on a boat ride at the London Dungeon with their son and daughter Chloe .
Mrs Coupe said : ' Both Alan and I sat on the same side of the boat and it tipped over , causing water to slosh in .
' The man in charge asked us to move to balance the weight in the boat , and the children were mortified . '
Following the plane ordeal , and also to help with her MS , Mrs Coupe joined a Slimming World club .
She persuaded her husband to attend and in the first week Mrs Coupe lost 8lb and Mr Coupe lost 9lb .
Instead of takeaways at night , the couple had pasta , vegetable curries or steak salads .
Now Mrs Coupe has lost 6st 5lb and her 54 - year - old husband 5st 13lb .
Mrs Coupe , who has also dropped six dress sizes to a 14 , said : ' I do n't feel embarrassed about getting on a plane anymore - we all feel so great we could fly around the world now without a hitch . '
The Pulitzer Prize , the prestigious award for excellence in print journalism , is being expanded to include online - only publications .
Since 2006 the award committee has accepted submissions from stories appearing on the websites of newspapers , like say – The New York Times – but the new guidelines would seemingly open up the prize to online - only outlets like , you know , Mashable ( lol ) .
According to a statement issued today , the basic criteria for qualifying organizations are that they “ publish at least weekly … are primarily dedicated to original news reporting and coverage of ongoing stories … and adhere to the highest journalistic principles . ”
Video , however , is still off - limits .
Somewhat ironically , the news comes on the same day that The Tribune Company , one of America ’s biggest newspaper companies , filed for bankruptcy .

Obama 's Redistribution ' Bombshell '
By Michael Dobbs
Douglas Holtz - Eakin .
" In a previously uncovered interview from September 6 , 2001 , Barack Obama expressed his regret that the Supreme Court had n't been more ' radical ' and described as a ' tragedy ' the Court 's refusal to take up ' the issues of redistribution of wealth . '
No wonder he wants to appoint judges that legislate from the bench . "
-- McCain economics adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin
With just over a week to go until the election , the McCain campaign is stepping up its efforts to portray Barack Obama as a closet " socialist " bent on implementing a major redistribution of wealth in American society .
The Illinois Democrat 's remarks to " Joe the Plumber " on " spreading the wealth around " are Exhibit A in the Son of Karl Marx argument .
Exhibit B is a newly - discovered interview that Obama gave to a Chicago public radio station back in 2001 in which he mentioned the R - word several times in a generally positive context .
Did Obama really say what the McCain camp says he said ?
The Facts
" Obama Bombshell Audio Uncovered .
He wants to Radically Reinterpret the Constitution to Redistribute Wealth ! ! " runs the YouTube headline from the conservative video blog Naked Emperor News .
" This video exposes the radical beneath the rhetoric . "
On closer inspection , the " bombshell audio " turns out to be a rather wonkish , somewhat impenetrable , discussion of the Supreme Court under Earl Warren .
Obama , then a University of Chicago law professor and Illinois state senator , argued that the courts have traditionally been reluctant to get involved in income distribution questions .
He suggested that the civil rights movement had made a mistake in expecting too much from the courts -- and that such issues were better decided by the legislative branch of government .
You can read the entire transcript of the interview here , courtesy of Fox News , but here is the passage in which Obama explains that courts are " not very good " at redistributing wealth :
Maybe I am showing my bias here as a legislator as well as a law professor , but you know I am not optimistic about bringing about major redistributive change through the courts .
You know the institution just is n't structured that way ....
Any of the three of us sitting here could come up with a rationale for bringing about economic change through the courts .
I think that , as a practical matter , that our institutions are just poorly equipped to do it .
In other words , Obama says pretty much the opposite of what the McCain camp says he said .
Contrary to the spin put on his remarks by McCain economics adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin , he does not express " regret " that the Supreme Court has not been more " radical . "
Nor does he describe the Court 's refusal to take up economic redistribution questions as a " tragedy . "
He uses the word " tragedy " to refer not to the Supreme Court , but to the civil rights movement :
One of the tragedies of the civil rights movement was that the civil rights movement became so court focused , I think , there was a tendency to lose track of the political and organizing activities on the ground that are able to bring about the coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change .
Holtz - Eakin " read a different interview to the one I heard , " said Dennis Hutchinson , a University of Chicago law professor who joined Obama in the panel discussion .
" Obama said that redistribution of wealth issues need to be decided by legislatures , not by the courts .
That is what a progressive income tax is all about . "
While there are sharp differences between the two candidates on economic issues , they both favor a progressive income tax system in which people with high incomes are taxed at a higher rate than people with low incomes .
The Pinocchio Test
With very few exceptions , all American politicians , including both presidential candidates , are in favor of a progressive income tax system and welfare policies ( such as Medicare and Social Security ) that " redistribute wealth . "
Barack Obama is more enthusiastic about " spreading the wealth around " than his Republican rival .
But that does not make him a " Socialist . "
The McCain camp is wrong to suggest that the Illinois senator advocated an " wealth redistribution " role for the Supreme Court in his 2001 interview .

Plenty of viewers are writing in to ask about the billions of pounds being " pumped " or " injected " into the banking system or given to banks to improve " liquidity " or generally being transferred to them to tide them over .
And what most of you would like to know is : " Where has all the money gone ? "
The problem is that while bankers , economists and Treasury Mandarins tend to be very precise about where numbers are entered into their ledgers , they can be rather sloppy about language .
Often when they say that a bank has been " given " funds , they actually mean " lent " , or simply that they have been allowed to swap one sort of asset for another .
Take the recent statement from the Treasury that " At least £ 200 billion will be made available to banks under the Special Liquidity Scheme " .
It sounds like a handout from the taxpayer , but it 's not .
It 's all in the assets Banks have assets , such as mortgages on our homes , which they can't use .
They 're desperate to raise cash to fund their day - to - day operations or lend out to people and businesses who need it .
But other banks and investors wo n't advance funds on the strength of these assets .
In today 's climate of suspicion , they assume any asset is dodgy , unless they see proof to the contrary , even if it 's a mortgage earning juicy interest from a homeowner .
So the government has come up with the Special Liquidity Scheme .
The Bank of England swaps cash or IOUs , which are as good as cash , in exchange for the banks most secure mortgages , or other top quality assets .
It 's done on the assumption that everything gets paid back , often in a matter of days .
In fact , the Bank of England , and hence the taxpayer , earns a fee for providing the service .
The big shares gamble Brown and Darling to the rescue Another figure bandied about is a sum of up to £ 50bn which is being used to buy shares in banks for the taxpayer .
Will we see this money again ?
Let 's hope so .
The shares ( some of them are preference shares - no time to explain that here ) will be worth nothing if the banks go bust or never make any money .
That 's the downside .
On the other hand , the PM and the Chancellor have already committed themselves to defending our major banks .
If they are successful , the value of the shares might rise and they could be sold , eventually , for a profit .
People who bought shares in the banks previously have to lump it .
They still own a proportion of RBS or Lloyds - but their cut is now much smaller .
The idea behind the share - buying scheme is to load the banks ' coffers with loot .
Every bank has to have a certain amount of money of its own stashed away before it is allowed to take deposits or lend .
It 's a bank 's capital , its stake in the game .
The government wants our banks to have so much capital that they can stand a financial eruption of Pompeian proportions .
The back - up billions
Which brings us to the most staggering sum of all , the £ 250 bn we are supposed to be " dishing out " to encourage banks to lend to each other for a bit longer , up to three years .
Add this £ 250bn to the previous £ 50bn and the £ 200bn in the Special Liquidity Scheme and see where some journalists get the apocalyptic figure of £ 500bn which is being doled out to banks to stop them from going bust .
But the £ 250bn is money which banks will borrow from each other , helped by a guarantee from the taxpayer that everyone will get paid back .
It 's like parents guaranteeing a son or daughter 's mortgage .
the £ 250 bn covers guarantees which might be made available and the £ 200bn is taxpayers ' money swapped for bank assets .
Only the £ 50bn ( or £ 37bn so far ) is actually being spent
With any luck the state will not be called on to honour the guarantee .
It 's there to oil the wheels .
And there 's another fee for the taxpayer .
So the £ 250 bn covers guarantees which might be made available and the £ 200bn is taxpayers ' money swapped for bank assets .
Only the £ 50bn ( or £ 37bn so far ) is actually being spent - and the Chancellor can wave his bank share certificates in the air to try to persuade us that this money has n't been wasted .
Of course , some of these billions could still be lost .
But Mr Darling is selling the package as a win - win for the rest of us .
Why the banks can't use their own profits Meanwhile , some viewers are asking what has happened to all the profits our banks have been racking up in recent years .
Why can't they use them to buy their way out of trouble ?
There 's that £ 1bn a year , for instance , that they are supposed to have been making from charging penalties to customers who went unexpectedly into the red .
Where has all that cash gone ?
Well , some went in dividends , some has been lost because they took on swathes of American mortgages which are now in default .
But those losses on their own would n't be enough to topple institutions such as RBS , Lloyds or HBOS .
It is the sudden loss of confidence in banks across the world which has left them exposed .
Crisis of confidence Last year 's run on Northern Rock After the collapse of the US investment bank , Lehman Brothers , in September , bankers started putting down the phone on each other .
They would n't lend to other banks and they took out any deposits they could get their hands on .
Last year High Street customers started a run on Northern Rock .
This year , bankers and investors started runs on any banking institution which looked weak .
On top of that , banking became an impossible job , even for banks which seemed solid .
They source much of their funding from depositors who can ask for their money back at short notice .
But they lend the funds out for longer terms , often of several years .
Once deposits start flying out the door , it becomes impossible to cover all those longer term loans .
A bank can start to look shaky .
In a matter of months our most venerable banks have been made to look like basket cases , because confidence in their financial strength has evaporated .
In fact , a lot of the money is still there .
It 's just not moving .

Health reporter , BBC News
Shehnaz knew her body was warning her Ovarian cancer is often referred to as a " silent killer " as women are generally unaware they have it until it has spread .
But health experts have warned that if women pay attention to their symptoms their chances of survival could be dramatically improved .
Survival rates are poor , with only 30 % of those diagnosed surviving for more than five years .
However identifying the disease before it has spread can mean nine in 10 women make the five - year mark .
" The symptoms shout out at you , but you have to listen to your body and act , " said 52 - year - old Shehnaz Khan , from Middlesex .
She first found out she had ovarian cancer 20 years ago after suffering for some time with constant dull aching abdominal pain and frequent tiredness .
Initially Ms Khan , an actress at the time , put the problems down to work stress , but doctors diagnosed ovarian cancer .
It is the type of cancer that can get any woman
Shehnaz Khan
She was told it had spread and had to have radical surgery , including a hysterectomy .
" In some ways I wish I had known what the symptoms were so that I could have acted sooner , but then I have been extremely fortunate that the treatment I received at the time has given me a long life and I am able to talk about it now and share my experience , " she said .
" For me the biggest shock was that I was going to lose my fertility and my chance to have children biologically .
" I had never heard of ovarian cancer before . "
Following her treatment , Ms Khan , now a designer , redoubled her efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle , eating carefully and exercising .
In 2006 , however , she started getting constant diarrhoea and feeling tired , she had period - type pain and started losing weight .
THE SYMPTOMS
Persistent pelvic / abdominal pain Persistent bloating Difficulty eating Feeling full quickly Initially , she suspected her high fibre diet was the cause .
But when the problem persisted and she started feeling faint , she went to her GP who advised a blood test called a CA125 to check for ovarian cancer .
This showed there were problems so she had further tests , which confirmed the disease had returned .
She said : " The tests said I had a big mass growing in the pelvic area and that it was ovarian cancer , which was hard for me to understand as I had no ovaries , but they said a cell must have remained and continued to grow and over the period had grown into this mass . "
She also had two small lesions in the upper abdomen .
Following chemo the tumour began to shrink and the lesions calcified , but she is now undergoing more treatment after they increased again .
Survival rates for Ovarian cancer are poor Ms Khan said she would probably need regular chemo as the tumours were unlikely to completely disappear .
" But the prognosis is that the treatments will help to kick back that tumour again and start to reduce it and bring back my quality of life , " she said .
" I think the shocking thing as regards survival rates is that there have not been any changes in 20 years and that is so frightening .
" If you can catch it early you can get help and treatment .
" It is the type of cancer that can get any woman and because you can't see it or feel it is hard .
" You have to rely on listening to your body . "
The Department of Health and cancer charity Ovarian Cancer Action ( OCA ) have issued the key symptoms to be aware of - persistent pain , persistent bloating , difficulty eating and feeling full quickly .
Peter Reynolds , of OCA , said : " We think awareness is really low .
" It was traditionally seen as a ' silent killer ' , but some women have the symptoms for a year before their cancer is diagnosed .
" It is important to say that if women have these symptoms they are unlikely to be ovarian cancer , but they should get them checked out .
' Hardly improved '
" Survival rates for ovarian cancer in this country have hardly improved for the last 20 to 30 years and the mortality rates are shockingly high . "
OCA has recently doubled the funding it gives to the Ovarian Cancer Action Research Centre , based at Hammersmith Hospital in London .
The centre 's researchers have been working to discover why the cancer quickly becomes resistant to chemotherapy and the role of ovarian cancer stem cells in the process .
Professor Hani Gabra , director of research , said they were developing new drugs and would soon be starting clinical trials .
" We are developing drugs that can re-sensitise the cancer again so it will respond again to chemotherapy , " he said .
" It probably would build up another resistance .
" But we are looking at ways of keeping people alive and improving their quality of life . "

The long campaign is over .
And so a new one begins : the race to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California .
A crop of would - be candidates is already preparing -- some openly , others behind the scenes -- with two years until the state ’s next big election .
One , Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , is a rancher ; at least one , former EBay chief Meg Whitman , is a billionaire ; a third , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , is known across the nation as a champion of same - sex marriage .
Several have run and lost for governor before , and one , Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , has been governor already .
Only one thing seems certain :
The next governor of California will not be a movie star .
Advertisement
Barring a dramatic turnaround , he or she will inherit the same challenge that Schwarzenegger , a Republican , vowed to conquer in the recall election of 2003 : controlling a state budget that is perennially off - kilter , reining in borrowing and managing the pull - and - push of taxes and spending .
“ Have we made any progress at all in five or six years ? ” asked Steve Poizner , the state ’s Republican insurance commissioner , sitting outside a Borders bookstore in his hometown of Los Gatos late last month .
“ No !
I mean , I ca n’t believe we ’re back to the same place we were . . . with massive budget deficits , and now we have a declining economy and jobs are leaving at an even more rapid clip . ”
The wild card is Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , 75 , widely considered to be the state ’s most prominent Democrat , who friends say is debating whether to enter the race or remain an influential figure in Washington .
She would vault to the head of the field , analysts say , but may be reluctant to leave the Senate with her party newly dominant in favor of a campaign to run a deficit - plagued state and deal with a polarized Legislature .
“ The question she will have to resolve for herself is whether she wants to give that very powerful , very important job up , ” said Darry Sragow , a Democratic strategist in Los Angeles .

Feinstein , who declined to be interviewed , indicated her interest to the state ’s political class by dipping a toe into state issues this fall .
Along with Whitman and Brown , she helped defeat Proposition 5 , which would have diverted drug offenders from prison into treatment .
She campaigned unsuccessfully against Proposition 8 , the initiative to outlaw same - sex marriage .
But it is Newsom , her fellow San Franciscan and Democrat , who could be most hampered in more conservative parts of the state by his close identification with the losing side of that initiative .
“ It characterizes him as a San Francisco liberal , ” said Allan Hoffenblum , a Republican political strategist .
Newsom , 41 , youthful and dynamic , helped trigger the debate over same - sex marriage in 2004 when he authorized marriage licenses for homosexual couples .
He presided over gay and lesbian weddings and gave the speech that became notorious when backers of Proposition 8 ran a TV ad with a video of a wild - eyed Newsom crowing that there would be gay marriages “ whether you like it or not . ”

Speaking to reporters on the day after the election , Newsom said he was not concerned about the issue ’s potential effect on his career .
“ It ’s trivial and irrelevant , ” the mayor said .
“ It was never about me .
It ’s not about politicians .
This is about people .
It ’s about real human beings . ”
Larry Gerston , a professor of political science at San Jose State University , agreed that video of Newsom ’s “ Howard Dean moment ” could hurt him in a general election , but he said the mayor ’s same - sex marriage stand might boost him in a Democratic primary .
“ It could even be a badge of honor , ” Gerston said .

So far , Poizner , Newsom , Garamendi and former Republican congressman Tom Campbell have formed exploratory committees to raise money for the race .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , 55 , has not ruled out a run , but he must first win back his current job in March .
“ All his energy is focused on running for reelection , ” said Villaraigosa consultant Ace Smith .
Former California Controller Steve Westly , 52 , who lost a Democratic primary in the 2006 governor ’s race , co-chaired President - elect Barack Obama ’s California campaign this year and worked with Schwarzenegger on Proposition 11 , to overhaul the way legislative districts are drawn .
He said he ’d decide whether to run again after the first of the year .
On the Republican side , while party primary voters are generally conservative , the potential candidates so far are largely moderate .
Whitman , who lives in Atherton , registered as Republican only a year ago , previously listing herself as “ decline to state . ”
Advertisement
Whitman , 52 , has been researching state issues ; she hired a Sacramento public relations team and retained Steve Schmidt , the Republican political strategist who ran Sen .
John McCain ’s presidential campaign and managed Schwarzenegger ’s reelection bid in 2006 .
Although she has never held office , with a net worth between $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.7 billion , Whitman could finance her own campaign .
Poizner , 51 , a wealthy former Silicon Valley entrepreneur , says he is “ pro-choice ” but would like to reduce the number of abortions and opposes same - sex marriage .
He takes a hard line against tax increases , which may appeal to party conservatives displeased with Schwarzenegger ’s embrace of them .
Poizner said Schwarzenegger had “ gotten the reform movement started , ” but added , “ There ’s a lot of work to be done . ”
Campbell , 56 , spent 10 years in Congress , was briefly Schwarzenegger ’s finance director and has taught at Stanford University and UC Berkeley .
He praised the governor for being “ not a partisan man , ” and said his priority would be creating new jobs and educating young people .
Advertisement
“ I am concerned that the next generation of Californians may not be trained adequately , ” he said .
For Democrats , the question is :
Who may be liberal enough to prevail in a primary , yet moderate enough to win a general election ?
Digging into an omelet at a Denny ’s in Stockton , near his home in Walnut Grove , Garamendi , 63 , said he can win votes in California ’s “ red zones ” in his third bid for the post since 1982 , even though he is a Democrat .
He says he has built a deep knowledge of the state as lieutenant governor , insurance commissioner and lawmaker .
“ Climate change , environment , energy policy and healthcare , ” said Garamendi , who owns a cattle ranch in Calaveras County .
“ I ’ve worked on these issues for 30 years . ”
Brown -- who has been telling associates he wants his old job back -- is viewed as formidable by virtue of his family ’s political dynasty ( as the son of Gov. Pat Brown ) , his tenure as a colorful two - term governor from 1975 through 1982 , three attempts to win the presidency and a political resurrection as Oakland mayor a decade ago .

Asked last month which Democrat had the best odds , Schwarzenegger went with Brown , speculating that Feinstein would stay in Washington .
“ He has been governor twice before in California , and he has worked his way back up again , ” the governor told a magazine publisher ’s group in San Francisco .
“ And he kind of can reach the Republicans and Democrats and bring different people together . ”
Poizner “ has also a good shot , ” Schwarzenegger said .
Brown said it was “ very premature ” to make a decision about running , but he acknowledged that he had picked up the pace of his fundraising .
Advertisement
“ Certainly it ’s something I ’m giving a lot of thought to , ” he said .
In an interview , Brown showed a keen interest in the fundraising of his rivals , and cited the nearly $ 3 million in his own campaign account .
“ Does Garamendi have a governor ’s account ? ” he asked .
“ There ’s not much activity there , is there ?. . . .
You notice Newsom has raised a little bit of money . ”
Brown cited the state prison crisis , charter schools and energy as key issues now .
He said California had been at the forefront of renewable energy during his governorship , but since then conflicts between public and private utilities and a lack of transmission lines have impeded progress .
“ I think a big opportunity is to promote alternative energy , ” Brown said .
“ The Silicon Valley has been investing billions . ”

Describing himself as “ a student ” of California , Brown said he had gained new insight from his previous tenure after a quarter - century of thought :
“ I can see the unintended consequences of all these 10,000 laws that a governor puts in over the course of eight years . ”

Times staff writer Richard C. Paddock contributed to this report .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday extending billions of dollars in tax credits for the solar , wind and biodiesel industries , ending months of uncertainty for renewable energy companies .

The House voted 263 to 171 in favor of the tax breaks Friday as a part of the $ 700 billion bailout package for Wall Street .
This package was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate earlier this week .
President George W. Bush will now sign the measure into law .
Legislation to extend the renewable energy tax credits , which were set to expire at the end of the year , had been stalled by a dispute between the House and the Senate over how to pay for the tax breaks .
However , attaching the energy tax credits to the economic rescue package gave them new life .
The legislation extends for one year the production tax credit for wind energy , with an eight - year extension for investment tax credits for businesses and homeowners to install solar energy equipment .
Buyers of plug - in electric cars would receive tax credits ranging from $ 2,500 to $ 7,500 .
The bill also extends a $ 1 per gallon production tax credit for biodiesel through 2009 .
This measure closes a “ splash and dash ” loophole where companies mixed foreign biofuels with U.S. biodiesel to receive the U.S. subsidy , but then sold the fuel at a discount to European markets .
Renewable energy companies praised the House vote .
John Berger , chief executive officer of Texas - based Standard Renewable Industry , said the extensions of the tax credits will be a boon for the solar industry .
“ We are at a critical time period in the solar industry in the country and around the world .
We are just starting to see some economies of scale , some prices decreasing in the solar panels , ” Berger told Reuters .
“ Having the 8 - year extension will absolutely cement in place getting solar to be part of conventional energy . ”
The news of including the tax credits in the bailout package did push shares of solar energy companies up sharply this week .
The Solar Energy Industries Association said the tax package provides the solar companies with “ policy certainty ” and said the package is “ the most significant federal policy ever enacted for the solar industry . ”
The American Wind Energy Association said “ these tax credits are essential to the continued growth of wind energy , to the economic and energy security of the United States and to a successful beginning in the fight against global warming . ”
Energy efficiency groups also applauded the bill ’s approval .
“ It would have been unthinkable for the Congress to leave town for the elections having approved this massive rescue plan while ignoring the needs of beleaguered American consumers on Main Street who face spiraling energy costs , ” said Brad Penney , director of government relations for the Alliance to Save Energy .
Environmentalists have criticized the package , however , for extending tax credits for refineries that process oil from shale or tar sands .
In addition to the energy tax breaks , the Senate bill included tax incentives for other businesses and a one - year fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax so millions of Americans will not be subject to higher income taxes .

Back in October , Marcy Stirman wrote a letter to the editor that ran in a Tuesday ’s edition of the Alamogordo Daily News .
In the letter that was entitled , ” Why I ’m a Republican ” and listed 16 reasons for her party affiliation .
The list ends with Stirman saying Obama is ” a Muslim socialist . ”
She also wrote , ” I believe war is a fact of life and we should always win . ”
She also wrote in this letter that , ” I believe Muslims are our enemies . ”
The chairwoman of an Otero County Republican women ’s group defended the letter that she sent .
That did n’t sit well with the rest of the board of Republican Women of Otero County .
The head of the Republican Women of Otero County refused to resign after calling Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama a “ Muslim socialist . ”
Otero County GOP chairwoman Sassy Tinling says that when Marcia Stirman refused to quit , the rest of the board of the Republican Women ’s group gave Stirman their resignations .
Tinling also says the county GOP executive committee disassociated itself from the GOP women ’s group .
The New Mexico Republican Party says Stirman does n’t speak for them and her comments do n’t reflect GOP values and beliefs .
I find this very heartening to hear .
Marcia should step down and resign after making such dreadful comments .
But it does n’t seem she has the good grace to be ashamed .
Another violent incident between settlers and Palestinian olive pickers :
Residents of the West Bank village of Kadum claimed to have been attacked by residents of the Kedumim settlement as they arrived at their olive grove Sunday morning .
According to the Palestinians , some 10 settlers assaulted them with stones .
An IDF force dispatched to the area removed the olive pickers .
Saturday 's Incident Sources in Hebron : Settlers attacked Palestinians harvesting olives Ali Waked Report says Jewish residents of West Bank city hurled stones at Palestinians and left - wing activists in Tel Rumeida neighborhood .
Police : Palestinians were picking olives without authorization Sources in Hebron : Settlers attacked Palestinians harvesting olives
" They only want to evacuate us from the area claiming that we did not coordinate our arrival with them .
We have no plan to evacuate and will continue to harvest our olives , " he said .
Asked why the harvest was not coordinated with the IDF , Shatiwi replied , " They drive us crazy until they give us approval .
We have not been given approval till now since the beginning of the season , and judging from last year 's experience , their coordination is given for a much later date when it already rains and the olives are damaged . "
Kafr Kadum residents said that last year the approval was given after the harvest season had already ended , and when the olive pickers arrived at the grove they discovered that the olives had been stolen from the trees , allegedly by settlers .
Shatiwi said that he had discovered that olives belonging to him , his neighbors and his relatives were stolen from another part of the village , near the outpost of Shvut Ami .
" We discovered that the ladders were use for the harvest , the sheets we use to collect the olives and sacks of olives , were all stolen by the settlers .
Instead of investigating this , they are only busy trying to evacuate us . "

Residents of Kafr Kadum and the surrounding area said that the officer responsible for granting the approvals for the olive picking has taken a holiday vacation and will only return after Simchat Torah
" The farmers cannot wait until the honorable officer returns from the holidays .
The olives on the trees do not understand that there is a holiday break .
The settlers are also taking advantage of the fact that we are not allowed to enter and are celebrating with our olives , " one of the farmers told Ynet .
The Judea and Samaria police said in response that Palestinians had filed a complaint with the Kadum station , claiming that their ladders , sheets and harvest equipment were stolen .
An investigation has been launched into the case .
An IDF source told Ynet that " this is an area of conflict with the settlers , and therefore the Palestinians are asked to coordinate the harvest in advance . "
The official added that the army and the Palestinians have coordinated an olive harvest for next week .

If you ’ve watched tv recently and played the Monkey Island series in the past , you may know exactly where I am about to go : Lechuck ’s theme .
Yes , the new commercial put out by Kohls sounds note for note like Lechuck ’s theme … with the added Christmas tone of sleigh bells in the background of course .
Watching the commercial a few times over on youtube , there ’s no way that the composer of the commercial simply hit on the melody by chance .
The intro of the song is note for note with the blaring brass of Lechuck ’s theme , and as the song continues it still fits comfortably in with the game music .
This brings up the question of why .
Did the composer for Kohl ’s have some motivation to do this act ?
Did he or she have a short deadline and had nowhere to turn to , or was it a brilliant homage to a well loved adventure game series ?
Even more possible : did the composer hope that the classic adventure game demographic was so small that few would actually catch on to the theme being used ?
If the sole intention of the composer was a time limit or lack of inspiration , then he / she chose one hell of a theme to * pirate * .
All puns aside , Lechuck ’s theme is incredibly ominous and evil and it ’s supposed to entice people to buy bright red and white objects ?
I guess in that aspect , Kohl ’s was n’t really interested so much in the music , and their thinking did not stretch past , “ gotta have more sleigh bell ” .
If this song was a nod in the direction of adventure game fans , then I can say I ’m thrilled – but , I would n’t shop at Kohl ’s anyway …
I , of course , ca n’t speak for everyone else who experienced the same joy or anger at hearing the theme on tv , so it could be a brilliant ploy .
If the composer did not want to get caught stealing , well it ’s not in the news * yet * .
Even still , I do n’t really think Michael Land is going to be incensed enough to pursue Kohl ’s – if he even learns of it , anyway .
So to the composer , wherever you are .
I take my hat off to you - whatever your intention may be – because you committed an act of piracy , introduced the world to Monkey Island , and turned Lechuck ’s theme into a sleigh ride of doom .
Rock On .

Stocks plunged Thursday as anxiety about the economy and the government 's wheel - spinning on the auto bailout and TARP plagued the market throughout the day , culminating in a massive final - hour selloff that saw major indexes crash through resistance levels .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 444.99 , or 5.6 percent , to 7552.29 , its lowest close since March 2003 .
The Nasdaqlost 5.1 percent to close at 1316.12 , also a six - year low .
The S&P 500 index was the hardest hit , falling 6.7 percent to 752.44 , its lowest close since 1997 .
Trading volumes were heavy , with about 2.23 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange .
The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market , shot back above 80 .
" We 've created — I can't believe it — the TARP crisis # 2 .
I thought we'd have learned our lesson after TARP crisis # 1 , " said Jim Paulsen , a strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis .
" Two weeks ago , the leadership took on a fear - mongering campaign to sell the TARP ...
The next leg started almost the minute the Treasury Secretary said , ' We 're not going to do this TARP thing . ' "
And , Paulsen said , once major indexes got close to their dot - com bust lows , there was an almost gravitational pull to test those levels .
" We got close enough [ to the lows ] here ... and it was just like , how could you not just try this sucker on ? "
Paulsen said .
Stocks had attempted a rally following a report that a compromise has been reached on an auto bailout .
But Democrats rejected the quick - fix plan and the market retreated .
Comments by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the government should n't be too hasty , offered the market no comfort .
Today 's decline followed Wednesday 's crushing selloffthat saw the Dow close below 8,000 for the first time in more than five years .
In those two days , the Dow has lost about 872 points , the biggest two - day point drop since Nov. 6 , and the third - biggest point drop of all time .
The S&P 500 is now more than 52 percent below its October 2007 record high , making the current bear market the second biggest on record .
The current decline is exceeded only by the 83 percent drop between 1930 and 1932 , according to the Stock Trader 's Almanac .
The declines have been so bad that now more than 100 stocks in the S&P 500 are below $ 10 .
Citigroup stock dropped another 26 percent , ending at $ 4.71 a share , a nearly 16 - year low .
Earlier , the stock had gotten a little bounce following news that Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud had raised his stake in the company to 5 percent .
However , the stock resumed its descent after investors figured out that the prince 's investment was likely just dollar - cost averaging .
From ' Fast Money ' :
More worrisome , however , is the stock 's flirtation with the $ 5 mark .
Most institutional investors and pension funds are barred from owning stocks below $ 5 .
So if Citigroup 's stock holds below that level , it could trigger a wave of selling .
" We 're back at the same dynamics pre-TARP , when , a stock slipped below $ 10 and it was sent into a death spiral — no matter whether it had a good or bad balance sheet , " Paulsen said .
" As soon as you took out the TARP again , Citi went on a death spiral , " he said .
" We keep creating more and more collateral damage . "
JPMorgan shares fell 18 percent after the firm announced plans to cut about 10 percent of its investment - banking staff .
General Motors and Ford ended up 3.2 percent and 10 percent , respectively , even as the Big Three auto makers ' request for a bailout this week was rejected on Capitol Hill .
Earlier , the stocks had rocketed more than 40 percent after the Detroit Free Press reported that key senators had reached a compromise on the $ 25 billion bailout , but the gains began to evaporate after Democratic leaders rejected this quick - fix plan , saying auto makers needed to come up with a plan before they received any money .
A deadline of Dec. 2 was set for auto makers to submit their plans ; Congress will reconvene the week of Dec. 8 .
Meanwhile , GMAC , the money - losing partnership between GMand Cerebrus Capital Management , announced that it has applied to become a bank - holding company .
Chrysler hopes to restart merger talks with GMif the government comes up with a bailout package for auto makers , the Financial Times reported Thursday .
Economic data came in worse than expected : The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported its gauge of regional manufacturing activity contracted further , to minus - 39.3 in November from minus - 37.5 in October .
Nationwide , leading indicators dropped 0.8 percent in October , after a downwardly - revised 0.1 - percent gain in September .
Economists had expected a reading of 35 on the Philly Fed and minus - 0.6 percent in leading indicators .
Jobless claims rose by 27,000to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 last week , well above the 508,000 economists had expected and the highest since July 1992 .
Continuing claims rose by 109,000 to 4.01 million .
Boeing shares fell 1 percent after the aerospace giant announced plans to cut about 800 jobs , or one - quarter of the staff , from its defense unit operations in Wichita , Kansas .
Oil ended below $ 50 a barrel , hitting its lowest level since May 2005 , leaving a string of energy - stock carnage in its wake .
ExxonMobil dropped 6.7 percent , while Chevron lost 8.8 percent and Valero Energy shed 15 percent .
However , oil 's break through the key $ 50 level offered some economists a sliver of hope .
Today 's economic data show that “ the decline in the economy is still accelerating .
We ’re still in freefall right now in terms of this quarter , " Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group , told CNBC .
But , at some point , he said , the rapid decline in oil is going to have a stimulative effect .
" It 's a billion dollars for every penny that gasoline goes down .
We 're talking $ 150 to $ 200 billion dollars compared to last summer consumers are not going to be pumping into their tanks , " Hoffman said .
" Right now , admittedly , in this freefall , it ’s not offsetting the loss of confidence but you gain some confidence , you see that drop in oil and other commodity prices , corporate profits , consumer spending — I think that ’s a little bit of a silver lining in what is admittedly a pretty dark sky . "
General Electric skidded 11 percent after the conglomerate , the parent of CNBC , said it has no plans to raise capital from sovereign - wealth funds .
PepsiCo slipped 3.5 percent after the beverage giant reiterated its full - year outlook .
The Federal Reserve pared its outlook for economic growth through 2009 leading market watchers to expect further cuts to the base interest rate .
It also added to the growing fear of a deflationary spiral taking hold of the economy .

A Sharper View of a Hazy Giant
Credit : ESO , F. Marchis , M.Wong ( UC Berkeley ) ; E.Marchetti , P.Amico , S.Tordo ( ESO )
Explanation :
This dramatic image of Jupiter is touted as the sharpest picture of the entire gas giant ever taken from the ground .
The picture was made using a prototype instrument known as MAD ( Multi- conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator ) mounted on one of the European Southern Observatory 's 8 - meter diameter Very Large Telescope units in Chile .
Working at infrared wavelengths the MAD instrument removes atmospheric blurring , the bane of earthbound telescopes , by using multiple guide stars and deformable mirrors to sense and correct for the distortions produced by turbulence in Earth 's atmosphere .
Hydrogen and methane deep in Jupiter 's own thick atmosphere absorb light at infrared wavelengths .
So , this sharper view shows the infrared sunlight reflected from the giant planet 's high level haze prominent in the equatorial regions and near the poles .
It reveals features as small as 300 kilometers across .
The promising technique can also be applied to imaging other extended objects like star clusters and nebulae .

TAMPA , Fla. , Nov. 19 ( UPI ) --
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed starting running back Earnest Graham on the season - ending injured reserve list Wednesday with a severely sprained right ankle .
Graham suffered the injury on his first carry in last Sunday 's 19 - 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings and had to be helped to the sideline .

In the week leading up to the game , Graham had been nursing a knee injury .
" I do n't know the medical terms but right now it does n't look like he will play anytime soon , " Tamp Bay Coach Jon Gruden said before Graham 's MRI Wednesday .
Graham finishes the 2008 - 09 season with four touchdowns after 132 carries for 563 yards .
Also going to IR was rookie linebacker Geno Hayes .
The sixth - round pick from Florida State compiled eight tackles on defense and seven on special teams .
On Oct. 12 , he blocked a punt and returned it for a touchdown in the Buccaneers ' 27 - 3 win over the Carolina Panthers .
A bad news for cigarettes smokers in India .
Government of India has decided to ban smoking in in all public places from 2nd October , Gandhi Jayanti .
Now you ca n’t smoke in hotels , restaurants , offices , public gatherings etc .
Moreover , if you get caught while smoking , then a fine of Rs 200 would be imposed .
The health ministry has also plans to increase the fine to Rs 1000 after some time .
Even if the employer will be fined if their employees are found smoking inside office premises .
Smokers will also be fined for lighting up their cigarettes in even pubs , bars and discotheques .
Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare , Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss is the brain behind all these new measures .
He has already banned smoking in India movies .
I feel that the idea behind this ban is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient , and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces .
According to WHO reports , in developed countries , 26 % of male deaths and 9 % of female deaths are due to smoking .
So time has come to say no to Smoking .
Charles Darwin famously declared that " natural selection " was Mother Nature 's way of improving a species so it could advance .
Internet search engines are locked in their own Darwinian drama .
Depending how it turns out , desktop brands such as Google ( GOOG ) and Yahoo ( YHOO ) could become sturdier versions of themselves , ensuring survival as more people bolt for the mobile Web .
Or they could become the Dodo birds of the Net — outclassed by a new generation of rivals .
Born in the early days of the Internet , Google , Yahoo and smaller competitors help billions of people navigate the Web each day .
Now , they 're scrambling to adapt their desktop services for the hard realities of the wireless world .
Today , about 1 billion people have PCs ; about 3 billion have mobile phones , growing to 4 billion by 2010 .
A major driver is the growing popularity of Web - enabled devices such as the Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone .
One of the biggest challenges : dealing with the matchbox - size screens of cellphones and other devices , which are n't hospitable to the ads that are the lifeblood of traditional search engines .
Billions in potential ad revenue are at stake as social networks , location - based services and wireless search deliver instant answers to wireless users on the go .
" As hot as they are right now , Google and the others could become dinosaurs if they simply try to use their old business models , " says Roger Entner , a senior vice president at IAG Research in Boston .
But if they can adapt , he says , they could extend their dominance .
Microsoft ( MSFT ) has been pushing its Windows Mobile operating system for years .
Today , it 's available from 50 handset makers and more than 160 mobile operators worldwide .
Even so , it 's been tough slogging , says Phil Holden , director of online services for Microsoft .
" What we 've learned is that loyalty on the PC does n't necessarily transfer to the mobile phone , " he says .
The wireless world , he adds , " has a lot of different dynamics . "
One thing everybody agrees on : The mobile Web is an advertising gold mine just waiting to happen .
The fledgling mobile search industry generated about $ 700 million in ad revenue in 2007 , JupiterResearch estimates .
By 2012 , revenue is expected to hit $ 2.2 billion and keep rising .
Jupiter analyst Julie
Ask says mobile search could eventually eclipse the traditional Web , which currently generates about $ 20 billion in ad revenue .
No matter how things shake out , consumers will benefit , predicts Ford Cavallari of Monitor Group , a consulting firm in Boston that specializes in technology .
Search rankings based on factors that have little relation to the quality of a product or service , such as the number of daily " hits " a website gets , or a paid advertisement placement , are about to become history , he says .
Soon , word - of - mouth referrals from social - networking sites ( think Facebook and MySpace ( NWS ) ) and customized data made possible by instant messaging and other instant communications will rule , he says .
The upshot :
In the near future , a restaurant " might actually have to be high quality and offer value " to patrons to draw customers from the Web , Cavallari says .
" In the next 12 to 18 months we 're going to see a growing segment of ( consumers ) using wireless services as the way to get on the Internet 95 % of the time , " says Imad Mouline , chief technology officer of Gomez , which helps Facebook , Expedia ( EXPE ) and other companies improve the quality of their Web presence .
Currently , about 16 % of cellphone owners use handheld devices to access the mobile Web , Jupiter says .
Entner , for one , thinks the mobile Web could produce a mighty rival to traditional desktop engines , one whose core strengths are rooted in the unique world of wireless .
Such a newcomer , he says , " could wind up doing to Google what Google did to Yahoo " and other PC - based search engines .
Namely , it could trump them in the marketplace .
To be sure , Google , a Web monster with a market value of more than $ 200 billion , would be tough to topple .
But it 's not impossible .
If it 's not careful , Entner says , Google could wind up following in AOL 's famous footsteps .
AOL in the '90s was an online juggernaut with a gold - plated brand name and more than 30 million subscribers .
Today , it 's a free service with a dwindling base of about 8.7 million customers .
" Google is trying to replicate a 20 - inch experience on a 2 - inch screen , and that 's leaving them , inevitably , about 90 % short , " he says .
Too much information Making the leap to wireless is a lot trickier than it might appear .
For starters , there are those tiny screens .
Internet search was designed for PC screens , which can easily accommodate loads of advertisements .
The latter is critical , because search engines depend on ads for their financial survival .
In the PC environment , ads are abundant and constant .
Paid advertisements are typically stripped along the right side of the PC screen , with premium spots at the top reserved for the biggest spenders .
Try that on a wireless device , and you 'd quickly run out of room for anything else .
Similarly , the basic act of rendering searches also gets tough on a tiny screen .
In the online world , a single search request can result in a dozen or more pages of results .
If results are n't specific enough , you simply resubmit a query .
After a few tries , you usually find what you 're looking for .
That entire process is a total non-starter in the wireless environment , says Sameer Mithal , a senior principal with IBB Consulting in Princeton , N.J. Mobile consumers are typically on the run , he says , with little time or patience for typing on pint - size keypads .
As for pages of search results — forget about it .
There is n't nearly enough screen space for that , Mithal says .
And advertisements ?
Approach with care ; otherwise , you may offend customers and lose them for good , Gomez 's Mouline warns .
" Not doing it thoughtfully can get you to a point where customers will abandon your entire brand . "
Traditional search engines , to some extent , are victims of their own success .
Basic search algorithms are designed to do a massive Web " crawl " each time a search request is received .
In the mobile environment , however , such thoroughness can be the digital equivalent of using a shotgun to take out a housefly — way too much firepower for the task at hand .
" The desktop search engines are what they are , " Mithal shrugs .
Even if you 're only asking for a very specific thing — a sports score , for example — " they still have to search overall Web content . "
Search engines , angling to win over mobile customers early , are racing to solve these problems .
Their solutions , in some cases , are wildly different .
Yahoo's solution is a nod to the social - networking craze .
Its OneConnect service , which makes its debut this summer , integrates messaging and social - networking updates from Facebook , MySpace and the like in one spot on the phone .
OneConnect ties directly to a user 's address book , letting people share information , social - networking updates and messages on the fly .
" On the phone , time is limited , so you really need to provide highly relevant and useful information , " says Marc Davis , chief scientist for Connected Life , the Yahoo unit responsible for non-PC services , including mobile .
That philosophy is the force behind " OneSearch with Voice , " which integrates voice - recognition technology with traditional search .
The service allows users to simply speak their request into a cellphone —
" Where 's the best craps table in Las Vegas ? " — in plain English .
Responses are sent back in text form , as in any other search .
The voice - recognition technology is " so good , it 's shocking , " Davis says , handling accents , continuous speech and verbal affectations with ease .
While all searches , mobile and otherwise , use the same search algorithm , there is one big difference :
Yahoo says mobile search responses are provided strictly on the basis of relevancy , with no preferential treatment for ad - supported products and services .
" This is about providing answers , not links , " Davis says .
Google says it sees no reason to change what it does just because it 's moving into the wireless arena .
" We think that what we do is highly transferable to the mobile device , " says Matt Waddell , chief of mobile and developer products for Google .
The tiny screen is n't a problem , he says .
" It 's still as easy as typing . "
That said , Google is making a few accommodations .
Instead of giving wireless users pages of search results , for example , it only offers " snippets " —
Google - speak for the first few search results that appear at the top of the page .
It 's also limiting the number of ads to one or two per search .
Waddell says the advertising opportunities in wireless are huge .
One example : Say you 're in San Francisco , and you suddenly get an urge for pasta .
Provided your device has Global Positioning System location technology , Waddell says , Google can offer up a list of Italian restaurants within a five - minute walk .
" Advertisers would probably be willing to pay more money for such an ad , because it would be much more targeted , " he says .
While such an approach might seem to subjugate the interests of consumers to advertisers , Waddell says that 's not the case at all .
" We never think of advertising first , " he says , adding , " We wo n't touch an ad with a 10 - foot pole unless we think it delivers a better search experience . "
Google on the go Google is taking other steps to make sure it does n't get iced out of wireless opportunities .
The Web giant is pushing development of an open wireless operating system — dubbed Android — that would make it easier for consumers to use Google 's mobile services .
Android - loaded devices are expected to hit the market later this year .
While the big incumbents duke it out , start - ups are nipping at their heels .
That includes Medio , a Seattle - based company that hopes to turn itself into the Google of mobile .
Like Google , Medio 's service is geared around a simple " search box " format .
That 's where the similarity ends , CEO Brian Lent says .
Medio " was designed as a pure - play company for the mobile industry . "
Unlike Google , he says , Medio 's patented algorithm hones in on " mobile discovery , " producing far more relevant answers for users .
Example : A search for a Madonna ring tone might also result in links to a CNN article about the singer , as well as V Cast , the mobile music channel offered by Verizon .
" That 's a lot different than crawling the Web " as Google does every time a query is received , Lent says .
Another difference : Medio is a " white label " company that works directly with big carriers such as Verizon and T - Mobile .
Carriers , in turn , rebrand Medio 's service under their own names .
Lent has a very personal view of the Web 's biggest search engine .
A data - mining expert , Lent was part of the academic team that worked on Google when it was still a lab project at Stanford .
He left to take a job at Amazon a month before Google was incorporated .
Lent , who remains friends with Google co-founder Sergey Brin , says he 's hugely admiring of Google 's pioneering efforts .
The Web giant , now a Medio partner , almost single - handedly raised the online search category to a new level , he says , introducing billions of people to the wonders of the Web .
But now it 's a new world , he says — a wireless world .
" Everyone wants to bash the incumbent , but I 'd rather take a playbook out of judo and leverage the strengths that they have " and build on top of that , Lent says .

U.S. Department of State Is Inviting “ us ” To Ask Them Questions About Our Foreign Policy via YouTube video .
Watch the video , and follow their directions to submit your 9/11 Truth ( or whatever ) questions .
Although it may be unlikely that they will entertain 9/11 Truth questions , it ’s important for them to understand what we know and what questions we have .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska lawmakers voted Friday to subpoena Gov. Sarah Palin 's husband , several aides and phone records in their investigation into Palin 's firing of her public safety commissioner , setting up what one senator called a " branch - versus - branch smackdown . "
Gov. Sarah Palin is fighting allegations she improperly tried to force the firing of her former brother - in - law .
Todd Palin has been a " principal critic " of his wife 's ex-brother - in - law , state Trooper Mike Wooten , and had " many contacts " with Department of Public Safety officials about his status , said Steve Branchflower , the former prosecutor hired by the state Legislature to investigate the firing .
Sarah Palin , now the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations that she and her advisers pressured then - Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire Wooten and that Monegan was terminated when he refused .
Palin has said she fired Monegan over budget issues and denies any wrongdoing .
Branchflower said 16 of the 33 people he planned to interview have given statements .
But since last week , when Palin 's attorneys began to argue that the state Personnel Board should handle the investigation , numerous witnesses have refused to cooperate .
" While we will hopefully get over this little bump in the road , there may arise others , " he said .
" And so the subpoena is always a good thing to have standing by . "
Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein told reporters after the vote that the Democratic lawmaker managing the investigation , state Sen.
Hollis French , " has partisan motives for doing this . "
And Palin 's lieutenant governor , Sean Parnell , repeated claims that the investigation was " a political circus . "
" Using subpoenas like this looks like an abuse of power , and it's become a circus , " Parnell said .
Friday 's action goes " well beyond the pale of a legislative committee 's normal responsibilities , " he added .
Palin 's lawyers say the investigation -- which the Legislature commissioned on a bipartisan basis in July -- belongs before the state Personnel Board , which met to consider the request Thursday .
In a lengthy memo distributed to reporters , the McCain campaign said Palin " remains committed to cooperating with a fair , non-partisan investigation . "
But French is a supporter of Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , and the McCain campaign accused him of turning the investigation into a partisan attack " to achieve his and the Obama campaign 's political agenda . "
" With today 's action , the investigation has devolved into a full - scale political circus overseen by what amounts to a discredited kangaroo court , " the campaign said .
French largely declined to comment after the hearing , but told CNN he was " absolutely not " working on behalf of the Obama campaign .
One Republican senator -- Charlie Huggins , of Palin 's hometown of Wasilla -- joined the two Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 3 - 2 vote supporting the subpoenas .
Huggins said he did not believe the investigation would amount to a " hill of beans , " but said the truth should come out , and " the sooner the better . "
Republican state Senate President Lyda Green -- an outspoken critic of the governor , also from Wasilla -- told CNN that she would approve the subpoenas .
Green said Palin had the authority to fire Monegan " for no reason . "
But she said her administration 's continued contacts with Monegan 's department about her ex-brother - in - law raised questions that need to be explored .
" We had continuing pressure from within the administration to reinvestigate , and at some point , they were told to give up -- and they did not , " she said .
Palin herself was not on the list Branchflower presented to the House and Senate judiciary committees , but lawmakers have said they hope she will be able to talk to them during the probe .
They have set an October 10 date for completing the investigation -- a date moved up three weeks after Palin became Sen.
John McCain 's running mate .
Branchflower , a former Anchorage prosecutor , asked lawmakers to subpoena 10 members of Sarah Palin 's administration as well as the phone records for suspended Board and Commissions Director Frank Bailey , who was recorded in February discussing Wooten 's status with a state police lieutenant .
He also asked lawmakers to subpoena the employee of a worker 's compensation insurance firm who handled a claim Wooten filed in 2007 .
But he added that no witnesses have said Palin directly told anyone , " I want that guy fired . "
Wooten and Sarah Palin 's sister divorced in 2005 .
The governor and her family have complained extensively about him since then , describing him as a " rogue trooper " who threatened family members , and say they brought him up to state officials as a possible threat to the governor 's security .
In 2006 , Wooten was suspended for five days for using a stun gun on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity " ; drinking beer while driving his patrol car ; and illegally shooting a moose using his wife 's permit .
In papers filed with the state Personnel Board , the governor has said she was unaware of Wooten 's punishment until after Monegan 's dismissal .
In addition to Todd Palin , the subpoenas cover 11 members of the Palin administration , including the governor 's chief of staff , deputy chief of staff and executive secretary ; and Frank Bailey , an official suspended in August after Sarah Palin disclosed he had called a state police lieutenant to discuss Wooten .
Branchflower also requested a subpoena for Bailey 's phone records to determine whom he called before and after that February 2008 call .
The last subpoena was for Murlene Wilkes , an insurance adjuster who was involved in handling a worker 's compensation claim Wooten filed .
Sarah Palin once pledged to cooperate with the investigation .
But aides are refusing now because the investigation has become a " circus , " said Parnell , the lieutenant governor .
Republicans unsuccessfully have asked to get French , the state senator running the investigation , removed from the probe after he suggested in an ABC News interview that the case could produce criminal charges or an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
On Friday , Republican state Sen .
Gene Therriault questioned whether Branchflower was being steered toward or turned away from particular witnesses after French said there was no " political will " to subpoena Palin 's former chief of staff .
" Something is fishy here , " Therriault said .
He said the decision to pursue subpoenas means " we are heading for a branch - versus - branch smackdown . "

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The United States wants to increase the number of countries enjoying visa - free entry after opening the door to citizens from six new European Union countries and South Korea , U.S. officials said Friday .

From Monday , travelers from the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia , as well as South Korea , will be allowed to travel to the United States without a visa provided they fill in a form on the Internet .
Washington is continuing talks with EU countries not yet in the visa waiver program -- Poland , Greece , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Malta and Romania .
“ It is our objective to admit additional countries before the change of U.S. administration , ” said Jackie Bednarz , a Department of Homeland Security official at the U.S. Mission to the EU .
The visa waiver program includes a further 27 countries , including EU states , Australia , Japan and Singapore .
From January 12 , citizens from all countries in the program will be required to register online ahead of traveling to the United States by air or sea .
If the so - called Electronic System Travel Authorization is refused , a traveler will need to apply for a visa .
Bednarz said a pilot project showed an approval rate of 99.6 percent .
The new U.S. requirement is the latest in an overhaul of U.S. travel regulations since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
On the online form , the traveler must give his name and travel information , and state whether he has a communicable disease , is a drug abuser , has already been denied a U.S. visa , or “ is seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities . ”
The online registration at www.cbp.gov/esta is similar to the paper form that travelers from visa - free countries now fill in aboard the plane and hand to border control on arrival in the United States .
A European Commission official said the EU executive was yet to decide whether it considered that the new system was equivalent to reintroducing a visa for European citizens traveling visa - free to the United States .
A U.S. official insisted this was not a visa .
The online form is free but it has not been ruled out that a fee could be applied at some point , the U.S. official said .
The $ 3 million that Barack Obama 's campaign paid to run last night 's campaign ad on eight networks was a drop in the bucket , but did the gamble pay off in viewers ?
Click to find out .
Hint : he outdid Ross Perot 's rating .
As weird as it was to see Obama turn into Stone Phillips , the presentation was a relatively innocuous portrait of Americans struggling and the man who claims he can help them .
The ad scored with viewers , who made it the most highly rated presidential ad buy in history .
The early rating had to make the campaign happy : the half - hour ad scored a combined 17.8/29 ( household rating / share ) before Game 5 of the World Series on Fox .
It bested the numbers of that game ( the conclusion of the aborted Game 5 managed a decent 13.1/20 ) and most other regular programming .
Since ABC's Pushing Daises did its usual poor number , most of the folks who watched the ad may have stuck with it rather than changing the channel .
The real question is whether the major audience was supporters tuning in for a glimpse of their favorite celebrity , or undecided voters who can be swayed by that kind of feel - good propaganda .
With the narrow focus on economic issues , you can bet the campaign was hoping that single issue voter constituted good chunk of that 17.8 rating .
UPDATE : Final numbers are out .
All told the entire audience was 33.6 million viewers , with NBC drawing 9.8 million alone .
I got an email yesterday from Sears , because it is where America Shops ( and I am America ) , and my friend Sears told me that LAYAWAY IS BACK , so's I could " BE READY FOR THE BIG DAY , " which made me wonder why Sears wanted me to buy shit " on Layaway " for my own Birthday , but then there 's that other Big Day , with The Jesus , and the The Santa , and I guess I 'm glad Sears ( which is also actually the K - Mart ) is giving us ( as in U.S. ) the privilege of laying some stuff away and paying for it a coupla bucks at a time as opposed to slapping it on some credit cards , but c'mon , man , in these Uncertain Economic Times , should n't we ( as in You ) just kinda chill on the Consuming for a Li'l bit , huh ?
I mean , errbody 's talking about how nobody really Feels the War on Freedom — except for people who are actually Over
There getting shot and blown up and all their friends and family — and well , yeah , it 's kinda psycho to have World War effing III going on and we ( as in Us ) are all Over Here gearing up for the big Consuming season , but there 's also the Economies , man , like , of Scale and whatever , Micro , Macro , Schmackro , and that 's a whole other kinda
War that people — except for all the people who are getting axed from their jobs and their friends and family — are totally not feeling , man , and this LAYAWAY crap is a perfect example .

I mean , I love Teevee , man , I [ heart ] it totally , and I started listening to the Siren Songs out there with the Big Sales , and the No Interest Until the Year 2525 , and I got totally sucked in for a minute , thinking about a 300 - inch teevee or whatever , but it 's fucked up , man , it 's a trap , seriously , do n't do it , and do n't let anybody tell you it 's Bad for the Economies to shop less , seriously , the Economies are already Bad , see ?

I 'm not saying like , do n't buy your kid a new Winter coat or whatever , I 'm saying stop looking at the ads for the 40 - 60 - 100 - infinity - inch Plasma Teevees ; these stores want you to get on the no - interest - for - two - years hook for right now .

Now think about what the next coupla years is gonna look like , eh ?
Seriously , what is gonna improve any time soon ?
Just downshift , man , slow down , stop buying new DVDs ever week , look at all the goddamn DVDs you have , man , watch some reruns , and do n't buy that new car for the Saved By Zero interest , man , keep the crappy car for a little while longer , and really , what is it with these car companies ?

Shit costs money , and Money Costs Money , and if you can be all Let 's Make A Deal or No Deal with the bank to change up that interest rate , go for it , but you should also think about Renting a smaller place , and that big - screen would n't fit there anyway , okay ?
Utilities are becoming more aggressive about collecting money from delinquent customers , leading to a surge in service shutdowns just as economic woes are pushing up the number of households falling behind on bills .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve announced Monday it will offer an unlimited amount of dollars to three other central banks in an unprecedented move to provide liquidity to the global banking system .
The U.S. central bank will lend dollars at a fixed interest rate to the central banks of England , Switzerland and the European Union , according to a joint statement from the banks .
The other central banks will be able to borrow " any amount they wish " in exchange for collateral .
The goal is to flood the financial system with much - needed dollars .
After they borrow dollars from the Fed , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank will provide private financial institutions with one - week , 28 - day and 84 - day U.S. dollar loans in the latest attempt to unfreeze credit .
" The plan allows the central banks to exchange assets on their books for more liquid assets , " said John Silvia , chief economist for Wachovia .
" It will then allow institutions that need dollars to conduct the business they need to conduct . "
The new plan will continue through April 30 , and the Bank of Japan will consider introducing similar measures .
" Central banks will continue to work together and are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to provide sufficient liquidity in short - term funding markets , " the Federal Reserve said in a statement on its Web site .
With inter - bank lending frozen , and financial institutions unable to acquire short - term money to fund daily operations , central banks have searched for methods to boost liquidity and restore the credit markets to normal operations .
" People have become extremely risk - averse because of the legacy of Lehman Brothers , " said Silvia .
" If a bank like Lehman can turn over and die in a matter of days , it would be hard to convince banks to lend to other institutions for any given time period . "
The latest move follows last week 's global coordinated interest rate cuts , as well as Sunday 's announcements that European governments will guarantee new bank loans and the British government will invest $ 63 billion in three major banks .
Monday 's plan is the first time in which central banks have issued uncapped loans to other financial institutions .
Previously , the Fed had allotted $ 620 billion in swap arrangements with nine other central banks .
That number has ballooned since December , when the Fed announced a $ 24 billion swap cap only with the ECB and the SNB .
The huge increase in swap funds has been especially necessary during the recent crisis , as banks have become more and more reliant on central banks to provide them with essential loans .
" Before the crisis , central banks were dealing in much smaller numbers , and banks accepted a wide array of collateral and exchanged many different currencies , " Silvia said .
" Now , the dollar and collateral from central banks is much more highly favored . "
In a separate move , the Fed last week doubled the size of its lending facility to private banks - its so - called term auction facility - to $ 300 billion .

Candace Gingrich to Olbermann : Progress is being made on marriage equality Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Candace Gingrich , Youth Outreach Director for the Human Rights Campaign and openly gay half - sister to twice - divorced " traditional marriage " advocate Newt Gingrich , sat down with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann to discuss California 's Proposition 8 .
New poll data suggesting a shift in opinion on the state 's gay marriage ban , which could be enough to change the initiative 's outcome were the vote to be held today , " just exemplifies the progress that 's being made on people understanding what marriage equality is all about , " Gingrich said .
" It 's been three weeks since the election , but people have continued having conversations about this issue .
They 've continued seeing the families that are affected by having their marriage taken away from them . "
" And I want to thank you , Keith , because your rant was exactly what was needed , " she added .
" It was continuing that dialogue , and you helped a lot more people understand the issue . "
On November 10 , Olbermann devoted a " Special Comment " to addressing the marriage ban , which passed 52 % - 47 % in this month 's election .
" What if somebody passed a law that said you could n't marry ? " he asked marriage equality opponents .
Gays " want what you want , " he said , " a chance to be a little less alone in the world . "
" Marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples does n't threaten anything , or anyone 's marriage , " Gingrich went on , saying that President - elect Obama 's statements on the issue make it clear on where he stands , even though he has stopped short of supporting full civil marriage in name .
" It is not something that people should have to fear .
And [ Obama ] said very simply , you know , this is about people 's civil rights , and they should be afforded to folks whether or not he , personally , agrees with them or not . "
Gingrich took her brother , former Speaker of the House , to task over statements he made on the November 14 edition of Fox News ' The O'Reilly Factor .
" I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us , " he said .
" I think it is prepared to use the government if it can get control of it .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion .
And I think if you believe in historic Christianity , you have to confront the fact . "
On Saturday , Ms. Gingrich shot back in a Huffington Post piece :
... The truth is that you 're living in a world that no longer exists .
I , along with millions of Americans , clearly see the world the way it as -- and we embrace what it can be .
You , on the other hand , seem incapable of looking for new ideas or moving beyond what worked in the past .
Welcome to the 21st century , big bro .
I can understand why you 're so afraid of the energy that has been unleashed after gay and lesbian couples had their rights stripped away from them by a hateful campaign .
I can see why you 're sounding the alarm against the activists who use all the latest tech tools to build these rallies from the ground up in cities across the country ... ... What really worries me is that you are always willing to use LGBT Americans as political weapons to further your ambitions .
That 's really so '90s , Newt .
In this day and age , it 's embarrassing to watch you talk like that .
You should be more afraid of the new political climate in America , because , there is no place for you in it .

" Trends which cannot continue , do n't . " -- Attributed to Warren Buffett and others
- 1 -
The most obvious trend which cannot continue today is the maintenance of prosperity in America by means of ever - increasing debt and monetary inflation .
The America we grew up in , the America we are used to -- in terms of not only prosperity but also world dominance , freedom and human rights at home , respect around the world , and in other ways -- that America is already gone , and we are living in the vapors and shadows of its corpse .
Americans and indeed people everywhere will increasingly be asking themselves who caused the epic financial collapse that has already destroyed trillions of dollars in wealth , slowed the economies of nearly every nation on Earth , and generated a surge in unemployment and homelessness in America and elsewhere .
I have written about the causes previously ; see , for example , Destruction by Paradigm : How the United States wrecked the world 's most robust economy and impoverished its own people from March of 2007 ( especially section 3 ) and will not discuss them in detail here .
The free market ( something we do n't actually have ) has been set up as the fall guy , but the true culprit is government coercion and its results -- our unconstitutional central bank ; the unconstitutional abandonment of the gold standard ; corporatism and resulting corruption of the regulatory process , to name a few highlights .
The current nightmare has been over a century in the making , so do n't expect it to be solved anytime soon , like " in your lifetime . "
Repair of the damage , assuming it ever happens , will take far longer than that .
It is worth noting that repair could happen much faster , if a return to something approaching genuine freedom could be engineered .
I do n't see that as being in the cards , however , although I would be thrilled to be wrong .
More likely , the problems currently scaring us to death are just the start of an epic descent into Hell , a cautionary event that will be studied and retold for a thousand years and more , assuming the human race survives that long .
I am sorry to be so downbeat , but I can only call it as I see it .
Today 's situation will appear cheerful in comparison even a year from now , and not only financially .

This global financial crisis was not only foreseeable , it was actually foreseen and described years ago -- not by government bureaucrats ( other than former OMB head David Walker ) , not by politicians ( other than Dr. Ron Paul [ video of Paul speaking after the bailout bill passed , 4 min 14 sec ] ) , not by most of the talking heads on television , not by most financial commentators , but instead by those few observers who have at least some understanding of Austrian economics and whose careers do not involve boosting the corrupt , corporatist system that has been devouring America for decades .
The people most recently responsible for creating this problem are now telling us that they know how to fix the problem -- and the fix , naturally , involves taking incomprehensibly vast sums of money from the American public and handing that money to the banks and other institutions and connected , wealthy individuals who were the immediate , proximate cause of the problem .
Yeah , that 'll work .

I opened the file for this column almost two years ago , then put it aside and forgot about it .
After last week 's breathtaking betrayal of the American public by Congress and the President , I decided to return to this column and finish it .
As a reminder that today 's crisis has been building for years , here is the opening section I originally wrote :
As I begin writing this ( on December 4th , 2006 ) everything seems fine .
It is n't .
By the time you read this , the problems may or may not be apparent to most Americans .
On Friday , December 14 , 2006 , the U.S. federal government is scheduled to release the annual Financial Report of the United States , which -- unlike the budget figures constantly reported in the news -- uses industry - standard GAAP accounting .
This is the type of accounting your business uses ; the deficit and other numbers we usually see about our government 's finances are generated by , essentially , cash flow analysis .
These figures do not account for liabilities that are building up , including future obligations for Social Security , Medicare , and so on .
The difference is stunning .
What is the budget deficit for fiscal year 2006 ?
We 've been told it is " only " $ 248.2 billion -- actually an enormous number , a frightening number for any thinking person .
With 300 million men , women , and children in the U.S. including perhaps 125 million adults with jobs in the private sector , $ 248.2 thousand million ( there being a thousand millions in a billion ) means the new federal debt created this year amounts to roughly $ 2,000 for every business owner and non-government employee in the country .
That 's not total federal debt : it 's just NEW debt for 2006 , as reported by the federal government .
Even counting infants , children , the retired , students , the unemployed , and government employees ( who are , of course , paid with tax dollars ) , the new debt adds over $ 800 to each person 's federal debt load .
Bad , right ?
Wait until you see the real numbers .
And indeed , as you know , the real numbers were horrible -- and have only gotten worse .
- 4 -
Speaking of " the real numbers " , the amount of government debt Americans have recently been saddled with is vast beyond comprehension .
As you look at the chart below , keep in mind that a trillion is a thousand billion .
United States total GDP is about $ 13.78 trillion , and world GDP is roughly $ 65.61 trillion , according to ( shiver ) the CIA factbook site .
Chart from The Dollar is Doomed by Jennifer Barry
http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/editorials/barry/2008/1003.html
$ 2.092 trillion is a significant percentage of America 's entire Gross Domestic Product -- and remember , this is NEW debt , not previously - created federal debt ( presently over $ 10 trillion ) and not current unfunded liabilities such as Social Security and Medicare , which are perhaps another $ 100 trillion ( other figures are available ; use a search engine and pick whatever number you prefer -- they 're all impossibly large ) .
This is debt on a dizzying scale ; debt on a scale that absolutely cannot and will not ever be repaid , except ( possibly , if the government survives long enough ) in near - worthless , inflated dollars .
Consider the Zimbabwe dollar , which was worth substantially more than the US dollar in 1980 ( " At the time of its introduction , the Zimbabwean dollar was worth more than the U.S. dollar , with ZWD 1 = USD 1.47 " per this Wikipedia article ) .
The Zim $ is now worth essentially nothing , and that 's despite the original Zim Dollar having been replaced with a new version ( " the second dollar " ) and then a still - newer version this past July at 10 billion to one !
At the time the original " old " dollar was replaced in August 2006 , its exchange rate was over half a million Zimbabwe dollars to one U.S. dollar .
Clearly , things are deteriorating at an accelerating rate in what had been , not so long ago , one of Africa 's wealthiest nations .
Also clearly , a single Zimbabwe dollar ( a theoretical construct , really ) is worth almost exactly nothing .
A loaf of bread in Zimbabwe costs more than 100 billion dollars -- which is also the maximum allowable cash withdrawal from a Zimbabwe bank , by law .
The CIA Factbook site has this to say about Zimbabwe 's monetary woes :
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely prints money to fund the budget deficit , causing the official annual inflation rate to rise from 32 % in 1998 , to 133 % in 2004 , 585 % in 2005 , passed 1000 % in 2006 , and 26,000 % in November 2007 .
Private sector estimates of inflation in 2007 are well above 100,000 % .
Well above one hundred thousand percent ?
In fact , Steve H. Hanke pegs the current ( late September 2008 ) annual rate of inflation in Zimbabwe at -- this is not a misprint -- 531,000,000,000 % .
Yes , five hundred thirty one billion percent .
For readers who still believe hyperinflation is a rarity , Hanke provides a list of 29 recent examples in Hyperinflation : Mugabe versus Milosevic .
( Note : the chart figures in linked article are for monthly inflation rates ) .
Clearly , if we make the United States dollar worthless enough , then we can repay all those trillion - dollar debts !
Just as clearly -- so clearly that the world is starting to notice and to modify its behavior accordingly -- this is the actual plan in Washington .
Returning to " the real numbers " that America is drowning in : If $ 248.2 billion is roughly $ 2,000 for every American with a non-government job or business , how much is $ 2,000 billion ?
Answer : over $ 16,000 per American with a non-government job or business .
Again , that is just new debt created recently for the bailouts .
Jennifer Barry ( she of the chart shown above ) points out that :
" Despite Bernanke 's assurances to the contrary , these bailouts mean tremendous inflation of the money supply .
The U.S. can no longer avoid hyperinflation -- it is here .
The effects can hardly be overstated when the reserve currency of the world is debased so rapidly .
Empires disintegrate and social upheaval occurs .
Dollar depreciation is not apparent to the masses yet , but once the realization occurs , the social effect will be explosive .
I believe this is why a U.S. Army brigade from the 3rd Infantry Division has been given orders to patrol America ' to help with civil unrest and crowd control . '
" The dollar is doomed but most people do n't know it yet . "
This is what putting government in charge of the money supply gets you .
The American dollar may not plunge to the levels reached by the Zimbabwean dollar , but it will plunge in value ; the only questions are how fast and how far .
For that matter , the US dollar has already plunged in value , having lost about 97 % of its value since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 -- when a $ 20 bill could be exchanged , by law , for a one - ounce gold coin .
( You can check how much gold a $ 20 bill will buy today -- " almost none " is a good guess -- at 321gold.com ) .
For that matter , the Constitution 's Section 10 * still requires that our money be gold and silver ( the section has never been repealed ) -- just another example of the lawlessness that has increasingly characterized our government over time .
For a short refresher course on the topic with focus on the current financial crisis , here is Ron Paul on CNN recently ( video , 5 min 31 sec ) .
- 5 -
The financial crisis now underway is just one element in a major , multi- pronged threat to love and freedom here at home and around the world .
As is typical in a crisis , government 's response has been to take more money and power from the people and gather that money and power to itself .
Tyranny advances crisis by crisis , and this effect is so powerful that governments have often created crisis events rather than wait for one to appear on its own .
Whether the present crisis has been engineered purposefully , as some believe , or is entirely the result of clueless and corrupt behavior on the part of government regulators , investment bankers , elected officials , and others , the result is the same : a screaming financial emergency that is being milked for all the money and power the elite can get from it .
For an in - depth look at how severe is the immediate danger to our lives and liberty , I highly recommend this recent interview with author Naomi Wolf ( 27 min 52 sec , and well worth the time ) , in which she discusses why strong , direct action is needed NOW to prevent a complete descent into tyranny .
By " direct action " she means , among other things , arresting George W. Bush immediately .
Ms. Wolf 's sense of urgency is palpable and well - supported , and she describes a number of things Americans can do to oppose and possibly prevent the collapse of freedom in America .
She is cautiously optimistic , an attitude bolstered by her finding that tyranny has in fact been thwarted by citizen action more than once in history .
Ms .
Wolf is the author of a book with the same title as this column , which outlines her research into the methods historically used to impose fascism in formerly free ( or relatively free ) nations .
The reader will see immediately that these ten steps have already been used to one extent or another in the United States , especially since
9/11/2001 :
1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy .
2. Create secret prisons where torture takes place .
Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens .
Set up an internal surveillance system .
Harass citizens ' groups .
Engage in arbitrary detention and release .
Target key individuals .
Control the press .
Treat all political dissidents as traitors .
Suspend the rule of law .
Wolf 's book ( the full title is The End of America : Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot ) explains how the above pattern was followed in Hitler 's Germany , Mussolini's Italy , and in other places .
Frighteningly , it is a plan that works , and America 's federal government has been visibly following this plan for several years now .
Once again , Wolf believes that the present level of destruction can be reversed -- that the American republic has not yet been ended with certainty .
This is a refreshingly positive view , although I have difficulty sharing it .
She stresses , however , that unless a large number of Americans begin to effectively oppose the destruction of their liberties , and quickly , " the end of America " will no longer be a warning but rather a fait accompli .
Note :
Article 1 , Section 10 reads : " No State shall enter into any Treaty , Alliance , or Confederation ; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal ; coin Money ; emit Bills of Credit ; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts ; pass any Bill of Attainder , ex post facto Law , or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts , or grant any Title of Nobility .

SanDisk has developed a new file system for flash - based SSD drives , improving random write speeds by up to 100 times .
The system , dubbed ExtremeFFS , should be coming to products sometime next year .
How 's it work ?
To maximize random write performance , SanDisk developed the ExtremeFFS flash file management system .
This operates on a page - based algorithm , which means there is no fixed coupling between physical and logical location .
When a sector of data is written , the SSD puts it where it is most convenient and efficient .
The result is an improvement in random write performance – by up to 100 times – as well as in overall endurance .

The first clues are emerging that Wall Street pay will plummet this year  but perhaps not enough to satisfy the financial industry ’s critics .
Bonuses , which soared to record heights in recent years , could drop by 20 to 35 percent across the industry , according to a private study to be released on Thursday .
Bonuses for top executives could plunge by 70 percent .
But to some , those figures , from the consulting firm Johnson Associates , demand the question :
Why should Wall Street executives get any bonuses at all ?
Banks ’ profits have plunged , and the government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up the industry and prevent its problems from dragging down the economy .
A report on Wednesday from the New York State Assembly said Wall Street bonuses could tumble 41.3 percent next year , which could further widen a budget deficit .
( CNN ) --
One hundred twenty African refugees -- most of them fleeing war - torn Somalia -- were forced overboard at gunpoint off the coast of Yemen , leaving at least 26 dead and 20 missing , the United Nations ' refugee agency said Wednesday .
A Somali refugee walks past the United Nations - donated tents at a refugee camp west of Aden .
Seventy - four survivors made it to the beach Tuesday and were taken to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees center in Ahwar , Yemen , according to UNHCR .
Some told the United Nations that they were waiting on their boat for a smaller vessel to take them ashore when the smugglers operating the boat forced them overboard .
Some were pushed and beaten , and others were shot and killed , for not complying , they said .
The smaller boat never arrived , they said .
Heavy fighting in Somalia 's capital and a widespread drought has led to a dramatic increase in Somalis making the sometimes deadly journey by sea to Yemen , according to UNHCR .
Nearly 26,000 refugees have arrived on Yemen 's shores this year from the Horn of Africa -- almost three times the number of refugees to make the perilous journey across the Gulf of Aden last year , according to UNHCR .
Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity .
It is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country .

Fighting in Somali capital kills nine Journalists kidnapped in Somalia
New smuggling routes , including some based out of Djibouti -- which lies north of Somalia and is much closer to Yemen -- have also led to the increase in refugees , according to the UNHCR .
Refugees pay as much as $ 150 to get to Yemen on small fastboats , while others pay between $ 50 and $ 70 for a ride on larger and much slower vessels , the agency said .
Earlier this year , Yemen 's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline in an attempt to deter the smugglers .
Some of the smuggling boats are seized by Yemen 's coast guard and given to Somali fishermen who suffered losses in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami .
As part of a $ 19 million operation , UNHCR operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in Yemen and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal crossing to Yemen .
It has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials .

Prime Minister
Yves Leterme has been in an emergency cabinet meeting Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme has offered his government 's resignation amid a growing row over the break - up and sale of the stricken bank , Fortis .
King Albert II has deferred the decision on whether to accept it , and has begun talks on how best to proceed .
Earlier , Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen quit after a judge said there were signs the government had tried to stop a court freezing the sale of Fortis .
The appeals court ruled shareholders had not been properly consulted .
Fortis has been among the European banks hardest - hit by the current financial turmoil , which left it desperately short of cash .
' Suspending response '
Mr Leterme 's spokesman , Peter Poulussen , confirmed the government 's decision to resign had been approved by the cabinet at an emergency session on Friday .
" The cabinet has decided to tender the resignation of the entire government to the king , " he said .
The government is embroiled in a row over the sale of its stake in Fortis Under Belgium 's constitution , the king must now decide whether to accept the resignation .
However , he has said he will defer the decision .
" The king is suspending his response and is immediately beginning consultations , " the palace said in a statement .
Mr Leterme only took office in March , nine months after a general election had resulted in political deadlock founded in tensions between Flemish and Walloon groups .
He tendered his resignation in June after he failed to push through plans to devolve more power to the regions , but the king rejected it .
Correspondents say the king could refuse the resignation again on the grounds that being without an administration would be dangerous during the current financial crisis .
Court report
The BBC's Europe business reporter , Ben Shore , says the root of the government 's crisis can be traced to New York in the middle of September and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
After that , bankers almost completely stopped lending to one another and Fortis could not refinance its debts , forcing the Belgian government to take over and sell almost all the company 's assets , our correspondent says .
Hundreds of thousands of investors were left with virtually nothing and so began a successful legal action effectively preventing the asset sale .
Last week , the Brussels appeal court ruled in favour of the shareholders and froze the sale of most of Fortis to France 's BNP Paribas , which was supposed to have been finalised this week .
Then , in a judgement earlier on Friday , Belgium 's Supreme Court president said there were " undoubtedly significant indications " that members of the Belgian government had attempted to influence the outcome of the court case .

After months of looking , struggling through Git-SVN glitches and letting things roll around in my head , I ’ve finally arrived at a web - focused Git workflow that ’s simple , flexible and easy to use .
Some key advantages :
Pushing remote changes automatically updates the live site
Server - based site edits wo n’t break history
Simple , no special commit rules or requirements
Works with existing sites , no need to redeploy or move files
Overview
The key idea in this system is that the web site exists on the server as a pair of repositories ; a bare repository alongside a conventional repository containing the live site .
Two simple Git hooks link the pair , automatically pushing and pulling changes between them .
The two repositories :
Hub is a bare repository .
All other repositories will be cloned from this .
is a bare repository .
All other repositories will be cloned from this .
Prime is a standard repository , the live web site is served from its working directory .
Using the pair of repositories is simple and flexible .
Remote clones with ssh-access can update the live site with a simple git push to Hub .
Any files edited directly on the server are instantly mirrored into Hub upon commit .
The whole thing pretty much just works — whichever way it ’s used .
Getting ready
Obviously Git is required on the server and any local machines .
My shared web host does n’t offer Git , but it ’s easy enough to install Git yourself .
If this is the first time running Git on your webserver , remember to setup your global configuration info .
I set a different Git user.name to help distinguish server - based changes in project history .
$ git config -- global user.name " Joe , working on the server "
Getting started
The first step is to initialize a new Git repository in the live web site directory on the server , then to add and commit all the site ’s files .
This is the Prime repository and working copy .
Even if history exists in other places , the contents of the live site will be the baseline onto which all other work is merged .
$ cd ~/www $ git init $ git add .
$ git commit - m" initial import of pre-existing web files "
Initializing in place also means there is no downtime or need to re-deploy the site , Git just builds a repository around everything that ’s already there .
With the live site now safely in Git , create a bare repository outside the web directory , this is Hub .
$ cd ; mkdir site_hub.git ; cd site_hub.git $ git -- bare init Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ joe/site_hub.git
Then , from inside Prime ’s working directory , add Hub as a remote and push Prime ’s master branch :
$ cd ~/www $ git remote add hub ~/site_hub.git $ git remote show hub * remote hub URL : /home/joe/site_hub.git $ git push hub master
Hooks
Two simple Git hooks scripts keep Hub and Prime linked together .
An oft - repeated rule of Git is to never push into a repository that has a work tree attached to it .
I tried it , and things do get weird fast .
The hub repository exists for this reason .
Instead of pushing changes to Prime from Hub , which would n’t affect the working copy anyway , Hub uses a hook script which tells Prime to pull changes from Hub .
post - update – Hub repository
This hook is called when Hub receives an update .
The script changes directories to the Prime repository working copy then runs a pull from Prime .
Pushing changes does n’t update a repository ’s working copy , so it ’s necessary to execute this from inside the working copy itself .
#!/bin/sh echo echo "****
Pulling changes into Prime [ Hub 's post - update hook ] " echo cd $ HOME / www || exit unset GIT_DIR git pull hub master exec git-update - server - info
post - commit – Prime repository
This hook is called after every commit to send the newly commited changes back up to Hub .
Ideally , it ’s not common to make changes live on the server , but automating this makes sure site history wo n’t diverge and create conflicts .
#!/bin/sh echo echo " **** pushing changes to Hub [ Prime 's post - commit hook ] " echo git push hub
With this hook in place , all changes made to Prime ’s master branch are immediately available from Hub .
Other branches will also be cloned , but wo n’t affect the site .
Because all remote repository access is via SSH urls , only users with shell access to the web server will be able to push and trigger a site update .
Conflicts
This repository - hook arrangement makes it very difficult to accidentally break the live site .
Since every commit to Prime is automatically pushed to Hub , all conflicts will be immediately visible to the clones when pushing an update .
However there are a few situations where Prime can diverge from Hub which will require additional steps to fix .
If an uncommitted edit leaves Prime in a dirty state , Hub ’s post - update pull will fail with an “ Entry ‘ foo ’ not uptodate .
Cannot merge . ” warning .
Committing changes will clean up Prime ’s working directory , and the post - update hook will then merge the un-pulled changes .
If a conflict occurs where changes to Prime ca n’t be merged with Hub , I ’ve found the best solution is to push the current state of Prime to a new branch on Hub .
The following command , issued from inside Prime , will create a remote “ fixme ” branch based on the current contents of Prime :
$ git push hub master : refs / heads / fixme
Once that ’s in Hub , any remote clone can pull down the new branch and resolve the merge .
Trying to resolve a conflict on the server would almost certainly break the site due to Git ’s conflict markers .
Housekeeping
Prime ’s .git folder is at the root level of the web site , and is probably publicly accessible .
To protect the folder and prevent unwanted clones of the repository , add the following to your top - level .htaccess file to forbid web access :
# deny access to the top - level git repository : RewriteEngine On RewriteRule \.git - [ F , L ]
Troubleshooting
If you ’re seeing this error when trying to push to a server repository :
git - receive - pack : command not found fatal :
The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Add export PATH=$ {PATH}:~/ bin to your . bashrc file on the server .
Thanks to Robert for finding and posting the fix .

Readers of his books could only guess at Mr. Terkel ’s interview style .
Listeners to his daily radio show , which was first broadcast on WFMT in 1958 , got the full Terkel flavor as the host , with breathy eagerness and a tough - guy Chicago accent , went after the straight dope from guests like Sir Georg Solti , Toni Morrison and Gloria Steinem .

“ It is n’t an inquisition ; it ’s an exploration , usually an exploration into the past , ” he once said , explaining his approach .
“ So I think the gentlest question is the best one , and the gentlest is , ‘ And what happened then ? ’ ”
Studs Terkel was born in the Bronx on May 16 , 1912 , the third son of Samuel Terkel , a tailor , and the former Anna Finkel , who had emigrated from Bialystok , Poland .
In 1923 the family moved to Chicago .
In the late 1930s , while acting in the theater , Mr. Terkel dropped his given name , Louis , and adopted the name Studs , from another colorful Chicagoan , James T. Farrell ’s fictional Studs Lonigan .
His childhood was unhappy .
His father was an invalid who suffered from heart disease .
His mother was volatile and impetuous , given to unpredictable rages that kept the household on edge .
“ What nobody got from her was warmth and love , or at least not a display of it , ” Mr. Terkel said .
After moving to Chicago , the Terkels managed hotels popular with blue - collar workers , and Mr. Terkel often said that the characters he encountered and the disputations he witnessed at the Wells - Grand Hotel on the Near North Side were his real education .
Although he read avidly and feasted on Roget ’s Thesaurus , he was , by his own reckoning , no scholar .
He earned philosophy and law degrees at the University of Chicago , but after failing a bar exam he worked briefly for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in Chicago , doing statistical research on unemployment in Omaha .
He then found work in Washington counting bonds for the Treasury Department .
When he returned to Chicago in 1938 , Mr. Terkel , who once described his life as “ an accretion of accidents , ” joined the Federal Writers ’ Project , a New Deal program .
He wrote scripts for WGN radio and , after appearing in “ Waiting for Lefty ” at the Chicago Repertory Group , found work in soap operas like “ Ma Perkins ” and “ Road of Life . ”
What he called his “ low , husky , menacing ” voice made him a natural to play heavies .
“ I would always say the same thing and either get killed or sent to Sing Sing , ” he later recalled .
It was while performing with the Chicago Repertory Group that he took the name Studs .
In 1939 he married Ida Goldberg , a social worker from Wisconsin whom he met while they were both with the Chicago Rep .
She died in 1999 .
The couple had one son , Dan Terkell , who altered the spelling of his surname .
Mr. Terkell , who lives in Chicago , is the only immediate survivor .
Michael Jackson
But the ailing star is too weak to be rushed into surgery and may even be fighting for his life , claims Ian Halperin , a former award - winning investigative journalist on America 's respected Rolling Stone Magazine .
Canadian Halperin says Jackson , 50 , has been diagnosed with Alpha 1 - antitrypsin deficiency , a genetic condition that can be fatal in severe cases .
And he claims the singer is now so ill he can barely speak and has lost as much as 95 per cent of the vision in his left eye .
Jackson was photographed in Los Angeles ten days ago visiting a doctor prior to shopping in several of his favourite stores with aides .
The singer , who wore a Long Ranger style mask and Indiana Jones fedora to almost completely hide his face , was able to walk unaided , despite being seen in a wheelchair earlier this year near his home in Las Vegas .
Jackson 's condition has worsened to the point where his quality of life is severely diminished
But Halperin claims Jackson 's lung condition has become more acute , causing the spin - off pulmonary disease emphysema often associated with heavy smokers – even though he has never touched cigarettes .
The writer added : " He has had Alpha 1 - antitrypsin deficiency for years but it 's gotten worse .
He needs a lung transplant but may be too weak to go through with it .
" He also has emphysema and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding , which his doctors have had a lot of trouble stopping .
It 's the bleeding that 's the most problematic part .
It could kill him . "
Jackson 's official spokeswoman would not comment on Halperin 's claims but Jackson 's older brother Jermaine seemed to confirm that the singer has serious health issues .
He told America 's Fox TV news : " He 's not doing so well right now .
This is n't a good time . "
Author Halperin added that Jackson 's lung conditions – which affects only one in 5,000 Americans – has been difficult to treat because of the associated health problems .
He said : " For years , Michael has been working with his own doctors to try to make sure it does n't progress .
He has been on many medications that have stabilized him . "
But as the disease has progressed , Halperin added , Jackson 's condition has worsened to the point where his quality of life is severely diminished .
The author said : " He can barely speak .
Also , the vision in his left eye is 95 per cent gone . "
Marlene Erven , executive director of the American Alpha - 1 Association , which represents sufferers , said : " This is a rare disorder .
There is a protein deficiency that prevents the lungs from being properly protected during the everyday act of breathing .
Patients often develop emphysema and either lung or liver disease , which can be fatal . "
Jackson , whose attorneys revealed he had become dependent on morphine and the potent painkiller Demerol prior to his California trial in 2005 when he was cleared of child molestation , has long been beset by health problems .
Despite flickering hopes of a professional comeback following a self - imposed period of exile in Bahrain , the singer now rarely leaves his rented mansion in Las Vegas .
He was unable to attend a hearing last month at the High Court in London where Bahrainian prince , Sheikh Abdullah was suing him for allegedly failing to honour a $ 7 million business deal .
Jackson , who settled out of court with the prince , revealed earlier this month that he plans to sell off thousands of items of personal memorabilia at a five - day auction beginning on April 21 in Beverly Hills .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Fossil fuels do n't all come from fossils .
Scientists now are developing gasoline that is synthesized from plants that are not so old .
This so - called green gasoline is chemically derived from sugars in corn and other grains or from cellulose found in the tough , woody parts of plants .
Unlike the most common biofuel , ethanol , this new fuel requires no tweaks to a car 's engine .
" It is virtually the same as gasoline from crude oil , " said John Regalbuto , director of the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
" It is a drop - in replacement for what you get at the pump . "
The NSF has funded several projects to develop green gasoline .
One of these converts sugar into gasoline , diesel or jet fuel and is being commercialized by Virent Energy Systems in collaboration with the oil company Shell .
A slightly different process discovered by researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst can brew up gasoline components from wood chips and other plant refuse .
All this new work involves chemical agents called catalysts , which reformulate plant sugars into the energy - packed molecules ( called hydrocarbons ) that fuel our cars , trains and planes .
Catalytic conversions
The catalysts are tiny metal particles usually embedded in a porous material .
Chemical reactions occur on the metal surfaces at a much faster rate than they would in a liquid .
Creating gasoline with catalysts is not new .
Before World War II , the Germans developed a method to chemically derive synthetic fuel ( or synfuel ) from coal .
The same process was resurrected when the oil crisis hit America in the 1970s , but the synfuel market collapsed when crude oil became cheap again in the 1980s .
" No one had the foresight to keep up research and development in these catalytic processes , " Regalbuto told LiveScience .
When oil prices started to climb in recent years , many researchers instead looked to ethanol .
" People have made ethanol for millennia , so that was the first wave of ideas , " Regalbuto said .
Ethanol is fermented from plants in a process that uses enzymes to drive the reactions , not catalysts .
The advantage of enzymes is that they are very selective : they will target one type of molecule .
Catalysts are more generic , so chemists have to be careful that unwanted reactions are not occurring on the catalyst surface .
However , catalysts can work at high temperatures that would typically destroy enzymes .
This allows the reactions to run much faster — more than a million times what they would at room temperature .
Catalysts can also be used over and over , unlike enzymes .
Paradigm shift Regalbuto thinks it 's time for a paradigm shift in the biofuel market from " ethanol with enzymes " to " hydrocarbons with catalysts . "
The main reason is that hydrocarbon fuels , such as gasoline , diesel and propane , pack a lot of energy .
Gasoline supplies 50 percent more energy per gallon than ethanol ( and surprisingly 15 times more energy per mass than TNT ) .
This is why cars running on ethanol get lower gas mileage than when they run on gasoline .
Making hydrocarbons from plant materials is also more efficient than making ethanol .
The primary reason for this , Regalbuto explains , is that removing unwanted water from ethanol production requires energy - intensive distillation , whereas hydrocarbons separate automatically from water .
This efficiency could translate into lower costs .
Virent estimates that a gallon of their green gasoline could be around 20 percent cheaper than a gallon of ethanol made from corn .
Regalbuto predicts that green gasoline of some sort will be at the pump within the next few years .
He realizes that further down the road people may start abandoning gasoline - powered cars for electric vehicles , but the market for hydrocarbons is unlikely to dry up .
" We will still need diesel for big things like trains , planes and boats , " he said .
Analysts say US concern is not with nurturing democracy but oil and gas US Vice - President Dick Cheney has said the US wants to work with Azerbaijan on additional routes for exporting the region 's oil reserves to the West .
He also pledged support for US allies in the former Soviet Union .
A BBC correspondent says the US sees the states as key allies in protecting access to the region 's energy supplies .
Mr Cheney - who will also visit Georgia and Ukraine - spoke as US officials revealed President Bush was to announce a $ 1bn ( £ 0.5 bn ) aid package to Georgia .
Flanked by Azerbaijan 's President Ilham Aliyev , Mr Cheney said : " We 've met this evening in the shadow of the recent Russian invasion of Georgia . "
He said he was bringing " a clear and simple message for the people of Azerbaijan and the entire region : the United States has a deep and abiding interest in your well - being and security " .
But the BBC's Steve Rosenberg , in Moscow , says America 's primary concern is not nurturing democracy in the region but rather oil and gas .
Washington wants to benefit from huge energy deposits in the Caspian Sea , but it does not want all the pipelines heading west through Russia .
One Western - sponsored pipeline is already pumping Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey 's Mediterranean coast .
There are plans for another pipeline to take natural gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia and transporting it from Turkey to Austria .
Our correspondent says that , as far as the US and the EU are concerned , the new pipeline is vital if the West is to avoid becoming too energy dependent on Moscow .
Pledge of support Mr Cheney 's trip is likely to infuriate Moscow , which sees Azerbaijan , Ukraine and Georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
In Georgia , Mr Cheney is expected to stress US support for President Mikhail Saakashvili - the man the Kremlin dismissed on Tuesday as a " political corpse " whose leadership it did not recognise .
Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev has also accused the US of helping Tbilisi build its war machine and called on America to review its relations with the Georgian authorities .
" Unfortunately , at a certain point [ the US ] gave Saakashvili carte blanche for any actions , including military .
All that was translated into aggression , " Mr Medvedev told Italian television .
Fighting between Russia and Georgia began on 7 August after the Georgian military tried to retake the breakaway region of South Ossetia by force .
Russian forces launched a counter - attack and the conflict ended with the ejection of Georgian troops from South Ossetia and Georgia 's other separatist region of Abkhazia .
Russia has since recognised the independence of both regions , though no other country has .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON 
In a propaganda salvo by Al Qaeda aimed at undercutting the enthusiasm of Muslims worldwide about the American election , Osama bin Laden ’s top deputy condemned President - elect Barack Obama as a “ house Negro ” who would continue a campaign against Islam that Al Qaeda ’s leaders said was begun by President Bush .
Appealing to the “ weak and oppressed ” around the world , the Qaeda deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , said in a video released Wednesday that the “ new face ” of America only masked a “ heart full of hate . ”
For years , the terrorist network sought to fuel anti-Americanism with prolific audio and video recordings vilifying President Bush as the leading American “ crusader ” against Muslim nations .
The election of Mr. Obama , a black man who spent part of his childhood in Indonesia and whose father was from a Muslim family , has muddied Al Qaeda ’s message .
The Qaeda leader described the victory by Mr. Obama , who has called for a troop withdrawal from Iraq , as the American people ’s “ admission of defeat in Iraq . ”
But he warned Mr. Obama that the United States risked a reprise of the Soviet Union ’s failures in Afghanistan if the president - elect followed through on pledges to deploy thousands more troops to Afghanistan to carry on the fight against Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies .

TV Talking Heads Eat Their Words ( Except Peter Schiff ) Posted by Pile ( 8662 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Industry ]
[ Pundits ]
Check out this very amusing compilation of videos of various pundits talking about the future of the U.S. Economy and financial markets .
One guy nailed it .
The rest , including Ben Stein and everyone at Fox News , pretty much embarrassed themselves ...
Check out this apocryphal video from 2006 - one guy Peter Schiff knew what was going on :
About Peter Schiff :
Peter D. Schiff is the president of Euro Pacific Capital Inc. , a brokerage firm based in Darien , Connecticut .
Schiff adheres to the principles of the Austrian School of Economics and the Ludwig von Mises Institute .
Schiff frequently appears as a guest on CNBC , Fox News , and Bloomberg Television and is quoted in major financial publications .
Schiff points to the low savings rates of the United States as its worst malady , citing the transformation from being the world 's largest creditor nation in the ' 70s to the largest debtor nation at the turn of 2000 .
His extremely bearish views on the U.S. Dollar , the United States stock market , bond market , and the United States economy have earned him the nickname " Dr. Doom . "
In an August 2006 interview Schiff generated much controversy when he repeated his long - held investment thesis : " The United States economy is like the Titanic and I am here with the lifeboat trying to get people to leave the ship [ Whereas apparently idiots like Ben Stein are on the bow with a bullhorn trying to sell tickets to the next cruise ] ... I see a real financial crisis coming for the United States . "
On May 16 , 2006 in debate on Fox News , Schiff accurately had forecast that the U.S. housing market was a bubble that would soon come to bust .
On December 13 , 2007 in a Bloomberg interview on the show Open Exchange , Schiff further added that he felt that the crisis would extend to the credit card lending industry .
Following this observation , it was soon reported on December 23 , 2007 by the Associated Press that " The value of credit card accounts at least 30 days late jumped 26 percent to $ 17.3 billion in October from a year earlier at 17 large credit card trusts examined by the AP ...
At the same time , defaults -- when lenders essentially give up hope of ever being repaid and write off the debt -- rose 18 percent to almost $ 961 million in October , according to filings made by the trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission . "
Schiff also references the role of the US consumer in the world , saying that the US consumer thinks he 's doing the world a favor by consuming what the rest of the world produces .
He is quick to point - out that this relationship will come to an end , in his view , much sooner than people imagine , and with negative consequences for the US .
Schiff has been quoted as saying : " Consumption is its own reward for Production " -- meaning that without production , the US cannot indefinitely sustain its ongoing consumption .
Schiff , and other adherents of Austrian economics , promote savings and production as " the engine of economic growth -- not consumption . "
Schiff has said on numerous occasions that the current economic crisis is not the problem ; it is the solution .
According to him the transition from borrowing and spending to saving and producing cannot be accomplished without a severe recession , given the current imbalances of the US economy .
But according to him that transition needs to happen .
He also thinks the government is doing no one a favor by trying to " ease the pain " with stimulus packages , bailouts and such .
Schiff believes these actions will only make the situation worse and possibly result in hyperinflation if the government continues to " replace legitimate savings with a printing press . "
UnTitled

BBC News , Buenos Aires
La Plata is a lovely city .
Its central plaza is dominated by a beautiful cathedral , its tree - lined streets are full of interesting shops and quality restaurants .
Some call La Plata the prostitution capital of Argentina
It is a thriving university city and the capital of Buenos Aires province - the largest and wealthiest in Argentina .
But there is also a sinister , sleazy underside to La Plata .
Some call it the prostitution capital of Argentina .
In and around the city there are hundreds of brothels , incongruous from the outside - in residential streets , at the bottom of dirt roads - often only recognisable by a straggly array of coloured light - bulbs or a barely visible name .
Susana Martinez is a former prostitute who now helps to run the Sandra Cabrera health centre in the city .
It is a health centre run by sex workers for sex workers .
It was set up two years ago , with the help of the local authorities , after prostitutes , rent - boys , transvestites and transsexuals complained they were suffering discrimination in the public hospitals .
Sandra Cabrera was a campaigning sex worker killed by the police in a still - unresolved case .
Sex workers ' needs " They would shout things like ' You deal with the whores , ' or ' Look what 's blown in with the rubbish , ' " said Susana .
She added that sex workers also had different medical needs and worked different hours to other people .
The public health system simply was not serving their needs .
A recent study in Argentina also found that one in three people did not know how Aids and the HIV virus were transmitted .
This in a well - informed public after more than 20 years of campaigns and advertising .
So former sex workers , like Susana , and those still working , like Mishel , work with the medical staff at their health centre to build trust with the patients and to educate as well as treat .
" We needed to educate and to make people aware of our specific problems but also to tell them not to discriminate because of the work we do , " said Susana .
Susana Martinez does twice - weekly visits to brothels " One day a colleague told me that our doctor , while doing the check - ups , tried to persuade the girls to leave prostitution and the streets .
" I was angry because we are free to choose .
I 've never told them to stop being doctors and change profession .
" So , as you can see , it was hard work to make everybody aware and respectful . "
She added : " We also had to educate the nurses .
They were terrible .
They 'd come from hospitals where it 's common to shout and maltreat people . "
Many of the prostitutes that come to work in La Plata are from Paraguay and Peru or the poor northern provinces of Argentina .
They are usually young , sometimes too young to have sex legally , and nearly always badly educated and frightened .
Twice a week , Susana does the rounds in a mini-bus , visiting the brothels and talking to the prostitutes .
She distributes condoms and tries to find out how the young girls and boys are doing , how they are being treated .
They can not go everywhere and some places are simply too dangerous for them to visit .
Much of the sex industry in La Plata is operated either outside the law or on the very edges of the law .
Tricked
The health workers asked me not to film or record , to keep my mouth shut and , if asked , say I was from the health ministry .
They knew I was underage .
I got nothing .
Maybe some perfume or a couple of pesos
Mishel
The first place we visited was down a dirt road , outside the city .
Its name was displayed in dull purple lights .
Loud music blared from inside .
There were pool tables , an empty stage and a silver disco globe .
The young owner behind the bar eyed us suspiciously .
Susana , bubbly and friendly , greeted him and the two girls sitting silently on stools at the bar .
One kept her face hidden , the other sipped her drink nervously .
Both wore short skirts and high heels .
It was early and work had not yet begun .
Two men playing pool made phone calls then walked to the far side of the almost empty room .
Susana plonked a bag of condoms on the bar and asked the owner to sign for them , which he did .
Susana asked if she could talk to one of the girls in private and after five minutes returned .
The girl , from Paraguay , was pregnant .
Some are kidnapped and forced into the sex industry .
Others are tricked with offers of jobs as domestic workers or waitresses only , on arrival in Argentina , to have their documents confiscated and their freedom curtailed .
Police involvement
With no money and no ID , there is nowhere to go .
Families back in Paraguay or northern Argentina are poor and often working away from home themselves .
And the local police are some of the main beneficiaries of the industry .
Susana knows where the underage girls and boys are working but , she said , while the authorities are so closely involved in the industry there is nothing they can do to change the situation .
Through their health centre they can at least provide education , protection and condoms - plenty of condoms .
They distribute 20,000 a month , paid for by the local authorities .
After visiting the brothels , we toured the dark streets .
Firstly , the area where the female prostitutes work , then the male ones .
The mini-bus pulls up and Susanna leans out of the window waving a plastic bag full of condoms .
" Protection , condoms ! " she shouts .
Many of the workers know Susana , recognise the van and come sauntering over with a kiss , a joke and a bit of gossip .
Others , new to the city , are more wary .
Susana asks them how they are doing , if they need any help and tells them where the health centre is .
Then we move on to the area where the transvestites and transsexuals work , precarious on high heels , displaying buttocks and breasts , giggling and mocking one another .
" They 're all Peruvians , " said Susana .
Condoms are handed out to sex workers at brothels and on streets According to Mishel , one of the reasons the industry has thrived in La Plata is that the authorities allow it , often encouraging it to do so .
He lives and works in a house in the centre of the city with 13 friends , both men and women , including a married couple .
It is a co-operative .
The rooms are clean , they advertise in local papers and can afford one another some kind of protection .
But the police insist that they too provide protection .
Mishel pays the local force $ 400 a month .
" Otherwise , " he said .
" They 've said they can't protect us . "
" From who ? " I asked him .
" From third parties , " he replied .
" I do n't like it but there 's nothing else I can do if I want to continue working . "
Mishel , like all the sex workers in La Plata , has a story to tell .
He is from a small , conservative town in rural Buenos Aires province .
His relationship with his mother deteriorated when she realised he was gay and , as a young boy , he left for Buenos Aires .
There his only option was to work the streets .
But one day he was picked up by a person who he thought was a client .
He spent the next nine years as a sex slave , forced to sleep with whoever his owners told him to - often servicing guests at the city 's five - star hotels .
" It was wealthy businessmen , " he explained .
" Often foreigners and even diplomats .
They knew I was underage .
I got nothing .
Maybe some perfume or a couple of pesos . "
Powerlessness
He finally escaped and went to live with his brother who was studying in La Plata .
After working for a while in a burger bar , he went back on the street .
It was the only way he could earn enough to study and to pay for his brothers and sisters to study .
The Sandra Cabrera health centre has become a model .
They receive visits from other parts of Argentina and from abroad .
It can do nothing to tackle prostitution in La Plata .
Those , like Susana and Mishel , know the industry only too well , they know it is deeply ingrained in Argentine society and they are powerless to help .
But they do know what problems the city 's sex workers face .
And they do provide some protection , plenty of understanding , medical care and advice and some hope for people living on the margins of an often cruel and uncaring society .

LOS ANGELES 
In a surprise ruling , a federal judge in Los Angeles said he intended to grant 20th Century Fox ’s claim that it owns a copyright interest in the “ Watchmen , ” a movie shot by Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures and set for release in March .
The decision was disclosed in a five - page written order issued on Wednesday .
Gary A. Feess , a judge in the United States District Court for Central California , said he would provide a more detailed order soon .
Fox has been seeking to prevent Warner from releasing the film .
The superhero adventure , based on the “ Watchmen ” graphic novel , is being directed by Zack Snyder ( who also directed “ 300 ” ) and has shaped up as one of most eagerly anticipated releases for next year .
A Warner spokesman , Scott Rowe , declined to comment on the ruling and the studio ’s plans .
At an earlier hearing , the judge said he believed that issues in the case could be settled only at a trial , which was scheduled for late January .
On Wednesday , however , Judge Feess said he had reconsidered and concluded that Fox should prevail on crucial issues .
' It was my job to be seen and not heard , ' reveals Nicole Kidman in an explosive interview about her marriage to Tom Cruise
Stifled : Nicole Kidman , pictured here in LA last month , has spoken out about her marriage to Tom Cruise
For years , Nicole Kidman maintained a dignified silence over her ill - fated marriage to Tom Cruise .
But the actress has finally spilled on life as Mrs Cruise , revealing she lived in her husband 's shadow and sensed it was her job ' to be seen and not heard ' .
The former Hollywood golden couple , who are parents to Isabella , 15 , and Connor , 13 , separated just after their 10th wedding anniversary in 2001 .
She told Glamour magazine she felt stifled during the high - profile marriage : ' I felt I became a star only by association .
I did n't think [ my early movies ] were very good , which is why I would always cower in the background . '
' I thought , I do n't deserve to be here .
We would go to the Oscars and I would think , I 'm here to support him .
' I felt it was my job to put on a beautiful dress and to be seen and not heard . '
Kidman and Cruise first met while making the film Days of Thunder when she was just 22 , and subsequently starred together in Far and Away and the sexually explicit Eyes Wide Shut .
But it was after the split that her career really soared with an acclaimed role in Moulin Rouge and a 2003 best actress Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours .
Her next movie , the highly - anticipated Baz Luhrmann directed drama Australia , is due to be released later this year .
The 41 - year - old is now married to country singer and fellow Australian Keith Urban , with whom she has a 4 - month - old daughter , Sunday Rose .
Kidman says she is now happier than ever : ' I 'm in a place of gratitude and humility .
I touch wood every day .
The journey of life - we all go through it .
' You have love , you lose love , you find new love .
To have love again is a beautiful thing . '
Cruise , 46 , now has a two - year - old daughter Suri with new wife Katie Holmes , who is 17 years his junior .
The devout Scientologist has been accused of being a controlling husband in his current marriage , with his detractors maintaining an an unofficial ' Free Katie ' campaign throughout their relationship .
In his shadow : The former Hollywood golden couple at the Oscars in 2000
Thieves frequently target churches in the Russian countryside
A 200 - year - old church building has disappeared from a village in central Russia , officials from the Russian Orthodox Church say .
The building had stood near the village of Komarovo since 1809 .
It was intact in July but some time in early October thieves made off with it brick by brick , they said .
Local prosecutors had been informed and an investigation was under way , a spokesman for the local Russian Orthodox Church said .
The disappearance of the Church of the Resurrection , some 300 km ( 186 miles ) north - east of Moscow , was not immediately noticed .
It was in an out - of - the - way area and was not being used , although Church officials were considering resuming services there .
Now all that remained of the two - storey building - a school before it was turned over to the Church - were its foundations and some sections of wall , the Church said .
Thieves often target churches in rural Russia .
Religious icons can be sold and church structures sold off for building materials .
Fail and You Yahoo !
Ever since Wonka 's Chocolate Factory in Mountain View started serving queries , it has been a living monument to the failure of Sunnyvale 's Slugworth - and just about everything that has gone wrong can be blamed on Jerry Yang .
From the days of Jerry and David 's Guide to the World Wide Web , Yang has been a constant pain in the ass to anyone with a financial interest in the company .
Not heeding the investors ' advice to take your money and shut the fuck up like David Filo did , Jerry Yang systematically destroyed shareholder value , employee morale , and just the general sense in the industry that anybody at Yahoo ! has their shit together .
Yahoo !
is now on its deathbed as Microsoft is watching through the window , hoping that it does n't get stuck with the funeral arrangements .
Google , in its characteristically understated sense of superiority , has no words , but the enlightened - San - Franciscan - I - told - you - so smirk on its face says it all .
As with the degenerate drug user who took a taste of tina at a party and years later ended up a full blown crystal meth addict living in a park in the Mission , you have to ask :
How did it come to this ?
Failing to Enslave the Oompah Loompahs
From its beginning , Yahoo ! attracted mediocrity in engineering .
Larry Page and Sergey Brin , on the other hand , realized that not only do you need to hire the best engineers to have a successful software company , you also need to make them love you unconditionally .
To cultivate that kind of blind faith , a quality Loompah needs an interesting project .
It may not always make immediate business sense , but it 's the only way , if you want the servitude just right .
Once you 've convinced a Loompah that you really have his best interest at heart , you can put him on a boring , money - making project for a while .
It 's this machinery that has kept Wonka rolling in cash , but made every product beyond Gmail a dud .
An alpha nerd applying for a job at Yahoo !
will likely be turned off by the selection of PHP as a first order programming language .
In the programming world , PHP is considered an “ aw , how cute ” language .
Google uses C++ , which is sure to attract a top - notch engineer whose only way to express his masculinity is the speed with which he can ace an academic recursive programming problem and the condescending modesty he has while explaining the solution .
A good Loompah will be much more stimulated by Google 's interview process than Yahoo !'s .
It is a little known fact that when interviewing for a position in engineering , candidates at Google are not only graded on the efficiency and correctness of their solutions , but also their ability to deliver the answer in the form of a short song and dance routine .
No such evaluation is made at Yahoo !.
Google Loompahs are completely protected from the outside world .
They do n't have to deal with scary things like commuting to work or paying for lunch .
Wonka provides all , and in return , he expects your devotion .
Yahoo !
does n't run a massive transit system to shuttle employees back and forth to work , and they charge for lunch in the cafeteria .
In Silicon Valley , that kind of abusive treatment is just tacky .
This creates the difference between Google - Loompahs and Yahoo !
employees : at Yahoo ! , the managers try to forcibly shackle the employees , while at Google , the Loompahs demand their shackles and will raise hell if they do n't get them .
While hiring issues and entertainment of engineers are n't directly Jerry Yang 's fault , they are still within his general blast radius of failure and set the tone for disasters to come .
As Chief Yahoo ! , nobody was quite sure what Yang was responsible for , but as CEO , it became abundantly obvious what he should n't be responsible for .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Remember all those people who camped out and waited on line at Apple stores to be among the first to snag an iPhone ?
Well , that novelty and feeling of smug superiority might soon wear off if the rumors are true that Apple Inc. may sell its sleek smart phone at Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
I was surprised when I heard the buzz .
Is n't Wal - Mart WMT , - 0.08 % , the discount behemoth with more than 2,500 homogeneous box stores in the U.S. , the antithesis of everything that the unique , design - focused Apple AAPL , - 0.75 % brand stands for ?
Officials at Apple in Cupertino , Calif .
were of no help in confirming the story , but that 's to be expected .
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling declined to comment .
Even so , it does appear that the company , and its service / distribution partner AT&T Inc. T , - 0.28 % will be selling the iPhone at Wal - Mart , possibly later this month , analysts say .
" Our research indicates that recent market reports of Wal - Mart selling Apple 's iPhone 3G appear to be true , though details ( timing , price , etc. ) remain uncertain , " wrote Toni Sacconaghi , a well - regarded analyst at Sanford Bernstein , in a report last week .
As Sacconaghi points out , many key details remain uncertain , including the price .
Some have even speculated that the iPhone would be priced at $ 99 at Wal - Mart , for a lower - end model with a smaller amount of storage -- four gigabytes -- a rumor which was first reported by The Boy Genius blog .
But several analysts have since dismissed the $ 99 price point .
See Boy Genius report here .
Still , even at its current price of $ 199 for the eight - gigabyte iPhone , I wondered if selling the hot smart phone at Wal - Mart would detract from its cachet as the most stylish and sought - after gadget of the year .
Would it become another Motorola Inc. MOT Razr , which was initially a trendy , luxury item but lost its status ?
" It 's probably premature to say whether this will lead to the kind of value erosion that we saw with the Razr , " said Ross Rubin , director of industry analysis with the NPD Group , in an interview .
" A lot of that came from independent dealers and the Internet .
Apple has n't opened up the floodgates ( with its distribution ) .
But the Razr had quite a few years of being positioned as a high - end device before it became a free offering . "
Apple is clearly looking to make the iPhone as mainstream as possible , much as it has done with the iPod , which is now the dominant digital music player in the U.S .
The iPod , which has an entry retail price of $ 49 for an iPod shuffle , now has a 71 % stake of the $ 2.4 billion MP3 market , as of the end of September , according to NPD Group 's retail tracking service .
The iPod can be found at Wal - Mart .
" Apple 's potential partnership with Wal - Mart likely indicates that Apple ultimately wants to drive mass - market adoption of the iPhone ( like it has done with the iPod ) , rather than maintain a high - end positioning ( as in the case of the Mac ) , " Sacconaghi wrote .
Calling a different customer
With the low - priced , high - volume iPod music player , Apple 's distinguishing feature is its iTunes music download service , which hooks consumers in with its simplicity when the two are used together .
As more cell phone makers are now emulating the iPhone 's ease in surfing the Internet , as well as other features like the touch screen in their own smart phones , Apple is banking on applications created just for the iPhone to set the device apart .
Analysts are not yet clear on how much volume Apple would drive initially by selling the iPhone at Wal - Mart .
NPD 's Rubin points out , however , that buying an iPhone is a much more complex purchase than buying a new iPod , because it entails a signing a subscription agreement with a cell phone service provider .
Some budget - conscious Wal - Mart customers might balk at the monthly cost of the service plan for an iPhone , which starts at about $ 70 .
" There are far more considerations that go into the purchase of a cell phone than into the purchase of an MP3 player , " Rubin said .
Many customers are wedded to their current cell phone providers , either through a family plan or through regional coverage issues .
" For Wal - Mart 's customer base , it is a stretch for many of those customers to be considering any smart phone . "
Rubin added that the iPhone 's arrival could also bring new shoppers to Wal - Mart .
Sacconaghi expects a " less - than - proportionate impact " on iPhone sales and is not adjusting his iPhone estimates yet .
He is currently looking for 21.3 million units sold in fiscal 2009 .
" We believe iPhone sales will benefit from the added distribution , though not proportionately , " he noted .
Wal - Mart is the second - largest consumer electronics retailer in the U.S. after Best Buy Stores BBY , +1.51 % .
" Wal - Mart will have a greater impact on the iPhone 's demographic reach in terms of raising awareness and availability among lower - end consumers who are less likely to shop at the Apple Stores or Best Buy . "
So for those waiting for an even lower - priced iPhone , it may not happen this year , even if the iPhone is sold at Wal - Mart .
But Shaw
Wu of Kaufman Brothers Equity Research believes the $ 99 price point is inevitable at some point , as Apple " rounds out its cell phone product line . "
So yes , some of the exclusiveness of the first iPhones will inevitably be lost in the process as the price falls , but is n't that true with all hot new electronics products , thanks to the constant evolution of ever - shrinking semiconductors and storage at the heart of most consumer electronics devices ?
For many of us who take environmental protection into our own hands daily , a bicycle is an indispensible part of the dream .
Throw off those winter blues … bicycling can make your winter green !
Bicycles are an efficient way to transport yourself daily for a number of reasons .
To me , the most important benefit to using a bicycle is that it improves my health and fitness .
Probably the next most important to me is a bike ’s economy .
You pay for occasional maintenance throughout the year , but on the whole , it is far cheaper than using a car , or even travelling by public transportation !
On the environmental front : unlike motor vehicles , bicycles produce no greenhouse gases from their use .
Their parts can often be manufactured from recycled materials .
Overall , while not perfect , bikes make for a significantly smaller footprint than any other existing mode of efficient , long - travel transportation out there .
The distance from my home to my work is 1.8 miles .
( Another good way to think green : move close to your essentials ! )
Walking , that might take me 40 minutes !
But on my bike , I am there in 9 - 12 minutes .
As the nights get longer and the air gets crisper , however , I am reminded that unless I take certain measures , I will soon be prevented from using my bike to get to work by the “ elements . ”
Common enemies to the bicycle include : snow , slush , ice , gravel , and salt .
But if you ’re like me , you strive to think green in all seasons … not just the warm and sunny ones .
Surely , winter is the least popular time to ride bikes–it ’s cold and difficult , and just plain inconvenient !
However , who does n’t need to keep fit in the winter months ?
And with a few quick steps and some basic knowledge , you can equip yourself and your bike with the necessities to keep it sturdy and rideable throughout the winter months .
1. Studded Tires
Combats : ice , snow , slippery surfaces
One of the most important steps you may want to consider when winterizing your bike is making it capable of sticking to the ground when you are riding or turning corners .
Just like getting studded tires for cars , you may want to invest in studded tires for your road bike !
Typically road bike tires have very little traction and are fairly smooth .
Winter tires will have many more substantial nubs , usually with little metal studs in each ( Phattire.com and Penn Cycle give you an idea for these essential winter accessories . )
Before you order or buy them , make sure they will match your tire size by checking the measurements on the rim of your tire ( usually 27 ″ , 26 ″ or 700 ) .
In general , mountain bikes –with their thick , wider , nubby tires –will grip any surface better when it is rough .
Thus , even if you dislike riding mountain bikes on city streets , you may want to consider getting a mountain bike –with studded tires –for the really messy days this winter .
2. Regular Cleaning
Combats : corrosion and griminess due to salt , dirt
It is extremely important that you clean your bike regularly during the winter .
Set aside 30 minutes to an hour a week to thoroughly degrease , scrub , and re-grease your chain ( and you may want to consider cleaning your hubs and bottom bracket too ) .
You ’ll probably be surprised at how much faster black gunk builds up in the wetter winter months !
Simple Green is the standby for any bike mechanic for degreasing .
You ’ll want to use chain lube only for re-greasing your chain , while thicker , turquoise - blue poly lube will work for repacking your bearings in the hub and bottom bracket .
Some people may think the biggest threat to the “ well - being ” of their bicycle is snow , ice , or freezing in the winter months .
Actually , the culprit that can cause the most serious problems is : salt !
Make sure you do not skip this step when keeping your bike “ winterized ” for the cold season .
3. Proper Gear
Combats : your discomfort !
Staying warm when speeding past cars in below freezing temperatures can be a challenge indeed .
While it is necessary to maintain one ’s warmth while travelling , one must be careful not to create conditions where you will overheat due to exertion , sweat , then then chill the water on your skin !
Usually tight fitting “ Thinsulated ” clothing items are needed .
The most important , often overlooked , item is the winter face mask–crucial from keeping your cheeks from chapping !
Also important are appropriate gloves that protect your hands while allowing you to grip your bike , hats , and ear coverings .
I hope you find this list useful as you ride into the great white beyond .
Please consider carefully whether biking is appropriate for your this winter .
As any biker ’s physical safety is more vulnerable when on the road with cars , consider that reduced visibility and slippery road conditions in the winter make for a dangerous situation –you might be winterized , but the car behind you may not be !
Being safe is always more important than living the green dream–at least for now .
See you in the streets !

Here ’s another one of those bizarre stats of the year for you :
Out of the 11,585 U.S. and international stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. , 11,584 have lost money in 2008 , according to fund data through Nov. 20 .
In other words , just one fund has n’t lost money this year — and that is the APX Mid Cap Growth Fund , which was flat through Thursday ’s close .
That ’s right , folks , its return — or lack thereof — is a mere zero thus far in 2008 .
Given that most equity mutual funds are required to be fully ( or 90 % ) allocated , its really no surprise .
But its such a stark statistic , I thought it was worth mentioning .
Pretty wild . . .

Shi Yinhong , a professor of international relations at the People ’s University of China , said Mr. Obama ’s background , particularly his upbringing in Indonesia , made him suited to understanding the problems facing the world ’s poorer nations .
He and others say they hope the next American president will see their place more firmly within the community of nations , engaging in what Jairam Ramesh , junior commerce minister in the Indian government , called “ genuine multilateralism and not in muscular unilateralism . ”
Assuming Mr. Obama does play by international rules more fully , as he has promised , can his government live up to all the expectations ?
“ We have so many hopes and wishes that he will never be able to fulfill them , ” said Susanne Grieshaber , 40 , an art adviser in Berlin who was one of 200,000 Germans to attend a speech by Mr. Obama there in July .
She cited action to protect the environment , reducing the use of force and helping the less fortunate .
In essence , she wants Mr. Obama to make his country more like hers .
But she is sober .
“ I ’m preparing myself for the fact that peace and happiness are not going to suddenly break out , ” she said .
Many in less developed countries — especially in the Arab world — agree that Mr. Obama will not carry out their wishes regarding American policy toward Israel and much else , and so they shrug off the results as ultimately making little difference .
“ We will be optimistic for two months but that ’s it , ” predicted Huda Naim , 38 , a member of the Hamas parliament here who said her 15 - year - old son had watched Mr. Obama ’s rise with rapt attention .
But some remain darkly suspicious of the election itself .
They doubted that Mr. Obama could be nominated or elected .
Now they doubt that he will govern .
The skeptics say they believe that American policy is deeply institutionalized and that if Mr. Obama tries to shift it , “ they ” — the media , the corporate robber barons , the hidden powers — will box him in or even kill him .

Taiwan 's fortunes could be linked to the US slump A senior Chinese official has pledged that China will consider any request for assistance from Taiwan during the current global financial downturn .
Relations between China and the self - governing island it regards as part of its territory have improved since Ma Ying - jeou became Taiwan 's president .
China and Taiwan are already closely linked economically .
China 's economic growth has slowed in recent months , but its leaders still see an opportunity to be grasped .
China is not suffering as much as its neighbours , so it has offered help to South Korea and Hong Kong , and co-operation with Japan as they try to ride out the financial storm .
Tourism request Now China is promising to support the Taiwanese , an important gesture which it no doubt hopes will win it more friends on the island .
Taiwanese firms have invested billions of dollars in China and the island 's reliance on the mainland both as a market for its goods and as a supplier is likely to increase as the US , a key market for Taiwan , continues its economic slump .
The pledge to do more came at a meeting of politicians , academics and business leaders from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait called to discuss ways to co-operate in the financial and service industries .
The Taiwanese responded warmly to the Chinese offer , and urged Beijing to start by making it easier for Chinese tourists to visit the island .

Here 's K - Lo arguing that I cannot be regarded as being anywhere on the spectrum known as " the right " :
He voted for John Kerry .
He endorsed Barack Obama .
It remains a mystery to me why Andrew Sullivan is described as on the Right or a conservative .
That 's not me being McCarthyite .
I just think words have meanings .
You will notice no mention of any actual policy or philosophical positions .
The criteria are entirely about party loyalty .
But I endorsed Kerry , given the fiscal and foreign policy recklessness of Bush , as " the conservative choice - for a difficult and perilous time . "
Many other conservatives found Bush 's first term repellent as well .
I can see why some would disagree with me .
But conservatives pondering the Bush - Rove wreckage might ask themselves whether Bush 's re-election was , in fact , a good thing for conservatism .
I wrote my own defense of conservatism in my book .
It seems to me that if K - Lo wants to dispute my arguments as unconservative , she should read the book and explain her differences .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The two were fierce rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination US President - elect Barack Obama is " on track " to nominate Hillary Clinton as secretary of state within a week , according to US media reports .
A Democratic Party official was quoted as saying the move would be made public after next week 's Thanksgiving holiday .
The two sides have worked out financial disclosure issues regarding her husband Bill Clinton 's charitable activities , the party official reportedly said .
The former president has offered to allow ethics reviews of his charities .
Mr Clinton has an international charitable foundation with operations in dozens of countries .
This latest move is seen as an attempt to address questions about whether his philanthropic activities would create conflicts of interest if his wife got the job .
KEY APPOINTMENTS
Chief of staff : Rahm Emanuel , a deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton Senior advisers : David Axelrod , Valerie Jarrett , Peter Rouse and John Podesta ( formerly chief of staff to Bill Clinton ) Press secretary : Robert Gibbs White House counsel : Greg Craig , formerly special counsel to Bill Clinton Vice - president 's chief of staff : Ron Klain , formerly chief of staff to Al Gore Staff secretary : Lisa Brown , formerly counsel to Al Gore
Obama 's team so far
There has been mounting speculation that Mr Obama would offer the New York senator the role of America 's top diplomat since a meeting between the two a week ago was reported .
Neither Mrs Clinton nor Mr Obama has confirmed the reports .
But an aide to Mr Obama 's transition team said the two had had substantive conversations about the job , the Associated Press news agency reports .
Mrs Clinton would have to give up her Senate seat , which she has held for eight years , to take up the position .
Recognition Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama fought a long and often bitter campaign to be the Democratic Party 's presidential candidate .
TOP CABINET CONTENDERS
Secretary of state : Hillary Clinton Health secretary : Tom Daschle Attorney general : Eric Holder , deputy attorney general under Bill Clinton Homeland security : Janet Napolitano National security adviser : General James Jones
Clinton at State Department ?
But after losing out on the nomination , she endorsed his bid for the presidency and campaigned for his election .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the appointment of Hillary Clinton would likely heal the rift inside the Democratic party caused by the bruising primary campaign .
Mr Obama would also come across as a confident leader , not afraid to reach out to rivals and surround himself with strong personalities , our correspondent says .
The economic crisis will be a priority for Mr Obama at the start of his presidency .
But with the US involved in two wars , in Iraq and Afghanistan , the former first lady would be able to hit the ground running on foreign policy , our correspondent says .
She would have instant international stature and recognition as secretary of state , and world leaders would welcome her , Kim Ghattas says .
However , with a vice - president as well - steeped in foreign policy as Joseph Biden , careful consideration needs to go into how the two will work together , our correspondent adds .
If a deal fails , other names touted for the post in the US media include Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , who ran for president in 2004 , and New Mexico 's governor Bill Richardson .

The concept of a " burden of proof " is important in debates — whoever has a burden of proof is obligated to " prove " their claims in some fashion .
If someone does n't have a burden of proof , then their job is much easier : all that is required is to either accept the claims or point out where they are inadequately supported .
It is therefore no surprise that many debates , including those between atheists and theists , involve secondary discussions over who has the burden of proof and why .
When people are unable to reach some sort of agreement on that issue , it can be very difficult for the rest of the debate to accomplish much .
Therefore , it is often a good idea to try to define in advance who has the burden of proof .
Proving vs. Supporting Claims
The first thing to keep in mind is that the phrase " burden of proof " is a bit more extreme than what is often needed in reality .
Using that phrase makes it sound like a person has to definitely prove , beyond a doubt , that something is true ; that , however , is only rarely the case .
A more accurate label would be a " burden of support " — the key is that a person must support what they are saying .
This can involve empirical evidence , logical arguments , and even positive proof .
Which of those must be presented will depend very much upon the nature of the claim in question .
Some claims are easier and simpler to support than others — but regardless , a claim without any support is not one which merits rational belief .
Thus , anyone making a claim that they consider rational and expect others to accept must provide some support .
Support Your Claims !
An even more basic principle to remember here is that some burden of proof always lies with the person who is making a claim , not the person who is hearing the claim and who may not initially believe it .
In practice , then , this means that the initial burden of proof lies with those on the side of theism , not with those on the side of atheism .
Both the atheist and the theist probably agree on a great many things , but it is the theist who asserts the further belief in the existence of a deity .
This extra claim is what must be supported , and the requirement of rational , logical support for a claim is very important .
The methodology of skepticism , critical thinking , and logical arguments is what allows us to separate sense from nonsense ; when a person abandons that methodology , they abandon any pretense of trying to make sense or engage in a sensible discussion .
The principle that the claimant has the initial burden of proof is often violated , however , and it is n't unusual to find someone saying , " Well , if you do n't believe me , prove me wrong , " as if the lack of such proof automatically confers credibility on the original assertion .
Yet that simply is n't true — indeed , it 's a fallacy commonly known as " Shifting the Burden of Proof . "
If a person claims something , they are obligated to support it and no one is obligated to prove them wrong .
If a claimant cannot provide that support , then the default position of disbelief is justified .
We can see this principle expressed in the United States justice system where accused criminals are innocent until proven guilty ( innocence is the default position ) and the prosecutor has the burden of proving the criminal claims .
Technically , the defense in a criminal case does n't have to do anything — and occasionally , when the prosecution does an especially bad job , you will find defense lawyers who rest their case without calling any witnesses because they find it unnecessary .
Support for the prosecution claims in such cases is deemed to be so obviously weak that a counter - argument simply is n't important .
Defending Disbelief
In reality , however , that rarely happens .
Most of the time , those required to support their claims do offer something — and then what ?
At that point the burden of proof shifts to the defense .
Those who do not accept the support offered must at the very least show just cause for why that support is insufficient to warrant rational belief .
This may involve nothing more than poking holes in what has been said ( something defense attorneys often do ) , but it is often wise to construct a sound counter - argument which explains evidence better than the initial claim does ( this is where the defense attorney mounts an actual case ) .
Regardless of exactly how the response is structured , what is important to remember here is that some response is expected .
The " burden of proof " is not something static which one party must always carry ; rather , it is something that legitimately shifts during the course of a debate as arguments and counter - arguments are made .
You are , of course , under no obligation to accept any particular claim as true , but if you insist that a claim is n't reasonable or credible , you should be willing to explain how and why .
That insistence is itself a claim which you , at that moment , have a burden to support !
I 've heard from a source that the reason it takes so long to copy media to the iPhone is flash 's slow write speeds .
I mention this because the relatively slow write speed of flash can be a bottleneck in certain circumstances , even though write operations are typically " fire and forget . "
A new technology from SanDisk , however , claims to boost flash 's random write speeds by up to 100 times under certain conditions .
SanDisk is also proposing two new metrics that the company feels will help customers compare flash to magnetic storage alternatives .
Write faster
SanDisk 's new ExtremeFFS aims to address write speed issues using a version of the TrueFFS technology that the memory maker acquired when it bought M-systems , a flash technology company .
To understand how ExtremeFFS works , you first need to know more about flash 's write limitations .
More recent flash versions have much - improved write speeds , but NAND flash will always be challenged in this regard because the way that writes work with the technology .
Specifically , in order to write data to a nonempty flash sector , you must first erase that sector and then write to the newly empty spot .
This erase - before - write requirement means that on a basic level , flash writes are slow because they often take two operations to complete .
The problem is worse for random writes than it is for streaming writes , because a single erasure of one large section of storage can accommodate a batch of multiple writes ; contrast this to random writes , where each individual write must first be preceded by an individual erase .
In addition to the erase / write issue , which I 've actually oversimplified here , flash 's speeds are also affected by the amount of software that it takes to actually manage the physical aspects of the technology .
In a nutshell , most operating systems and filesystem drivers expect for a mass storage device to be structured like a hard disk , i.e. , addressable using cylinders and sectors .
Flash , however , is arranged in the typical RAM grid structure , which means that on a basic level there must be a mechanism for mapping the OS model of filesystem locations onto the physical flash hardware .
The general concept also applies to ExtremeFFS TrueFFS mapping , from a whitepaper on the topic .
The general concept also applies to ExtremeFFS
In the case of ExtremeFFS , this OS - to - physical mapping is not static .
Rather , the controller and software work with the flash to do dynamic mapping , so that related file blocks are clustered together for maximum streaming read performance , and random erase / write operations are distributed based on a number of reliability and performance factors .
In regard to the latter , random writes can be cached and then actually written to the disk at the optimal time and location in order to cut down on the number of erases per write .
The TrueFFS stack , again applicable to ExtremeFFS
ExtremeFFS can also do a few more tricks , like doing housekeeping and garbage collection chores ( marking bad blocks and actually erasing blocks marked as " empty " ) simultaneously with regular reads and writes .
Finally , the software can learn a user 's data access patterns , so that data is eventually arranged for maximum efficiency .
This latter feature — the user pattern learning — seems like it will be especially hard to pick up with benchmarks , and SanDisk 's press release acknowledges as much .
But if it works , there has to be some way to measure it , so I 'm anxious to get our hands on one of these drives and see if we can quantify the effect .
New metrics
SanDisk is concerned that the current crop of hard drive - oriented metrics by which consumers judge storage devices are ill - suited to SSDs , and I happen to agree .
However , I 'm not entirely sure that the two new metrics that the company has proposed are what the doctor ordered .
Both of these " metrics " are n't really metrics as much as they are " ratings , " like AMD 's erstwhile Performance Ratings .
In performance case , the rating is " vRPM , " for " virtual revolutions per minute , " and it's an attempt by SanDisk to say " this is how fast you 'd have to spin a hard drive to get this same level of performance . "
The vRPM rating is by plugging an SSD 's read operations per second and write operations per second into a formula , which spits out a fake RPM number .
If this sounds kind of contorted and pointless , that 's because it is .
Hard drive RPMs are only a general proxy for relative drive performance , so it 's not at all clear why anyone would want to take actual performance data ( ops per second measurements ) and then convert it into a number that 's a proxy for the performance of a different type of device .
But this is what SanDisk proposes to do .
( Good luck with that . )
The company 's second proposed rating is called long - term data endurance ( LDE ) , and it represents an attempt to quantify for users how much data can be written to a device over the course of its lifetime .
The basic LDE unit is " terabytes written , " or TBW , so that the owner of an SSD with an LDE of 40TBW can expect to be able to write up to 40 TB of data to it before it 's worn out .
By way of example and justification , SanDisk 's LDE whitepaper contains the following quite telling quote :
If a user has some idea of how many GBs / day he writes on the average , he can estimate the actual usable lifetime for him from dividing LDE by his average daily usage .
For example , if a drive has a LDE of 40TBW and the user writes 10 GB per day , then LDE is not exhausted in the first 10 years .
Raise your hand if you have even a ballpark idea of how many GB per day you write to your hard drive .
I thought so .
Still , in spite of the fact that this LDE rating appears to be relatively worthless , it has the distinct advantage of appearing to be informative and important .
I mean , who does n't want to be able to write more terabytes , even if they have no idea how many they 're writing today ?
For this reason , I give LDE better odds of success than vRPM , and it may become the MTBF of the SSD world .
( Before you write in , I know that MTBF numbers are made up and generally pointless , which was the point of equating them with LDE numbers . )

Fish oil supplements given to pregnant mums boost the hand - eye coordination of their babies as toddlers , reveals a small study published ahead of print in the Archives of Disease in Childhood ( Fetal and Neonatal Edition ) .
The researchers base their findings on 98 pregnant women , who were either given 4g of fish oil supplements or 4g of olive oil supplements daily from 20 weeks of pregnancy until the birth of their babies .
Only non-smokers and those who did not routinely eat more than two weekly portions of fish were included in the study .
Eighty three mothers completed the study .
Once the children had reached two and a half years of age , they were assessed using validated tests to measure growth and development .
These included tests of language , behaviour , practical reasoning and hand - eye coordination .
In all , 72 children were assessed ( 33 in the fish oil group and 39 in the olive oil group ) .
There were no significant overall differences in language skills and growth between the two groups of children
But those whose mothers had taken fish oil supplements scored more highly on measures of receptive language ( comprehension ) , average phrase length , and vocabulary .
And children whose mothers had taken fish oil supplements scored significantly higher in hand - eye coordination than those whose mothers had taken the olive oil supplements .
This finding held true even after taking into account other potentially influential factors , such as the mother 's age and duration of breast feeding .
High cord blood levels of omega 3 fatty acids at birth ( from fish oil ) were strongly associated with good hand - eye coordination , while low levels of omega 6 fatty acids , found in many vegetable oils , were not .
Prompted by concerns about mercury content in certain types of fish , pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplements are becoming increasingly popular , say the authors .
The findings show that relatively high doses of omega 3 rich fish oil supplements in the second half of pregnancy do not seem to have any adverse effects on neurodevelopment or growth , they add .

Python 3 : An end to Unicode Problems ?
One of the major changes in Python 3 is that there are now only Unicode strings .
There is a bytes type for when you are dealing with binary data , but when you are dealing with text it is always Unicode .
There is a corresponding change to the Python I / O system so that files opened in text mode return decoded strings and in binary mode they return bytes .
Compared to many languages the support for Unicode in Python 2 is pretty good .
So long as you obey the straightforward rules that you always decode data to Unicode when you receive it , and encode when you need to write it ( always specifying the encoding of course ) then Unicode strings in Python 2 work very well .
The problem is that by having the default string type ( str ) as a byte string the language is virtually begging you to write code that falls over as soon as it has to cope with non-ascii characters or multi- byte encodings .
Even if you are careful it is very easy for byte strings to slip through ( particularly when dealing with third party libraries that are n't as fastidious as you ) .
As soon as you have a mix of Unicode and byte strings you risk an implicit decoding operation , which will use the default encoding ( probably ascii ) and possibly failing loudly .
What Python 3 brings to Python is internal consistency .
You can no longer cause encoding related errors by adding Unicode and byte - strings .
Whenever you have text you have strings that are represented internally as Unicode .
No need to worry about that any more .
What it does n't mean is that you do n't have to worry about encodings , or even cross - platform issues .
In fact it is likely to be a cause of some fun cross - platform issues .
What Python 3 does by default is read and write using the platform default encoding .
On a Mac that will be ' mac - roman ' and on Windows in the UK it will be something like CP1252 .
Very different encodings .
This means that if you have program files stored as text that were created on one system and then read them from another system , by default they will be decoded with a completely different encoding .
Take a file like this created and then read on the Mac :
>> > d = ' \ u20ac '
>> > open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' ) . write ( d )
>> > d = open ( ' test.txt ' ) . read ( )
>> > [ ord ( c ) for c in d ]
[ 8364 ]
If we take the same file and then read it with Python 3 on Windows :
>> > d = open ( ' test.txt ' ) . read ( )
>> > [ ord ( c ) for c in d ]
[ 219 ]
And this is because :
Mac
>> > h = open ( ' test.txt ' )
>> > h .
encoding
' mac-roman '
Windows
>> > h = open ( ' test.txt ' )
>> > h .
encoding
' cp1252 '
The answer to this is that in fact now that we are always decoding when we read a file in as text ( or writing text out to a file ) , it is even more important that we are aware of the encoding being used .
If we are only ever using this file on the current system then maybe we do n't need to worry , but if we ever need to read data that might have been created on another system then we had better know what encoding was used .
The solution : the open function takes an optional encoding parameter :
>> > h = open ( ' test.txt ' , encoding = ' utf - 8 ' )
>> > h = open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' , encoding = ' utf - 8 ' )
Private Members in Python and C# : You Don't Really Need Them and You Can't Really Have Them
A while ago I wrote a mildly controversial blog entry about the way the Python community responds to certain questions : You Don't Really Need It
One of the issues I talked about was the fact that Python has no concept of private members .
It does provide name mangling when your member names start with a double underscore .
This is intended to be used for avoiding name collisions in subclasses .
In Python the strong convention is that member names that start with a single underscore are private and should n't be used outside the class .
This worries developers who come from a background in statically typed languages , where the default is usually for everything to be private .
As well as the nervousness that naturally comes from having your privates exposed , some feel that this violates encapsulation and means that Python is n't truly object - oriented .
Of course Python encapsulates data and methods as objects , it is merely a translucent encapsulation .
In practise this just does n't seem to be a problem .
In Python you can ( ab ) use name mangling ( or other tricks like data access through closures ) that make it inconvenient for developers to access private data and methods .
However , Python has such simple to use introspection capabilities that these are almost always trivial to get around .
However , most static languages also provide introspection .
In C# this is called reflection , and though it is damn inconvenient to use , it is there and can be used to access / modify private members .
In fact , not only is it available , it is also the recommended way to overcome certain difficulties .
Take the following situation that Christian and Orestis encountered at work the other day .
By default when making web requests with WebClient .
DownloadString it raises an exception if the server sends non RFC compliant headers .
Unfortunately such rarely - encountered sites as the Yahoo finance sites do this .
You can specify in your app.config file that you are happy to accept non-compliant headers ( useUnsafeHeaderParsing ) , but there is no direct API to set this .
If you need to change this setting at runtime you use something similar to this wonderfully horrible piece of reflection ( shown as IronPython code ) :
import System
from System import Array
from System .
Reflection import Assembly , BindingFlags
typeName = " System.Net.Configuration.SettingsSectionInternal "
def setUnsafeHeaderParsing ( ) :
settingsAsm = Assembly .
GetAssembly ( System .
Net .
Configuration .
SettingsSection )
if settingsAsm is not None :
settingsType = settingsAsm .
GetType ( typeName )
if settingsType is not None :
instance = settingsType .
InvokeMember ( " Section " ,
BindingFlags .
Static | BindingFlags .
GetProperty | BindingFlags .
NonPublic ,
None , None , Array [ object ] ( [ ] ) )
if instance is not None :
useUnsafeHeaderParsing = settingsType .
GetField ( " useUnsafeHeaderParsing " ,
BindingFlags .
NonPublic | BindingFlags .
Instance )
if useUnsafeHeaderParsing is not None :
useUnsafeHeaderParsing .
SetValue ( instance , True )
return True
return False
This modifies the same hidden setting that would be set from app.config .
Note
This is mainly an example of why private is n't really private in C#.
Miguel de Icaza does n't like it as an example though : " Bad advice .
That hack will for starters not work with mono , silverlight or iphone and will easily break on upgrades . "
" It wo n't work with a stronger security setting ( sl ) .
For individual cases like your sample you can c /p mono code . "
So in C# your privates are also exposed , all you do is make life more painful for the developer who really does need access to them .
Here 's to not making life painful for us poor beleaguered developers .
To end with , here is a quote from an excellent article ( not at all about Python ) on how a strong focus on testing ( essential for any developer with a genuine commitment to quality ) challenges your conventions :
" 3 . Private makes less sense than it used to ...
Get used to living in a more public world . "
Integers Can't Handle Floats
This surprised Glenn and me at work the other day :
Python 2.6 ( trunk : 66714 : 66715 M , Oct 1 2008 , 18 : 36 : 04 )
[ GCC 4.0 .1 ( Apple Computer , Inc . build 5370 ) ] on darwin
Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information .
>> > a = 6
>> > a . __sub__ ( 2.0 )
NotImplemented
Python integers do n't know how to subtract floats from themselves !
This is because the result needs to be a float .
Instead , when you subtract a float from an integer , the integer returns NotImplemented , which causes the Python interpreter to call the __rsub__ method on the float - that then does the subtraction and returns a new float .
>> > a = 6
>> > b = 2.0
>> > b . __rsub__ ( a )
4.0
The reason that it caught us out is that in Resolver
One we have some spreadsheet objects that need to behave like numeric objects under certain circumstances ( for compatibility with Excel you need to be able to treat cell ranges that only cover a single cell as if they were the value of the cell they contain ) .
We were taking a shortcut to achieve this .
Rather than implementing all the numeric protocol methods by hand we attached a bunch of functions that delegate to the corresponding bound method of the object they hold as values .
In IronPython 1 this worked fine , but IronPython 2 has got more compatible with CPython - and when we call the bound subtraction method of an integer with a float it calls the float __rsub__ with our cellrange .
Unsurprisingly floats do n't know how to do arithmetic with cell ranges ...
The nice and simple ( and cleaner ) solution was to stop delegating to bound methods and instead use the numeric functions from the operator module that provide full Python semantics for numerical operations .
Python 2.6 and Executable Zipfiles
A new feature that was quietly sneaked into Python 2.6 , without the fanfare it deserves , is the ability to distribute Python applications as executable zipfiles .
Python has long had support for importing modules and packages from zipfiles - through the oh - so - badly - needed - in - Iron Python zipimport .
What is new is the ability to make zip archives executable .
If you call the Python 2.6 + ( or 3.0 + ) interpreter passing in a zip file instead of a Python file - the interpreter looks inside the zip file for a Python file named __main__.py ( at the top - level ) and executes it .
The zip file can also contain all the ( pure - Python only ) modules and packages your app depends on .
This is a great way of distributing applications as a single file .
The nice thing is that the Python interpreter does n't depend on the extension to recognise zipfiles , instead recognising them automagically .
This means that on Windoze you can give these archives a new extension ( perhaps '. pyz ' ) and associate them with Python 2.6 - allowing Windows to execute them automatically when you double click on them in explorer .
I think , but am not 100 % certain , that the zipfile specification is flexible enough that you could also prepend a pound - bang ( ' # !' ) interpreter line to make them executable under Mac OS X and Lunix type platforms .
michael$ echo > __main__.py " print ' Hello world ' " michael$ python __main__.py
Hello world michael$ zip test.zip __main__.py adding : __main__.py ( stored 0 % ) michael$ python test.zip Hello world
UPDATE : Floris Bruynooghe notes in the comments that you can add a hash - bang line to a zipfile and make it executable :
$ cat > __main__.py print ( ' hi there ' ) ^D $ zip test.zip __main__.py adding : __main__.py ( stored 0 % ) $ cat > hashbang.txt #!/usr/bin/env python3.0 ^D
$ cat hashbang .
txt test.zip > my_exec $ chmod +x my_exec $ ./ my_exec hi there $
Join the Glorious Python Programming Revolution
Ars Technica has a new article on learning Python :
The article itself is kind of meh , merely linking to six of the most well known online Python tutorials , but what is interesting is their rationale for promoting Python :
" Recently , Google has stepped up its presence in the cloud computing arena .
Google 's new App Engine ( aka " AppSpot " ) lets you design and run web applications using Google 's existing infrastructure . "
" At this time , App Engine uses Python as its primary programming language .
Although Google is investigating other languages for future releases , if you want to get started with App Engine , you 'll need to first master the Python scripting language . "
Overwhelmingly the best part of the article is the image they use ...
Ars Technica have a real problem with puns when doing articles on Python .
Take their article introducing Python 3 for example :
Thissss article is pretty good , but as expected Python 3 is causing controversy both inside and outside the Python community .
People wonder if the benefits of breaking backwards compatibility are worth the potential confusion it causes .
The very best response I 've seen is the following blog entry by James Bennett .
It kicks off with a fantastic introduction that has nothing to do with Python but should be read by programmers and business managers of every strain .
Back to Ars Technica , they will always have a place in my heart .
They 've done a fantastic series of articles on the history and technology of the Amiga computer ( the first ' desktop ' computer with a pre-emptive multitasking operating system being one of the jewels in its crown of glory ) .
If , like me , you are nostalgic for the beautiful usability of this machine ( both as a user and a developer ) then you 'll love this series .

Spam Volumes Drop by Two - Thirds After Firm Goes Offline
The volume of junk e-mail sent worldwide plummeted on Tuesday after a Web hosting firm identified by the computer security community as a major host of organizations engaged in spam activity was taken offline .
( Note : A link to the full story on McColo 's demise is available here . )
Experts say the precipitous drop - off in spam comes from Internet providers unplugging McColo Corp. , a hosting provider in Northern California that was the home base for machines responsible for coordinating the sending of roughly 75 percent of all spam each day .
In an alert sent out Wednesday morning , e-mail security firm IronPort said :
In the afternoon of Tuesday 11/ 11 , IronPort saw a drop of almost 2/3 of overall spam volume , correlating with a drop in IronPort 's SenderBase queries .
While we investigated what we thought might be a technical problem , a major spam network , McColo Corp. , was shutdown , as reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday evening .
Spamcop.net 's graphic shows a similar decline , from about 40 spam e-mails per second to around ten per second -- if I 'm reading that graphic correctly .
A number of other spam - fighters today reported a similar drop in junk e-mail volumes .
I heard from a reader named Martin who works at a small hosting facility in Germany .
He wrote in after noticing a lack of spam banging on his company 's e-mail servers .
He sent in this graphic and asked that we not use his full name or identify his employer .
Security Fix reader
Ted wrote in to say his small Internet service provider also charted a massive collapse in spam volumes yesterday and into today .
Ted , who also requested we use only his first name , writes :
Dear Mr. Krebs ,
Thank you for your outstanding contribution to bringing down McColo Corp .
I can clearly see the impact you 've had , by looking at the spam graph of the small ISP which hosts the web site [ omitted ] for me :
The daily 15 minute graph reports the rate of spam over a 29 hour period .
Time is UTC .
As I write , it is about 12:00 UTC , and detected spam is arriving at less than half the rate of the same time yesterday .
The world saw a similar -- if short - lived -- drop in spam volumes in September , following the demise of Intercage , a.k.a.
" Atrivo , " another Northern California based ISP that security experts identified as a major source of badness online .
In that case , it only took the spammers a few days to find a new home .
It seems likely that the same will happen in this case as well , and that this minor victory will be short but sweet .
Nilesh Bhandari , product manager with IronPort , said the company sees an average of about 190 billion spam e-mails each day .
Then , at around 4:30 p.m. ET yesterday , IronPort saw a huge decline in spam levels .
For the 24 hour period ending Tuesday , the company tracked about 112 billion spam messages .
Bhandari said he expects the spam volume to recover to normal levels in about a week , as the spam operations that were previously hosted at McColo move to a new home .
" We 're seeing a slow recovery , " Bhandari .
" We fully expect this to recover completely , and to go into the highest ever spam period during the upcoming holiday season . "
Thom Hartmann of radio’s Air America was a guest on Countdown last week to discuss what is happening with the bailout ( or lack of a bailout ) of the auto industry .
David Shuster talks to Thom Hartmann about the GOP ’s decision to tell the industrial midwest to go to hell .
Hartmann breaks down the reasons the GOP to wants to bust unions and explains how this movement started under Ronald Reagan .
He also has some suggestions for Barack Obama to get the economy back on track , and one is to read Alexander Hamilton ’s Report on Manufacturers from 1791 .

Oct. 27 , 2008  --
The McCain campaign is definitely demoralized right now .
The blame game has begun .
There is no question that there is a rift between Sarah Palin 's camp and that of John McCain inside the Republican campaign , sources tell ABC News .
And you are seeing people within the McCain campaign starting to look to the future .
Not only Palin , but many of the McCain staffers , as well , are circulating their resumes and pointing the finger .
Whenever people in the campaign are starting to worry more about their own reputations rather than whether they 're going to win in seven days , there is a significant problem .
GOP Rift Between McCain and Palin Camps
Palin is going to be the most vivid chapter of the McCain campaign 's post - mortem .
McCain argued Monday that he " could n't be more proud " of his running mate .
However , there is a significant rift inside the McCain campaign .
Those loyal to McCain believe they have been unfairly blamed for over - handling Palin .
They say they did the best they could with what they got .
They point to the bounce in the polls McCain got when he announced Palin as his running mate , her Republican convention speech , and her first interview with ABC's Charles Gibson .
What did n't work were the limited , subsequent media interviews , most notably between Palin and CBS anchor Katie Couric .
But some McCain camp insiders tell ABC
News they simply could n't put Palin out in front of the media any more than they did because she was n't ready .
The Palin camp is fighting back , arguing that if the McCain campaign had just let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin , she would have done just fine on her own .
The Alaska governor herself has been pushing out on her own against McCain 's handlers .
In recent days she has been speaking her own mind about what she thought of McCain 's strategy in Michigan , and what she thought of his decision not to go after Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
And we 're seeing more and more of that in the closing days of the campaign .
Obama Tries to Boost Turnout , Momentum
Officials from both the Obama and McCain campaigns tell ABC News they believe there is very little that either candidate can do to change the trajectory of the race .
Unless one of them makes a major mistake , nothing they can say or do will affect them one way or the other .
Now , it 's all about turnout and momentum .
Barack Obama is leading McCain 52 - 45 in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
The only thing the Obama campaign is worried about right now is voter complacency , over - confidence , or that the idea that Obama is winning somehow energizes and mobilizes Republican voters .
McCain Looks to Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania is the only big Democratic - leaning state than McCain has a chance of turning around now , although he trails Obama 53 - 40 in the latest Pennsylvania poll by Morning Call / Muhlenberg College .
If McCain does n't win Pennsylvania 's 21 electoral votes , he would have to run the table and win all eight of the competitive states that were held by President Bush in 2004 , including Virginia , Florida , Ohio , Colorado , Missouri , Indiana , North Carolina , and Nevada .
That 's very , very tough for McCain to do .
The only way he has more paths to 270 electoral votes is if he can flip Pennsylvania and turn it around -- that would give him more leeway .
If you take all four of these states that will be decided relatively early on Election Night next Tuesday -- Pennsylvania , Virginia , Ohio , and Florida -- McCain has to win three out of four of those states to even have a chance of getting to 270 electoral votes .
Even that is a necessary but not sufficient condition for him .
That shows what he's up against because he 's behind in all four of these key battleground states right now .
Even more dire for McCain , the Republicans even started to advertise this week in Montana , which should be a solid Republican state .

Republican Vice - Presidential candidate Governor Sarah Palin's ( R - AK ) daughter Bristol attends the third session of the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota with boyfriend Levi Johnston September 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) -
The mother of an 18 - year - old man who plans to marry Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s pregnant daughter , Bristol , has been arrested on drug charges , authorities said on Friday .
Sherry Johnston , 42 , was taken into custody at her home in Wasilla , Alaska , on Thursday after an undercover narcotics investigation , Alaska State Troopers said in a statement .
She faces six counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance , said trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters .
She was released on $ 5,000 bail shortly after her arrest .
All the charges are felonies .
Peters declined to release any further information about the case , saying police needed to protect the investigation .
Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee in the 2008 election , revealed during the campaign her 18 - year - old daughter was pregnant and that Levi Johnston was the father .
The two have said they plan to marry and Bristol Palin is due to give birth this weekend .
I went downtown to St. Paul in order to get some pictures and observe the situation ( I already protested on Monday ) , but John Ireland Bridge was blocked by the police with dump trucks when I got there .
The cops said there was a bomb threat to the Minnesota Historical Society , but that was quite clearly a lie since they were standing so close to it and they ’d already closed the other bridges as I found out later .
So I went over to the capitol on foot using the Marion Street Bridge instead .
I saw more cops than protesters .
The cops had the city in a headlock .
All the other bridges were closed by the police ; cops , BCA agents and national guardsman were everywhere .
St. Paul was on fucking lockdown .
By the time I found out how totally heavy - handed the police presence was I was getting tired and decided to split .
I was trying to get back to my car on the other side of the Marion street bridge when I saw a group about 200 protesters approaching the bridge .
That ’s why I ’m walking against the flow at the beginning of the video .
Unfortunately I was too busy trying to get good footage and did n’t notice the cops had surrounded us on all sides .
Soon the police started firing flash grenades , smoke bombs and generally scaring the shit out of me and all these peaceful protesters .
We were corraled onto the bridge where they told us we were all under arrest , but not before all of us were shellshocked by the overwhelming police response .
Watch the video , but beware that it ’s intense , chaotic and there ’s swearing and explosions .
Notice how none of the protesters resisted or attacked the cops in any way .
This is ironic because we were charged with “ resisting a lawful order ” along with the 1st amendment - killing crime of “ presence at an unlawful assembly . ”
Whatever happened to the right of people to peaceably assemble ?
We are not free ; The Bill of Rights is no longer operative .
If you are n’t reading this from jail that simply means the cops have n’t bothered to arrest you on trumped up charges yet .
They can clearly do exactly that whenever they want , with no repercussions .
I was n’t even part of the protest and I was charged with being part of an “ unlawful assembly . ”
The whole arrest process took hours .
We were told to sit and put our hands on our heads , which many people had to do for several hours ( your arms get sore ) .
I was cuffed after an hour or so and stood around for another hour waiting to get my mug shot ( on the bridge ; this was all very ad hoc ) .
Since we were on the bridge for so long they eventually hauled at least 3 porta - potties onto the bridge itself , for both police and protester usage ( under heavy guard , of course ) .
Eventually I was led onto a city bus with 40 other arrestees and brought to the Ramsey County jail for booking .
They searched me about 5 times , confiscated all my stuff , and gave me a paper bag with a peanutbutter and jelly sandwitch and two apples .
See , even oppressive police tactics have a Minnesota Nice aspect .
Of course we did n’t get knives so we had to spread the jelly and PB with our fingers .
Hours dragged by as we waded our way through the bureaucracy and were eventually cited and loaded onto a paddywagon and driven out of the jail .
They let us out just outside the fences and we were free and on our own far from where we were arrested , but at least the incredibly awesome Coldsnap Legal Collective were there to offer us hugs and access to free legal advice .
People without rides or places to go were able to sleep on the grass outside the jailhouse thanks to sleeping bags the Coldsnap folks brought .
Somebody sent the angels last night ; they ’re doing great work and need your support !
The problem with good things is that the police like to infiltrate and ruin them from the inside .
That might ’ve been the case with the protest last night .
I heard several people talking about police plants agent provocateurs pretending to be protesters , inciting violence and keeping their superiors informed about where they are headed .
Unfortunately , this is standard practice for police departments these days , including Denver during the DNC .
How many acts of vandalism and violence that you read about in the mainstream media were actually committed by undercover cops in order to incite and defame activists ?
Imagine the embarrassment of the police and governments if they held a convention with massive protests and no one was arrested !
They ’d have spent millions upon millions of dollars for nothing !
They ’ve got to earn their outrageous security budgets , which is why they were so keen to arrest anybody who happened to be near Marion St. Bridge last night , including media folks and medics ( at least 5 were arrested , along with a dozen credentialed photographers ) .
Of course they also wanted to show who ’s boss .
Clearly they are , and clearly they are not going to allow us to change the system peacefully or otherwise .
We are not free .
We are only permitted to do what they let us ; truly free expression is verboten .
Believe it or not , America used to be a pretty anything - goes society as long as it was n’t overtly violent ( think of the Old West ) .
Nowadays we cling to our police state as if that makes us safer .
But what have we lost in the process ?
Please Use Porn Responsibly / Violet Blue 's concerns about the new anti-porn feminist agenda
Far be it from me to attempt a liberal media cover - up of the real dangers of porn .
DVDs have really sharp edges .
Like , do not spill Astroglide into your keyboard .
Your hard drive could fill up .
Do not lick the monitor ; it 's bad for the screen .
Most porn sucks and you will spend hours trying to find anything worth watching .
Caterwauling starlets on higher volumes might have your neighbors dialing the emergency number for Animal Care and Control .
Wireless mice are not safe for insertion .
Re-enacting anything starring Rocco Siffredi might actually cause someone to lose an eye -- be careful where you point that thing .
And I 'm deeply worried about the under - representation of women in gay porn .
And then there 's the correlation between porn and automobile fatalities .
Linda Lovelace , famous porn star of " Deep Throat " fame died in a car accident in 2002 .
Porn star Britney Madison , sometimes known as Britney Jade , died in a Las Vegas automobile accident in 2005 .
Adult star Anna Malle , described by Adam Film World as " one of the great wild women of porn " died in 2006 as the result of a car crash off state Route 160 in Las Vegas .
These porn-related accidents should obviously serve as cautionary tales for would - be starlets .
Porn viewers are equally at risk .
A 38 - year - old Ohio man reported that his home was invaded in September 2003 .
The article says , " The man said he that was sitting home alone masturbating and watching a pornographic movie when a man came down into the basement , holding a gun , and started to videotape him .
The man said that before he left , the intruder fed his dog some mushrooms and the dog died . "
Poor dog .
What 's worse , porn might even stop your heart .
This completely weird research studysays that having sex in a " hasty situation " makes you more likely to have a coronary incident and die .
Last month , Australian researchers claimed a link between clinical depression and an online sex life .
" 1,325 men from the U.S and Australia were surveyed about their Internet sex habits , which might include trolling for porn , participating in online chats , or doing things with webcams . "
There is actually no limit to the ways in which this four - letter word ruins lives .
On July 17 , 1990 , Daryl E. Porn , a Connecticut resident , was involved in an automobile accident in Portland , Maine , when motorist Lori Willoughby sped through a stop sign and broadsided his vehicle .
See , you just have to be called porn to find yourself in a life - threatening situation .
Of course , any thinking person knows that these anecdotes are just that , anecdotes .
The correlation between porn use and making freaky death and depression actually happen in real life is hardly valid .
But when people like the extremist feminist group Stop Porn Culture tells us that porn is harmful , their arguments make just as much sense as the ones above .
Never mind the fact that SPC is a traveling anti-porn road show that displays over a hundred extreme hardcore images to all comers ( no puns ; they do n't check IDs at the door , nor do they provide the federally required documentation to show that none of their sexually explicit images include children ) .
They perpetuate myths and unsubstantiated claims that porn -- they say all porn , but only show us the really extreme stuff -- is responsible for exploiting women , providing dead - end economic choices for young girls , fostering racism , fostering hatred and degradation of women , and they totally totally promise ( while admitting on their own Web site that there is no hard evidence ) that porn is a causal factor in rape , child abuse and domestic violence .
And SPC also plays that great old ditty , stating that all porn performers must have been abused as children .
Is n't this all just so adorably retro , coming from a 2008 organization ?
Awww .
It 's sweet that people can still be so naive in these jaded times .
I want to give them a cookie and pat them on the head like children telling me Herbie is real when SPC states that in porn " abuse an exploitation of women is common . "
Mostly , I want to introduce them to Sasha Grey who said :
" I performed my first sex scene on May 1st , 2006 , in The Fashionistas 2 : Safado .
Although I have come a long way since then , many people in society believe that I am a victim .
I was not sexually abused .
I am not on drugs .
The acts I perform are always consensual .
I am a woman who strongly believes in what she does -- it is time that our society comes to grips with the fact that ' normal ' people ( women especially ) enjoy perverse sex . "
If correlation were equal to causation , organizations like SPC would be right .
Porn would be the cause of all rape .
I 'd also be able to blame porn for killing Gerard Damiano of natural causes last month .
I could also categorically state that porn was responsible for my friend 's body issues ( because everyone wants huge scary immovable porn chick breasts ) .
And the economy ?
Well , if porn had n't saturated our society with " industries of sexual exploitation " then no one would have painted the Wall Street bulls ' balls blue , leading to the humiliation and exploitation of everyone on Wall Street and sending the Dow into a money shot of a tailspin .
It 's anti-porn logic , people .
And it 's awesome !
It 's all is based on the assumption that there is no such thing as healthy porn use , and that there 's no such thing as healthy porn .
And that all porn is the same , and that the mainstream porn industry is n't being killed by the Internet giving us all , finally , freedom of choice and we do n't have to watch things that makes us go " ew " anymore because that 's all they carry at the local Jack Shack .
Please , no one tell them the truth .
Someone 's got to keep the millions of us normal , porn- loving peoples of all genders , races and sexual orientations entertained with a little haunted house fiction .
It 's not just the logic at SPC that kept me coming back for laughs .
It 's important to really savor the " new " face of the anti-porn movement , especially since we 're finally getting the Bible - thumping extremists out of the White House .
At Stop Porn Culture , they give us the history of the feminist anti-porn movement , citing Dworkin and MacKinnon as their lineage , and give us the vision of a world where the great tradition of stopping sexual abuse of women and children is possible in their mission .
Their board of directors ( some of whom also star in their upcoming film " The Price of Pleasure " as " experts " ) hail from colleges around the nation .
Links from SPC's
Web site lead to their MySpace and YouTube pages , have DIY instructions on doing your own anti-porn presentations ( though you gotta promise you 're over 18 to see the images , m'kay ? ) .
Links offsite also lead to a site called " The No Porn Pledge " ( owned by Patty Valentine , aka " One Angry Girl " ) , and is part of throughtheflame.org , an anti-porn nonprofit -- and all of the Web sites in the ring categorically state that they " do not promote any particular religion or ideology . "
The funny thing is , when you scratch the domain lookup surface it 's just like the anti-porn feminist history they claim , where the 'ists were in bed with the church : Stop Porn Culture is registered and owned by Skyward - bound Productions , specializing " in serving churches and other nonprofit organizations get the materials they need to help spread the ministry of Jesus Christ . "
The real low - down dirty shame is n't that John Waters is n't directing porn ( okay , it doe make me cry myself to sleep every night ) .
The real shame and harm is that organizations like SPC are so busy with their questionable beliefs -- and truly exploitative tactics -- that no one even gets a chance to find out that no , you should n't imitate what you see in porn :
It 's not safe sex .
The sexual fantasies portrayed in porn -- especially the extreme ones -- like all adult sexual situations , require context ( which is exactly what SPC removes ) .
And most of all , that people should be given the opportunity to use porn responsibly like alcohol , cars , or the Internet .
Or pilfered hardcore images .
Got that , SPC ?

When a logo ’s used for a number of years , the brand equity that ’s generated can become a valuable tool .
As such , any redesigns often implement subtle changes in order to refresh the look whilst considering customer recognition .
Here are ten successful redesigns courtesy of Brand New , with a little explanation behind the change .
1. Toys R Us
“ The star has been stuffed into the engorged R in order to make a tight and simple ( r ) wordmark which is less patriotic , more bulbous and more fun . ”
Joe Marianek
“ The US could have been just a tad closer to the R to keep the same spacing throughout . ”
Armin Vit
2. MSNBC
“ The revised logomark for msnbc , while not really expressing the acronym in a technically , grammatically correct fashion gets away with it just fine .
And the use of the lowercase is less imposing , more legible , and just plain friendlier than the all - caps imperialist approach . ”
Christian Palino
“ … the new logo has switched from the unbelievably clunky , non-flattering , monolithic , typographically - wrong — heinous horizontal scaling anyone ? — uppercase wordmark to an überfriendly lowercase setting .
The peacock ’s feathers , of course , have been left unrattled .
The move is instantly beneficial in that the mark becomes approachable and rhythmical , instead of cold and monotonous .
And this is achieved just by switching from one sans serif — a mangled Helvetica or , worse , possibly Arial — to another — the never - wrong Gotham . ”
Armin Vit
3. BusinessWeek
“ The blue bar was a point of equity that could have been easily ported to this news masthead / identity .
Other than that , I really think this was a step in the right direction . ”
Kyle Hildebrant
4. Science Channel
“ A very effective reference to its main purpose of screening science related shows , so the “ periodic table ” look is well used here .
I especially like the orange / tangerine that they chose , which reproduces nicely on RGB screens , and also has that sense of being new and fresh .
That being said , there does seem to be too many different points that parts of the logo are being aligned to .
The “ Sc ” to the edge of the box , the word “ Science ” to the middle of it and “ Channel ” to the edge of “ Science ” .
Seems rather clunky and I am sure there are better ways of doing it . ”
Bjorn Yeo
5. Dolby
“ The double - ds have been merged together , removing the visual separation and additional noise that was present in a logo that has to appear at extremely small sizes .
This merger allows more lateral space for the Ds to have a wider form that marries well with the new typography .
In addition , the “ DOLBY ” wordmark has been liberated from its bounding rectangle , employing a lighter - weight typeface for better legibility . ”
Christian Palino
6. QuickChek
“ The typography is forgettable , nothing to worry about but nothing to praise either , maybe a geometric sans would have added some interest .
Overall , this is a great visual upgrade for a modest chain of stores that will likely benefit from the added differentiation … ” Armin Vit
“ Solid , competent work . ” Jerry Kuyper
7. Qantas
“ The sleeker form makes sense — more power in the legs and a larger tail .
Overall the new logo is a huge improvement while retaining the brand equity from the original kangaroo . ”
John Feldhouse
8. Delta
“ The new logo is simple and to - the - point .
The new colours sit much nicer than the old ones — the blue is more dominant and the typeface is much more modern . ”
Leanne Johnson
“ The sense of depth given by the two reds is n’t forced at all — quite the opposite .
It would have been so easy to use ( and these days probably sell ) gradients / bevels / etc .
This gets the job done very nicely , while showing restraint . ”
Von K
9. NFL
“ … this ( logo ) has to be embroidered on everything from knickers to headbands to shoelaces so minimizing the number of stars and opening up that space was the best thing to do .
And to be able to justify it with the teams per division argument is even better . ”
Armin Vit
10 . Hunter
“ I am glad to see someone get rid of gradients and all the bubbly stuff ! ” Nick Irwin
“ I love that their new logo does not try to be all flashy and 3D .
Its great to see a company who realizes that good design does not mean throwing drop shadow and gradients on everything . ”

A huge thanks to Armin and Bryony for their work on Brand New , a wealth of info on major logo updates .
The US Farm Bill is about more than just what foods are subsidized and who receives those subsidies .
It also governs the food stamp program , school lunches and more .
In other words , it is not just of interest to farmers !
There is a great misconception that the Farm Bill helps out small farmers and is vital to helping the little guys stay afloat during crop failures due to natural disasters .
This lens hopes to bring to light the fact that the greatest amount of this taxpayer - funded program goes to large agribusiness companies , who in turn buy out the small farmers .
Subsidies are sometimes several million dollars and are paid annually , whether there is a crop failure or not .
Some of the recipients are city folk who never venture anywhere near a farm , simply renting out the land to farmers .
While commodity crops such as corn and wheat are highly subsidized , fruits and vegetables are categorized as " specialty crops " and receive minimal funding .
There is also limited funding available for organic and sustainable farming practices .
This artificial tampering with the free market means that no matter how high consumer demand is for organic fruits and vegetables , it will remain unprofitable for farmers to comply with demand .
Instead they will continue to grow more and more corn , that appears as more and more high fructose corn syrup in processed foods .
All the while , prices for organic produce remain artificially , yet justifiably high .
Learn about agricultural subsidies in general , the history of the US Farm Bill , current statistics on this Bill , who supports it and who does n't .
Afterwards , take part in the poll and say what you believe about this important issue .
The Huffington Post , a venture - capital - backed new media site that mixes links to other sites content with hundreds of celebrity and volunteer blogger posts , is being accused of slimy business practices by a handful of smaller publications who say the site is unfairly copying and publishing their content .
Whet Moser , an editor at alternata ] ive weekly Chicago Reader wants to know why The Huffington Post 's newly formed Chicago - focused venture is stealing their copyrighted concert reviews and reprinting them in whole in order to get search engine traffic .
And he found other examples taken wholesale from The Onion and Time Out Chicago .
Compare for example , the Chicago Reader 's Amanda Palmer review and The Huffington Post 's ( screenshots if the pages change : Reader , The Huffington Post )
Moser writes :
You want to do a post that says , " According to Jessica Hopper , Bon Iver rules , check 'em out , go here for the info , " fine .
But taking an entire concert preview is bush league .
Doing it as a practice is just beneath contempt .
If the future of journalism –which everyone keeps telling me The Huffington Post represents — is a bunch of search - engine optimization scams , we have bigger problems than Sam Zell 's bad investment strategies .
But The Huffington Post co-founder Jonah Peretti says the contretemps are overblown — that the complete re-printing was a mistaken editorial call and that The Huffington Post 's intention in aggregating other publications ' content is to send traffic their way .
" You tease , you pull out a piece of it , and then you have a headline or link out , " Peretti said .
" Generally publishers are psyched to have a link . "
The headlines on The Huffington Post , he points out , link to the outside site , not to The Huffington Post page with the two to three paragraph excerpt of the other site 's copyrighted story .
That page is accessible via the comment and " Quick Read " links , and serves as the " anchor " page for comments or for follow - up reporting by The Huffington Post staff .
Almost all of the readers click on the headlines and photos , according to Peretti , which means most do n't know the excerpt page exists since they get sent to the original site .
He compares The Huffington Post's
influence on other sites traffic to that of link - voting sites like Digg and Reddit .
Those sites , along with Google News and Slashdot , rely on small excerpts or user submitted summaries of online content in order to create lists of the best new content on the web .
But none of those aggregation sites , including Google News , uses as much of a percentage of copyrighted content as The Huffington Post does .
The Huffington Post , which launched in May 2005 , drew 19 million unique visitors in November through the efforts of 27 editorial staff members , according to a spokesman .
There 's just one editor for the
Chicago - focused project , which launched in August .
The company just closed a $ 25 million funding round a few weeks ago .
Moser is n't alone in his sentiments against The Huffington Post 's aggregation tactics .
Nick Denton , the publisher of Gawker and other semi-famous blogs , hates the Huffington Post .
Kevin Allman , a New Orleans journalist and editor of Gambit Weekly , finds The Huffington Post 's idea of starting a whole series of city - focused aggregation sites hypocritical , especially given the site is named after Arianna Huffington , a popular , and now - liberal - leaning columnist .
In other words : professional newsgathering organizations have paid professional writers to do professional work , and then
Arianna comes in , creates links to their creations , and sells ads on her own page .
How progressive .
But Peretti says some 95
percent of The Huffington Post 's traffic goes through the headline links , and that when The Huffington Post does original reporting or adds to a story , it changes a headline link to point to its content .
Otherwise , the Chicago project picks the ' best ' stories from publications like the Chicago Tribune , the Sun Times and the Chicago Reader .
As for disgruntled publishers , Peretti seems genuinely perplexed and says The Huffington Post links should be good for them — and suggests that upset editors get in touch and build relationships with
Huffington Post editors .

Politico's Carrie Budoff Brown reports :
At a press avail in Monroe , Mich. , Barack Obama on Palin : " Back off these kinds of stories . "

" And people 's children are especially off - limits .
This should n't be part of our politics .

And if I thought there was somebody in my campaign who was involved in something like that , they would be fired . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Primary care doctors in the United States feel overworked and nearly half plan to either cut back on how many patients they see or quit medicine entirely , according to a survey released on Tuesday .

And 60 percent of 12,000 general practice physicians found they would not recommend medicine as a career .
“ The whole thing has spun out of control .
I plan to retire early even though I still love seeing patients .
The process has just become too burdensome , ” the Physicians ’ Foundation , which conducted the survey , quoted one of the doctors as saying .
The survey adds to building evidence that not enough internal medicine or family practice doctors are trained or practicing in the United States , although there are plenty of specialist physicians .
Health care reform is near the top of the list of priorities for both Congress and president - elect Barack Obama , and doctor ’s groups are lobbying for action to reduce their workload and hold the line on payments for treating Medicare , Medicaid and other patients with federal or state health insurance .
The Physicians ’ Foundation , founded in 2003 as part of a settlement in an anti-racketeering lawsuit among physicians , medical societies , and insurer Aetna , Inc. , mailed surveys to 270,000 primary care doctors and 50,000 practicing specialists .
The 12,000 answers are considered representative of doctors as a whole , the group said , with a margin of error of about 1 percent .
It found that 78 percent of those who answered believe there is a shortage of primary care doctors .
More than 90 percent said the time they devote to non-clinical paperwork has increased in the last three years and 63 percent said this has caused them to spend less time with each patient .
Eleven percent said they plan to retire and 13 percent said they plan to seek a job that removes them from active patient care .
Twenty percent said they will cut back on patients seen and 10 percent plan to move to part - time work .
Seventy six percent of physicians said they are working at “ full capacity ” or “ overextended and overworked ” .
Many of the health plans proposed by members of Congress , insurers and employers ’s groups , as well as Obama ’s , suggest that electronic medical records would go a long way to saving time and reducing costs .

A number of these agencies are military based , which may directly conflict with Federal law that prohibits the military from engaging in domestic intelligence gathering .
The National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , is one of the organizations that is mentioned in the report that is particular cause for concern .
NGA provides mapping tools and imagery intelligence that are obtained from the United State 's military spy satellites which are controlled by the National Reconnaissance Office .
In other words during the RNC , these top spying tools could have been utilized to gather intelligence on the homes of activists and media workers who were a part of the demonstrations .
That information could have then been relayed to local officials .
A second agency that was involved in the planning is the Pentagon 's Northern Command , NORTHCOM .
Having NORTHCOM at the table , assisting in the planning is troubling because it could mean that the military was involved in the crowd control strategies and dealing with potential civil unrest .
According to a report in Army Times , it said that an active military unit has been deployed by NORTHCOM in the United States .
This deployment marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment within U.S. Borders .
Furthermore it appears that the FBI may have been using a station faking technology that would allow them to locate an individual through their cell phone .
The ACLU is concerned with how this technology is used and if there was proper judicial oversight .
In the USA Patriot ACT , this process for obtaining a track was made easier , and could allow for little to no judicial oversight .
This tracking via cell phones could have been used during the RNC without the knowledge of even the phone companies .
said Teresa Nelson , ACLU of Minnesota .
The ACLU - MN will continue to investigate and will use their findings in future lawsuits against law enforcement officials .

Thursday ’s assault came after the opposition party had threatened to block the deal by force if necessary .
Fearing an attack , members of the foreign affairs committee , under the control of the governing Grand National Party , had barricaded themselves inside the room as they met .
Security guards and aides from the governing party stood outside the barricaded doors , where scuffles broke out when a dozen opposition lawmakers showed up .
The opposition lawmakers then used at least one sledgehammer and crowbars to tear through the doors , only to be thwarted by piles of furniture thrown up as a second line of defense .
The mayhem failed to prevent the pact from being formally introduced to the committee , a step in the process of bringing it to a full parliamentary vote .
The deal to lower tariffs and other trade barriers was signed last year by negotiators from South Korea and the United States but cannot take effect until ratified by lawmakers in both nations .

Back in 2000 , before “ everything changed , ” the Council on Foreign Relations held a conference entitled “ The Next Financial Crisis : Warning Signs , Damage Control and Impact ” at its posh headquarters on Manhattan .
“ For two days , several speakers told a high - powered audience of 250 people , comprised largely of bankers , investors , corporation officials , and policymakers , mostly from the United States , but also from Europe , of the possibility that the U.S. stock market , and potentially the world financial system , would melt down , ” Richard Freeman wrote in the July 28 , 2000 , issue of the Executive Intelligence Review .
Patrick Carmack , producer of the acclaimed documentary “ The Money Masters , ” details how private international bankers gained control of the American economy .
At the time , the corporate media was heralding the alleged robust nature of the U.S. economy under Clinton , even as the so - called Dotcom bubble was deflating .
Obviously , the CFR knew something very few other people knew or even vaguely gleamed — the global elite were in the preparatory stages of imploding the economy .
The CFR ’s eight hour “ war - game simulation of the simultaneous breakdown of major financial markets around the world ” foresaw what we are now experiencing up close and personal .
The CFR ’s game closely paralleled what is going on now .
Freeman writes :
What had been simulated , was a policy of pumping huge amounts of liquidity by the Federal Reserve , both through public sources and also through secret channels , to “ keep the main markets open . ”
The simulation was conducted such that “ all the public would see , is that the Fed volume of loans to banks had gone up . ”
Further , and darkly revealing , the CFR , according to its own testimony , the simulation began with a coup against the President of the United States .
As for the latter , we have experienced something somewhat different — a coup not by forces outside the presidency but already ensconced within , a coup launched against Congress , the Constitution , and the American people by a coterie of insiders firmly in control of the executive .
The CFR enlisted like - minded current , former , and future insiders , described below , to game the meltdown simulation :
For the simulation , the CFR conscripted 75 people , including bankers , former Treasury Secretaries , and former State Department officials .
Participants were divided into four teams , sent into four rooms , with the ability to communicate with each other and with a command headquarters through the computers .
The four teams covered 1 ) monetary - financial , which dealt with the functions of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors ; 2 ) economic and trade , which dealt with the functions of the U.S. Treasury Department ; 3 ) regulatory matters ; and 4 ) national security — nut case and former CIA director James Woolsey played the role of Secretary of Defense .
Indeed , Woolsey is a “ nut case ” – more accurately , a psychopath — and a dangerous one associated with the neocons and the Project for the New American Century , the Likudnik dominated JINSA , Frank Gaffney ’s neocon infested Center for Security Policy , and the American Foreign Policy Council .
Let ’s say he represented the neocon branch of the CFR , not yet in power when the game commenced on Manhattan .
However , it would not be long before the neocons were in control of the White House and began to implement their “ new Pearl Harbor ” and orchestrate the unitary dictatorship of the executive , resulting in numerous martial law pieces of legislation now hanging over us ominously like a legal Sword of Damocles .
The game - players were hit with breakdowns in several markets , which increased in severity , and in some ways interacted , during the simulation .
The market assumptions included : the Dow Jones Average Industrial Average falling by stages , from 10,000 to 7,100 ; the price of oil shooting up to $ 36 per barrel ; the dollar plummeting against both the euro and the yen ; the affiliate of a large British insurance company that was a big player in the equity derivatives market getting into trouble , causing panic in the derivatives market …
“ The potential for financial breakdown was often accurately presented at the conference , but no solution was even remotely discussed , ” Freeeman concludes .
In other words , the purpose of the CFR “ war game ” was not to prevent or ameliorate such a crash , but obviously how to best manage it after the markets began a precipitous and catastrophic decline , as they are now in the process of doing at the behest of the CFR and the international banksters .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Of course , none of this should come as a surprise , as history instructs : the banksters were behind the economic depression of 1907 , designed to put in place the Federal Reserve , and also the so - called Great Depression beginning in 1929 .
As Curtis Dall , member of the N.Y. stock exchange wrote in his book , “ F.D.R. : My Exploited Father - in - Law , ” the 1929 stock market crash “ was the calculated ‘ shearing ’ of the public by the World - Money powers , triggered by the sudden shortage of call money in the New York money market . ”
According to Rep. Louis McFadden , chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1933 , the 1929 crash “ was not accidental .
It was a carefully contrived occurrence … .
The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so they might emerge as rulers of us all . ”
Once again , we are experiencing yet another “ shearing , ” this time to rival all past fleecings , at the behest of the international banksters .
McFadden also said that the creation of the Federal Reserve System was engineered to establish “ a world banking system … a super - state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure . ”
Our current economic “ crisis , ” wholly artificial , is designed to put the finishing touches on this globalist super - state .
As the CFR ’s very own Carroll Quigley wrote in Tragedy and Hope , the “ powers of financial capitalism had ( a ) far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences .
The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations .
Each central bank … sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans , to manipulate foreign exchanges , to influence the level of economic activity in the country , and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world . ”
Earlier today in the House , we experienced this influence upon “ cooperative politicians ” as they steamrolled through the banker bailout bill that will further consolidate the political power of the ruling elite .
Hank Paulson ’s undue influence as “ finance Czar , ” unanswerable to Congress or the American people , will compliment the authoritarian character now present in the executive quite effectively .
Next up , the ultimate financial meltdown that will be micromanaged by the CFR and global elite .

Hang on a minute , I 've got the answer to a 40 - year cliffhanger ...
Michael Caine reveals all about THAT scene in The Italian Job
For decades film buffs have pondered over what happens to the gang in The Italian Job as their getaway coach full of gold teeters over a precipice .
Until now , all they 've had to go on were the immortal last words of Sir Michael Caine 's character Charlie Croker : ' Hang on a minute , lads .
I 've got a great idea . '
Now the 75 - year - old actor has revealed the mystery of the 40 - year - old cliffhanger at the end of the 1969 cult film .
Michael Caine 's character Charlie Croker , in the cult film The Italian Job , reaches for the gold bullion as the gang 's getaway coach teeters over a precipice , below
Speaking at last night 's 2008 Visit London Awards , he told how the film 's producers had already devised the ending but chose not to use it .
He said : ' In the coach I crawl up , switch on the engine , stay there for four hours until all the petrol runs out .
' The van bounces back up so we can all get out , but then the gold goes over .
' There are a load of Corsican Mafia at the bottom watching the whole thing with binoculars .
' They grab the gold , and then the sequel is us chasing it . '
The actor was speaking after the Royal Society of Chemistry launched a competition to solve the film 's conundrum .
Last month the society invited entrants to deduce how Croker 's gang might have unloaded the gold without losing their lives as part of the film 's 40th anniversary next year .

Sir Michael was at the Royal Albert Hall ceremony after being voted London 's favourite Londoner .
He beat Joanna Lumley , Sir Alan Sugar , Paul Merton , Jamie Oliver and singer Leona Lewis to win the award .
Sir Michael , whose latest film Flawless , co-starring Demi Moore , is released today , said he was overjoyed to have been chosen .
' It is extraordinary , and completely unique as I did not have to do anything to get it . '
Now in their fifth year , the Visit London Awards recognise and reward excellence in London tourism and also honour leaders in entertainment , creativity and innovation .
The RSC 's competition is open until January 1 , with the prize of a three - night stay for two in Turin next spring .

I do n't know if this Boeing C - 17 GlobeMaster III is the biggest RC airplane model in the world , but comparing it to the now - dead previous record holder it looks like we almost may have a tie .
In any case , its 19.68 feet of wingspan , four turbine engines , and perfect detail make it a worthy competitor for the Top Gun competition .
Check the stills to get an idea of this model 's majesty .
The original C - 17 is 174 ft , has a wingspan of 169.8 feet , and can carry 102 troops , a payload of 170,900 lb ( 77,519 kg ) of cargo " distributed at max over 18 463L master pallets or a mix of palletized cargo and vehicles . "
Its remote - controlled counterpart is made at a 1/10 scale .
According to its creators , the model weights 264 pounds .

The arrest followed a complaint from a member of the airport 's staff that she was assaulted as she attempted a body search on Miss Ross in the security area at Terminal Four .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called by security staff at about 10.30 am after a woman security officer complained of an alleged assault .
It is believed she set off a metal detector before boarding a British Airways Concorde flight to New York , and was angered when a guard tried to search her by hand .
The singer is thought to have tried to " frisk " the guard herself before boarding the aircraft .
Miss Ross left Heathrow police station at 3.20 pm , and eventually caught the 7 pm Concorde flight to New York .
Moments before boarding the supersonic airliner , Miss Ross told BBC News 24 : " It was scary , I was scared , I 'm worried about my children and I want to go home . "
Diana Ross is led away by police on Wednesday morning
" I have been through all the airports of the world and have never been subjected to such an intrusive search .
" I am a huggy person , I do n't mind being touched , but not in this way - it was far too personal , " she said .
Her publicist , Phil Symes , added : " The whole issue for Miss Ross was the indignity of women when they are subjected to this kind of body search . "
He said she had tried to complain to security staff but was angered when she was given a leaflet about complaints procedure .
' Celebrities take offence '
" She felt that was not good enough .
She then went back and approached the girl again and said , ' How would you feel in this situation ? ' and actually touched the girl .
" She told me that women should fight against being subjected to this kind of intimate body search . "
An airport spokesman said : " We are required by law to hand search any passenger who activates the metal detector alarms .
" Occasionally high - profile celebrities take offence at this procedure . "
Miss Ross had been travelling alone after meeting record executives to plan promotional campaign for her new single , Not Over You Yet .
She shot to fame in the 1960s as part of The Supremes , and has continued to win great acclaim into the 1990s - including a performance in New York 's Central Park during torrential rain .
Tokyo can now proudly wear its culinary stars on its shoulder ( 191 of them , according to the latest Michelin Guide , nearly twice as many as second - place Paris ) – but for a real taste of how everyday Japanese dine , look past the sushi to Japan 's second great dining specialty : theme restaurants .
From medical prisons to maid cafés , they reveal a country given to confusedly mixing cultural contexts , with strange , sometimes laughably inappropriate results .
1. The Wizard of the Opera
Worth it for the name alone , this restaurant promises " gorgeous and gothic dining " , but what they really mean is that it 's opera - themed .
The sauces are drawn on like musical notation , they make a delicious smoked - salmon dish ingeniously ( no , really ) shaped like a rose , and they 'll even squirt out the word " opera " for you in cursive chocolate .
The tables are made of marble and the music is – duh – opera .
The quality of the cuisine does n't measure up to the Wizard 's high - culture aesthetic , being largely manufactured at the same facility that serves the dozens of other restaurants owned by the Diamond Dining group , but if your date complains just put an admonishing finger to their lips and then use that finger to indicate the Donizetti .

2. Princess Heart
Tokyo theme restaurant : Princess Heart
Princess
Heart plays straight to the frilly delusion of many a young lady , promising to transform you into a monstrous Disneyfied conflation of Cinderella , Snow White and Sleeping Beauty .
It 's a magical fantasy land on the fifth floor of an office building in Ginza , the city 's very - expensive - pen district .
The elevator doors open to a smiling manservant who addresses you using honorific Japanese usually reserved for royalty .
Then he shows you to a full - length mirror in which , apparently , you are expected to preen .
Then inside is a magical forest with a giant wizard 's tree and heart - shaped chairs .
The desserts are shaped variously like hearts , clocks , hearts and hearts .
Try " Salad Rolls of Shrimp and Steam Chicken with Two Sauces Enchanted with Sleeping Beauty 's Voice " , or " Something Cinderella Leaf - Baked Custard of Magic at 12 O'Clock " .
Just make sure you leave before the dwarves kiss you at midnight , or whatever .

3. Namahage
Namahage
For good luck , some people rub rabbits ' feet .
In the northern prefecture of Akita , on the other hand , they dress as demons , striking fear into the hearts of young children and making them cry .
If you 're thinking , " sounds like a brilliant idea for a family restaurant , " too bad - Namahage 's beaten you to it .
While you 're eating your meal ( your standard nabe soups and fried chicken , loosely based on traditional Akita cooking ) , the lights suddenly cut out , and a deafening wailing fills the air .
Stamping and shouting in the semi- darkness , performers dressed as giant " namahage " evil spirits go from table to table , as they are said to go from house to house in Akita , asking : " Any bad guys , or lazy guys ? "
To demonstrate your innocence , so that the Namahage will offer a blessing rather than take you back to the mountains for eternity , you 're expected to feign surprise or even fear – though the performance is entertainingly jarring enough that you wo n't have to fake it .
It 's like a meal and a traumatizing character test in one .
Surprisingly popular with families .

4. Alcatraz ER
Alcatraz ER
Alcatraz , the crazy old uncle of Japanese theme restaurants , kickstarted the trend about a decade ago by capitalising on everyone 's love of hospital food .
The setting is a " medical prison " .
You are the patient .
The waitresses are dressed as the type of nurses that exist only in Benny Hill re-runs .
They handcuff you , pretend to inject a giant needle into your rear , and then lock you in a cell .
There , you can order such dishes as Dead Chicken ( in which two chicken feet are clasped together in peaceful repose ) , Penis Sausage ( in which a sausage is carved to resemble a severed penis ) and Intestine ( another sausage , and sort of odd considering that you can order actual intestine in any of Tokyo's zillion yakitori restaurants ) .
Try the cocktails : the false teeth in a jar has particular bite .
Occasionally , the staff will " accidentally " open your cell door and it's your mission to go screaming around the restaurant in a wheelchair evading the outstretched hands of other prisoners .

5. Alice in Wonderland
On the continuum of Japanese cosplay , the character of Alice trails the French Maid in terms of sexiness , but is well ahead of Bo Peep .
So it 's a good thing that the Alice In Wonderland restaurant keeps things family - friendly .
True , you are served by a battalion of waitresses , all dressed like Alice .
But plenty of other touches keep the atmosphere from becoming totally creepy : bunny tails on the chairs , a big clock against one wall , and a Mad Hatter Tea Party room over which towers a giant lamp ( you 've shrunk , remember ? ) that contrasts with a tiny version at the entrance ( back when you were huge ) .
Some appetizers come served on a chessboard , and the pizzas are done up like playing - card soldiers .
Try the Green Caterpillar tuna and avocado sushi roll , or the cute Mock Turtle Mimosa Salad .

6. @home Café
Famous , and with good reason .
First , you have to pick a floor – 5th , 6th or 7th – and then spend upwards of an hour queuing , on the fire escape , no less .
Some people buy hot oden stew - in - a - can from the vending machine for the wait ; this is not recommended .
When you finally get to the front of the line , you 're handed a list of rules – one hour maximum , no touching , strictly no photography – and then ushered into a bright , plasticky café around which bustles a gang of almost parodically cute , friendly young women dressed as French maids .
A maid pops up in front of your table to welcome you with a selection of hand poses .
You 're allowed one photo onstage with any maid you like , performing a hand pose of your choosing – we went for " cat claws " , but " heart shape " and " finger to corner of mouth " are popular alternatives .
Or , for 300 yen , play a game with a maid – we soundly defeated our maid in a version of Rock ' Em'Sock ' Em Robots that was clearly rigged in our favour .
Every hour , the maids get up onstage to sing a J - pop song ( the café 's maids are all , of course , in a band , called Agumi ) ; everyone in the café is expected to follow along with the hand gestures .
Then there 's a rousing game of group janken ( rock - paper - scissors ) .
The eventual winner was a tall , stooped man with thinning hair who had come alone .
He won a sticker .
Oh , and the maids will write a personalised message for you on your omu- raisu ( omelette - rice ) in ketchup .
Baffling .

In the same way many Japanese mix and match bits of pop culture , they often think nothing of mixing and matching bits of different religions .
Yoshinobu Fujioka , an ordained Buddhist priest of the Shin Buddhism sect , took advantage of this openness .
Playing on the idea of the bartender - as - confessor , he took it to its logical conclusion : he opened a bar .
At Vowz ( a pun on " vows " and the Japanese term for " shaved head " ) , Fujioka slings drinks to customers – Buddhist , Christian , Dawkinian , you name it – cracks jokes , listens to their problems , and gives them advice based on Buddhist teachings .
Every night he conducts a short prayer ceremony before the altar in the corner .
Try his patented mix of cranberry juice , lemon and habushu poisonous - snake water , which he calls Aiyokujigoku , literally " Love- Desire - Hell " ( " Because in Buddhism , as in other walks of life , love can become hell , " he laughs ) or a glass of Hannyatou " Wise Hot Water " , the sake invented by a Buddhist monk to hide his drunkenness from his killjoy colleagues .

Ninja Akasaka
Ninja is a classy immersion in Shogun - era coolness .
A featureless black doorway in Tokyo's Akasake - Mitsuke business district leads to a maze of cave - like corridors .
Soon you 're greeted by a ninja and given a secret password .
Watch out for the disintegrating bridge !
The food is spectacular modern Japanese , with the prices to match – in one showy dish a sword is yanked from a coconut to release a fountain of dry ice smoke .
The dessert menu is particularly dramatic – we wo n't give it away – and if you 're lucky you 'll get treated to a visit from … cue taiko drum roll … the illusionist .
It 's no surprise they 've got a signed plaque commemorating Steven Spielberg 's visit : the place feels like a set from Indiana Jones and the Ninjas of Tokyo .

Diamond Dining 's first theme restaurant now seems a little dated compared to the flash of Ninja , but it 's still got a certain bloody charm .
Dark red velvet curtains frame a passageway that is lit from below by a glowing floor of red blood cells ; cobwebs drape around the chandeliers ; in a nice touch , all the mirrors are broken .
The place is n't as bustling as it used to be , and the food is standard modern - izakaya fare , but Vampire Café 's attention to detail is excellent , and it remains one of the only theme restaurants in Tokyo that you might actually want to stop by for a quick drink – Bloody Mary , Blood Clot , Blood Orange and Vodka , you name it .

" Oh God , " said my fellow diner , a devoutly raised Irish Catholic , as he stared around at the decoration in the Christon Café .
" If Father Hickey saw me here … " It 's unclear what he was so worried about .
The owner of Christon merely spent the last decade buying ancient church paraphernalia in South America and hauling it all back to a cavernous dining hall in Tokyo's red - light district .
Gargoyles , huge oil paintings and even huger chandeliers loom over an altar featuring a gaggle of Virgin Mary statues framing a glowing , crucified Christ , backlit in ever - changing , multicoloured neon .

When the Time Lords of Doctor Who face a fatal blow , they can always regenerate , taking on a newer , and often younger , body .
A certain species of hydrozoa can perform a similar trick , going into hibernation when times are tough and then emerging as a younger version of itself .
And researchers say this potentially immortal creature is slowly taking over our seas .

The jellyfish - like hydrozoan , Turritopsis dohrnii survives through a phoenix - like ability .
When faced with a food shortage or environmental danger , the T. dohrnii collapses into a blob and starts its lifecycle all over again .
Not only have researchers deemed the organism “ nearly immortal , ” this phoenix property has enabled the T. dohrnii to spread to oceans all across the globe .
Passing ships frequently swallow up the hydrozoa in their ballasts , triggering the rejuvenation process .
Thus , an adult hydrozoan that has already reproduced could be swallowed up and dropped off elsewhere to restart its lifecycle and reproduce all over again .
Thus far , researchers have not found that the T. dohrnii , which can be identified only through genetic testing , have upset any of the ecosystems they have invaded .
But the predatory creatures seem to be the perfect alien invaders : difficult to detect , patient , and successful in the face of adversity .

Straight - Party Ticket Votes Failed to Allow Voters to Review Names of Presidential Candidates Before Casting ' Ballot '
Same Flawed , Hackable , Unverifiable Machines Being Used in GA Senate Race , Elsewhere ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/6/2008 , 11:48 am PT
All 185 of the completely unverifiable Diebold touch - screen voting machines used in Northumberland County , PA 's election were ordered impounded by a judge Tuesday night after complaints from both the Republican and Democratic parties .
Officials from both parties had filed requested action following reports from voters that straight - party ticket votes were not showing voters the names of their selection for President on the summary screen near the end of the 100 % faith - based touch - screen voting process .
Problems with straight - party voting , particularly on touch - screen voting systems , were reported in a number of states that allow the practice , during the early voting period in the days leading up to Election Day .
While one Diebold AccuVote touch - screen machine was impounded by an official in Colorado following reports of votes flipping on the screen from Democratic to Republican candidates in early voting --- and even with hundreds of similar startling problems reported directly to the Obama campaign as The BRAD BLOG reported exclusively on Monday --- no other action was taken on or before Election Day to remove these wholly unverifiable systems from use until Tuesday night 's court - ordered quarantine of the Northumberland County machines .
The same unverifiable machines made by Diebold were used in a number of states , including the entirety of Georgia where a run-off has been scheduled following a tight race for the U.S. Senate there .
The same models were also found , by a landmark Princeton study in 2006 , to be easily susceptible to malicious viruses that could result in a flipped election which would be difficult , if not impossible , to discover ...
Kim Zetter , over at WIRED 's " Threat Level " blog has been doing tremendous work on this beat of late , so we 're happy to associate again with her fine reporting on this news out of PA ...
Brad note :
While the summary review screen on touch - screens allows voters to review their selections , it does n't actually allow for confirmation that the system has or will count their votes accurately , as there is no way to do so on a Direct Recording Election ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting system . ]
County poll workers discovered around 7:30 am Tuesday morning that voters who chose to vote a straight - party ticket could not see their selections on the summary review screen .
The summary review screen allows voters to verify that the machine has registered their selections accurately before they cast their ballot .
[ count Northumberland County uses AccuVote paperless touchscreen machines made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) , which are supposed to display the chosen candidate 's name on the review screen .
But voters who voted a straight - party ticket could see only a message saying they had voted a straight - party ticket .
To make matters worse , it seems that misinformation may have been given to voters , instructing them to select their Presidential candidate again after choosing the straight - party option .
That action may have actually de-selected the voters ' presidential preference as described by Zetter ...
After the discovery was made , voters were still allowed to vote on the machines , but Director of Elections Mary Thew told Threat Level that they were told that if they wanted to vote straight - party to also touch their choices individually on the screen after selecting the straight - party option to make sure their vote was registered .
Generally touching a candidate 's name after a voter has already selected the straight - party ticket option will de-select the candidate on that machine , not select it .
But
Thew said the candidate names were showing on the review screen after voters selected them individually .
Zetter goes on to report that , based on the uploads of the Diebold machines ' memory cards to the Diebold tabulators , McCain reported defeated Obama by a sizable margin , despite the nearly identical Democratic v. Republican registration in the county .
She also notes that turnout totals and undervote numbers have not yet been made available ...
The county will begin its canvassing process tomorrow , with 20 days to certify the election results .
There is , however , no way to confirm that any vote cast on one of these systems in Northumberland was actually recorded as per the voters ' intent .
So , by and large , whatever Diebold says the results are , will be what the results are , with no recourse for any voter or any party .
Diebold 's Central Tabulator Also Faulty ...
To make matters worse this year , Diebold admitted in late August of this year that their GEMS central tabulator system routinely drops thousands of votes from uploaded totals without notifying the system administrator that there was an error .
That failure , first discovered by election officials in Ohio , and originally denied by the voting machine company , exists on Diebold tabulators used in 34 states on Tuesday .
The problem affects all votes cast on both optical - scan paper ballot systems ( such as those used in several counties in the razor - thin Franken / Coleman U.S. Senate race , now set for a manual recount in Minnesota ) and touch - screen systems manufactured by the company .
The critical programming flaw which causes the problem has been in the GEMS systems for some 10 years before they finally admitted to the problem just over two months ago while being sued by Ohio's Sec. of State Jennifer Brunner , after the failure was confirmed by election officials in Hamilton County , Ohio .
GOP Demanded Similar Action in 27 PA Counties in 2006 ...
During the 2006 election in PA , then Senator Rick Santorum ( R ) and the state GOP had demanded the impounding of touch - screen systems used in 27 counties in the state , following complaints of votes flipping on the screens .
Their letter to the Secretary of the Commonwealth asked that counties " not recalibrate any Voting Machine that has been identified as being miscalibrated , but rather impound the Voting Machine " and that " a sufficient number of emergency ballots be provided to these affected Counties so that no voter loses his / her right to vote . "
During the run-up to Tuesday 's elections , the Democratic Party and election officials in a number of states simply recalibrated voting machines --- in the middle of the voting period , an incredibly dangerous moment to allow anybody to access such machines in this way --- when voters reported similar incidents .
After results were reported of Santorum 's re-election defeat in 2006 , they withdrew their request to impound the machines .
Same Machines Still Used in GA , Despite History of Hacking ...
Despite a stunning 2006 report from Princeton University --- revealing that malicious viruses could easily be inserted on the Diebold AccuVote TS , resulting in manipulation of totals from machine to machine , and even to the central tabulator --- the system is still used in a number of states .
Georgia uses the same Diebold touch - screen machines seen undetectably flipping an election without detection in Princeton 's study ( see the 3 - minute Fox " News " video demostration right ) , to " count " all of their Election Day votes .
While they were first used there in 2002 in the surprising upset of Republican Saxby Chambliss over Democratic encumbant Max Cleland , they are being used again this year to determine the results of the close race between Chambliss and his Democratic challenger Jim Martin .
As Chambliss reportedly received just 49.9 % of the votes , shy of the 50 % majority required for Senate races in GA , a runoff election --- on the same voting machines --- has been scheduled for December 2nd .
[ Disclosure : The Princeton analysis was carried about on a Diebold machine we loaned to them , after it was given to VelvetRevolution .us by a Diebold insider who has been a source for The BRAD BLOG for some years .

You ’re in for a sweet surprise
Posted by Pete Berg on Saturday , September 6th , 2008 at 10:39 pm
Proof that High Fructose Corn Syrup is just as safe as normal sugar .
Paid for by the Corn Refiners of America .
Trying to explain the unemployment rate is a challenge since there are many nuances to look out for .
For example , today the unemployment rate came out at 6.5 % , the highest since March of 1994 .
That would be troubling in itself .
What was also released in the report is a horrible number of 240,000 jobs being lost in October .
Probably more surprising is the September employment number was revised to show a 284,000 job loss .
What does this amount to ?
1.179 million jobs have been lost since the start of 2008 .
It has been a very challenging year on the jobs front .
In this article we ’ll try to breakdown some of the details in the job report since it may be confusing to many .
I will also argue that the true unemployment rate is more likely to be near 11.8 % .
First let , us take a look at the exponential jump in the unemployment rate :
From this chart it is pretty clear how quickly the employment situation has deteriorated .
Much of this has to do with housing and the credit crisis and areas like California housing that are simply having the worst housing decline in recent memory .
The above chart does n’t show the entire picture however .
Let us expand the chart out to 1990 :
The above chart does a better job showing the current employment situation in perspective .
We have the early 90s recession and also the early recession this decade .
The troubling thing about unemployment is that the rate does n’t peak for a few years after a recession has started .
Let us take a look at this with data from the Federal Reserve showing recessions :
Recession
Early 1980s recession : July 1981 – November 1982
Recession of the early 1990s : 1990 - 91
Early 2000s recession : 2001 -2003
Peak Unemployment
Early 1980s recession : Peak hit on February 1983 at 10.4 %
Recession of the early 1990s : Peak hit on June 1993 at 7.8 %
Early 2000s recession : Peak hit on June 2003 at 6.3 %
Using the above as a guideline , we get a pretty reliable range of approximately 2 years from when the recession begins , to where peak unemployment is hit .
The third quarter GDP was our first official contraction although it was slight .
So we can mark the start of the “ official ” recession on July of 2008 .
Meaning , we can expect peak unemployment to hit sometime in the summer of 2010 if the last three recessional patterns hold up .
Again , this recession by all estimates will be more painful and more prolonged so it is hard to say if the above will hold true .
If we go back to the Great Depression , that contraction lasted a painful 10 years from 1929 to 1939 .
If you think that was long you should consider the Long Depression of 1873 – 1896 .
A 23 year contraction .
Let us now look at a chart in the employment report which I believe reflects a better view of the real unemployment rate .
A - 12 shows various ways of measuring employment .
I believe that U - 6 in the table is a much better reflection of the country ’s employment scene :
Now why is this a better measure .
It includes “ marginally attached workers ” who are people that are looking ( or not looking ) for work but want to work .
You can consider this batch the discouraged worker subset .
In addition , the number of part time workers has been growing .
So looking at the difference between U - 3 which is reported by the median and U - 6 we get a large difference .
One is 6.5 % and the other pushes the number up to 11.8 % .
That is why it feels much worse than a 6.5 % environment .
I think most people would agree that someone who wants work but has given up searching should be considered unemployed .
Then in this subset , you have those looking for work but not stating why but this may be someone working a few hours at a job but in reality is looking for full - time employment .
They too should be considered .
The 11.8 % number is stunning and incredibly high .
Remember at the height of the Great Depression the unemployment rate hit 25 % :
The above pattern also holds out for the Great Depression .
The actual business contraction cycle peaked in August of 1929 and did n’t hit trough until March of 1933 .
The market hit a peak in September of 1929 but we are referring more to the business cycle .
As you can see from the chart , the peak was hit in 1933 but in reality peak unemployment was essentially reached in 1932 which already was over 20 % .
So using the above model of 2 to 3 years from the start of the cycle , it also held true back then as well .
Depending on the severity , the longevity of the contraction can be drawn out .
As you can see from the other charts above , the 2001 - 03 recession quickly recovered .
As of October of 2008 , 10,080,000 people are unemployed from a total 155,038,000 workforce .
I wanted to dig deeper into the Great Depression data but of course it is hard to find data during this time .
I did however find a 1930 Census report and here are the raw numbers :
Very quickly we can say that the data in this chart was most likely produced in 1929 which would have had the favorable unemployment rate of roughly 5 % .
But let us take that actual workforce and we can then get a figure of the actual number of unemployed during that time :
1930 Workforce : 48,832,859
1930 unemployed : 2,429,062
5 % rate
If we use the 25 % peak reached in 1933 , we can say that 12,208,214 people were out of work during the Great Depression .
That should put that 10,080,000 number in perspective .
Keep in mind our employment base is now 3 times as big but just thinking that we have nearly as many people unemployed since the Great Depression is a sobering fact .
So when you dig into the employment report , you will find some fascinating data that goes beyond the actual mainstream number reported .
Given the history of past recessions , we can expect the employment situation to deteriorate at least until the summer of 2010 .

I ’m not much of a “ Seven Veils ” kind of guy so let ’s just get to it .
A TV commentator summed up the Joe the Plumber situation Perfectly :
“ The crazy bastard thinks progressive income is socialism .
Income tax has always been progressive . ”
Yes , Alice there is a Wonderland .
The Mad Hatter is running for president and all the March Hares are voting for him .
The key question is how much money is rich ?
Is it $ 250 grand or $ 5 million ?
It ’s OK to make money as long you to do n’t make too much .
If you make a buck selling a hamburger , that ’s OK .
If you sell a million hamburgers , you ’re evil .
That " living document , " the Constitution , has grown fine print that reads ,
“ Does not apply to rich people .
President decides who ’s rich . ”
Tell me , Alice …
What ’cha gonna to do when they come fo’ you ?
When we eat the rich , who make more than $ 250,000 , we ’ll start on those that make more than $ 200,000 .
Then it ’ll be $ 100,000 .
Hell , " rich " just means someone who ’s got more than you .
It ’s not fair he won life ’s lottery while you were still looking for a dime to scratch the ticket .
It ’s not fair he cracked books in college while you were cracking kegs .

Has this country gone mad ?
We have presidential candidates talking about how much they can steal and how much of the loot they will share with us if we vote for them .
Are we a nation of nerds living in our mother ’s basement ?
My advice to America : enjoy Wonderland while you can .
That noise you ’re ignoring is Reality pounding at the door and it wo n’t be a pleasant reunion .
The Best of Brian Wilson
Hagel ’s unwillingness to endorse McCain is generally perceived to be a result of their ongoing disagreements over the Iraq war .
But he told me that the gulf between them is much deeper : “ In good conscience , I could not enthusiastically — honestly — go out and endorse him and support him when we so fundamentally disagree on the future course of our foreign policy and our role in the world . ”
Like Obama , Hagel — who is not running for reëlection this year — seems to have viewed the Senate more as a stepping stone than as a final destination .
As a freshman , he secured a seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and became a serious student of foreign policy , treating committee hearings as seminars .
After the November , 1998 , elections , in which the Republicans failed to gain a single Senate seat , he challenged Senator Mitch McConnell for the chairmanship of the Republican Campaign Committee .
He attacked the G.O.P. leadership for running “ issueless campaigns ” with “ demonizing ” ads , and he spoke about the need to renew the “ political culture in America by ‘ defining up ’ the standards of debate , political discourse , and campaigns . ”
( Hagel lost . )
In 2000 , he was on the short list of Vice - Presidential candidates compiled by Dick Cheney for Bush .
Four years later , Hagel , with a small group of advisers , was discussing running for President in 2008 .
From the start , securing the Republican nomination loomed as his greatest challenge .
A traditional pro-business , small - government conservative , Hagel is a graduate of a Catholic high school , who is pro-life and supports school prayer .
He occasionally broke with his party — on immigration reform , on the No Child Left Behind Act , on a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage — but , according to Congressional Quarterly , in 2006 he voted with the President ninety - six per cent of the time .
Hagel ’s heresy on the Iraq war overshadowed the rest of his record , however .
In 2002 , the Weekly Standard included Hagel ( along with Brent Scowcroft and the Times ) in its “ axis of appeasement . ”
After Democrats won control of Congress in 2006 and allowed many more votes on the war , Hagel ’s support for Bush ’s policies declined — in 2007 , he voted with the President just seventy - two per cent of the time — and some commentators referred to him as “ not a real Republican . ”
Hagel says that he attempted to offer advice privately to the White House but was rebuffed .
He once called Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and asked to see him ; Rumsfeld invited him to lunch .
“ I wanted to talk to him alone , ” Hagel said .
“ And when I showed up he had a whole table full of generals and admirals . ”
During the Clinton Administration , he began writing letters to the President on foreign - policy issues of signal importance .
“ Clinton used to call me and we ’d discuss it , or he ’d ask me to come talk with him , ” Hagel recalled .
In the past eight years , he has written to Bush a number of times , including , most recently , letters about Russia and Iran .
But he said that he has never received a response from the President .
( He has occasionally received an acknowledgment from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs . )
“ This Administration has viewed Congress as an appendage , a nuisance , ” Hagel told me .
“ Clinton was just the opposite .
Reagan was the opposite .
Bush ’s father was the opposite .
They understood the value of making Congress their ally . ”
He said that Vice - President Cheney nearly always attended the weekly lunch held by the Senate Republican Caucus , at which major issues — including the war in Iraq — are discussed .
Often , someone asked Cheney whether he ’d like to say something .
“ Almost always , he ’d say , ‘ No , no , ’ ” Hagel said .
“ It always said to me , by his very lack of engagement or even giving us the courtesy of saying something , that they could care less about us .
Except when he wanted us to do something : ‘ Vote this way . ’ ”
In December , 2006 , the Iraq Study Group released its report about the war , describing the situation in Iraq as a quagmire .
Hagel heartily agreed with the group ’s key recommendations — a phased troop withdrawal and diplomatic engagement with Iran and Syria — and he was taken aback by the Bush Administration ’s negative reaction .
“ It was a way for the President to almost start over , in building a bipartisan consensus , ” he said .
“ And as I watched this thing go forward — the essential trashing of the report by the President , in his remarks — I was astounded .
Not much astounded me about this crowd anymore .
But this did . ”
Instead of withdrawing troops , the Bush Administration decided to increase their number by thirty thousand , a strategy that became known as the surge .
On January 24 , 2007 , Hagel addressed his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He and his close friend Joe Biden , the Democratic senator who is the committee ’s chairman ( and now the Democratic Vice - Presidential nominee ) , sponsored a resolution opposing the escalation and calling for a transition to a limited U.S. military mission in Iraq .
“ This is not a defeatist resolution , ” Hagel told members of the committee .
“ We ’re not talking about cutting off funds , not supporting the troops .
. . .
When I hear , on both sides of this argument , impugning motives and patriotism to our country , not only is it offensive and disgusting but it debases the whole system of our country and who we are . ”
He went on , “ We did n’t involve the Congress in this when we should have .
And I ’m to blame .
Every senator who ’s been here the last four years has to take some responsibility for that .
But I will not sit here in this Congress of the United States , at this important time for our country and in the world , and not have something to say about this .
And maybe I ’ll be wrong .
. . .
But I do n’t ever want to look back and have the regret that I did n’t have the courage and I did n’t do what I could . ”
Recalling that morning , Hagel said that , as he listened to his colleagues discuss sending more troops to Iraq , he was struck by their “ cavalier approach , as if it were an abstraction .
Very few people know much about war , very few are touched by it .
This is also a time when we had seen over a period of four years so much deception by this Administration — straight outright lies — and I thought to myself , as I looked around the committee , have we learned nothing in the last four years ?
And we ’re now going to send thirty thousand more troops into this meat grinder ?
For what ?
. . .
We were not a co-equal branch of government .
We were just kind of this afterthought to the President , and whatever he tells us to do , we kind of docilely go along . ”
The committee approved the resolution in a 12–9 vote ; Hagel was the only Republican who voted for it .
“ I was called a ‘ traitor , ’ and I was called ‘ disgusting , ’ ” he told me .
“ How could I not support the troops ?
‘ Shut your mouth , you ’re a Republican ! ’
Which I always found astounding — to equate war based on your politics , as a Democrat or a Republican .
I often said in hearings , I wonder where my Republican colleagues , who are so enthusiastic about the war in Iraq , would be if Bill Clinton was the President ?
I think I know exactly where they would be . ”
Several days after the vote , Cheney , in an interview with Newsweek , said that he believed “ in Ronald Reagan ’s 11th commandment : thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican .
But it ’s very hard sometimes to adhere to that where Chuck Hagel is involved . ”
For the next several months , Hagel tried to persuade enough Republicans to vote for a similar Democratic amendment , so that Republicans and Democrats together would reach sixty votes — the number required to prevent a filibuster .
Various Republican colleagues told him privately that they agreed with him , he said , but he was unable to win more than a handful of Republican votes .
“ Sorry , we do n“t serve the Lumberjack Breakfast to accountants . ”

On Wednesday , March 7 , 2007 , Hagel ’s staff sent reporters e-mails announcing a press conference at the University of Nebraska , in Omaha , the following Monday .
Most reporters assumed that Hagel was planning to declare his intention to run for President ; NPR reported that “ the Senator ’s campaign is portraying tomorrow ’s announcement as one of the most important in his career . ”
But Hagel told the crowd that he had not yet made up his mind , and he was widely ridiculed .
That month , in an interview with Esquire , Hagel said of Bush , “ He ’s not accountable anymore , which is n’t totally true .
You can impeach him , and before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment . ”
John McCollister , a former Nebraska congressman and a longtime friend of Hagel ’s , wrote a letter to the editor of the Omaha World Herald , criticizing him , though not by name .
“ I believe that some people disregard the awful consequences of a premature withdrawal and want to end the war , period , ” McCollister wrote .
“ Others have a consuming , burning hatred of George W. Bush as their dominant legislative priority .
Those who carelessly throw out talk of ‘ impeachment ’ are of the same stripe . ”
Michael McCarthy , the chairman of a private - equity firm in Omaha where Hagel worked in the early nineties , and who was one of his closest advisers as he considered running for President , told me that Hagel is “ very good at political calculus , so there is no doubt that he understood the political ramifications of anything he said , or actions he took . ”
Even so , McCarthy added , as Hagel has become frustrated by Congress ’s failure to confront the Bush Administration over its conduct of the Iraq war , “ he has become — he ’ll hate me for saying this — somewhat more preachy . ”
Some observers were perplexed by Hagel ’s behavior ; if he was serious about running for President , why was he doing and saying things that virtually guaranteed he could not win the nomination ?
But Rita E. Hauser , a longtime Republican activist who served on Bush ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board during his first term , and had numerous conversations with Hagel as he thought about entering the race , told me that she encouraged him .
“ It was a long shot , but I felt he could run as a courageous dissenter , and there was plenty of interest in that among a wide swath of Republicans , who felt the war had gone terribly awry . ”
Hauser said that Hagel was concerned about the growing political power of the religious right .
“ He was somewhat shocked at the degree to which the pro-life people — I ’ll call it the extreme Christian agenda — had taken over the Party . ”
In the end , Hauser said , Hagel concluded that if he had to take on both the Christian right and the Bush White House he probably could not win the nomination .
In September , 2007 , Hagel announced that he would not run for President in 2008 and would retire from the Senate at the end of his term .
According to several people close to Hagel , he had become increasingly discouraged by his inability to influence the Bush Administration and his Republican colleagues , particularly on Iraq - war policy .
His younger brother Tom , a law professor at the University of Dayton , says that Hagel , in his various occupations before he became a senator , “ had his own agenda and could get things done .
I think it was incredibly frustrating for him to be in the Senate , as one of one hundred senators . ”
When I asked Hagel about his decision to retire , he pointed out that after he was elected he said that he only intended to serve for two terms .
On Election Night , he went on , his wife , Lilibet , had asked him , “ Do you think you can hold a job for six years ? ”
“ That ’s true ! ” Lilibet told me in late July .
We were seated at the kitchen table in the Hagels ’ large flagstone house , set high on a hill in McLean , Virginia , where they live with their two teen - age children and a Portuguese water dog .
Lilibet , a dark - haired , dark - eyed woman from Meridian , Mississippi , who volunteers as a reading tutor in inner-city Washington schools , explained that until Hagel became a senator he had never stayed in a job for more than a few years .
“ I think he just likes change — it keeps things interesting . ”
It appears to be a pattern set in his childhood .
“ His father changed jobs a lot — from bad to worse — and they were always moving , ” Lilibet said .
“ Chuck liked going to new schools — a chance to make new friends and , I think , reinvent himself . ”
Explaining Haiti
Right or wrong , Haiti is considered the point of entry of Christianity into the New World because it is the place where Christopher Columbus built the first Spanish colony after landing on December 5th , 1492 .
Roman Catholicism was the official religion of Spain , and thus was imposed on all the original inhabitants of the island .
The natives were made Christians by force and the island was called ‘ Hispaniola ’ , meaning ‘ little Spain ’ .
Before long the Indian population was enslaved and wiped out , and Africans were imported as replacements .
But that ’s not all .
Haiti is the only place in the world where revolutionary African slaves successfully ended slavery and colonialism to build a new and independent country .
All this happened when Jean - Jacques Dessalines , his Generals , along with the indigenous army , proclaimed Haiti ’s independence from France on January 1st , 1804 .
On that day , they rejected the colonial name ‘ Saint - Domingue ’ and reclaimed the Indian name Haiti ( Ayiti1 ) for the country .
In celebration of Haiti ’s bicentenary , the United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 2004 the ‘ International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition ’ .
Ironically , in that same year , several thousands soldiers from different countries landed in the country as the ‘ United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ’ ( MINUSTAH2 ) .
Two hundred years after its independence and at less than 700 miles from the coast of Florida , Haiti has become the most unstable and the poorest country of the western hemisphere .
Although Haiti ’s free fall can easily be understood from a strictly historical perspective , religious arguments have been used by many to follow and explain the demise of this tiny nation .
Have you ever heard how some preachers or theologians try to explain the unspeakable misery that is crippling most of Haiti ’s population of 8 million ?
Everywhere you go , from your television screen to the Internet , what you are most likely to find is a reference to a spiritual pact that the fathers of the nation supposedly made with the devil to help them win their freedom from France .
As a result of that satanic alliance , as they put it , God has placed a curse on the country some time around its birth3 , and that divine burden has made it virtually impossible for the vast majority of Haitians to live in peace and prosperity in their land .
Surprising , right ?
The satanic pact allegedly took place at Bois - Caïman near Cap - Haïtien on August 14 , 1791 during a meeting organized by several slave leaders , under [ Dutty ]
Boukman ’s leadership , before launching what would become Haiti ’s Independence War .
This brutal period lasted 13 years until the last survivors of the French expeditionary forces , dispatched to Saint - Domingue with the sole purpose to re-establish slavery , were allowed by Dessalines to leave the island and return to Napoleon .
Those who made it safely to France wrote and reported about the utmost bravery and supreme courage of Haiti ’s indigenous army .
Obviously , the idea that Haiti was dedicated to Satan prior to its independence is a very serious and profound statement with potentially grave consequences for its people in terms of how they are perceived by others or how the whole nation is understood outside its borders .
One would agree that such a strong affirmation should be based on solid historical and scriptural ground .
But , although the satanic pact idea is by far the most popular explanation for Haiti ’s birth as a free nation , especially among Christian missionaries and some Haitian Church leaders , it is nothing more than a fantasist opinion that ultimately dissipates upon close examination .
Exploring the religious argument
I was born and raised in Haiti , and I am a graduate of the State University in Port - au - Prince .
I am also a believer in the Lord Jesus - Christ in accordance with the Bible .
In all of my studies of Haitian history , however , I have yet to find a good evidence of even the idea of Satan ’s assistance in the Independence War , let alone a satanic pact .
For quite some time now , several articles on the Internet have mentioned the existence of an iron pig statue in Port - au - Prince as a monument to commemorate Haiti ’s so - called pact with the devil through Vodou .
The statue would be in remembrance of a pig that was killed during the gathering by the African slaves .
In an effort to know more about that rumor , I contacted several authors about the exact location of the pig statue that ’s incidentally nowhere to be found in the country .
Their answer was complete silence , a simple apology , or just the removal of the reference from their texts .
One writer was grateful to me for pointing out the inaccuracy of her article , and she made the necessary adjustment .
But I am sure that the same allusion can be found somewhere in other published pieces of writing and documents .
The worst part of the whole picture is that the story is believed by many sincere Christians in America and around the world ; and not only do they believe it , they also spread it as fact .
The tragedy of our age is that repeated lies are often mistaken for the truth , especially when repeated long enough .
That ’s particularly the case in religious circles where faith on the part of the audience is generally expected , but that should never be so for those who believe in the Bible .
Maybe , believers need to return to biblical texts like 1 Thessalonians 5:21 , “ Test everything .
Hold on to the good ” .
It ’s hard to know where the idea of a divine curse on Haiti following the purported satanic pact actually originated , whether from foreign missionaries or from local church leaders .
In his book Ripe Now - A Haitian congregation responds to the Great Commission 4 , Haitian pastor Frantz Lacombe identified a ‘ dependence mentality ’ in the leadership of the Haitian church , which resulted from the way the Christian faith was brought to the country , historically and through various denominations .
Apparently , this unfortunate manner of thinking , which tends to emulate the worldview and culture of North American and European Christian missionaries , has permeated the general philosophy of the Haitian church on many levels , including church planting , church management , music and even missionary activities .
In that context , I would not be surprised if the satanic pact idea ( followed by the divine curse message ) was put together first by foreign missionaries and later on picked up by local leaders .
On the other hand , it is equally possible that some Haitian church leaders developed the idea on their own using a theological framework borrowed from those same missionaries who subsequently propagated the message around the world .
Either way , because of this message , Haiti has been portrayed as the country born out of Satan ’s benevolence and goodwill toward mankind .
Should n’t such a fantastic idea be tested for its historic validity and theological soundness ?
I invite you to take with me a closer and possibly different look at the available records .

Footnotes
1 – Ayiti means land of mountains in Indian language .
True to its name , the country has approximately ¾ of its territory made of rugged terrains , high mountains , hills and valleys .
Some have said that it was Haiti ’s topography along with rains and tropical diseases that defeated the French soldiers during the independence war .
While it is true that the environmental conditions favored the indigenous army , with the use of guerilla warfare , the Spanish and the French were able to establish and maintain slavery on the island for 300 years under those same conditions .
Therefore it is safe to conclude that nature alone was not the factor and Haiti would have never won its independence from France if the leaders of the revolutionary army were not who they were and did not do what they did the way they did it .

It comes courtesy of the Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge .
In July , St. Paul software developer CodeWeavers came up with the gimmick to make its products available free for a day if any one of five positive ( but seemingly unlikely at the time ) things happened during Bush 's last six months in office : gas drops to $ 2.79 a gallon , milk drops to $ 3.50 a gallon , U.S. jobs exceed 138 million , the Twin Cities median home price returns to $ 233,000 or Osama bin Laden is captured .
Bingo on No. 1 .
When CodeWeavers CEO Jeremy

Then I yelled , ' Oh , crap ! ' as I realized every American can now have my software for free -- kind of upsets my fourth - quarter revenue projections , " he said .
So on Tuesday , all of CodeWeavers products , which allow Mac and Linux users to run Windows applications , can be downloaded for free -- instead of $ 40 each -- at the company 's website , www.codeweavers.com.

Aso took over as prime minister from Yasuo Fukuda last month
Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso has unveiled Japan 's second economic stimulus package in as many months .
The 5 trillion yen ( $ 51bn ; £ 31 bn ) package includes cutting highway tolls and increasing loan guarantees that have been offered to small companies .
There will also be a package of tax cuts and other benefits for Japan 's struggling households .
It comes on top of the 11.7 trillion yen package unveiled in August by Mr Aso 's predecessor , Yasuo Fukuda .
The new package also includes an expansion of tax - exempt housing loans to boost the struggling property market , funding for care of children and the elderly , and support for unemployed young people .
" In this kind of situation , we need to relieve people 's insecurities , " Mr Aso said .
" We should not be fearful of the violent storm , nor should we just stand and let the typhoon blow us away . "
Election delay
But the prime minister also said that if economic conditions allowed , he would like to be able to raise consumption taxes in three years .
Mr Aso said he would wait to call elections until his economic measures had taken effect .
" I would like to ask for people 's approval after seeing the achievements of my policies , " he said .
The election must take place before September 2009 .
Before the financial crisis worsened , there had been speculation about a possible snap election in November .

Print this article JUPITER Cholesterol Drug Trial : Marketing Tactics Threaten Public Health and Wealth
There is a climate of elation in the world of pharma :
A recent study seems to suggest that cholesterol lowering medication should perhaps be given to everyone , regardless of their level of cholesterol , to prevent future heart attacks .
This is big money .
At present , sales of cholesterol lowering medications are worth tens of billions of dollars , on a much more limited set of prescribing guidelines .
Yet , there are huge numbers of people suffering from the side effects of statins , which include severe muscle pains , cognitive trouble and even Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer 's disease .
Vera Hassner Sharav of the Alliance for Human Research Protection discusses the JUPITER study and its implications for our health in an article that looks at the study 's limitations and inherent conflicts of interest , as well as the financial aspects of medicating healthy people to lower cholesterol .
- - - Pharma Marketing Tactics Threaten Public Health and Wealth
by Vera Hassner Sharav Amid much fanfare , on Sunday , November 9 , AstraZeneca announced the results of its drug trial , Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention : an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ( JUPITER ) .
The results were announced at the American Heart Association conference and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine ( Nov. 9 ) .
The study was hailed as a watershed event in heart disease prevention : " In this trial of apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high - sensitivity C- reactive protein levels , rosuvastatin [ Crestor ] significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events . "
Current treatment algorithms for the prevention of myocardial infarction , stroke , and death from cardiovascular causes recommend statin therapy for patients with established vascular disease , diabetes , and overt hyperlipidemia .
Last year Statins commanded a $ 34 billion market share .
Not satisfied with selling pharmaceuticals to the sick , drug manufacturers seek to expand the market for prescription drugs to healthy people .
They promote drugs as though they were toothpaste - disregarding the drugs ' hazardous effects .
Companies do this by persuading an unsuspecting public about the need to take drugs as a preventive measure against presumed risks of future illness .
And , more importantly , drug companies set out to convince doctors - providing cash incentives - to prescribe drugs for healthy people despite documented , even life - threatening risks .
To their credit , the NEJM published an editorial by Mark A. Hlatky , M.D. , who took a more critical view of the study design , its reliance on a single biomarker , CRP .
He raises doubts whether the findings warrant expanded use of statins .
Dr. Hlatky points to other flaws in the JUPITER study design : " ... the study provides only limited and indirect information about the role of high - sensitivity C- reactive protein testing in clinical management , since the trial did not compare subjects with and those without high - sensitivity C- reactive protein measurements , nor did it compare the use of high - sensitivity C- reactive protein with the use of other markers of cardiovascular risk . "
" The relative risk reductions achieved with the use of statin therapy in JUPITER were clearly significant .
However , absolute differences in risk are more clinically important than relative reductions in risk in deciding whether to recommend drug therapy , since the absolute benefits of treatment must be large enough to justify the associated risks and costs .
The proportion of participants with hard cardiac events in JUPITER was reduced from 1.8 % ( 157 of 8901 subjects ) in the placebo group to 0.9 % ( 83 of the 8901 subjects ) in the rosuvastatin group ; thus , 120 participants were treated for 1.9 years to prevent one event . "
" On the other side of the balance , of concern are the significantly higher glycated hemoglobin levels and incidence of diabetes in the rosuvastatin group in JUPITER ( 3.0 % , vs. 2.4 % in the placebo group ; P=0.01 ) .
There are also no data on the long - term safety of lowering LDL cholesterol to the level of 55 mg per deciliter ( 1.4 mmol per liter ) , as was attained with rosuvastatin in JUPITER , which is lower than in previously reported trials .
Long - term safety is clearly important in considering committing low - risk subjects without clinical disease to 20 years or more of drug treatment .
Finally , the cost of rosuvastatin ( roughly $ 3.45 per day or $ 1,250 per year ) is much higher than that of generic statins . "
The cost - for the drug alone -- of treating 120 people for 1.9 years to prevent one serious cardiac event would be $ 285,000 .
Dr. Hlatky further notes : " Ridker et al. suggest , from their meta- regression analysis , that the risk reduction observed in JUPITER was greater than that expected on the basis of previous trials .
Meta -regression is not a reliable technique , however , and the early termination of JUPITER owing to the efficacy data probably exaggerated the results to some degree . "
Which brings us to the issue of conflicts of interest : AstraZeneca funded the JUPITER study in order to justify prescribing its cholesterol - lowering statin , Crestor for people with normal cholesterol levels .
Needless to say , a favorable result would exponentially increase the sales of the drug .
The potential profit is in the trillions of dollars .
The research objective had a built - in bias , and the sponsor and principle investigator had a strong stake in a desired outcome .
Furthermore , in light of the increased incidence of diabetes among the group prescribed Crestor ( 3.0 % , vs. 2.4 % in the placebo group ) , the trial 's early suspension raises red flags about the extent of that ( and other risks ) that are known to occur mostly after extended exposure .
Not disclosed in the NEJM , is the discovery by Merrill Goozner : " the first thing you need to know about this trial is that its lead investigator , Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , owns a patent on the $ 20 test that measures CRP . " ( posted below )
The JUPITER trial screened nearly 90,000 people to find the 17,800 with elevated CRP measures who were eligible for the trial .
If 10 million people are tested to find the estimated two million with elevated CRP levels , " it 's $ 200 million in test sales , which , if the royalty is only 1 percent , amounts to a hefty $ 2 million a year in extra income for Dr. Ridker . "
If AstraZeneca can get two million more " apparently healthy men and women " on rosuvastatin , it 's an additional $ 2 billion - plus in sales . "
In light of AstraZeneca 's record of corrupt practices [ * ] , the following authors ' statement should taken with a high degree of skepticism : " The trial was financially supported by AstraZeneca .
The sponsor collected the trial data and monitored the study sites but played no role in the conduct of the analyses or drafting of the manuscript and had no access to the unblinded trial data until after the manuscript was submitted for publication . "
American medicine has been derailed from its therapeutic focus and ethical principle , " first , do no harm , " into a commercially driven enterprise since it aligned itself with the pharmaceutical industry .
Industry 's unconscionable marketing strategy - promoting the use of drugs for healthy people - is accomplished with assistance from professional medical societies and influential physicians at prestigious academic centers .
Doctors have adopted a specious corporate rationale to justify prescribing drugs for healthy people as " preventive therapy . "
All - too - often , doctors accept findings from company - controlled , biased studies , ignoring the indicators for potential serious hazards posed by drugs .
In the case of the JUPITER study , there was " a higher incidence of physician - reported diabetes " in the group exposed to Crestor .
Doctors at the American Heart Association , lent legitimacy to prescribing statins for long - term use in healthy people , simply on the basis of a screening test that showed they had elevated levels of CRP , a biomarker for inflammation .
They predicted that the JUPITER study might lead as many as 7 million more Americans to consider taking cholesterol - lowering statin drugs , such as : Crestor , Lipitor , Zocor , Similarly , the prescribing practices of US psychiatrists are driven by industry 's marketing agenda with no scientific medical evidence to support the widespread prescribing of psychotropic drugs .
Dubious screening tests - such as DISC , TeenScreen , KiddieSADS , TRAYY - provide the basis for " diagnosing " mental disorders in millions of otherwise healthy American children who are then exposed to harmful toxic drugs that interfere with normal physiological and neurological development .
Even as these drugs ' labels now carry black box warnings , the most severe drug warnings mandated by the FDA - including the increased risk of suicide - prominent psychiatrists promote the use of these drugs in children .
Financially compromised psychiatrists regularly pen their name ( for hefty fees ) to industry - generated clinical trial reports and clinical practice guidelines whose prescription drug recommendations have propelled the most toxic psychotropic drugs into blockbuster sellers .

CRP -- The Next Chapter in Medical Waste ?
The latest study on statins and heart disease , which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine website yesterday and in all the major papers this morning , is worth a second look , not because of what it says about heart disease , which is mildly interesting at best , but because of what it reveals about profit - driven medical research and how it contributes to making the U.S. health care system the most bloated and wasteful in the world .

Terror 's youngest victim
I t is a long walk from the main gate , through the Sir Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital 's labyrinthine innards and up a slope , before you reach Ward No 41 , on the first floor of the building dedicated to the care of sick children .
At the far end of the ward , two beds away from the head nurse 's station , four - month - old Sheetal Yadav looks around curiously .
Her beautiful large eyes focus on you -- a new curiosity within the bland , flaking walls of the multi-bed hall that serves as the children 's ward .
You pick her up and she gives you a bright , pleased smile .
But her clothes are wet ; her skin wrinkled from the damp .
She is not wearing any underwear .
" Kya karoon ( What can I do ) ? " says her 25 - year - old mother Sunita helplessly .
" I only have a few clothes for her , and she 's wet them all . "
Sheetal is much too young to understand the horror that has befallen her family .
But her mother is reeling under the impact of the devastation that targeted them on November 26 .
When the terrorists launched their murderous spree at Mumbai's Chhattrapati Shivaji Terminus on November 26 , Sunita 's family was one of the many destroyed in the brutal attack .
Upendra Yadav , a data entry operator for a company in Vapi ( located at the southern tip of Gujarat ; it touches the state 's border with Maharashtra ) , was taking his wife and daughter back home to Basawan in Uttar Pradesh .
They were accompanied by Sunita 's brother , Upendra 's cousin sister and her five - year - old son .
In a voice so soft you can barely hear it , Sunita says her husband is dead ; she believes he died almost instantly in that murderous hail .
The shock of her unexpected loss is evident -- she moves like a zombie , eyes vacant , voice without emotion , as she mechanically goes through the motions necessary for the mother of a four - month - old baby .
She does not eat enough to survive , says her father sadly .
" I picked up my baby and ran , " Sunita says tonelessly .
She , too , was hurt .
Sunita had been hit by bullet in her chest and shrapnel struck other parts of her body .
As she struggled to find her way out of the panic - ridden station , her blood drenched her child .
Then , she could no longer run .
The loss of blood had made her giddy and she fainted , holding tightly to her precious child .
( Guantanamo Bay , December 8 , 2008 ) - Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others announced that they plan to plead guilty to conspiring in the September 11 attacks and related crimes at a hearing before US military commissions at Guantanamo today .
All five defendants face the death penalty .
" What should have been a major victory in holding the 9/11 defendants accountable for terrible crimes has been tainted by torture and an unfair military commissions process , " said Jennifer Daskal , senior counterterrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch .
" These five men are known to have been mistreated and tortured during their years in CIA custody , including the acknowledged waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed . "
Prior to their transfer to the US military detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 , all five defendants were held for years in secret CIA detention .
Earlier this year , CIA Director Gen. Michael Hayden acknowledged that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been subjected to " waterboarding " - a form of mock drowning that has been prosecuted as torture by the United States for more than 100 years .
Other defendants are believed to have been subjected to other abusive interrogation methods such as extended sleep deprivation , the use of painful stress positions , and forced nudity , while in CIA custody .
Under the rules of the military commissions , a judge cannot accept a guilty plea unless he determines that the plea is voluntary and free of coercion .
" In light of the men 's severe mistreatment and torture , the judge should require a full and thorough factual inquiry to determine whether or not these pleas are voluntary , " Daskal said .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four others - Ali Abdul - Aziz Ali , Ramzi bin al - Shibh , Mustafa al - Hawsawi , and Walid bin Attash - were formally charged before the military commissions on June 5 , 2008 .
All but Hawsawi have chosen to represent themselves , although they have accepted lawyers as advisors .
As of September , all of the men except Bin al Shibh seemed to be cooperating with their legal counsel .
Bin al - Shibh 's lawyers have challenged his competency and are continuing to represent him until a decision on that issue is reached .
" Upon taking office , President Obama should dissolve the military commissions and move these cases to federal court , so that the outcome of the most important terrorism trials in the history of the United States will not be questioned , " Daskal said .

This one ranks right up there with the weirder musical instruments .
The Beer Organ is a keyboard device that actuates compressed air which blows over the openings of beer bottles .
The organ has brass fittings , lighting and is contained in a walnut enclosure on casters .
It has an air pump controller and self playing device ( like a player piano ) which allows the organ to also play musical tunes unaided , or via keyboard or MIDI controlled device .
Yes , it has Midi .
I know what you ’re thinking , this is an instrument that someone recently threw together as a joke , a crazy DIY project .
Nope , these have been around since the 1800’s .
Finally – a use for all those beer bottles you saved while you were in college .
Oh wait , I promised audio .

An issue that has entered the mainstream media in a lot of countries ( noticeably not really in the US ) is Genetic Engineering ( GE ) or Genetic Modification ( GM ) of food .
A lot of food that we eat today contains genetically modified ingredients and usually without our knowledge .
Supporters of this technology maintain that it ensures and sustains food security around the world as the population increases .
As time goes on , the science behind genetic engineering is no doubt improving .
Biotechnology could be the wave of the future and genetically modified foods could really provide alternatives to help increase food production .
However , there is a growing wave of concern from citizens , farmers and scientists who question the way the research is currently being handled by a few large , profit - hungry corporations .
That is , as well as scientific debates on the merits of genetically engineered food , there are equally , if not more important , debates on the socioeconomic ramifications of the way such science is marketed and used .
Critics believe :
The problem of food shortages is a political and economic problem .
.
Food shortages and hunger are -- and will be -- experienced by the poorer nations .
. GE
Food is an expensive technology that the farmers of the developing nations would not be able to afford easily .
that the farmers of the developing nations would not be able to afford easily .
Patenting laws go against the poor around the world and allow biotech companies to benefit from patenting indigenous knowledge often without consent .
around the world and allow biotech companies to benefit from patenting indigenous knowledge often without consent .
This is a very young and untested technology and may not be the answer just yet .
and may not be the answer just yet .
Crop uniformity , which the biotech firms are promoting , will reduce genetic diversity making them more vulnerable to disease and pests .
This furthers the need for pesticides ( often created by the same companies creating and promoting genetically engineered crops ) .
Hence this leads to questions of the motives of corporations and countries who are using the plight of the developing world as a marketing strategy to gain acceptance of GE food as well as dependency upon it via intellectual property rights .
That they are against any labeling or other precautionary steps and measures that states may wish to take is of paramount concern .
The way in which we reach the answer to the question , " are GE foods safe ? " is where a lot of the problem lies .
A quick acceptance of GE foods without proper testing etc. could show corporate profitability to be very influential , while a thorough debate and sufficient public participation would ensure that real social and environmental concerns are in fact adhered to .
And this pattern would probably indicate to us how other major issues in the future ought to be dealt with .
There is also the issue of do we actually need genetically engineered food , given that agriculture in small biodiverse farms are actually very productive .
Economics and politics at all levels , ( international , national and local ) have often prevented food from reaching hungry people , not a lack of production .
These same causes have also created , or contributed to , a lot of poverty , which prevents people from being able to afford food in the first place .
This section then , looks more into the political issues behind the emerging promotion of biotechnology and genetically modified or engineered foods .

In the Fall issue of Ms. , The American Prospect 's Ann Friedman gets the real story behind Seasonale and Lybrel , the pills that allow women to menstruate only four times a year or not at all , respectively .
Some opponents of these kinds of pills have argued that not having a period is " unnatural , " and others say these pills " pathologize " menstruation .
Friedman points out that the original pill was manufactured on a 28 - day cycle as a way to convince Catholics that it was natural , not because it was actually any more natural than these newer versions .
Friedman also notes that " the uterine lining does not build up as quickly for women on the pill , there 's actually no medical need to slough it off every three weeks . "
In other words , all the research thus far has shown that these pills are safe , so why all the fuss ?
As Sarah Haskins told us already , it 's all about marketing .
When Seasonale first came on the market in 2003 , it had Candace Bushnell as a spokeswoman .
In the ads for the pill , the Sex and the City scribe said , " When you think about what women have accomplished with thirteen periods a year , think about what we can accomplish with only four . "
This makes the pill sound like a lifestyle choice , rather than a real medical decision with discernible benefits , Friedman points out .
These benefits can include lower risk for uterine and ovarian cancers and hindering the progress of endometriosis .
On the anti-pill side is anti-choice crazy Leslee Unruh .
Leslee said of the period supressing Lybrel , " [ It 's ] a war on women and children … [ it 's proponents are ] wanting us women who are feminine and have fertility … to be like men . "
Of course , neither Bushnell nor Unruh have it right : regulating your period in whatever way you see fit is neither a lifestyle choice nor unnatural .
It 's a decision to be made with research and medical professionals .

Newswise — New analytical tools coming on line at the Spallation Neutron Source , the Department of Energy 's state - of - the - art neutron science facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , include a beam line dedicated to nuclear physics studies .
The Fundamental Neutron Physics Beam Line ( FNPB ) has opened its shutter to receive neutrons for the first time .
Among the nuclear physics studies planned for the new , intense beam line are experiments that probe the neutron - related mysteries associated with the " Big Bang . "
" Completion of the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beam Line marks a significant step in the SNS 's ramp up to full power , building up to its eventual suite of 25 instruments for neutron analysis , " said ORNL Director Thom Mason , who led the SNS construction project to its completion .
" The nuclear physics community is excited to have this new tool for exploring theories of the origins of the universe . "
Although research at most of the current and future operating SNS beam lines is directed towards condensed matter and materials research , research at the FNPB is focused on basic studies in nuclear physics .
" While other beam lines use neutrons as a probe to study materials , the object for much of the work proposed at the FNPB is the study of the neutron itself , " said University of Tennessee Professor Geoffrey Greene , who holds a Joint Faculty Appointment with ORNL and who leads the FNPB project .
" Among the questions that will be addressed at the FNPB are the details of the internal structure of the neutron as well as a careful study of the way in which the free neutron decays .
Such experiments have important implication for fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology . "
Greene explained that neutrons , which have no electric charge , may nevertheless have a slight displacement between internal positive and negative charges .
The existence of such a " neutron electric dipole moment " could shed light on what happened in the early phases of the Big Bang .
In particular it could help to explain why the universe appears to be made entirely of matter without any antimatter , he said .
While the neutron is stable in most nuclei , when it is liberated ( for example in an SNS neutron beam ) it lives for only about 10 minutes .
" Precise measurements of the neutron lifetime help clarify the distribution of chemical elements generated in the first few minutes of the Big Bang and shed light on the amount of normal matter — as opposed to dark matter and dark energy — in the universe , " Greene said .
" Another set of extremely precise studies at the FNPB will address the interaction between neutrons and simple nuclei and may help to explain universal ' parity ' violation , " Greene said .
" Roughly speaking , parity is the symmetry that implies that the laws of physics are invariant when ' viewed in a mirror . '
The surprising fact is , at a basic level , the universe appears to be ' left - handed . '
" The challenge remains to understand why this puzzling state of affairs exists , " he said .
Greene noted that the theoretical basis for such symmetry violation -- first outlined several decades ago -- was recognized earlier this month with the 2008 Nobel Prize to Yoichiro Nambu .
The FNPB is funded by the DOE Office of Science 's Office of Nuclear Physics .
ORNL is managed by UT - Battelle for the Department of Energy .
More than 4,000 British Muslims have passed through terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan , according to security agencies , providing a fertile recruitment pool for the Islamist international jihad .
Men from the UK's Kashmiri community have joined groups such as Lashkar - e - Toiba , the prime suspects in the Mumbai attacks , which have been fighting against Indian forces in Kashmir .
Others from a Pakistani background are in the ranks of the Taliban and other groups taking part in action against British and Nato forces in Afghanistan .
A former commander of the British force in Helmand , Brigadier Ed Butler , has revealed that his troops had come across British Muslims in southern Afghanistan .
" There are British passport holders who live in the UK who are being found in places such as Kandahar , " he said .
" There is a link between Kandahar and urban conurbations in the UK .
This is something the military understands , but the British public does not . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last year , RAF Nimrod intelligence - gathering aircraft tracking Taliban radio signals in Afghanistan heard insurgent fighters speaking with Yorkshire and Midlands accents .
As well as fighters joining their ranks , groups such as Lashkar also benefit from funds raised on their behalf in the UK by the Muslim community .
It has also been claimed that some of the aid money donated for the earthquake disaster relief three years ago was siphoned off for militant groups .
Lashkar , previously known as Jaish - e - Mohammed , has forged links with al - Qa'ida in Pakistan and are said to have shared training camps .
One of their most famous recruits was Rashid Rauf , accused of being a key member in the plot to blow up transatlantic airliners , who was recently reported to have been killed in an American missile strike .
British Muslim recruits have also been involved in other conflicts .
Asif Hanif , 21 , from London , killed three people and injured 55 by blowing himself up in Tel Aviv .
A companion , Omar Sharif , 27 , from Derby fled the scene after explosives strapped to his body failed to detonate and was later found dead , his body washed up on an Israeli beach .
Somalia 's transitional government has accused Britain of being the main source of money and men for the fighters of the Islamist Courts Union ( ICU ) , a fundamentalist group , in the country .
The then deputy prime minister , Hussain Mohammed Aideed , declared : " The ICU 's main support was coming from London , paying cash to the ICU against the government .
Among those who died in the war with the ICU were British passport holders . "
The Independent , in Mogadishu after the Somali capital was taken over by Islamist forces last summer , discovered a significant number of young Somalis who had returned to fight for the Islamists from the diaspora in the West .
Half a dozen young men , including two brothers from Wood Green in north London , were acting as bodyguards for Sheik Yusuf , one of the main Islamist commanders .
One of the brothers , Hamid , said at the time : " The true Muslims are the only ones who are honest and who are patriots .
We are doing our duty by fighting for the cause of Islam , which is above all countries . "
Britain has also been accused of being the centre where a number of terrorist plots abroad were planned .
Moutaz Almallah Dabas , a Syrian - born Spanish citizen accused of helping those who took part in the 2004 Madrid train bombings , was extradited from London to Spain after the discovery of links between the attack and an alleged cell in England .
Friedman :
We should ' consider moving up the inauguration date ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In 1933 , the Great Depression deepened as the country drifted between the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his inauguration .
In an attempt to prevent that from happening again , the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution moved presidential inaugurations from March up to January -- but now even January 20 may not come soon enough for the struggling American economy .
New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday , " I think we should seriously consider moving up the inauguration date , because I do n't know that we have two months to have a political vacuum at this moment in this economic crisis .
...
This administration has kind of checked out .
They 're not going to do anything big . "
" There is a storm coming , " Friedman continued , " and it has n't hit yet .
And I believe the decisions made , possibly in these next two months , could determine the next four years .
This administration could be over before it starts -- over in the sense that it will spend the next four years digging out of a hole that has been created right now , that may be deeper and darker than anyone realizes . "
An economic adviser to President - elect Barack Obama has told CNN that Obama is urging outgoing President Bush to do more to fix the economy , but some Democrats worry that this is not enough .
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) says of Obama , " I would like him to become -- at least offer to become -- more involved .
And I think that offer would be welcomed , not just by the Democrats in the House and the Senate but also by the White House itself . "

Here 's another edition of the BillO Comedy Hour .
O'Reilly is very worried that he's one of the only people who will be looking out for the folks if Obama and the Democrats win a strong majority in Congress .
This is the talking point that Bill and Newt have been pushing : ' Be afraid of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid , so do n't vote for the Democrats , ' even though Republican / Conservative rule has devastated our country and Iraq .
( rough transcript )
O'Reilly : ... is , when you have a collision , say Obama wins the election of a committed left Congress and a committed left President with a committed left media , they all then meld together .
I do n't think this is healthy for the country .
I mean , you 're going to have a media that 's very sympathetic to whatever Congress and the President does no matter what it is .
And you 're going to have very few voices , talk radio , this network , some people in dissent .
I 'm getting a little uneasy here , Juan .
Williams :
Well , hold on .
You had a Republican President , you had a Republican House and Republican Senate for most of the Bush administration ...
O'Reilly : And a liberal media .
Williams :
Well , but you know what , most of the media was intimidated , remember the whole idea was that this is a right - of - center country and this is a man in power .
There 's always deference showed to the President ...
O'Reilly :
It looks like the stars are aligned .
{snip} But Mary Katherine , the collusion of a far left Congress to a far left media to a far left media being sympathetic to them makes me a little uneasy because there 's no check and balance there , it all goes out the window .
The media is supposed to be the check and balance on the Congress and there is n't any check anymore .
They are actively rooting and promoting and that 's what we have .
I did n't hear Bill complain when the media rolled over for Bush , allowing him to lie us into war and forgo every single campaign promise he made .
You remember his " Compassionate Conservative " routine ?
And has Bill ever heard of the Blue Dogs ?
Of course everything Bill says is a complete lie in this clip , but we 're used to that here at C&L .
But if what O'Reilly says was actually true and the Democratic Party does achieve a solid majority after Nov. 4th then let me break down his argument .
1. Talk Radio : Rush Limbaugh and his followers will attack every single policy Obama tries to put forth that will try to help rescue this nation from the complete disaster that has been caused by Conservatism .
2. FOX News :
Is an extension of right wing talk radio and so will also try to disrupt every policy decision Obama makes .
And they will use every smear available to them .
3. Liberal media : Typical Conservative talking point that has been successful in intimidating the press from doing their job whenever it benefits Republicans .
4 . When has O'Reilly ever worried about checks and balances ?
But let 's forget that .
Why would Bill and the media be in " dissent " over Obama ?
Are n't they supposed to be covering the news as it happens ?
Being a watchdog of the government does n't mean that the press has to disagree with their policy decisions from the outset , it means an eye is kept on them .
And so ends another edition of the Bill O'Reilly Comedy hour .
FOX should n't feel too bad that The Half Hour News Hour failed so miserably .
They already have a comedy show that 's been running for a very long time now .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
With financial markets still not working smoothly two months after almost shutting down , the Federal Reserve unveiled further steps Tuesday aimed at lowering borrowing costs for consumers and home buyers .
The Fed has pumped billions of dollars into financial institutions , but found that this was not enough to bring institutional buyers and sellers of key mortgage and lending products back to the market .
The central bank announced what it called a term asset - backed securities loan facility , a plan under which it will lend up to $ 200 billion to support the issuance of debt backed by consumer and small - business debt -- such as credit - card loans , student debt , auto loans and loans backed by the Small Business Administration .
In addition , the Fed said that it would purchase up to $ 100 billion in direct debt of Fannie Mae FNM , , Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.59 % and the Federal Home Loan Banks , along with up to $ 500 billion of mortgage - backed securities backed by Fannie , Freddie and Ginnie Mae ( the government - sponsored enterprises , also known as GSEs ) .
The Treasury Department is providing a backstop for the asset - backed - securities program from its Troubled Asset Relief Program pool , known as TARP .
“ The Fed 'is well on its way of following the Bank of Japan 's policy of quantitative easing -- targeting the quantity of money rather than its price . ' ” — Ashraf Laidi , CMC Markets
" The financial markets are not working as we'd like them to work ... and this is an effort to address that situation , " said Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
In an illustration of the problem , delinquencies and losses on U.S. prime auto asset - backed securities remained at their highest levels since 2000 , pressured by seasonal factors along with the current economic climate , according to Fitch Ratings .
In another example of the trouble that lenders have been having , credit - card giant American Express Co. AXP , - 1.08 % earlier this month -- on the same day that Paulson said the Fed 's latest plan was on the way -- sought government help to steer it through the financial crisis , and Capital One Financial Corp.
COF , - 1.23 % received preliminary approval for $ 3.55 billion in U.S. investment .
See full story .
Bypassing banks , creating liquidity
In general terms , economists welcomed the Fed 's latest actions , although some critics complained it does n't make sense to encourage Americans to borrow more .
The U.S. central bank hopes the plan to lend to the markets for asset - backed - securities will create liquidity , which in turn would encourage originators of consumer loans to restart lending to individuals .
The markets for asset - backed securities " historically have funded a substantial share of consumer credit and SBA - guaranteed small - business loans , " the Fed said in a statement detailing the new loan facility .
The facility is designed to generate increased credit availability and to support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small - business asset - backed securities at what the Fed called " more normal interest - rate spreads . "
On Nov. 12 , Paulson laid out some details for the next stage of the government 's financial - market rescue package .
He announced that the Treasury had shelved the original plan to buy troubled mortgage assets while turning its attention to nonbank financial institutions and consumer finance .
Some of the money saved from not buying mortgage assets would be used to shore up the market for credit - card receivables , auto loans and student loans , according to Paulson .
" This market , which is vital for lending and growth , has for all practical purposes ground to a halt , " he said .
See full story .
U.S. government officials said the new asset - backed securities program is designed to go around banks and to reach cash - strapped investors .
It 's set to be up and running in February .
The Treasury will provide $ 20 billion of credit protection to the Fed in connection with the asset - backed securities loan .
Investors will be able to tap the Fed for funds to purchase these asset - backed securities .
The Treasury 's thinking is that this will remove some of the fear in the market and let investors become more engaged , according to government officials .
Purchases of up to $ 100 billion of GSE direct obligations will be conducted through primary dealers in a series of competitive auctions to begin next week .
The open - market purchases will be conducted by asset managers selected via a competitive process with a goal of starting the program before the end of the year .
Thawing out the mortgage market
Lauding the new program , Paulson said the government may act to expand it over time to include other assets , such as commercial mortgage - backed securities , nonagency residential mortgage - backed securities and other asset classes .
For now , government officials said they hope that direct purchase of mortgages would lower yields on the loans for home buyers .
" This action is being taken to reduce the cost and availability of credit for the purchase of houses , which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally , " the Fed said .
Already , the yield on current - coupon mortgages has fallen 60 basis points , or 0.6 % , from Friday 's close , according to Morgan Stanley analysts .
Those gains will help a different benchmark for investors .
Yields on mortgage - backed securities on Monday were about 1.64 percentage points higher than Treasurys , according to an index compiled by Merrill Lynch .
That 's headed back up towards the multi- year highs reaching in March and is contributing to keeping mortgage loan rates high , and therefore less available or desirable for potential home buyers .
Fresh data reported Tuesday in the latest S&P / Case - Shiller analysis of home prices showed continued deterioration , underscoring the extent of the problem in U.S. real estate .
See full story .
Ashraf Laidi , chief foreign - exchange strategist at CMC Markets , said the Fed " is well on its way of following the Bank of Japan 's policy of quantitative easing -- targeting the quantity of money rather than its price . "
However , government officials denied the program was quantitative easing , noting that the Japanese central bank added reserves to influence bank behavior .
By contrast , the U.S. program 's aimed at investors , the officials commented .
The Fed will be adding reserves to its balance sheet , which has already grown by $ 1.3 trillion this year as a result of the program .
List of Companies Planning to Participate in the US ’s Government TARP
Ever wonder how many companies announced plans to participate in the US ’s government TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) ?
I did a little digging and as of November 18th , there were at least 25 companies either approved or planning to participate .
Here ’s an unordered list .
First Midwest Bancorp Inc. ( FMBI ) – Received preliminary approval for about $ 193 million worth of investment South Financial Group Inc. ( TSFG ) – Applied CoBiz Financial Inc. ( COBZ ) – Plans to apply E*Trade Financial Corp. ( ETFC ) – Applied for $ 800 million Associated Banc - Corp .
( ASBC ) – Preliminary approved for $ 530 million Capital Pacific Bancorp ( CPBO ) – Preliminary approved for $ 4 million Fulton Financial Corp . ( FULT ) – Filed an application for about $ 375 million .
Trustmark Corp. ( TRMK ) – Preliminary approved and will issue $ 215 million in senior preferred shares and $ 32.3 million in common shares .
Pacific Capital Bancorp ( PCBC ) – Preliminary approved for about $ 188 million Heritage Commerce Corp . ( HTBK ) – About $ 40 million was preliminary approved Banner Corp . ( BANR ) – $ 124 million was approved in senior preferred , $ 18 in common shares Columbia Banking System Inc. ( COLB ) – $ 76.9 million was preliminary approved Heritage Financial Corp .
( HFWA ) – $ 24 million in senior preferred , $ 3.6 in common stock .
Bridge Bancorp ( BDGE ) – Considering participation Cascade Financial Corp. ( CASB ) – About $ 39 million Midwest Banc Holdings Inc. ( MBHI ) – About $ 85.5 million in preferred , $ 12.8 million of common stock .
Goldman Sachs – part of the initial 9 banks that the government bought equity stakes into , along with the 8 below Morgan Stanley J. P. Morgan Chase & Co Bank of America Merrill Lynch Citigroup Inc. Wells Fargo & Co. Bank of New York Mellon State Street Corp
As I know , the TARP is a 5 year program that allows banks to borrow at 5 % , an amazingly attractive rate given the circumstances .
Do you have any relationships with these banks ?
Are you scared that so many already announced their desire to participate ( and many more assumed to have applied but without any announcements yet ) ?
Does it really matter to you ?
A few weeks ago , we reported on the news that a programmer was nearing completion on a Linux port of 3D Realms ' popular title Prey .
Ryan " icculus " Gordon was working to push out the full retail version of the game 's binaries .
After months of work , he has finally succeeded in bringing the full version of the game to the Linux platform .
In an attempt to keep the entire procedure legal , the full Linux version requires a working CD key and the original CDs or digitally - distributed installation file to get the game up and running .
The full single player game is supported and Gordon says that network play is also supported cross-platform with the original PC version .
All the information relating to the release and how to install it can be found on icculus ' web site .
Prey is a solid shooter , if not an aging one , but it 's nevertheless nice to see this port come to fruition .
There is no reason that more games can't come to the Linux platform , and if Prey sees a boost in sales ... well , let 's not get ahead of ourselves .
The game does some interested things with perspective and messed with 3D space long before Portal .
If you have n't checked it out , get a copy on the cheap .
Here is a store that is sadly destined to fail .
I love the leet reference but probably not the best marketing idea .
I 'm sure every old lady in this town has already written this place off as a pawn shop owned by some damn foreigner that can't spell .
The truth is , I guarantee you the pwner looks a hell of a lot more like one of these two creeps .
The only thing being Pwned ! in this place is your sweet virgin ass .
New Generation of Intel Devices Can Measure Air Pollution , " Scavenge " Energy from the Environment
December 8th , 2008 by Michael Ratliff
Intel has unveiled a new generation of tiny sensors that continuously analyze air quality in an effort to further understand and combat air pollution .
The corporation also announced on Friday that it is developing devices that can tap energy from sunlight , body heat and television signals .
While the air quality sensors have yet to hit the consumer market , street sweepers in San Francisco have already been outfitted with the chip - sized sensors that continuously monitor and relay air pollution information .
The sensors are linked to GPS enabled Nokia N95 cellphones and allow scientists to access air quality readings worldwide in real time .
According to Intel ’s Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner , the energy tapping devices ( which are in the research stage ) can salvage and store small amounts of energy from sources in the surrounding environment such as sunlight , body heat , television signals and cell phone towers .
The devices are designed to continuously ‘ scavenge ’ energy until they have a enough power to perform a given task such as run a built - in data transmitter with limited range .
Rattner says a commercial application for such a product could be a medical implant that monitors a patient ’s health and then transmits data to a doctor ’s cell phone placed near the implant .
I am most excited about the air quality sensors .
Imagine the data that could be gathered if every phone in the country had such a device .
Changes in air pollution could be monitored in real time and environmental disasters could be predicted and prevented !
The prospect of ‘ free energy ’ devices is quite interesting as well , although I would like to see if such a system could work on a large scale .

Poor Lonesome George : Although he may have found a mate , researchers say he is still being denied the joys of fatherhood .
George is thought to be the last representative of a tortoise subspecies from the Galapagos Island of Pinta , and researchers rejoiced this summer when he appeared to father a batch of eggs .
But earlier this week a spokesperson for the Galapagos National Park announced that 80 percent of the eggs do not appear to be viable .
The excitement began this summer when two female tortoises exhibited surprising behavior .
The females , who have shared George 's enclosure at the Charles Darwin Research Station on the central island of Santa Cruz for almost 20 years , are of a different but closely related species .
After decades of reproductive reticence , they stunned scientists during the summer by building nests and filling them with eggs for the first time [ Nature News ] .
Researchers quickly removed the 16 eggs from the nests and installed them in an artificial incubator , although three of those eggs were thought to have already deteriorated .
The remaining 13 eggs were expected to hatch this week , but a recent inspection depressed researchers ' hopes .
Most of the eggs were found to have lost a great deal of weight through water loss , which indicates that no embryos have been developing , and several eggs have fungus growing on their shells , which may signal that the material inside is rotting .
However , a slim chance of baby tortoises remains .
Scientists said 20 percent of the remaining eggs could still produce offspring ....
" We will leave the eggs in the incubators and try to find answers , " said Washington Tapia , a park official [ Reuters ] .

Hill is known as Cupcake to his friends and would appear to be an unlikely Barack Obama supporter .
He spoke to the BBC's Matthew Price about his support for the Democrat , and why some of his friends will not vote for a black man .
Water ,
Water , everywhere ; nor any drop to drink .
The plight of the Ancient Mariner is about to be alleviated thanks to a firm of eco-inventors from Canada who claim to have found the solution to the world 's worsening water shortages by drawing the liquid of life from an unlimited and untapped source - the air .
The company , Element Four , has developed a machine that it hopes will become the first mainstream household appliance to have been invented since the microwave .
Their creation , the WaterMill , uses the electricity of about three light bulbs to condense moisture from the air and purify it into clean drinking water .
The machine went on display this weekend in the Flatiron district of Manhattan , hosted by Wired magazine at its annual showcase of the latest gizmos its editors believe could change the world .
From the outside , the mill looks like a giant golf ball that has been chopped in half : it is about 3ft in diameter , made of white plastic , and is attached to the wall .
It works by drawing air through filters to remove dust and particles , then cooling it to just below the temperature at which dew forms .
The condensed water is passed through a self - sterilising chamber that uses microbe - busting UV light to eradicate any possibility of Legionnaires ' disease or other infections .
Finally , it is filtered and passed through a pipe to the owner 's fridge or kitchen tap .
The obvious question to the proposition that household water demands can be met by drawing it from the air is : are you crazy ?
To which the machine 's inventor and Element Four 's founder , Jonathan Ritchey , replies : ' Just wait and see .
The demand for water is off the chart .
People are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and increasingly unreliable . '
For the environmentally conscious consumer , the WaterMill has an obvious appeal .
Bottled water is an ecological catastrophe .
In the US alone , about 30bn litres of bottled water is consumed every year at a cost of about $ 11bn ( £ 7.4bn ) .
According to the Earth Policy Institute , about 1.5 m barrels of oil - enough to power 100,000 cars for a year - is used just to make the plastic .
The process also uses twice as much water as fits inside the container , not to mention the 30 m bottles that go into landfills every day in the US .
But the mill also has downsides , not least its $ 1,200 cost when it goes on sale in America , the UK , Italy , Australia and Japan in the spring .
In these credit crunch times that might dissuade many potential buyers , though Ritchey points out that at $ 0.3 per litre , it is much cheaper than bottled water and would pay for itself in a couple of years .
There is also the awkward fact that although there is eight times more atmospheric water than in all the rivers of the world combined , it is unevenly distributed .
Those areas of the US that are most desperate for more water - such as the arid south - west where ground water levels are already dramatically depleted - have the lowest levels of moisture in the air .
The mill ceases to be effective below about 30 per cent relative humidity levels , which are common later in the day in states such as Arizona .
To combat that problem , the machine has an intelligent computer built into it that increases its output at dawn when humidity is highest , and reduces it from mid-afternoon when a blazing sun dries the air .

Obama :
I read the other day that Sen. McCain likes to gamble .
He likes to roll those dice .
And that ’s OK .
I enjoy a little friendly game of poker myself every now and then .
But one thing I know is this – we ca n’t afford to gamble on four more years of the same disastrous economic policies we ’ve had for the last eight .
Obama seems to have read this article in the New York Times :
Senator John McCain was on a roll .
In a room reserved for high - stakes gamblers at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut , he tossed $ 100 chips around a hot craps table .
When the marathon session ended around 2:30 a.m. , the Arizona senator and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings .
A lifelong gambler , Mr. McCain takes risks , both on and off the craps table .
He was throwing dice that night not long after his failed 2000 presidential bid , in which he was skewered by the Republican Party ’s evangelical base , opponents of gambling .
Mr. McCain was betting at a casino he oversaw as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , and he was doing so with the lobbyist who represents that casino , according to three associates of Mr. McCain .
The visit had been arranged by the lobbyist , Scott Reed , who works for the Mashantucket Pequot , a tribe that has contributed heavily to Mr. McCain ’s campaigns and built Foxwoods into the world ’s second - largest casino .
Joining them was Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s current campaign manager .
Their night of good fortune epitomized not just Mr. McCain ’s affection for gambling , but also the close relationship he has built with the gambling industry and its lobbyists during his 25 - year career in Congress .
The article also could have mentioned that McCain ’s recent moves – from suspending his campaign to picking Palin could also be included among his “ gambles ” .
Of course , his decision to blame Pelosi for the bill ’s failure is n’t a gamble – it ’s just ridiculous , a desperate attempt to distract the country from this latest incident in which his party has place ideology above country .
Combine this with McCain ’s apparent propensity of over - personalize conflicts and crises , and you get an idea of what a disaster a McCain administration would be .
This guy was n’t even able – after he put himself on the line and went to Washington and acknowledged something had to be done – to get a significant minority of his party to support any sort of compromise on this issue .
The Republicans demonstrated today that they are not willing to make the difficult choices needed to lead .
But better days are coming :
The skies look cloudy and it ’s dark .
And you think the rains will never pass .
But these too will pass : a brighter day will come .

I know that some of you would druther have seen it go the other way , ... you sick bastards .
In the latest twist in Minnesota 's continuing U.S. Senate race , the Al Franken campaign hit Ramsey County with a lawsuit Thursday , seeking the names and addresses of voters whose absentee ballots were rejected .
The DFLer 's campaign hopes to force counties across the state to turn over the lists of rejected absentee voters who , if later found eligible , could tip the balance in the closest Senate race in the country .
With Republican Sen. Norm Coleman 206 votes ahead of Franken , a hand recount is scheduled to begin next week .
Marc Elias , lead recount attorney for Franken , said that both Ramsey and Hennepin counties had rejected the campaign 's request , forcing it to take legal action .
Elias said that because Beltrami County had complied , the campaign had already learned of one woman , an 84 - year - old stroke victim , whose absentee ballot was disqualified because her signature no longer matched that on her pre-stroke voter registration card .
" The state may not devise a regime where a woman , because she had a stroke , does not have the right to vote , " Elias said at Franken headquarters Thursday morning .
But Beltrami County Auditor Kay Mack later questioned the campaign 's account , saying her office had n't rejected any ballots because of mismatched signatures .
Mack said there was one instance of an 87 - year - old woman in an assisted living center whose ballot was rejected because it bore no signature or mark .
The law , Mack said , is " very clear " about not accepting such ballots .
After being contacted by the Star Tribune with Mack 's account , Franken campaign spokesman Andy Barr said Thursday night that there may have been " some confusion about our earlier field report , " adding that the campaign is " still digging into the facts . "
Barr said the issue does not affect the merits of their lawsuit .
Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said Thursday that the state would not consider rejected absentee ballots as it begins the recount of the 2.9 million votes cast in last week 's election .
" Recount law is very specific about what is included , " Ritchie said .
" Under current law , those rejected ballots would be handled by a court . "
Meanwhile , Franken scored a gain of one net vote in 196 randomly selected precincts where a hand count of votes was conducted in recent days to test the accuracy of voting machines , according to a Star Tribune calculation .
The precinct - by - precinct results , which reduce Coleman 's lead from 206 to 205 votes , were posted on the secretary of state 's website Thursday night separately from the current unofficial tally .
They will be included in the certified totals to be approved on Tuesday by the state Canvassing Board .
If the same rate of change were experienced statewide , the DFLer would gain 21 votes in all .
The largest changes came in precincts in St. Louis and Ramsey counties .
Most Hennepin County results are not yet in .
Lots of attention , firepower
The race has drawn an influx of money and lawyers who are descending on the state .
Elias said the Franken campaign alone will deploy 1,250 volunteers across the state as part of its recount effort .
Darwin Lookingbill , director of the Ramsey County attorney 's civil division , said the law provides access to the list of all those who voted absentee but does not require officials to break the roster down for those who had a ballot rejected .
If a judge were to rule that the lists be made available to the two campaigns , absentee voters might be contacted one by one by the campaigns in an attempt to determine whether the votes should have been counted .
" The only way we can ensure people were not disenfranchised is to check the lists , " Elias said .
Elias , who was general counsel to John Kerry 's 2004 presidential campaign , said the Franken campaign would attempt to persuade the state Canvassing Board to count rejected absentee ballots where eligibility has been confirmed .
Coleman camp responds Coleman campaign manager Cullen Sheehan called the lawsuit " a new low , " and said the Franken campaign was " shamelessly trying to strong - arm local officials into counting invalid ballots . "
Sheehan said he had " grave concerns " that any release of individual names could lead to " harassment " of voters .
Ritchie said that privacy concerns will surely play into a judge 's decision on whether to release such detailed records .
" I would hope a judge would have a broad perspective on this , " he said .
Minnesota law states that lists of absentee voters cannot be made public before the end of Election Day .
Franken 's attorneys are arguing that means the data must be made public after that .
The law does not specifically address the issue of rejected ballots .
Getting ready to recount
At the secretary of state 's office , preparations for the recount continued Thursday .
The office provided an online training session for election officials across the state that covered issues ranging from how to organize the recount room to how to sort the ballots .
After the session , Ritchie told a reporter that his office was completely focused on the recount but that he was not surprised to see the fight already taken to court .
" I imagine this is the first of a number of things that fit into the [ judicial ] contest side , " Ritchie said with a sigh .
" I think we 're seeing that the campaigns are going to push this as far as they can . "
Beltrami County Auditor Mack said she was shocked to learn Thursday of the example the Franken campaign held up .
" Beltrami County did n't reject one absentee ballot because signatures did n't match , " Mack said .
" And we informed them of that . "
Mack said that of the 1,918 absentee ballots cast in her county , 69 were rejected , some because they had no signature or mark at all .
Mack said she is troubled that Beltrami County was singled out .
" We go to a lot of trouble to make sure people who request an absentee ballot get to vote , " she said .
" It 's troubling to me that they 're identifying this happened at all when they know we did n't reject anyone for that reason .
It makes me think it 's not just an accidental report .
I mean , look who they picked ?
They picked someone who would tug at the heartstrings .
I 'd be outraged , too , if that happened .
But it did n't . "
The new bioethics instruction was approved by Pope Benedict XVI
The Vatican has updated its opposition to embryonic stem - cell research , in - vitro fertilisation and human cloning in a sweeping new document .
The Catholic Church also said the morning - after pill and drugs preventing the implantation of the embryo during pregnancy were " gravely immoral " .
The rulings came in a Vatican document released to respond to scientific advances made in the past two decades .
Catholic doctrine says life begins at conception and must be respected .
Dignitas Personae ( The Dignity of a Person ) , an Instruction of Certain Bioethical Questions , was issued by the Vatican 's doctrinal body , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and approved by Pope Benedict XVI .
Deserving respect
The 32 - page document condemned new forms of birth control that " fall within the sin of abortion " .
It also reiterated Catholic teaching that responsible human procreation should take place through an act of reciprocal love between a married couple .
It said human life deserved respect " from the very first stages of its existence and can never be reduced merely to a group of cells " .
The instruction updated the Vatican 's 1987 instruction , Donum Vitae ( The Gift of Life ) , which enshrined the dignity of the human embryo .
But while the updated document denounced embryonic stem - cell research - which it noted invariably resulted in the destruction of the embryo - it said adult stem cell research was allowed , as the subject was unharmed by the process .
NEW JERUSALEM , Mexico -
The bell towers and domes rise like a vision out of the sugarcane fields , a medieval city sprouting from the hills of western Mexico .
A 30 - foot - high gate , complete with Disney - esque turrets , blocks the end of a winding road .
Behind it , a massive cross and an 11 - story tower loom over a statue of a knight in armor .
Women in Renaissance garb parade through the streets , chanting prayers .
This is New Jerusalem , a theocracy where soccer balls are illegal , John F. Kennedy is a saint , freedom of religion does n't exist and the end of the world is just around the corner .
It is the largest and longest surviving of a string of traditionalist Catholic colonies that have sprung up around the world .
But now , 35 years after its founding , things have gone terribly wrong in New Jerusalem , many residents say .
Palace intrigues , purges and the deaths of the sect 's spiritual leaders this year have left followers divided and confused .
The dogma has become increasingly bizarre , with apocalyptic deadlines that come and go and mysterious " seers " who order one monolithic construction project after another .
At the same time , the Mexican government is trying to establish its control over the town , setting up a public school and sending in riot police to protect dissidents .
The divisions and outside pressures have weakened what was once a Catholic utopia , residents say .
Its population has dropped from 8,000 to 3,000 , and is rapidly aging .
" I came here when there were 10 houses , " said Miguel Chavez Barrera , a former church leader who lost his position in a 2006 purge .
" Now , to see it come to this .
. . .
It 's enough to drive you crazy . "
City on a hill
New Jerusalem appears on no maps .
Signs , some faded or peeling , warn visitors they are on sacred ground .
" A penitent people for an unrepentant world , " says one .
Another warns sinners to honor the Virgin Mary : " Abhor my mother and I will abhor you forever . "
Townspeople look like extras from a Robin Hood movie .
Women wear headscarves and brightly colored dresses .
Monks garbed in brown or black mix with priests in white robes .
The rules are strict : no televisions , radios , alcohol , makeup or nail polish .
Pants for women are an " abomination , " according to a sign outside a shrine that lays out the dress code .
Residents go to church three times a day .
" This place is unique in all the world , " said Gerardo Ruiz , a spokesman for the church , who goes by the name Father Luis Maria de Monfort .
" It is an ark for those who truly believe . "
One house bears a papal seal .
It is a mansion intended for Pope Paul VI , whom townspeople believe is being held captive in a Vatican dungeon by liberal Catholics .
The current pope is the anti-Christ , according to the sect .
The town was founded in 1973 as a reaction to the Second Vatican Council of 1962 - 65 , when the Roman Catholic Church decided to allow Masses to be celebrated in languages other than Latin , a greater role for laypeople and more tolerance toward non-Catholics .
Nabor C�rdenas , a parish priest in the town of Puruar�n , opposed those changes .
He began urging his followers to settle on the site after a local woman , Gabina S�nchez Romero , claimed she saw a vision of Mary , the mother of Jesus , warning that the Catholic Church had gone astray and the world would be destroyed before 2000 .
New Jerusalem 's residents celebrated Mass in the traditional Latin , avoided mixing with outsiders and eschewed government services like schools and clinics .
The Catholic Church rejected the sect and stripped C�rdenas of his ordination as a priest .
But the story of the Virgin Mary found an eager audience in Mexico .
On weekends , buses would roll into town , bringing thousands of pilgrims to visit the town 's shrine , buy at the stores and drop offerings in donation boxes .
Americans also visited , and some stayed .
One group of settlers came from Fort Collins , Colo .
Others were followers of a traditionalist sect in New York City .
" We came because this was the only place in the world where you could actually live in the presence of the Virgin , " said Franklin Gitchier , a former truck driver from Haverhill , Mass. , who arrived with his mother in 1985 .
By the 1980s , about 8,000 people lived in the town .
Residents took religious names , usually those of saints , adding to the town 's mystery .
C�rdenas appointed himself archbishop , adopted the nickname " Papa Nabor " and presided over Masses in a papal hat and robe .
Seminaries , monasteries and convents sprouted , none of them recognized by the Vatican .
New Jerusalem preached chastity and discouraged new marriages .
It also refused to register with Mexico 's Interior Ministry , which oversees religious groups in the country .
" Everyone feels it 's better just to not go there , " said Teodoro Torres , administrator in the Turicato township , which includes New Jerusalem .
Traditional Catholics
New Jerusalem is n't the only community born out of the backlash against Vatican II , said Miguel Leatham , an anthropologist at Texas Christian University who is writing a book about the group .
The Seibo No Mikuni movement in Japan ; the Little Pebble colony in Australia ; the Society of St. Pius X in St. Marys , Kan. ; and others have tried to found " holy communities " for their followers .
More mainstream traditionalists include people like actor Mel Gibson , who is building his own church in Malibu , Calif. , that is not recognized by the Catholic archdiocese .
What 's unusual about New Jerusalem is its size , Leatham said .
The town is probably the biggest " apocalyptic colony " in the world , he said , bigger than the Branch Davidian settlement at Waco , Texas , or Jonestown in Guyana .
Dogma and division
New Jerusalem 's first great schism came in 1981 , when Sanchez died and a new seer , 16 - year - old Maria Parteaga , gained Papa Nabor 's ear , Ruiz said .
Many refused to recognize her and began holding meetings in their own chapel .
In October 1982 , gangs of church faithful set fire to the chapel , then chased the dissidents from their houses , Leatham said .
The two factions battled with rocks , machetes and pots of boiling water .
No one was killed , but in the end , more than 680 people were expelled en masse , Leatham said .
In 1991 , a new seer , Agapito G�mez , rose to power , and the town 's doctrine took a turn toward the bizarre .
" Don Agapito " would mimic different voices into a tape recorder , and nuns would then transcribe these supposed messages from the afterlife .
G�mez claimed to channel L�zaro Cardenas , Mexico 's president from 1934 to 1940 ; Kennedy ; and other figures .
The church expelled hundreds more people in 1997 for not believing in these " Blessed Ones . "
The church also discouraged townspeople from having children to spare them from the horrors of the apocalypse .
" The Virgin does n't want there to be children because the way the world is now , she does n't want them to suffer , " said Richard Garcia , a priest who goes by the name Bertholo Abad .
When each deadline for the apocalypse passed , church leaders claimed that the world had been spared because the Virgin Mary had taken pity on it .
Then came the orders to build new public works , such as the hilltop - chapel complex and the 11 - story cylindrical tower near the main gate .
Meanwhile , most of the town 's streets are still unpaved .
" The tower took two years to build , and we have n't been able to finish it because there have been so many projects that Papa Nabor wanted done , " said Geronimo Diaz , the town 's assistant administrator .
" We still do n't know what it 's for . "
Whoever questioned such orders was labeled a " turbado , " or disturbed person , and expelled from the town .
Beginning in 2004 , the purges came faster .
The seminary was closed , with students expelled .
A group of priests who weighed possible " errors " in G�mez 's visions was thrown out .
But this time , unlike in the past , the Michoacan state government sent in riot police to keep the faithful from driving the dissidents out of town .
The turbados continue to wear the town 's typical dress , but the faithful shun them and bar them from entering the town 's shrine .
Clashes are frequent .
In February 2007 , fights broke out outside a church that the dissidents are trying to build in the town .
This year , on Sept. 16 , Mexico 's Independence Day , there were scuffles when church faithful blocked a parade organized by the dissidents .
The state 's Interior Ministry has begun holding regular meetings with church leaders in an effort to defuse tensions .
Church members accuse the government of meddling .
" Their idea is to come here and normalize us , " Diaz said .
Last year , the state built an elementary school for the children of the dissidents .
Some church members tried to block the road to prevent construction but eventually relented , Principal Armando Mouguia said .
On the school grounds , girls can run around without their headscarves and boys can play soccer .
In another blow to the church , most of New Jerusalem 's satellite churches across Mexico have sided with the dissidents , Ruiz said .
The flow of pilgrims , who sustained the church with their offerings , has slowed to a trickle .
End of an era
On Feb. 19 , Papa Nabor died at age 98 .
A video taken during his last days shows church leaders trying to get him to sign an affidavit naming Antonio Lara Barajas as his successor .
Finally , a priest takes the hand of the semiconscious leader and marks the document with his fingerprint .
Lara , who goes by the name Martin de Tours , declined to be interviewed .
Agapito G�mez , the seer , died in September .
No new seer has yet emerged , but the Michoacan government says it is bracing for another round of conflicts when one does .
" There is a latent risk of violence there , " said Victor Manuel Serrato , president of the state branch of the National Commission on Human Rights .
The church 's biggest problem , however , is the town 's aging population , Leatham said .
Many young men have left to find work elsewhere , some in the United States .
Those who remain are convinced they are doing the Virgin Mary 's will .
But even they acknowledge that the town is not what it used to be .
Every Wednesday , the entire town gathers at the shrine for a group meal .
As she shared a pot of chicken with a visitor , Elinda Goll of Clifton , N.J. , recounted the different purges she has seen since moving to New Jerusalem in 1985 .
" The Virgin weeps for this place , " she said .

Advertisement Indian commandos are storming a Jewish centre in the city of Mumbai , where gunmen are holding people hostage .
Troops abseiled from a helicopter into the building , as a ground assault was launched .
Gunfire was later heard .
Security forces are still clearing gunmen from two luxury hotels , after Wednesday 's attacks that killed more than 130 people and injured 300 .
Security forces says they are close to taking control of the Oberoi Trident hotel after freeing 93 people .
Media reports say that the majority of those rescued were foreigners .
Meanwhile , security forces are still moving room to room at the Taj Mahal Palace .
An army commander said nearly all guests and staff had been evacuated and that the security operation would be " wrapped up in a few hours " .
More than 90 people have been released from the Oberoi hotel
But the BBC's Nik Gowing , outside the hotel , said he had recently heard a series of explosions and an exchange of gunfire .
At first light helicopters swooped over the Nariman House business and residential complex in south Mumbai , which houses the Jewish outreach group Chabad Lubavitch .
Commandos initially dropped smoke bombs to create confusion , and then several troops abseiled down ropes to secure the roof .
They are said to have been tentatively moving down through the building , trying not to cause casualties among the hostages .
Earlier , a woman and child were seen leaving the building , but it was unclear whether they had managed to escape or were released .
The child was identified as the two - year - old son of Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holzberg , the main representative at the ultra - orthodox outreach centre .
There was no word on the rabbi's fate .
In a separate development , the Indian navy has taken control of two Pakistani merchant navy ships and is questioning their crews after witnesses said some of the militants came ashore on small speed boats .
Conflicting clues Gunmen armed with automatic weapons and grenades targeted at least seven sites in Mumbai late on Wednesday , opening fire indiscriminately on crowds at a major railway station , the two hotels , the Jewish centre , a hospital and a cafe frequented by foreigners .
The attacks are the worst in India 's commercial capital since nearly 200 people were killed in a series of bombings in 2006 .
On Thursday , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the government would " take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the safety and security of our citizens " .
Mr Singh said the attackers were based " outside the country " and that India would not tolerate " neighbours " who provide a haven to militants targeting it .
BOMB ATTACKS IN INDIA IN 2008 30 October : Explosions kill at least 64 in north - eastern Assam 30 September : Blasts in western India kill at least seven 27 September : Bomb blasts kills one in Delhi 13 September : Five bomb blasts kill 18 in Delhi 26 July :
At least 22 small bombs kill 49 in Ahmedabad 25 July : Seven bombs go off in Bangalore killing two people 13 May : Seven bomb hit markets and crowded streets in Jaipur killing 63
International reaction India has complained in the past that attacks on its soil have been carried out by groups based in Pakistan , although relations between the two countries have improved in recent years and Pakistani leaders were swift to condemn the latest attacks .
The Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Toiba denied any role in the attacks .
A claim of responsibility has been made by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen .
Eyewitnesses at the hotels said the attackers were singling out British and American passport holders , which BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says implies an Islamist motive - attacks inspired or co-ordinated by al - Qaeda .
But as investigators from other countries join the hunt , he says , most intelligence officials are keeping an open mind as the attacks have thrown up conflicting clues .
Co-ordinated , mass casualty attacks that target civilians and undefended buildings are very much in the al - Qaeda mould .
But our correspondent says al - Qaeda and its affiliates in the region tend to favour massive truck bombs driven into buildings by suicidal volunteers - that did n't happen in Mumbai .
He says al - Qaeda are also acutely media - savvy , filming their attacks and in the case of hostages , sometimes murdering them on camera .
Again , that does not appear to have happened this time .

Although rumors persist of their use in restaurants and movie theaters , the use of cell phone jamming equipment remains illegal in the US .
Right now , the only permissible use is by federal law enforcement officials , but that may change if state prison officials in South Carolina and a manufacturer of jamming equipment have their way .
Both would like to see state law enforcement get permission to use the jammers , which may push the technology a bit closer to the mainstream .
Jammers are relatively simple , as they simply rely on flooding the frequencies that cell phones use with electromagnetic noise , blocking any effective transmission within a limited radius .
Right now , the FCC is responsible for enforcing the ban on devices that block signals from cell phones , an authority that dates back to the Communications Act of 1934 .
The FCC notes that " the Act prohibits any person from willfully or maliciously interfering with the radio communications of any station licensed or authorized under the Act or operated by the US government . "
First time offenders may face either fines of up to $ 11,000 or a year in prison for each violation .
You can imagine how many offenses jamming something like a crowded movie theater might involve .
Nevertheless , it 's widely reported that the FCC has yet to actually hold someone accountable for doing so , and it's also widely reported that distributors have shipped the equipment to do so here from overseas ; see , for example , this story in Slate .
There are obvious public safety concerns surrounding the unrestricted use of these jammers ; it 's hard to imagine that blocking access to 911 is in anyone 's best interest , but there are situations where public security can be enhanced by their use .
Although it has n't been a problem in the States , cell phones have been used as remote detonators in terrorist attacks .
In other cases , cell phones have apparently been smuggled into prisons , where they have enabled inmates to continue to organize crimes on the outside or to further coordinate the smuggling in of goods .
For such reasons , federal law enforcement agencies have retained the right to deploy these systems , and have apparently done so at federal prisons .
The new push seeks to broaden the use of jammers by enabling their use at the state level .
Following a demonstration of the equipment at a South Carolina state prison , the company that supplied the demonstration equipment ( CellAntenna , which primarily sells signal extenders ) has indicated it would attempt to get a waiver from the FCC that would give states permission to use them .
Meanwhile , the demonstration has caught the attention of at least two US senators , who may in turn nudge the FCC along .
The development is n't interesting so much for the fact that states might get access to something the federal government is already using ; those sorts of things happen all the time .
What makes it intriguing is the fact that technologies designed for law enforcement have shown a consistent ability to escape their confines in recent years .
It 's easy to visit web sites that now offer a variety of stun guns and pepper sprays for sale to the public .
There 's no guarantee that cell phone jammers will go this route , but any changes that increase their use certainly make it more likely .

BBC News , Reykjavik
It is still idyllic , but security has been stepped up in the wake of the crisis
It is a sign of the times that security has been increased at Reykjavik 's small Parliament building , from one policeman to three .
Iceland 's Prime Minister Geir Haarde faces almost daily calls for his resignation from small but angry protests - and has even been seen with an armed bodyguard at the gym .
The crisis that saw Iceland 's three largest banks collapse in October also soured relations with Britain .
And while Mr Haarde insists " we need to move on " , he also insists his government is considering court action against the UK .
" I think there 's a special case with regard to Kaupthing which needs to be looked into , " he says , referring to Iceland 's biggest bank which collapsed on 9 October .
A decision on whether to go to court is expected by early January , focusing on action by the British authorities to put the UK operations of the bank 's subsidiary , Kaupthing , Singer and Friedlander ( KSF ) , into administration .
" We are looking at whether or not the action of the FSA ( Financial Services Authority ) led to the collapse of Kaupthing , Singer and Friedlander in the UK , which in turn led to the collapse of the mother bank here in Iceland , " he says .
Avoidable collapse ?
Iceland 's financial sector imploded over 11 unprecedented days .
First Glitnir , the third - largest bank , was nationalised on 29 September , then Landsbanki , the second - largest , was taken over under emergency legislation on 7 October .
The freezing order is still in effect and has the Icelandic Landsbanki listed along with Al - Qaeda and the Taliban
Prime Minister Geir Haarde
When I first met Mr Haarde , at a Reykjavik theatre on 8 October , I asked him whether Kaupthing was safe .
At the time , he said : " I wish I could give you an affirmative answer .
I think they are and I hope they are and it's been our objective to ensure that they are , so I assume so . "
His government had singled it out for special measures to save it - including an emergency loan .
But the next morning , Kaupthing rolled over .
Not told
Three months later , he sounds a regretful tone .
" This was the considered judgement of our central bank : that there was a chance of Kaupthing surviving , " he says .
" Hence , they were given a lender of last resort loan for a few days .
But the UK government , through the FSA , intervened in the meantime . "
So has Mr Haarde told the British government about this ?
No , he says , but he is not sure what communication had gone on between the FSA and Iceland 's equivalent body .
Yet details like this could be crucial in determining why Kaupthing went down and whether it could have survived .
And if the UK authorities were found culpable the damages would be counted in billions , according to lawyers in London working on a similar possible legal challenge for Kaupthing itself .
Of course , Mr Haarde 's talk of court action may be no more than sabre - rattling , as talks between the two sides continue on unravelling the tangle of assets and liabilities held by Iceland 's banks and their subsidiaries .
Help requested Local councils in England and Wales , charities , universities , and private depositors at Kaupthing 's subsidiaries on the Isle of Man and Channel Islands , still have no idea when or whether they will see any of their money again .
We 've been through many crises before in this country
Prime Minister Geir Haarde
Some have levelled more general criticism at the British government , suggesting it had known about the weakness in the Icelandic banking sector and should have warned them earlier .
Mr Haarde was in 10 Downing Street on 24 April this year - so what did he tell Gordon Brown ?
" We did n't specifically discuss the banking community , but we did discuss the economic picture in this country and what the outlook was like and what measures could be taken , " he says .
" He was very friendly and helpful at that meeting . "
Mr Haarde denies asking for help at this meeting , though Iceland did ask the UK for financial help at some point this year .
He says that " around about this time [ late April ] our central bank was in communication with the Bank of England " about this .
The UK help did eventually arrive - in the form of a £ 2bn loan to pay UK depositors with Icesave , Landsbanki 's Internet bank .
But here , too , Britain 's earlier actions - using anti-terror legislation to seize Icesave 's assets - still rankle in Reykjavik .
" I still do n't understand why Britain had to resort to the use of such legislation , out of proportion with the problem at hand , " says Mr Haarde .
" The freezing order is still in effect and has the Icelandic Landsbanki listed along with Al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
" That 's unacceptable , and we 've had no formal explanation as to why it had to be done in this way . "
Bounce back
Three months on , Iceland 's economy is in freefall .
The International Monetary Fund predicts its gross domestic product , or GDP , will contract by 10 % next year .
Companies are laying off staff .
And those who stay in work are taking pay cuts , at a time when inflation is at 17 % and interest rates at 18 % .
Mr Haarde is under immense pressure - but in combative mood .
" We 've been through many crises before in this country , " he says .
" Whether it be natural disasters or economic crisis , we 've always bounced back - and that 's what we 'll do this time . "

This really is a joy to see .
Although an unpleasant presenter herself , Megyn Kelly takes O'Reilly to school over the issue of atheism being regarded as a religion ( legally it is , despite O'Reilly 's insistence that it is n't ) .
O'Reilly 's bluster and bombast only really works against men , and against Kelly , he is truly lost for words :
Reclaim The Swastika
The swastika is an ancient symbol present in numerous and diverse cultures around the world , including the cultures of India , Asia , the Middle East , Europe and North America .
In India , the swastika has thousands of years of history and still retains its place of pre-eminence among the sub - continent 's spiritual symbols .
It remains one of the most prominent spiritual symbols in Hinduism , Jainism and Buddhism , and is found adorning temples and religious shrines throughout Asia .
After its misuse by the Nazis , it became associated with murder and oppression on a scale never before witnessed on this earth .
For this reason , in Europe , for many millions , the swastika came to symbolise evil .
There arose , as a result of this , a move to ban the swastika .
This website is dedicated to " reclaiming the swastika " - to sharing information that reveals its long and varied history and the spiritually deep meaning that underlies it .
For , if we allow the swastika to remain forever distorted , then those responsible will have won .

Experts race to save world 's rarest wolf from extinction
A team of dedicated conservationists is battling to save the world 's rarest wolf from a rabies outbreak by creating a ' barrier ' of vaccinated wolf packs .
With less than 500 left , the endangered Ethiopian wolf teeters on the brink of extinction .
They live in the Bale Mountains National Park near to the Oromo people , which places them at risk of catching rabies from dogs .
The wolves have been protected by the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme ( EWCP ) since 1998 , but the group say they are struggling in their mission .
An Ethiopian wolf is released after being vaccinated against rabies
' Despite the efforts of our veterinary team , who vaccinate thousands of dogs in Bale 's villages every year , the virus has raised its ugly head again and jumped into the wolf population , ' said Dr Claudio Sillero , the EWCP Director from Oxford University .
' Fifteen wolves have died to date , and laboratory tests have confirmed our worst fears that we are facing another potentially devastating outbreak .
' If left unchecked , rabies is likely to kill over two - thirds of all wolves in Bale 's Web Valley , and spread further , with wolves dying horrible deaths and numbers dwindling to perilously low levels .
' These preciously rare wolves can ill - afford it another massive die - off . '
In 2003 a similar epidemic swept through , and a rapid response by the Ethiopian authorities and EWCP blocked the spread of the epidemic .
Ethiopian wolves are the rarest type of wolf in the world
A team led by Claudio , EWCP Coordinator Dr Graham Hemson and Dr Fekadu Shiferaw of the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority is implementing a plan to vaccinate wolf packs to create a ' barrier ' to prevent the virus from spreading .
' Tracking and vaccinating these animals is a far from easy task , ' said Dr Sillero .
' Our veterinary team are travelling on horse - back and camping out in remote mountains above 12,000 feet with temperatures falling as low as - 15°C .
' But the first three weeks of the intervention have gone well with the team vaccinating to date forty - eight wolves in eleven vital packs that connect the Web Valley population with other wolves in Bale . '
Researchers at Oxford University have developed a detailed knowledge of the wolves from 20 years of continuous study .
A sophisticated computer model of how rabies spreads developed with colleagues at Glasgow University guides their vaccination efforts .
The intervention has been sanctioned by the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority ( EWCA ) and Oromia Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development .

Those who are interesting in just how Fred Clark came to use the name The Slacktivist ...
( CNN ) -- Federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the August 1 , 2007 , bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people and injured 145 .
Thirteen people were killed and 145 were injured in the August 1 , 2007 , Minnesota bridge collapse .

The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I - 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis , Minnesota , causing the collapse , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .
There were 111 vehicles on the portion of the bridge that collapsed , dropping them 108 feet into the 15 - foot - deep river .
An NTSB report released Friday said the board 's investigation found that 24 " under - designed " gusset plates were not discovered in reviews during the bridge 's design and construction .
The bridge opened in 1967 .
Substantial increases in the weight of the bridge because of modifications through the years , along with increased weight on the bridge due to construction equipment and rush - hour traffic the day of the collapse , likely contributed to the faulty plates ' collapse , the board said .
The board 's investigation determined that other possible reasons for the collapse , including corrosion found on the plates and preexisting cracks in the bridge , did not play a role in the collapse .
" We believe this thorough investigation should put to rest any speculation as to the root cause of this terrible accident and provide a roadmap for improvements to prevent future tragedies , " said NTSB acting chairman Mark V. Rosenker .

Do n't Miss Victims plan to sue over Minnesota bridge collapse
Several victims of the crash have filed lawsuits against a consulting firm that evaluated the bridge and the construction company whose equipment was on the bridge the day of the collapse .
As a result of its investigation , the safety board made nine recommendations to the Federal Highway Administration and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials dealing with improving how bridges are inspected and how bridge designs are reviewed .

KDE4Daily Virtual Image
Update - 27th January , 2009
Everything under the line is preserved for legacy reasons ; downloading KDE4 Daily for the first time as of now is not really a good idea :)
Note that the IRC channel in the contact section will shortly be closed , but the e-mail address will stay the same .
Just for fun , here 's how everything looked in the first ever version of KDE4 Daily , way back in November 2007 :
Many thanks to everyone who contributed bandwidth , bug reports and moral support ! :)
Contents
What is it ?
The KDE4 Daily project was created to help people try out and test KDE4 on the run up to its 4.0 release without having to compile from source , or log out to boot from a LiveCD .
Further , it aims to be updated nearly every day , so that people always have a mostly up - to - date ( but , inevitably , occasionally broken ) KDE4 install , and also aims to be able to create backtraces that will be of use to developers .
Typical daily updates range from 20 - 50 MB in size and take a few minutes to apply .
KDE4 Daily accomplishes these goals by using virtualization technology , with Qemu being the VM currently employed .
The current KDE4Daily ( v0.0.1 ) was released on 10th November , 2007 .
The current latest KDE revision provided for KDE4 Daily is r759652 , created on 11th January , 2008 .
Where is it ?
A torrent is available here .
If you cannot use Bittorrent , then " sandsmark " has provided a direct download - many thanks , Martin !
Additionally , Kiyoshi Aman has provided this mirror - cheers !
Additionally , " lufthanza " has recently converted the image to VirtualBox and torrented it here - again Kiyoshi has also mirrored this here :)
What is Qemu ?
Qemu is a technology that allows one to use a complete install of an operating system ( be it a Linux variant , or Windows , etc ) from within the user 's " normal " computing system , at a speed approximating the speed the operating system would run at if it were run by itself .
It is enormously useful for trying out software such as KDE4 without having to worry about tracking down dependencies or re-booting into a LiveCD - you can even run KDE4 from within Windows !
The drawbacks are that its speed is not quite as fast as running a proper install of KDE4 , and that graphical acceleration is not provided , so KWin 's new Composite features will not function .
What do I Need ?
You will need an install of Qemu , preferably with the kernel accelerator module installed and working .
512MB RAM is probably a minimum , and I would recommend at least 768 MB if you aim to be submitting backtraces to the developers .
Sufficient harddrive space .
The KDE4 Daily image starts off at 1.7GB , but should be limited in size to 3.5GB .
Decent bandwidth - you may need to be downloading a hundred MBs a day , although this is probably a worst case scenario .
A little free time , every few days , and a desire to help test bleeding - edge KDE !
Very Important Warning !
How Do I Install Qemu ?
Instructions for installing Qemu and the kernel accelerator module for all distros is beyond the scope of these docs , but the Ubuntu Wiki contains detailed instructions for installing under 7.04 and 7.10 here :
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
Note that 7.10 ( Gutsy ) users will have to manually install a replacement .deb as the Qemu install available is broken : see this post for details .
I 've Downloaded The File - What Now ?
The image is a bzip - compressed Qemu image - first you will need to uncompress it , using the archiving tool of your choice .
Assuming you have uncompressed the image and the uncompressed file has the name " kde4daily -0_0_1_r734472-qcow.img " , open up a command - prompt at the containing folder and type
qemu kde4daily - 0_0_1_r734472-qcow.img -m < amount of RAM to allocate >
256MB of RAM is a good amount to allocate , if you can afford it :
qemu kde4daily - 0_0_1_r734472-qcow.img -m 256
but if you are to be submitting backtraces , you will likely want more .
To give an idea of how much memory you will need for backtraces - the gdb process alone can easily consume 230 + MB of RAM when generating a backtrace .
A window containing your KDE4 image should now appear , and begin the standard Linux ( text - mode ) boot - up .
After a minute or so , you should be presented with the graphical ( KDM3 ) log - in screen .
Your username and password are both " kde4daily " .
Enter your username and password and click " Log-in " , and you should end up booting into the KDE4 desktop environment proper .
Hooray !
All being well , Qemu will have set up a network bridge that enables your KDE4 Daily install to access the Internet without you having to lift a finger !
This is Fun , But How Do I Get a More Recent Build of KDE4 ?
KDE4 is progressing at a rapid rate , and significant changes can often occur overnight .
For this reason , the KDE4 Daily image contains its own update system that allows you to upgrade your KDE4 install , from within the KDE4 Daily image itself while running in Qemu , without having to download a fresh image .
To use the update feature , simply log out of KDE4 or otherwise get back to the log - in screen , click Menu -> Session Type ->
KDE4DailyUpdater , and enter your username and password and click Log-in .
You should be presented with a black terminal in the centre of the screen and some instructions .
Follow the instructions and your KDE4 Daily updater scripts will attempt to access the Internet and scan for updates .
If none are found , you will be informed and given instructions to return back to the log - in screen .
If the attempt fails , you will be told and given a reason why - you can either return to the log - in screen or retry .
If it is successful , then , after several pages of scary scrolling text , you will be told the current revision number that you have been updated .
Follow the instructions to return to the log - in screen .
After upgrading ( or attempting and failing ) , you can get back to the KDE4 desktop from the log - in screen by choosing Menu -> Session Type -> KDE4Daily and logging in as usual .
Whoops - Something Crashed !
In the truly momentously unlikely event of a KDE app crashing , " DrKonqi " will appear and give you the option of creating a " backtrace " .
Such backtraces are of great use to the developers , so it is useful to affix them to your bug reports .
Please do ensure that you are not using a KDE4 install that is too out of date ( use the KDE4 DailyUpdater mechanism , described above ) as the crash may have already been reported and fixed .
Clicking on the " Backtrace " tab will start to generate the backtrace - Warning !
Generating the backtrace involves downloading very bulky data from the servers , and consumes a lot of RAM and time .
At the moment , there is no progress indicator to let you now what is going on , so please be patient and ensure you have plenty of RAM in your PC and allocated to the KDE4 Daily virtual machine .
Eventually , " Done " will appear in the backtrace form , ready for inclusion with your bug report .
Are There Any Bugs in KDE4Daily That Do Not Occur in KDE ?
Here are a few bugs that appear to be KDE4 Daily - specific :
Crashes upon selecting a template in any KOffice app ( only affects r742439 and previous ) .
and previous ) .
Occasional crashes on KDE4 startup , especially after an upgrade .
Simply logging in again appears to fix this .
Occasional " black screen of death " hangs on logout .
Graphical corruption on the logout screen ( where the black border comes down from the top of the screen ) .
Graphical corruption when opening menus .
KSnapshot ( running in a VM ) not working - please use KSnapshot on your host machine for taking screenshots .
Krita failing to start .
This is due to me missing a dependency , and can be fixed by : sudo apt - get install libglew1
The password is " kde4daily "
FAQ
Why Does n't It Boot ?
Most likely , you are using ( K ) Ubuntu 7.10 ( Gutsy ) .
Please see the note about this distro version in this section .
Why Qemu , Rather than VMWare or VirtualBox ?
Basically , Qemu is what I know :)
But luckily , many people know better than me , and have provided instructions for converting your downloaded image to a VirtualBox - compatible image ; see e.g.
Liquidat 's guide here .
Bernd has given some handy hints for VMWare users here .
Many thanks to he and Liquidat and everyone else who provided similar instructions !
Update : Someone has created and uploaded a VirtualBox image torrent - see " Where is it ? " for a link !
Where are Amarok and the Other KDEMultimedia Apps ?
Where are Kontact and the Rest of the PIM Suite ?
So What Modules are Included ?
Is it Possible to get KDE4 Localisations in My Language ?
[ Note : Original idea and 99 % of the work here was done by Toussis Manolis - many thanks !
Any errors / bugs are my own ] .
Around about r742845 , Toussis contacted me with a plan to allow the user to easily install translations from SVN with a view to making life easier for the translation team , and a modified version of his script has since been slipstreamed in .
First , ensure you are fully up - to - date using the KDE4 Daily update system .
Log in to KDE4 and from konsole , do :
bash $ KDE4DAILY_UPDATER_DIR/kde4lang.sh < language code >
e.g .
bash $ KDE4DAILY_UPDATER_DIR/kde4lang.sh en_GB
and follow the instructions .
The script will download and install 30 MB of installation tools , gobbling up much of the remaining space on " / " ( whoops - my fault for using such a silly partitioning scheme ! ) and will hopefully pop -up the KDE4 " Language " settings , where you can easily add your new language via a GUI .
Re-running the script will fetch and install any translations added for that language since the last run .
You may need to log in and out of KDE4 to allow the full set of additional translations to be applied .
Note that this feature is very new to KDE4 Daily and may have bugs - please report any you find to me !
Should I Mention That I'm Using KDE4Daily
When I File a Bug ?
I will hopefully be creating weekly " bridge " updates , that let you download and apply a week 's worth of changes in one go .
Experiments have shown that such bridge updates are often not much larger in size than an update for a single day !
KDE4
Daily always picks the path through updates that results in the smallest download size , so such " bridge " updates will be used automatically .
The Updater is a Little Unfriendly .
How About a GUI ?
Help !
I Did An Update , and Now KDE4 Wo n't Run !
Relax :)
It 's important to note that , as with all builds drawn directly from SVN on a frequent basis , many will be duff .
The KDE4 Daily updater has been deliberately designed to have no dependencies on Qt4 or KDE4 , so just keep updating every few days and eventually the problem will probably sort itself out .
If symptoms persist , call a doctor or , better , try and get in touch with me : see " How Can I Contact You If Things Go Wrong ? " for more info .
Do note that a newly - upgraded KDE4 install will occasionally crash on first run , so always try to log in at least once more if KDE4 crashes during start - up .
I 'm not sure why this happens , but suspect it has something to do with stale libraries being kept in memory .
What is the Underlying Distro Used by KDE4Daily ?
KDE4Daily sits on top of Kubuntu 8.10 .
This is mainly because this is the same distro that my desktop PC , on which builds / updates are prepared , runs .
Seems Pretty Slow .
Will the Final KDE4 Be Like
This ?
Firstly :
There wo n't really be a " final " KDE4 - many people seem to think that KDE4.0 will be basically the end of development of the KDE4 series , rather than what it really is - the beginning .
So when KDE4.0 is released , we can still look forward to years of improvements and optimisations in KDE4 and Qt4 !
Secondly : Running in Qemu gives an automatic hit to the speed of computations , so KDE4 Daily VM will run more slowly than if it were installed and running on the " bare metal " of your machine , as it were .
Also , I do n't believe Qemu accelerates the graphics at all - anyone who has experienced the joys of running a Linux desktop with an ATI card with poor drivers will know precisely just how painful that can be !
Additionally , the KDE4 build provided is compiled in debug mode , and while the bulky debug data has been extracted from the libraries and executables , the compiler will still ( I think ? ) avoid doing risky optimisations .
What KDE4 SVN Revision am I Currently Using ?
Your current SVN revision number is stored in the text file :
$ KDE4DAILY_UPDATER_DIR/data/kde4revision.txt
What Language are The Updater and Preparation Scripts Written in ?
Virtually everything is written in Ruby .
This was my first " proper " experience with the language , so I should probably amend the answer to " Very Bad Ruby " :)
This is slightly tricky as I suspect that anyone wishing to provide updates for KDE4 Daily will need to be running the same distro as that sitting under the KDE4 Daily image - that is , Kubuntu 7.04 .
I 'm not really sure how to approach this problem , to be honest , and would welcome suggestions .
The " brute force " approach would be to further abuse virtualization technology and provide an image that mirrors that of the installation that I use to generate the KDE4 Daily updates , but I have no idea how slow compilation of KDE4 would be inside a Qemu session .
Using distcc on the host computer might be a solution .
Apart from the challenge of providing an environment that will allow one to create updates compatible with KDE4 Daily , most other issues are solved : one of the original motivations for the project was to allow the Oxygen style / windec developers to easily deploy updates to the actual artists ( who may not have the technical skills to maintain and update a KDE4 install from SVN ) , so provision was made from the outset to allow a KDE4 Daily to install updates from a source other than KDE 's svn .
The idea is that the developers and artists switch to a different track ( called KDEOXYGENONLY , say ) , and then the artists '
KDE4 Daily updates will always be drawn from a source specified by the Oxygen developers and so only receive changes that are created by the Oxygen developers .
Currently , though , the only track available is the default one ( KDESVNTRUNK ) , and the updater scripts are hard - coded to use this one .
If there is sufficient interest in creating diffs , and if we can solve the issue of easily creating diffs compatible with KDE4 Daily , then I will try and get the preparation scripts into a usable state and make them available for download .
Why Is Backtrace Generation so Darned Slow ?
Generating backtraces is , at the best of times , a very intensive procedure : as mentioned , GDB can easily gobble up 230 MB of your RAM in the process .
The debugging information used by the KDE4 Daily KDE4 install is very large - approximately half a gigabyte , when compressed with maximum bzip compression .
Including it would swell the initial download by approximately this size .
Worse , the debugging info changes very frequently - rebuilding KDE4 after a days ' worth of updates can easily generate hundreds of megabytes of new debugging information .
For this reason , including the debugging info in the initial build and providing daily updates to it would be prohibitive in terms of bandwidth requirements .
Luckily , this debugging information is fantastically amenable to utilities such as bsdiff , which enables the " new " debugging info created each day to be expressed as a small patch against the " old " debugging data .
This reduces the bulk of the new debugging info to around 8 MB a day , rather than 2-300 MB .
So now , when GDB requests the debugging info for a file ( a custom FUSE filesystem daemon , written in Ruby , intercepts these requests ) , we can download the bulky , original debug info from the server , decompress it , see if todays ' build requires newer debugging info than that we have just downloaded and , if so , download the small patch file and apply it , eventually returning up - to - date debugging info for use by GDB .
So , in a nutshell :
The process of having to download , decompress and patch the debugging info is what causes the slowdown .
On the plus side , KDE4 Daily uses caching to keep the debugging info it has downloaded and prepared , so the process of generating a backtrace should be faster after the first time .
It also delivers and prepares only the debugging info specifically requested by GDB , and no more .
Out of date debug information is automatically cleared from the cache after each update .
Hey there everyone !
The nineteenth of November might not be a date that many people think is significant , but it's of special importance to us .
On this day ten years ago , Half - Life was unleashed on the world .
In celebration , we 've got lots of new media !
2008 has been a very eventful year for us .
Making a 12 + hour game is a monumental task , but we 're still powering ahead with development and making great progress .
Our programmers have been hard at work overhauling and expanding the AI , and lots of our NPCs have been brought to life by our talented voice actors .
Levels and chapters continue to be worked on and fine tuned , with large sections strung together and playable .
We 've also begun tackling the final content of the game , some of the most creative and technically challenging stuff we 've had to do yet .
And team members across the board continue to push the envelope and redefine what 's possible in a Source game .
While known by some hardcore Black Mesa fans , we 'd like to officially state that we 've upgraded to the Orange Box build of the Source engine .
We 're also excited to announce that we 've dropped Counter - Strike : Source as a requirement for Black Mesa , and from now on , the only thing you 'll need to play the mod is a Steam account with any Source engine game installed !
Black Mesa is now running completely off of our own content and base Source shared content , and we felt the vastly increased user base more then justified creating all the extra assets needed to make this switch .
1 Block Off the Grid's Community Solar Initiative Expanding to 20 US Cities
November 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
When we last wrote about 1 Block Off the Grid ’s ( 1BOG ) community solar initiative in San Francisco , many of you wondered why similar programs do n’t exist across the United States .
Well , good news for those of you in Boston , New Orleans , Seattle , Miami , Washington , and 15 other US cities — 1BOG is coming .
[ social_buttons ]
1BOG ’s business model uses the power of community as a bargaining chip to make solar energy significantly cheaper for homeowners .
In its San Francisco campaign , 1BOG negotiated up to 48 % off 2 kW solar systems from the market price for its participants .
The organization ’s expansion can be credited to social activism start - up Virgance , which just acquired the company .
According to 1BOG co-founder Sylvia Ventura , “ The portfolio of campaigns within Virgance brings a whole new dimension to what we are trying to accomplish with 1BOG .
Having access to tools and expertise such as online social networks puts 1BOG right in the middle of the action , where people actually connect and communities are formed . ”
And if all goes well with 1BOG ’s new 20 city campaign , Virgance plans on extending it to hundreds of cities .
“ Virgance amplifies what we ’ve accomplished in the past 3 months to the tenth power , ” Ventura said .
If you want to get in on the 1BOG action , do it soon — in a 2 month period , over 180 San Francisco residents registered with 1BOG ’s initial campaign .
And with the rising cost of energy hitting homeowners across the country , the company ’s community bargaining model looks mighty tempting .

Attackers have sprayed acid in the faces of up to 15 schoolgirls in Afghanistan .
The teenagers were walking to their all - girls high school in the southern city of Kandahar when they were attacked by two men on a motorbike .
The men used a toy gun to spray acid in the girls ' faces .
Some of the victims were wearing Islamic burqas , which gave them some protection , but several received serious acid burns .
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack .
Local officials believe it may be an attempt to stop local girls from attending school .
NATO - led forces in Afghanistan have condemned the act as cowardly .
Apple 's Director of Engineering of Unix Technologies Jordan Hubbard spoke at LISA '08 last week .
LISA ( or Large Installation System Administration Conference ) is a technical conference targeted at engineers and system administrators .
This year 's conference invited Apple 's Jordan Hubbard to speak about the evolution of Mac OS X from large servers to embedded platforms .
While technical readers may find the content of Hubbard 's presentation slides ( PDF ) quite interesting , the most surprising revelation is a more specific target date for Apple 's Mac OS X 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) : 1st Quarter 2009 .
When Apple first previewed Snow Leopard at the Worldwide Developers Conference 2008 , they simply stated that Snow Leopard would ship " in about a year " from the announcement .
A Q1 release would deliver it earlier than most had expected and makes it conceivable that we could see a demo or announcement at Macworld San Francisco 2009 .
Apple has said that they would be focusing on both quality and performance in Snow Leopard .
In particular , Apple has made it clear that there will be efforts to improve support for multi-core processors and GPU processing .
These improvements will help developers more efficiently use these capabilities that already ship in Macs .
