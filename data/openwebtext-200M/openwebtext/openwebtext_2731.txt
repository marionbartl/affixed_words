Tom Brokaw named our parents The Greatest Generation .
They came of age during The Great Depression and defeated Fascism , Nazism and Communism .
They built the Interstate Highway System and landed a man on the moon .
They built the great American middle class with safe communities and public schools that were the envy of the world .
They deserve the title of The Greatest Generation .
One of their few criticisms is that they spoiled us boomers , adhering to the teaching of Dr. Benjamin Spock .
I am 59 years old and a child of perhaps the most indulged and impatient generation in history .
I fear we may also become known as the generation that lost the American Dream .
The Baby Boomers have rejected personal responsibility and exhibited a lack of mental discipline that could have enormous implications for the future .
The United States House of Representatives , now overwhelmingly controlled by the Boomers , signed a $ 787 billion legislative “ stimulus ” package comprised of 1,071 pages and a hefty 8 pounds .
Not one legislator read the bill before signing it .
Months later , the same House members publicly screamed at the corrupt executives of AIG who received bonuses in 2008 – bonuses specifically allowed in the very legislation they passed without reading .
This abandonment of personal responsibilities by the Lost Generation took on historic significance on January 20 , 1993 .
That ’s when the first President Bush , a member of the Greatest Generation , was replaced with President William Jefferson Clinton , the first Baby - Boomer to reach the Presidency .
The Clinton presidency was notorious for its personal indulgence – and not just by introducing oral sex to the Oval Office .
During Clinton ’s watch , 100,000 Islamic terrorists were trained in camps in Afghanistan while terrorist strikes against American interests went unanswered .
Clinton failed to respond to the attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 servicemen .
Our enemies grew emboldened believing that America did not take their deadly threats seriously .
On September 11th 2,996 American civilians died in part because the government did not see its first priority to be protecting them .
Also under President Clinton , the Federal Government in 1999 relaxed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s requirements of home mortgages .
The decades old formula of 20 % down and a 30 year fixed mortgage that allowed the Greatest Generation to lift home ownership to more than 60 % was replaced with an array of instruments including sub - prime loans , “ no - doc ” applications where income was not verified , and teaser rates of 1 % .
Such tinkering led to unqualified purchasers with 100 % financing pushing home values up at 20 % per year .
The bubble burst in 2007 with disastrous consequences .
The heads of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made tens of millions in annual salary .
Despite the calamitous consequences of their stewardship , no one was fired .
Another Boomer , George W. Bush followed Clinton and continued the Lost Generation ’s abdication of personal responsibility .
He also failed to comprehend the extremist Islamic threat .
Again , no one was fired .
On December 12 , 2002 , George Tenet , fellow Baby - Boomer and Director of the CIA assured President Bush the case that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was a “ slam dunk ” .
President Bush authorized the invasion of a sovereign nation based on that intelligence .
No weapons of mass destruction were found .
America ’s soldiers inherited a broken country and hundreds of billions of responsibilities .
No one , including George Tenet , lost their job .
In fact , on December 14 , 2004 , President Bush awarded Tenet the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
On August 29 , 2005 , Hurricane Katrina slammed into Louisiana and Mississippi as a Category 3 hurricane .
The result was catastrophic .
The levees were breached and 1,836 Americans lost their lives .
Americans watched in horror as police abandoned their positions , and the National Guard struggled to protect the trapped citizens who could not evacuate .
Dead bodies lay uncollected in the streets .
No one will forget the scene of 60,000 American refugees at the Louisiana Superdome without food , water or medical care for days .
On national television , President Bush proclaimed , “ Brownie , you ’re doing a heck of a job . ”
Although three days later , FEMA Director , Michael D. Brown was forced to resign , no one else at FEMA was fired .
In July 2008 , gasoline prices hit a national average of more than $ 4.00 per gallon as demand outstripped supply pushing oil to $ 147 barrel .
The Lost Generation howled in protest at the oil companies who were profiting from the pain of American citizens .
This came as no surprise .
The environmental movement had stopped production on both nuclear power plants and gasoline refineries .
Congress banned oil exploration off America ’s coastline .
Congress decided that ANWAR , a barren strip of coastal Alaska the size of Logan Airport in Boston , was off - limits to oil exploration .
At $ 147 barrel , the Western economies were shipping more than $ 1 trillion dollars per year to the Persian Gulf to nations whose interests were simply not aligned with ours .
Once again , our elected officials , dominated by boomers , abdicated their responsibility to keep America safe .
Their inaction allowed our nation to become even more vulnerable to the oil weapon .
In 1973 , under President Carter , when the OPEC nations first used oil as a political weapon , America imported 30 % of its daily oil quota .
Yet not a word is mentioned by the Lost Generation expanding American production of oil to reduce this dependency .
Yes , they talk of wind and solar energy – which collectively generate less than one percent of our energy – but no one has yet figured out how to power a car with wind or solar energy .
After falling to $ 30 a barrel , oil has slowly crept back up over $ 50 a barrel – in a deep recession .
When the recovery arrives , does anyone believe oil will not return to $ 100 barrel ?
Yet the Lost Generation sleeps with no energy policy in place and once again abdicates its responsibilities to a future generation .
The same is true of Social Security .
The Baby - Boomers are retiring now .
The system is broken and there are not enough workers to make the transfers to the retirees .
Do you hear anyone in Washington raising the red flag of warning ?
Once again , the Lost Generation has abdicated its responsibilities and kicked the can down the road .
In the waning months of the Bush Administration , Treasury Secretary Paulson informed Congress that a $ 700 billion bail - out of the financial sector was needed to avoid a melt - down of our banking system .
TARP , the Troubled Asset Relief Program was passed by the Congress in a matter of days .
Only $ 350 billion was committed , banks were forced to accept TARP funds , and little of those funds made their way to acquire troubled assets .
GM and Chrysler received $ 17 billion even though they had no “ troubled assets . ”
Another $ 8 billion went to Sheik Mohammed in Dubai .
He had no troubled assets either , and $ 1.6 billion was paid out in bank bonuses .
AIG received $ 165 billion of TARP money and paid out $ 286 million in bonuses .
No one in Congress anticipated the AIG bonuses when they signed the legislation that specifically allowed the payments .
It does not end there .
Franklin Raines , chief executive of Fannie Mae received $ 91.1 million in compensation from 1998 to 2004 .
In 1998 , Fannie Mae stock was $ 75 per share .
Today , Fannie Mae shares are worth 67 cents .
Mr. Raines was not fired – he was simply hired as an economic advisor to President Elect Obama .
Raines recently settled a civil lawsuit alleging fraud and stock manipulation for $ 31.4 million .
Postmaster General John Potter received compensation of $ 800,000 in 2008 while the United States Post Office lost $ 2.8 billion .
It is possible his $ 135,000 bonus was based on future performance .
The USPS is projected to loss $ 6 billion in 2009 .
Postmaster Potter did not lose his job either .
Our congressional representatives earn $ 174,000 per year for this fiscal oversight .
Their congressional staff earns another $ 1.3 million per year plus too many perks to mention like free cars , airfare , and postage stamps .
The very things that we took for granted as children of the Greatest Generation are now challenged .
Home values have fallen dramatically .
Our retirement accounts have been decimated .
Our public schools are not working .
Traditional allies no longer stand with America .
Not surprisingly , most Americans fear their children will not be better off .
The approval numbers for Congress are at an all - time low .
Despite the vast number of problems facing our country in 2009 , when Congress passed a Continuing Resolution in March 2009 , it contained 8,500 earmarks of pork barrel spending confirming that this Congress is going to maintain business as usual .
Dr. Spock wrote that our parents should not spank us and they should always bolster our self - esteem .
That misguided advice led to the today ’s climate of political correctness where the ideal of self - esteem outweighs the importance of performance , success or accomplishment .
Consequently , the Lost Generation measures itself by its good intentions rather than by its accomplishments .
Its good intentions led to policies that prohibited oil exploration off the coastlines .
The result was $ 4.00 gasoline .
Its good intentions of teaching all children in their native tongue was a good idea but the cost to do so weakened the overall education system in America .
Its good intentions of helping poor families buy homes led to the sub - prime mess that has cost American families trillions in lost equity .
In the last twelve months , under the dominant control of the Baby - Boom generation , America has witnessed $ 11 trillion of home and stock equities disappear .
The Baby - Boomer 's move into retirement comes none too soon .
Let the boomers in Congress retire at 65 .
We ’ll even let them retire on the fat retirement plans they voted for themselves .
But let ’s get rid of them .
The next generation ca n’t do much worse .

He is a resident of Newport Beach , CA .
The AT&T hate is strong these days , especially following the carrier ’s inability to deliver two of the most highly anticipated features to the single largest iPhone market in the world .
But now even I am beginning to hate AT&T , and I still unfortunately have 16 more months to deal with these folks .
I ’ve been hearing a lot of reports from people about network quality issues .
I never experienced them , and I guessed it had something to do with the fact that I live in a relatively small market .
That ’s no longer the case .
In the past few weeks , I am noticing increasingly degraded service .
I watch as my phone signal flails around , losing data connectivity or becomes so sluggish its unusable .
Call drops have also become increasingly numerous — before late May I may have dropped one or two calls in six months .
I ’m also having problems where people are calling me and the calls are going directly to voicemail , even if I have service .
The only way I know somebody was trying to reach me is a seemingly phantom voicemail notification .
So my question for our rural readers : are you seeing these problems creep into your neighborhoods ?
I ’m quite curious .
AT&T is apparently being brought to its knees by the iPhone , and ca n’t keep up .
It is also becoming the single strongest argument to end the company ’s exclusive grip on the device .
Problems like this are not the Apple way .
Looking across the Web , its becoming clear that consumers ire for AT&T is now being transferred to Apple .
While this may not necessarily be fair , it was bound to happen .
It is now the company ’s responsibility to demand results from the carrier or move on .
I am actually hoping that T - Mobile makes a move to get the device .
Personally , I think that carrier would have been a better fit for Apple if it would have had a decent network : AT&T was more a marriage of convenience and necessity .
Apple , please listen .
It ’s time to move on .

Federal Hate Crimes Bill Will Erode Civil Liberties and Undermine Constitutional Safeguards Against Double Jeopardy
At the Grand Hyatt Hotel in midtown Manhattan on Friday , a decorous LCD placard outside a ballroom — the sort that might have announced the name of a session at a conference of anthropologists or oral surgeons — read , “ The Islamic Republic of Iran : Elections , 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. ”
On the way to the hotel , I ’d swapped headscarves with an Iranian friend .
The one she ’d brought was green , the official color of the campaign of the reformist presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi , and she had heard that in Tehran it was forbidden to wear green inside the polling places .
But at the Grand Hyatt , there were no headscarves to be seen , and plenty of green .
The ballroom was nearly empty when we arrived at 3:30 P.M. , except for a table staffed by three Iranian - Americans , one of whom assured us that they were volunteers , not employees of the Iranian government .
That would explain the lack of compulsory hijab .
He said he ’d seen about five hundred voters so far , and he estimated that seventy - five per cent of them were young people .
Our little group included a thirty - year - old man and three women in their twenties .
“ Iran has a bright future , ” the volunteer told us in avuncular tones , “ with so many young people getting involved . ”
My friends filled out their ballots .
Three were voting for Mousavi , one for the other reformist in the race , Mehdi Karroubi .
We loitered outside the ballroom , where two Iranian journalists sat on the floor glued to their Blackberries , looking for Facebook updates from Iran .
The ballroom was filling up .
A leggy young woman entered , in a green tank top and white hot pants , to a burst of appreciative laughter and a flurry of photographs .
Iranian sweets called gaz appeared on the refreshments table .
They were green , one voter pointed out , for Mousavi , and white , for Karroubi .
Another , mocking President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s 2005 campaign promise to bring oil to the people ’s supper tables , said , “ This is the gaz Ahmadinejad has brought to our tables . ”
From 3:30 P.M. until 4:15 P.M. , the scene at the Hyatt was festive , despite the news earlier in the day that the reformist headquarters had been sacked and prominent reformists arrested .
Everyone had a story about a relative who had never voted before , who was a royalist or an all - purpose skeptic , who was wearing green in the streets or simply casting a vote for Mousavi .
There was only one way this could go .
Turnout , we heard , was over eighty per cent .
But then the first ominous Facebook update came in .
The Ministry of Interior had announced that of the twenty - five million votes counted thus far , sixteen million were for Ahmadinejad .
The time , in Tehran , was just past midnight .
The polls in the cities had just closed .
It was not time to panic yet ; maybe this was just the rural vote .
But the mood in our little circle darkened .
It was n’t true , came another update — only five million had been counted , and , of them , both candidates were claiming sixty per cent .
Then the tally reached ten million , with sixty - seven per cent for Ahmadinejad .
And then the most sinister news of all : the public had been told that if anyone approached the Interior Ministry , which would be the obvious site for a protest of the vote count , the police had orders to shoot .
There can be no question that the June 12 , 2009 , Iranian presidential election was stolen .
Dissident employees of the Interior Ministry , which is under the control of President Ahmadinejad and is responsible for the mechanics of the polling and counting of votes , have reportedly issued an open letter saying as much .
Government polls ( one conducted by the Revolutionary Guards , the other by the state broadcasting company ) that were leaked to the campaigns allegedly showed ten - to twenty - point leads for Mousavi a week before the election ; earlier polls had them neck and neck , with Mousavi leading by one per cent , and Karroubi just behind .
Historically , low turnout has always favored conservatives in Iranian elections , while high turnout favors reformers .
That ’s because Iran ’s most reliable voters are those who believe in the system ; those who are critical tend to be reluctant to participate .
For this reason , in the last three elections , sixty - five per cent of voters have come from traditional , rural villages , which house just thirty - five per cent of the populace .
If the current figures are to be believed , urban Iranians who voted for the reformist ex-president Mohammad Khatami in 1997 and 2001 have defected to Ahmadinejad in droves .
What is most shocking is not the fraud itself , but that it was brazen and entirely without pretext .
The final figures put Mousavi ’s vote below thirty - five per cent , and not because of a split among reformists ; they have Karroubi pulling less than one per cent of the vote .
To announce a result this improbable , and to do it while locking down the Interior Ministry , sending squads of Revolutionary Guards into the streets , blacking out Internet and cell - phone communication , and shuttering the headquarters of the rival candidates , sends a chilling message to the people of Iran — not only that the Islamic Republic does not care about their votes , but that it does not fear their wrath .
Iranians , including many of the original founders and staunch supporters of the revolution , are angry , and they will demonstrate .
But they will be met with organized and merciless violence .
Already , YouTube clips are streaming out of Iran , many of them showing riot police savagely beating protestors .
Mousavi and Karroubi have been placed under house arrest .
( Update : It appears that Mousavi ’ situation is more complicated . )
When it comes to the instruments of democracy in Iran , there is understandable confusion abroad .
Iran has elections , and in 1997 Mohammad Khatami won them by a landslide and initiated an eight - year period of internal reform .
But this is only half the story of the reform years .
The other half involves the relentless occlusion of the reform agenda by clerics who outrank the president , and the systematic elimination of every loophole through which another Khatami might creep into the state apparatus .
By 2005 , the country ’s hard - line Supreme Leader , Ali Khamenei , had made it abundantly clear that he did not intend to tolerate a divided government .
The mood of the electorate , in 2005 and at the two mid-term elections since , has been cynical and despondent .
It was logical to conclude that no candidate who ran in the 2009 race could be expected to put up real resistance to the Supreme Leader , and that no reforms would be successful .
And so it was particularly stunning to watch Iranians resurrect their hopes and place them in Mir Hossein Mousavi — even if they did so for the main purpose of ejecting Ahmadinejad from power .
When the Supreme Leader approved Mousavi and Karroubi as presidential candidates earlier this year , Karroubi lacked a constituency , and Mousavi was no liberal .
Perhaps Khamenei did not count on Mousavi ’s emergence as the vehicle for a groundswell of youthful democratic sentiment — meaning whatever his personal views or background , if Mousavi became president , he would carry with him the same social forces and the same expectations as Khatami , who was fatefully paralyzed between the demands of his supporters and the constraints of his superiors .
Where Khatami was conciliatory by nature , Mousavi had a reputation for a steelier resolve .
And there is the small matter of Obama , the outreach from the United States , and the unavoidable sense that most of the Iranian public and its political establishment , including all three presidential challengers , support dialogue with America .
The major exceptions have been the Supreme Leader himself , his hard - line inner circle , and Ahmadinejad .
Did Khamenei fear the presence of unreliable forces in government during such a sensitive moment in Iran ’s foreign policy ?
Or did he want to shut down the possibility of dialogue altogether ?
WTOP sent us this hilariously inappropriate picture of the electronic sign on the GW Parkway 's northbound exit from Rosslyn toward the Key Bridge .
The Virginia Department of Transportation says it 's not their sign ( deny deny deny ) , but they do know how to turn it off , and someone headed over there to do just that .
Bummer .
Another sign at Chain Bridge Road and the GW Parkway had a similar message but was turned off earlier .
See what happens ?
You arrest BORF and then someone else feels the need to be , um , creative .
The wacky traffic sign appears to be all the rage this year .
In Austin this January , motorists were greeted with the warning , " NAZI ZOMBIES ! RUN !!! "
And then a week later in Lubbock , Texas , drivers were advised , " OMG THE BRITISH R COMING . "
The government is planning to introduce important new restrictions on access to cabinet and royal papers under freedom of information .
Under the new plans , cabinet papers would be absolutely exempt from FOI for a period of 20 years .
This would include records relating to cabinet sub-committees .
This would be significantly tighter than the current position , where for most cabinet documents the decision on whether to release them depends on the " public interest test " - whether it is more in the public interest to disclose them in response to an FOI request or to keep them secret .
Royal papers will also be subject to an absolute exemption for 20 years , which in the case of the sovereign and the heir to the throne would be extended to five years after their death if that was later .
The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that this is what Gordon Brown meant when in his Commons statement today he referred to " the need to strengthen protection for particularly sensitive material " .
This will be accompanied by greater openness for government papers apart from cabinet and royal documents , reducing the " 30 year rule " which governs when most of them will be open to the public to 20 years .
This is the government 's response to the recent Dacre review of the rule .
Mr Brown also confirmed that FOI will be extended to cover a wider range of organisations .
The justice minister Michael Wills had already indicated this last month .
The next step on this would involve consultation with those bodies that the government wants to bring within the scope of FOI , so it will be some time before any extension actually takes effect .
Mr Brown told MPs :
" Given the vital role transparency has played in sweeping aside the discredited system of allowances , and holding power to account , I believe we should do more to spread the culture and practice of freedom of information . "
UPDATE 17.50 : The Ministry of Justice has now given me this statement :
" The Dacre Review 's recommendation that we consider - in parallel to adopting a new rule - whether certain categories of information deserve enhanced protection has prompted us to look at important safeguards in the current FOI Act .
In relation to Cabinet information , and information relating to the Royal Household , it has become clear that those safeguards are insufficiently robust to protect our current constitutional arrangements , and need changing .
We will be announcing the detail of these changes in our full response , to be published shortly .
We will be making two amendments to the exemptions in the Freedom of Information
Act to ensure that our information access arrangements allow essential constitutional relationships and conventions to be preserved .
" Cabinet papers will be released much earlier than under the current rule , but will be subject to an absolute exemption under the Act until they are 20 years old .
" To ensure the constitutional position and political impartiality of the Monarchy is not undermined , the relevant exemption in the Freedom of Information Act will be made absolute for information relating to communications with the Royal Household that is less than 20 years ' old .
After that point - if the relevant Member of the Royal Family is still alive - then the exemption will continue to apply until five years after their death - on an absolute basis for the Sovereign and the Heir to the Throne , and on a qualified basis for other members of the Royal Family . "
The Campaign for Freedom of Information is not happy .
Negative Population Growth , Inc. ( NPG ) is a national nonprofit membership organization .
It was founded in 1972 to educate the American public and political leaders about the devastating effects of overpopulation on our environment , resources and standard of living .
We believe that our nation is already vastly overpopulated in terms of the long - range carrying capacity of its resources and environment .
We urgently need , therefore , a National Population Policy with the goal of eventually stabilizing our population size at a sustainable level , far below today 's , after an interim period of negative growth .
Most politicians , big business and its supporting economists call for growth as a solution to all our problems .
Apparently , they believe in perpetual growth , which is a mathematical absurdity on a finite planet .
There must be limits .
Science is demonstrating that human population and consumption in the United States and the world are already far too large and are destroying the natural systems that support us .
We must eventually stabilize our national as well as world population size , so that they would be sustainable indefinitely .

Firstly : forgive me for not giving many sources but I have n't the time .
The details should be verifiable .
Here goes :
The BoE , like many big banks , is in fact a private corporation .
If you read the BoE Act of 1946 , which ostensibly nationalised the bank , you 'll see that share ownership still remained with whoever held shares in it previously , now with a government guarantee , neat .
Yes , the government makes board appointments , but the process is not transparent and easily lobbied .
The reason the bank is so closely tied to the government ( more explicitely , HM Treasury ) shows how tightly interwoven parliament , The Crown and the BoE are .
This has historical reasons , the BoE is the oldest institution of its kind and The Crown has had close relations to it and other corporations ( British East India Company et al. ) for hundreds of years .
Empire as extension of corporate activity .
The Federal Reserve Bank in the US is a private corporation , as well .
Since it is historically quite young , though , it is easier to verify its status visa - vis the government , check the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
The Federal Reserve is owned by a number of large banks and private interests through shareholdings .
Woodrow Wilson regretted his role in creating the Federal Reserve and its long - term consequences for the American people .
In essence : The Federal Reserve and its precursor , the BoE are privately owned , for - profit institutions .
The missing 75 % of your calculation are filling the establishment 's pockets .
Whose in particular ?
That 's harder to figure in the UK , when you find out , let me know .
However , even the 25 % going into HM treasury are not necessarily going towards revenue spent for public purposes .
They are " the cut " The Crown gets for letting the BoE operate .
A convenient arrangement .
So much for the profits .
How does the BoE create these profits , though ?
Mostly by the monopoly of lending money to the government and charging interest .
That interest is paid back , amongst others , by the taxes that you pay .
As you can see , you are not necessarily benefitting from the process .
It might be worth while finding out to see how the 25 % cut is spent .
I am not sure if you are aware that governments , specifically their treasuries , can theoretically issue ( and have practically issued ) their own currency - and therefore would n't need to incur interest and , as a consequence , public debt .
The process of creating money is the same for government as it is for the banks , by fiat ( " out of thin air " ) .
The " innovation " that was the BoE , was to be made MONOPOLY lender to the government , and in the process set a bad example for other countries to follow .
The BoE , the Parliament and The Crown are all located in the central part of London referred to as " The City of London " .
The City of London is itself a private corporation ( issuing annual reports ) .
It would be interesting to see how the BoE and The Crown interlink with that entity and the legal implications thereof .
Small changes in our mundane lives can stimulate a surprising array of emotions – love , anger , defiance , even shame .
Take the five cents it now costs
Torontonians to take home anything they buy – books , fresh fish , running shoes – in a plastic bag .
" I hate those guys , " says a man in a grey T - shirt charging out of the Loblaws grocery store on Dupont St. with a jar of mayonnaise in one hand , paper products in the other .
Those guys ?
He waves vaguely to the store .
" Charging five cents ! "
Lucy , a part - time teacher , begs that her last name not be used because her children , keen recyclers , will be embarrassed if she publicly expresses her fondness for plastic grocery bags .
" I love them , " she says .
She has left her reusable bags in the car and emerged with a cartload of groceries bagged in plastic .
" I find them extremely convenient and I have many uses for them at home .
Somebody told me they can be composted ( that 's not true ) – but either way , I love them . "
Since the City of Toronto imposed the fee June 1 , we 've altered the way we shop – there 's a whole new anthropology of commercial exchanges .
Customers leave shops with arms loaded – cherries , chips and baguettes – refusing to pay five cents for a bag .
They are motivated by a nobility of purpose – they think they 're saving the earth – or a curmudgeonly resistance to paying for something that was once free .
Sometimes they 're just carrying a couple of sandwiches , as a man in a Tilley hat , white pants – a faintly nautical look – emerging from All the Best Fine Foods on a posh section of Yonge St. , did last week .
Why was he bagless ?
" I do n't like spending five cents , " he snapped .
Most people are surprisingly uninhibited striding across parking lots balancing groceries like Cirque du Soleil aerialists .
They shoulder kitty litter and paper towels , juggle avocados and lemons .
Some wave their receipts as they exit proving they 're responsible citizens who have spurned plastic but still paid for the goods .
Logistical problems lay ahead : with arms full , how to open the car door ?
Retired teacher Ann Marshall put her milk and bread on the roof of her car – she'd left her reusable bags on the passenger seat – and said , " I use plastic bags but I do n't want to pay for them .
You feel nickeled and dimed as a senior . "
Three weeks into the new regime , it 's not known how many shoppers have made the switch .
It appears many have .
Of the major grocery chains , only Loblaw Companies Limited , Canada 's largest grocer , has released figures on the decline in plastic bag use – 75 per cent fewer since launching its nationwide reduction program April 22 .
Metro and Sobeys have noted a drop – no numbers available – while reusable bag sales have increased fivefold and threefold respectively .
At the same time , shoppers have abandoned brand loyalty in shopping bags .
You see Fiesta Farms bags at Loblaws .
Sobeys bags at Metro .
Some use bags as cultural markers , identifying shoppers ' wider , more interesting lives as travellers ( Centre du Rasoir in Paris ) , readers ( Harvard Book Store ) or handy men or women ( Lee Valley Tools ) .
Some shoppers question if the five - cent fee is a deterrent or a penalty .
Lawyer and mother of two Tierney Grieve is annoyed , she says , pushing a cartload of groceries in plastic bags to her car where she has defiantly left her reusable bags .
" People judge you , " she says .
She needs the plastic to line rubbish bins at home .
" There 's a lot of social pressure to demonstrate how socially conscious we are , " says Grieve .
" Screw it .
I need some bags . "
Nor is she happy about the five - cent fee , though the large chains are donating part of the fee collected to environmental organizations .
" I 'd like to know what the charities are . "
Loblaws plans to give $ 1 million a year over three years to the World Wildlife Fund - Canada .
Any leftover funds will be used to reconfigure checkout stations , retrain cashiers and post reminder notices .
( A word on reconfiguring : Instead of placing items into plastic bags stretched on racks , the groceries accumulate on the counter in a muddle so the clerk can sort them and pack the different shaped reusable bags more efficiently . )
Metro is donating $ 2 million toward an environmental stewardship program in schools in Ontario and Quebec for the 2009 / 10 school year .
Sobeys Ontario is funding grants of up to $ 20,000 to support Earth Day Canada projects .
" I want to do the right thing , but what do I do about my garbage ? " says Grieve .
" Black cloth bags are not going to solve my bathroom and kitchen problem . "
Not only grocery shoppers face the question – would you like a plastic bag ?
– at the cash desk .
Clerks at bookstores , takeout food stores and clothing stores are asking , too .
At Indigo Books and Music on Bloor St. W. , where fees collected go to an environmental fund , a clerk estimates 75 per cent of customers are declining plastic bags .

One of them is Monique Macbeth , shopping with her granddaughter .
" Plastic bags , they literally last forever .
But they will soon be a thing of the past .
In Europe they use string bags and shopping baskets . "
At the landmark gourmet food store , Dinah 's Cupboard in Yorkville , manager Glenn Beech guesses customers rarely take plastic bags , no more than 10 to 15 bags a week .
" It 's not the five cents .
It 's just a reminder , `oh , yeah , we 're not supposed to be wasting bags . '
People are retraining themselves . "
The effect of this new consciousness also ripples through Ontario 's business community .
Plastic bag manufacturers are feeling the pinch and laying off staff , part attributable to the recession , part because of the fee for bags .
Fadhil Yousif , who runs Grand Plastics , a Brampton family business , says orders have dropped 75 per cent in the past two weeks .
He used to make 100,000 to 150,000 bags a day .
Last week , he stopped his machines .
" The stores are scared to stock their normal orders ; they do n't know if they can move them , " he said .
" I do n't know what I 'm going to do .
I 'm waiting to see what happens in the next two weeks . "
At the Canadian Plastics Industry Association , Cathy Cirko praises the plastic bag while lamenting the terrible timing – a recession – in imposing what she calls a " tax . "
" It 's not only affecting manufacturers of plastic products , but it does put a negative image on all plastics . "
She argues the City of Toronto should have expanded its recycling program and warns that the fee will have a negative impact on the recycling industry in Ontario .
Bags cost one to two cents to make , yet the businesses are charging five cents , she says .
Shopping bags account for less than 1 per cent of landfill and up to 70 percent of plastic bags are reused , she says .
" It 's a profit grab .
At the end of the day are we making sensible environmental decisions ? "
Still many people embrace the idea of reducing the use of plastic .
Customers at Olliffe Fine Meats on Yonge St. bring their own bags and many use the smart red folding bags given away when the store opened .
But the five - cent fee can cause uncomfortable moments .
What happens when you ring up a purchase and then inquire if the customer would like a plastic bag ?
" It 's Rosedale , " says Sam Gundy .
" It 's awkward to ask for a nickel after the transaction . "

Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : The Japanese prefecture of Saitama established a Prefectural Anime Tourism Investigative Commission on Tuesday to discuss ways to boost anime - based tourism — including " changing the [ local ] schools ' unifoms to match the uniforms of the Lucky Star characters . "
Takayoshi Yamamura , the Hokkaido University associate professor who wrote a paper about how the prefecture 's town of Washimiya became a mecca for Lucky Star anime tourists , chairs the six - member commission .
The other commission members include anime production figures and manga creators such as Sakuya Hikochi ( Dr. Kuruma 's Time Machine , Chichibu Cafe & Art- Culture Guide Book ) .
Besides the suggestion on Lucky Star uniforms , the commission also discussed the idea of " leasing a few vacant public facilities as production studios for manga creators . "
The commission will meet three times by next February and also exchange views over email or by other means .
The members plan to present their findings next March .
The prefecture already launched a " Saitama Chō Deep na Kankō Kyōkai " website for visiting domestic and foreign anime fans in Japanese , Simplified Chinese , and English last April .
The website highlights the shrine popularized by Lucky Star , the Crayon Shin-chan amusement facility , and the forested hills that inspired My Neighbor Totoro 's backdrops .
An estimated 420,000 visitors came to Washimiya 's Washinomiya Shrine during 2009 's New Year 's holidays — two to three times the number of visitors who came two years ago .

“ For most people , a high - deductible plan is basically a bet against yourself , ” said Ms. Stoll .
“ You ’re betting that you wo n’t get sick and you wo n’t have an accident .
But is n’t that exactly what insurance is supposed to be ?
A bet that something might happen , and if it does you ’ll be protected ? ”
Whether you are considering a high - deductible policy because you are healthy and do n’t think you need much coverage or you want the tax - sheltered savings account or you simply cannot afford anything else , you need to carefully consider the following .
WHY IS THE PREMIUM SO LOW ?
It is not always simply because the deductible is high .
There may be other cost - reducing limitations on the plan as well .
If the premium looks too good to be true , look for one of these lurking loopholes :

A cap on lifetime coverage .
It is hard to even estimate what you will need over your lifetime in health care coverage .
But when you are looking at this number , keep in mind that the average hospital charge for an appendectomy is $ 22,000 , and the average charge for a hip replacement is $ 40,000 .
You do not want a lifetime coverage cap that is going to be exhausted quickly by one or two long hospital stays or by extended outpatient care for a chronic illness .
A cap on doctor visits .
Some severely restrictive plans will cover only a handful of doctor visits a year after the deductible is met .
Others charge a big co-payment for every doctor visit .
Still others will not even start to cover doctors ’ visits unless they occur after a hospitalization  which , as Gary Claxton , a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation , points out , is basically a hospital - only policy .
A cap on hospitalization costs .
Again , consider those hospital costs .
Is the policy you are considering going to get you through ?
Mr. Claxton has seen policies that so severely restrict hospitalization that they will not pay for the first day you are admitted .
“ That ’s the day when you ’re most likely to have the most costs , ” he said .
“ Think of it : You ’re admitted to the E.R. , you have surgery and you spend the night in the I.C.U. , and none of it is covered . ”
Other high out - of - pocket costs .
Just because you have met your deductible does n’t mean you are done spending money .
High co-payments of 20 percent or more on doctors ’ visits , prescription drugs and hospitalizations can add up quickly .
With some of these policies , Mr. Claxton says , you will pay an extraordinary amount in out - of - pocket costs , sometimes as much as $ 10,000 .
If the purchase is completed , it would mark the first acquisition of a well - known American automotive brand by a Chinese company , after many months of speculation about when this might occur .
Chinese automakers have already purchased the MG and Rover brands , two of the most famous names in British automotive history .
As a Chinese company , Sichuan Tengzhong could face a challenge in presenting the deal to American owners of Hummer .
The brand has long sought to emphasize patriotism , stressing that the Hummer H1 was essentially the same vehicle built in the same factory as the Humvee that carries American soldiers into battle in Iraq and elsewhere .
It was Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California who persuaded the longtime maker of Humvees , A.M. General in Mishawaka , Ind. , to build a civilian version .
As he recounted at a Hummer news conference in 2001 , Mr. Schwarzenegger was filming the movie “ Kindergarten Kop ” in Oregon in 1990 when he saw a convoy of 50 Humvees drive by and decided that he had to have a civilian model of the same vehicle , which became the Hummer H1 .
G.M. bought the rights to the Hummer brand in 1999 and began making somewhat smaller Hummers .
G.M. initially procured the H1 from A.M. General but discontinued the model in 2006 .
Under the preliminary agreement announced on Tuesday , GM will initially continue to manufacture Hummers under contract for Sichuan Tengzhong , which will then market them around the world .
G.M. will continue making the H3 and H3T models in Shreveport , La. , through the end of next year , for example .
The buyer plans to shift additional production of the H3 from a plant in South Africa to Shreveport , Mr. Richards said .
Sichuan Tengzhong could bring Hummers to the crowded streets of China ’s big cities , although the vehicles would face the 40 percent tax that China imposes on cars , S.U.V.s and minivans with engines over 4 liters .
G.M. has not set up its own Hummer dealer network in China , but entrepreneurs already import the vehicles and sell them in the biggest cities .
Copies of the Hummer by Chinese automakers draw crowds at auto shows , although they are labeled as concept vehicles and are not for sale .
G.M. , which is hoping to shed unwanted assets and emerge from bankruptcy in about two months , said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter .
The automaker had planned to close Hummer if a buyer could not be found .
It is also trying to sell Saturn and Saab this year and plans to eliminate a fourth brand , Pontiac , in 2010 .
G.M. , with 60 percent government ownership , will keep Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC .
“ Hummer is a strong brand , ” Troy Clarke , the president of G.M. North America , said in a statement : “ I ’m confident that Hummer will thrive globally under its new ownership .
And for G.M. , this sale continues to accelerate the reinvention of G.M. into a leaner , more focused , and more cost - competitive automaker . ”
Once considered the ultimate muscle car , the Hummer became a symbol of what was wrong with G.M. and the American auto industry — big , bulky and gas - guzzling .
Sales of Hummers fell 51 percent last year , the worst drop in the industry , and are down 67 percent so far in 2009 .
Mr. Richards said the buyer planned to continue selling Hummer ’s current lineup as it develops “ more efficient ” vehicles .
The brand would eventually sell trucks fueled by diesel , ethanol and other alternative fuels , he said .
In February , G.M. said it had three bidders for Hummer , which has about 220 dealers globally .
Hummer ’s chief executive , James Taylor , said the sale would allow the company to continue to grow and maximize the brand ’s potential .
Given that Unix won , I think it 's interesting that dynamic languages make very little use of the dynamic linking and loading infrastructure provided by modern free Unixes such as Linux and the BSDs .
Most dynamic PLs opt to implement " dynamism " ( i.e. redefining stuff , loading code at runtime ) with application - specific data structures ( e.g. Lisp : red - black trees for uniquifying symbols , function pointers and indirect function calls ) , and they do so solely at runtime ( mostly using interpreters and JITs , although Scheme , one of the most advanced dynamic languages , is increasingly illuminating the possibilities of static , independent compilation of dynamic programs ) .
( Metaprogramming at runtime is perilous , as it is easy to mix up phase distinctions , something we can expect newer dynamic programming languages to discover in a decade ( of course we do n't know which decade . ) )
Link - time is mostly ignored .
And yet , under Linux with its heavy use of shared objects , one cannot even start a single program without invoking the dynamic linker .
But some people , even some computer programmers , do n't know how linkers work and what they do .
Basically , a modern linking file format , such as ELF , is a declarative way to construct the memory image of a running process , with lots of features for dynamic customization of the image construction process ( ELF even contains a customization hook called " program interpreter " in every executable ! ) .
Likewise , modern compilers and runtime systems such as GNU C contain sophisticated features aimed squarely at dynamic languages : weak symbols for runtime redefinability ( used by libc 's malloc and in the Linux kernel , for example ) , computed gotos , nested functions , and increasingly , GC .
And there is evidence that dynamic compilation and linking of C snippets is accepted and used in modern systems software .
I have collected some links to these topics , and would be interested to hear of languages and systems that you know that exploit them .
( Updates : added 3 ELF links ; added Drepper ; added Taylor )
Are you a small business owner or possibly looking to set up a personal website ?
Setting up a website can be done for a little over $ 100 .
This includes your own domain ; not a subdomain like www.theirwebsite.com/yourwebsite.
I mean your own website like www.yourwebsite.com, .org , .net , etc .
Some domain titles are going to cost more than others so you just need to make sure your domain title is not something extremely popular .
My personal name domain ; www.JenniferBuchanan.com ended up listed as $ 1,688 .
So I chose to pass on that and come up with my own unique domain name .
To begin you can open a free account with GoDaddy .
I only offer this web company because this is who I used for mine .
There are others and it is a good idea to shop around .
Setting up a web account is easy .
You can begin by experimenting and looking up domain names to see if yours has been taken or is available .
Once you find an available domain choose to purchase a two year contract or if you do n't mind spending a little more and saving more you can choose to set up a longer contract .
A two year contract should fall right around the price of $ 15.00 .
Once you have your domain you still need someone to provide a place to store your website files and other things you 'd like to store on the internet .
You are going to need a host for your domain .
A host is similar to a harddrive online .
You can choose a host that suits your website 's needs .
Hosts can range in price so make sure you shop around .
You can have a domain from one web company and a host from another .
It is easier on you to set up a domain and host with the same company , and less confusing .
Now that you have a domain and a host you can begin your design .
There are so many web designing programs out there these days .
You can also download many different trial versions off the internet .
If you already have Publisher ; they offer a great website designing program .
This is what I used .
With any website designing program you are going to need to bring out your creativity .
There are templates already set up if you do n't have a lot of time or you can bring out your artistic side and really be unique .
Designing a website can take quite awhile but if you want to save money do it yourself .
Make sure your pages are easy to read and that they all link up together sending one page to another and then back again .
You can usually take a tutorial of the program you are using to become more familiar with it .
If anyone would like me to write something on how to design a website let me know .
Once you have your website designed you are going to need to upload it to your host .
Depending on which program you used depends on the best way to upload it .
If you are unsure you can always call the company you used to design it and the hosting company for assistance .
If you used Publisher and Godaddy here is how it works .
First , with your website design open in Publisher , drop down your file list and click publish to the web .
Then choose a safe , memorable place to save your file and do n't change the name unless you are an advanced user .
Then open your Godaddy account .
When you are signed on drop down your hosting list and select my hosting account .
Select manage account for the correct domain title and select file manager from the content drop down menu .
Once your file manager is open you should see an existing file labeled HTML .
Select create new directory .
Name your new directory index_files .
Now you are going to open your new folder you just created .
When your index_files folder is open you are going to select upload from the folders above .
Browse for your website files where you saved them and open the index_files folder on your computer .
Select everything in that folder and upload .
After all of your files are uploaded ; select the HTML folder and then select upload again on the Godaddy file manager .
You are going to need to upload the other file you saw where you saved your website to your computer .
It will be labeled index.htm .
Upload this file into your HTML folder in your file manager and you are set to go .
Leave this page open and type in your domain name on the internet .
Check it out see if it worked .
If your website is there you are done and can close out Godaddy .
Congratulations !
There are so many other neat things you can get free for your website that hosting companies charge you for .
You can most times get free email with your domain name .
Example : yourname@yourdomain.com .
I know Qwest account holders get this service free with their internet service .
Try this : domains.live.com .
You can also get more traffic coming to see your website by going to each search site and finding the correct link to have that search engine search your site .
It is sometimes hard to find and most times they want you to create a free account with them ; which is fine .
You join and they add your site to their search engine .
You can also get a free statistics counters so you know how many customers or people are visiting your site .
This is a great benefit , because if you have no idea if you website is being used you wo n't know whether you need to find different advertising to get your name out there .
There are many websites out there that offer neat , free , frills for your website design .
These are great ways to spruce up your site , just make sure you have a good antivirus program because some of them require you to download files and you do n't want to get a virus .
If you have a good antivirus program your program will prohibit these corrupt files before you download .
Be safe .
Well there you have it .
A website for a little more than $ 100 .
Have fun with it .
The Android Scripting Environment ( ASE ) will make Android development easier and more accessible for a number of developers who do n’t want to build a full application .
The ASE allows developers to develop directly on the Android powered device without the need for a separate computer using Android ’s development environment .
Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal , started as a long running service , or started via Locale .
Python , Lua and BeanShell are currently supported , and we ’re planning to add Ruby and JavaScript support , as well .
The ASE scripts will allow access to many of the API ’s that are available to application developers , but according to Google will include a much more simple interface that will make it far easier to :
Handle intents
Start activities
Make phone calls
Send text messages
Scan bar codes
Poll location and sensor data
Use text - to - speech ( TTS )
And more
The Android Scripting Environment can be downloaded from the ASE project page HERE .

Since 2005 , a Brazilian senator has been championing new cybercrime legislation which would include tough measures against file - sharing .
Yesterday , at the International Free Software Forum , the Brazilian President openly criticized the bill , and then posed for pictures with The Pirate Bay 's Peter Sunde .
Since 2005 , Brazilian senator Eduardo Azeredo has been proposing new ‘ cybercrimes ’ legislation .
Unlike some European proposals , the Brazilian one is n’t limited to dealing with copyright issues alone , but has expanded to include all “ dangerous ” online activities .
Anyone creating a virus or simply sharing illicit files could be arrested and jailed for up to three years .
The International Free Software Forum ( FISL ) is an annual event sponsored by the Free Software Association taking place in Porto Alegre , Brazil .
The event sees the coming together of researchers , social movements , entrepreneurs , hackers and free information advocates , this year including Peter Sunde , spokesman for The Pirate Bay .
At the event yesterday was a rather high - profile individual , Brazil ’s President Lula .
The President took the opportunity to publicly criticize the legislation supported by Senator Eduardo Azeredo .
“ In our government it is prohibited to prohibit , ” said the president during his speech at the event .
“ I consider this bill a form of censorship , ” he added .
After meeting with others including Richard Stallman , President Lula noted that “.. the Internet must continue free , ” adding ” .. the freedom is the source of the creativity ” .
Also invited to the event was someone with perhaps an even higher profile in Internet - related issues than the president himself , The Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde .
Not wanting to miss out on a great photo opportunity to boost his popularity , President Lula Peter Sunde posed with Peter Sunde President Lula .

Two striking facts about the Hay festival this weekend have been ( a ) the weather – everyone has doubtless commented on the sunshine blazing down on what is usually a Somme - like vista of mud seen through slanting rain – and ( b ) the huge audiences for the science talks , with both of the big tents filled to capacity for two talks by Martin Rees and one by Steve Jones .
Whereas the weather might in fact be a cause for concern rather than celebration – is this another bit of proof that our basking comes at the expense of the ice caps – the other fact is genuinely a matter of celebration .
The interest shown in science , the informed questions that followed the talks , and the queues at the signings afterwards , were indicators of the healthy fact that there is a lively constituency of interest in science , which in this 50th anniversary year of CP Snow 's Two Cultures essay is a positive sign .
In the first of his two lectures Martin Rees talked about what we might expect , and what we should be concerned about , in our world in 2050 .
The points he made are to be found set out at greater length in his book Our Final Century ( he had first entitled this Our Final Century ?
his publishers removed the question mark ; the American edition , in line with the greater interest in immediate gratification over there , was entitled Our Final Hour )
It 's a good thing Rees keeps iterating his views about the risks we face from " error and terror " , given the immense harm that would accrue from very small probability events : some we might avoid , some we might rethink , some we would at least understand as they happen to us .
His second lecture was on the cosmos , an infinitely fascinating topic whoever annotates the slides – but when it is Rees 's eloquence , dry sense of humour and prodigious expertise doing it , the combination is unbeatable .
That is why a thousand people paid for tickets to come and listen .
From the discussion afterwards it was clear that at least many in the audience were at home with talk of parsecs and the Crab Nebula .
Steve Jones 's lecture was equally packed .
Celebrations of Darwin and discussions of evolutionary theory are everywhere in this anniversary year , constituting one of the biggest episodes of public education in science yet attempted .
Darwin and Darwinism were therefore Jones 's theme .
One of the high points was an anecdote illustrating the way creationists can reconcile the contradiction of fact with what they would like to believe : Jones told us that he had spent a year teaching in Botswana some years ago , where a fundamentalist form of Calvinism has long subsisted .
He asked one of his students there how he reconciled the study of biology with his faith .
The student replied , " it 's easy ; I simply accept that you evolved , but we were created . "
Hay is a place where grounds for optimism are to be found , in the survival of reading , in the flourishing of intelligent interest in science and ideas , in the liveliness of the public conversation .
Great stuff .
Keeping the public in the dark
( Natural News ) That Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett both died in the last 48 hours is shocking news to many , but it 's not nearly as surprising as the fact that they were both killed by Big Pharma 's toxic drugs .
Michael Jackson , we now know , died from an injection of Demerol given by his doctor -- a man who is now the subject of an LAPD manhunt .
There is little question that the injection of Demerol -- a potent pharmaceutical -- caused Jackson 's death .
Chalk it up to yet another tragic loss of a hugely inspiring artist who has become a victim of the pharmaceutical industry and overzealous medical doctors .
Demerol , by the way , is a highly - potent opioid drug that 's also highly addictive .
And yet it 's being prescribed ( and injected ) by doctors with the full support of the FDA , the pharmaceutical industry and the conventional medical community .
It is nothing less than amazing that mild drugs like marijuana remain outlawed while potentially deadly painkiller drugs like Demerol are openly injected into people by doctors .
Farrah Fawcett 's death was far less sudden than Jackson's , but no less innocent .
She was -- a toxic cocktail of chemicals pushed onto patients by oncologists who deceptively call it " treatment .
" Against the advice of many in the natural health community , Fawcett gave in to her doctors and agreed to be poisoned as a treatment for anal cancer .
But what she did n't know is that And after subjecting her body to more chemotherapy , it was n't long before Fawcett was diagnosed with liver cancer .
( Chemotherapy causes terrible harm to the liver , heart , kidneys and brain ... )
Before long , her suppressed immune system and ongoing poison treatments overcame her body 's natural healing ability , and she died ( as yet another victim of chemotherapy ) .
Her doctors , of course , claim she " died of cancer . "
Clever huh ?
Cancer doctors operate with that sort of clever deception :
If the cancer goes away , they claim the patient was " treated by the medicine , " but if the patient dies , they claim " the cancer killed them . "
It 's pretty easy to claim success if you take credit for the wins while fleeing the any responsibility for the losses .
Back to Farrah , while many of her friends and supporters say her battle with cancer was " an inspiration , " let me be the first to publicly state that to me , poisoning yourself with toxic chemicals is NOT inspiring , no matter how much suffering you go through .
I do not believe that people should be given special recognition for pain and suffering they consciously choose to inflict upon themselves , especially when all that suffering is easily avoidable .
It would have been far more " inspiring " for Farrah to choose healing remedies instead of deadly poisons .
Had she chosen natural remedies , she could have skipped all the pain and suffering , restored her immune function , reversed her cancer and gone on to live a much longer and more abundant life .
( It would have saved her a small fortune in medical costs , too ... )
But she did n't choose natural health ( nutrition , vitamin D , immune support , superfoods and medicinal herbs ) .
Instead , she chose poison .
As a result , her decision to ravage her body 's health through " slash and burn " medicine ultimately cost more than her body could afford to pay .
What 's especially sad about all this is that the conventional medical trade groups , the drug companies and the FDA are all conspiring to keep consumers ignorant of natural cancer remedies .
So Farrah Fawcett almost certainly did not have easy access to the kind of information about natural remedies that could have saved her life .
She would have had to read NaturalNews or other good sources of truthful information about natural solutions for cancer like www.Gerson.org ) .
But this is all by design : .
Those who dare to offer health products with accurate descriptions about their anti-cancer attributes are threatened with arrest and imprisonment by the FDA and FTC ( https://www.naturalnews.com/024246_cancer_the... ) .
The very best doctors who can really cure cancer have been either thrown in prison or run out of the country ( which is why all the best cancer clinics in the world are n't located in the United States ) .
The medical industrial complex , in other words , has conspired to keep the American people uninformed and diseased , making them dependent on the for - profit medical system that dominates modern medicine .
That Farrah Fawcett actually made a conscious decision to allow her body to be destroyed by chemotherapy is an indication of just how insidious and manipulative our conventional medical system really is .
Instead of giving patients options , it limits their options and gives them death .
Instead of educating patients about how to prevent and reverse cancer , our medical system de-educates patients and seeks to isolate them from knowledge of natural remedies .
Instead of , it seeks to .
It is a failed system that kills celebrities just as mercilessly as it kills those who are n't famous at all .
And unless we change our approach to healing cancer , more people will continue to die as victims of dangerous prescription drugs and failed chemotherapy " treatments .
" Because whether you 're famous or not , chemotherapy is still poison .

The so called " Paranormal " does not exist in the first place --- EVERYTHING is " NORMAL " , it 's just that our Science is incomplete and we are bound to occasionally encounter natural phenomena that are not yet in our Science books .
----
And simply ATTRIBUTE it to the " Paranormal " , a habit dating back to the old times when our Science , if it existed at all was even MORE incomplete .
It almost seemed that there were TWO incompatible Realities operating at once --- One that followed our chain of logic science and observation and one that did not .
the latter likely involving stuff farther on down the logic chain , we had not worked out yet --- but thought of as being DIFFERENT and called " Supernatural " or " Paranormal " .
The observer effect has been established and is more remarkable and stranger than most people know .
We also have other effects involving TIME and SPACE that would darn well look " Paranormal " to most all observers if encountered .--- Remember some of the greatest scientists predicted the various effects --- and , if correct , they would EXACTLY look like what we have been traditionally calling " Paranormal " for centuries .---- Before there was " Physics " .
SO they already come with " Supernatural " Traditions .
I say that so called " ghosts " and other " paranormal " observations are simply manifestations of more advanced Physics , likely already predicted by modern scientists , that have been observed for millennia and have gathered a superstitious " aura " around them ----- So they are rejected by most Scientists on those grounds alone and not looked at for what they actually are --- as what is EXPECTED to be seen if certain Physics theories are correct .
The observer effect appears to be explained by a more radical theory called HUT ( Holographic Universe Theory ) , where among other remarkable things that explain Quantum Entanglement , etc. is that " CONCIOUSNESS " itself is an active part of the universe .
The brain creating the illusion of a 3D universe from a 2D " higher reality " where space as relative position and distances between particles do not really exist .
This set up opens the door to such things as the observer effect , as the consciousness of the observer is actually interacting with the universe .--- And that is just for the observer effect , who knows what else may be going in ?--- Lots of room for so called " paranormal " looking stuff to occur here .---- in addition to already predicted Physics stuff .
Four nonprofit groups devoted to investigative journalism will have their work distributed by The Associated Press , The A.P. will announce on Saturday , greatly expanding their potential audience and helping newspapers fill the gap left by their own shrinking resources .
Starting on July 1 , the A.P. will deliver work by the Center for Public Integrity , the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University , the Center for Investigative Reporting , and ProPublica to the 1,500 American newspapers that are A.P. members , which will be free to publish the material .
The A.P. called the arrangement a six - month experiment that could later be broadened to include other investigative nonprofits , and to serve its nonmember clients , which include broadcast and Internet outlets .
“ It ’s something we ’ve talked about for a long time , since part of our mission is to enable our members to share material with each other , ” said Sue Cross , a senior vice president of The A.P .
She said the development in 2006 of an Internet - based system for members to receive A.P. material made it easier to do that kind of sharing , and to offer new products like the investigative service .

There ’s a popular medical thriller novel in which a global pandemic is intentionally set off by an evil plot designed to reduce the human population .
In the book , a nefarious drug company inserts live avian flu viruses into vaccine materials that are distributed to countries around the world to be injected into patients as " flu shots . "
Those patients then become carriers for these highly - virulent strains of avian flu which go on to infect the world population and cause widespread death .
One of the major global pharmaceutical players seems to have lost control over a virus which is considered by many virologists to be one of the components leading some day to a new pandemic .
There ’s only one problem with this story :
It ’s not fiction .
Or , at least , the part about live avian flu viruses being inserted into vaccine materials is n’t fiction .
It ’s happening right now .
Deerfield , Illinois - based pharmaceutical company Baxter International Inc. has just been caught shipping live avian flu viruses mixed with vaccine material to medical distributors in 18 countries .
The " mistake " ( if you can call it that , see below … ) was discovered by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada .
The World Health Organization was alerted and panic spread throughout the vaccine community as health experts asked the obvious question :
How could this have happened ?
As published on LifeGen.de ( http://www.lifegen.de/newsip/showne…), serious questions like this are being raised :
" Baxter International Inc. in Austria ‘ unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in 3 neighbouring countries , raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease ’ .
Austria , Germany , Slowenia and the Czech Republic – these are the countries in which labs were hit with dangerous viruses .
Not by bioterrorist commandos , but by Baxter .
In other words :
One of the major global pharmaceutical players seems to have lost control over a virus which is considered by many virologists to be one of the components leading some day to a new pandemic . "
Or , put another way , Baxter is acting a whole lot like a biological terrorism organization these days , sending deadly viral samples around the world .
If you mail an envelope full of anthrax to your Senator , you get arrested as a terrorist .
So why is Baxter — which mailed samples of a far more deadly viral strain to labs around the world — getting away with saying , essentially , " Oops ? "
[ efoods ]
But there ’s a bigger question in all this :
How could this company have accidentally mixed LIVE avian flu viruses ( both H5N1 and H3N2 , the human form ) in this vaccine material ?
Was the viral contamination intentional ?
The shocking answer is that this could n’t have been an accident .
Why ?

Our present century may not be quite as perilous for the human race as an ice age in the aftermath of a super - volcano eruption , but the next few decades will pose enormous hurdles that go beyond the climate crisis .
The end of the fossil - fuel era , the fragility of the global food web , growing population density , and the spread of pandemics , as well as the emergence of radically transformative bio- and nano­technologies — each of these threatens us with broad disruption or even devastation .
And as good as our brains have become at planning ahead , we ’re still biased toward looking for near - term , simple threats .
Subtle , long - term risks , particularly those involving complex , global processes , remain devilishly hard for us to manage .
But here ’s an optimistic scenario for you : if the next several decades are as bad as some of us fear they could be , we can respond , and survive , the way our species has done time and again : by getting smarter .
But this time , we do n’t have to rely solely on natural evolutionary processes to boost our intelligence .
We can do it ourselves .
Most people do n’t realize that this process is already under way .
In fact , it ’s happening all around us , across the full spectrum of how we understand intelligence .
It ’s visible in the hive mind of the Internet , in the powerful tools for simulation and visualization that are jump - starting new scientific disciplines , and in the development of drugs that some people ( myself included ) have discovered let them study harder , focus better , and stay awake longer with full clarity .
So far , these augmentations have largely been outside of our bodies , but they ’re very much part of who we are today : they ’re physically separate from us , but we and they are becoming cognitively inseparable .
And advances over the next few decades , driven by breakthroughs in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence , will make today ’s technologies seem primitive .
The nascent jargon of the field describes this as “ intelligence augmentation . ”
I prefer to think of it as “ You + . ”
Scientists refer to the 12,000 years or so since the last ice age as the Holocene epoch .
It encompasses the rise of human civilization and our co-evolution with tools and technologies that allow us to grapple with our physical environment .
But if intelligence augmentation has the kind of impact I expect , we may soon have to start thinking of ourselves as living in an entirely new era .
The focus of our technological evolution would be less on how we manage and adapt to our physical world , and more on how we manage and adapt to the immense amount of knowledge we ’ve created .
We can call it the Nöocene epoch , from Pierre Teilhard de Chardin ’s concept of the Nöosphere , a collective consciousness created by the deepening interaction of human minds .
As that epoch draws closer , the world is becoming a very different place .
A diamond ring is seen at a bridal show in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - A New Zealand man , spurned by the woman of his dreams , has come up with a novel way of disposing of the diamond engagement ring he bought her -- a treasure hunt .
Anyone keen to pick up the ring , valued at NZ$ 5,000 ( $ 3,268 ) , will need to be in New Zealand ’s capital city , Wellington , on Saturday to join the hunt , the Dominion Post newspaper reported .
“ I met this girl I thought was pretty cool , bought a ring , turns out she was n’t as keen , ” Anthony Gardiner , a 29 - year - old call - center worker , told the Dominion Post .
Clues to the ring ’s whereabouts will start being posted on social networking site Twitter ( http:/twitter.com/donoogle_com ) at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday ( 2000 GMT on Friday ) .
Gardiner says he will keep posting clues , and if the ring is not found by the end of the day , “ my clues will suddenly change into directions . ”
Having bought the ring in Hong Kong , he could n’t return it , and did n’t want to sell it , so he hit upon the treasure hunt .
Hanging on to it in the hopes of finding a willing recipient is also not an option .
“ Obviously , it ’s been a pretty unlucky ring for me , ” Gardiner said , adding he hoped it would be found by somebody who has “ found a cool chick and who wants to give them something they normally would n’t be able to afford . ”

A makeshift memorial for Flight 93 was created within days Just after ten o'clock in the morning on 11 September , 2001 people living in the rural communities of Shanksville , Indian Lake and Lambertsville Pennsylvania , heard the thump of an explosion , loud enough to rattle windows .
Looking to where the sound came from , they saw an enormous ball of black smoke and flame , rising over the rolling open fields and woodland where United Flight 93 had just hurtled straight into the ground .
So great was the impact that the aircraft , a Boeing 757 with 44 people on board , completely disintegrated .
Debris was scattered over a radius of several kilometres , but there were few pieces more than a metre in size , according to those who got to the site first .
The plane was just 20 minutes flying time from Washington DC and American officials now believe its intended target was probably the White House .
An even greater disaster was prevented because the passengers decided to fight back .
When the four hijackers took over , passengers used mobile phones to raise the alarm and call loved ones .
They also planned to take on the hijackers themselves .
One , Todd Beamer from New Jersey was heard to say : " Are you guys ready ?
Let 's roll ! "
Drawing the memories and transcripts of those calls together the 9/11 Commission concluded that it was the passengers ' efforts to regain control of the plane , that forced the four hijackers to cut their mission short .
Memorial obstacles
The heroism on board Flight 93 has become an iconic part of the whole terrible story of that day .
It has been the basis for a major film , books and internet memorials .
If you drive into the open country near Somerset in south - western Pennsylvania , a cobweb of roads eventually brings you to a makeshift temporary memorial a few hundred metres from the crash site .
There are a row of flags and a section of tall metal fencing bedecked with flowers , toys , flags and plaques left by well - wishers .
Passengers like Todd are credited with saving lives on the ground
It has the temporary feel of something heart - felt , but erected hastily in the immediate aftermath of the event .
Building a permanent memorial at the site has proved problematic .
Congress authorised the National Park Service ( NPS ) to go ahead with a memorial in March 2002 and teamed up with a group representing victims ' families to work with the network of people who own the land involved .
Deals were done to acquire about 80 % of the land required , but negotiations with seven landowners proved unsuccessful .
Legal process
So now the Park Service says it is resorting to an unusual move to force the landowners to sell .
It has announced plans to condemn the land and have a judge fix a sale price for the NPS to buy it .
The landowners range from a quarry company - Svonavec - to a man whose grandfather bought several hectares in the 1930s .
Another family operates a scrap metal company nearby , which would have to be moved .
They are unhappy about the announcement and some say the park service had not entered into formal negotiations with them before the announcement was made .
It will take some time for the legal process to be completed , but it appears that this move by the NPS will now bring this awkward chapter in the aftermath of 9/11 to a close .
Plans for the memorial on the Park Service website show a wide open space , covering almost 900 hectares .
The flight path will be paved in black granite , the names of those killed by the hijackers carved into 40 polished white granite slabs , lining a walkway .
Beyond a bronze ceremonial gate , the impact site will be planted with wildflowers .

A broad series of changes at Starbucks Corp. , from instant coffee to new menu boards that leave off drink prices , show how the company is adjusting its upscale formula to the economic downturn .
Investors hope to learn Wednesday whether the moves are working , when Starbucks conducts its annual meeting in Seattle .
Shares of Starbucks have fallen about 38 % in the past year to close at $ 10.78 on the Nasdaq Stock Market Monday , or about the price of a pound of Starbucks coffee beans .
Unlike past meetings , which have featured surprise performances by singers Tony Bennett and k.d. lang , this year 's gathering is likely to be a more subdued affair .
Instead , executives are expected to outline a plan to weather the recession that includes an effort to make Starbucks products seem more affordable , and reassure investors that the company is on track to cut $ 500 million of costs by the fall .
After years of broadening its customer base and making forays into entertainment , Starbucks has made its top priority retaining its existing patrons .
" The issue at hand ... is the cost of losing your core customer , " Howard Schultz , the company 's chief executive , said in an interview earlier this month .
" It 's very hard to get them back . "
Analysts say that Starbucks has seen the most pronounced drops in customers during afternoons and weekends , and that the company 's Frappuccino drinks have been particularly hard hit .
In the past month , Starbucks has entered the instant - coffee market with a version called Via that the company bills as offering a cup of Starbucks coffee for less than $ 1 .
It also has introduced pairings of breakfast sandwiches and drinks priced at $ 3.95 , or about $ 1 less than when bought individually .
" Finally ! " I hear you say .
And you are right .
Because of time - constraints and my wish to include much more than is essential for this tool I delayed and delayed and delayed the public release of wiipresent .
But now I convinced myself to be happy about it :-)
At least my TODO list is nicely formatted and complete .
And in itself the tool already works very nice .
The fact that ct magazine already mentioned wiipresent in their April edition was another motivation to release what works already .
So let me introduce to you : wiipresent v0.7.2 , an off - the - shelf tool to use your wiimote for giving presentations on Linux ( or control your Linux remotely ) .
Currently wiipresent can do the following things :
only requires a bluetooth receiver for communication
rumbles to indicate how much time you have left for your presentation
leds indicate how much time has passed / is left for your presentation
has keymaps for tens of presentation applications ( evince , xpdf , openoffice , acrobat reader , ...)
also has keymaps for many other applications ( multimedia , terminal , browser , ...)
can be used to control your mouse pointer ( to start an application , copy files , shutdown , ... )
easy to use buttons for common operations like : switching workspace , switching applications , ...
There are quite a few compelling reasons for using a Wiimote for giving presentations :
the same features as most of the advanced presentation devices
is much cheaper ( 40 EUR ) than those advanced presentation devices ( >80 EUR )
has an open and documented interface where some advanced devices do not work in Linux
uses bluetooth which is common on laptops nowadays , but small USB bluetooth receivers are quite cheap ( 10 EUR )
works very reliably even in a big exhibition hall ( LinuxTag 2008 ) with thousands of people and booths with as many bluetooth devices .
We even left the exhbition room and we were still able to control our laptop at the CentOS booth ( witness references on request :-) )
fancy silicon covers exist in various colors matching your outfit are available from Ebay
at least one person attributes finding a girlfriend by using the wiimote in a public area ( name witheld because of privacy concerns )
they come with a wrist - cord ( and anti-slip coating ) for vivid , animated presenters using lots of gestures
So get it from :
http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/wiipresent/
or look at the wiimote presentation Geerd - Dietger and I did at FrOSCon
Enjoy !
( CNN ) --
For fans of The Beatles , 09/09/09 will mark a new invasion .
The Fab Four will be made even more so when the remastered Beatles catalogue is released in September .
Apple Corps Ltd. and EMI Music have announced that as the date for the release of the entire original Beatles catalogue , digitally remastered .
That includes all 12 Beatles albums in stereo , with track listings and artwork as originally released in the UK .
The package will also contain the LP version of " Magical Mystery Tour " ( initially released as a double - EP in Britain , though available on CD since 1987 ) and the collections " Past Masters Vol .
I and II " combined as one title .
The release marks the first time that the first four Beatles albums are being made available in their entirety on compact disc , and it also coincides with the release of " The Beatles : Rock Band " video game .
Robert Levine , executive editor for Billboard , said the timing is genius in terms of marketing .
" Most bands , when they do a big project like this they pay for publicity , " Levine said .
" The Beatles got paid for ' Rock Band ' and then they are using that for publicity to rerelease a catalogue .
It 's pretty amazing . "
Blog : A Beatles fan reflects on the news
Levine pointed out that media have evolved tremendously since 1964 , when the band first burst onto the American scene with an appearance on " The Ed Sullivan Show . "
Back then , there were only three major television networks , and engineering of albums was much less sophisticated , Levine noted .
Previous rereleases have sold well in the past -- indeed , Beatles albums have sold steadily for decades -- and Levine said he expects this one to do even better .
" I think if you were to look at pure catalogue , old bands selling old albums , the Beatles are the kings -- commercially as well as artistically , " Levine said .
" A lot of [ music ] has been remastered better in the past 22 years , and remastering technology has come a long way . "
Piers Hemmingsen , the author of two books on Beatles music and head of the Web site Capitol6000.com , said there has long been a clamor among fans for good , high - quality versions of Beatles songs .
" The technology that was available back then was very limited , and with the newer technology they are able to do far more with what they have than they have ever been able to do before , " he said .
" For people who are plugged into iPods and the whole digital music scene , it 's going to be a lot better for them . "
In acknowledgment of the more technologically advanced listeners , each CD will contain , for a limited time , an embedded brief documentary film about the album .
The documentaries contain archival footage , rare photographs and never - before - released studio chat from the Beatles .
The remastering project was four years in the making .
Engineers used de-noising technology and cleaned up glitches like electrical clicks and microphone vocal pops , so long as it did n't affect the original integrity of the songs .
They also slightly boosted the volume levels .
Andrew Croft , publisher of Beatlology Magazine , said the announcement of the release of the remastered recordings " is long overdue in the Beatles community and for music fans alike . "
He also said the quest to improve the original recordings is not new .
Croft said bootleg releases over the years used rare and obscure vinyl pressings from countries like Japan and Germany to compile the best of the best recordings of The Beatles songs , presenting to the public a better sound that Apple could not offer prior to the remastering .
" While the new remasterings will replace a library full of bootlegs of their commercial releases , there remains a massive market for their more obscure tracks , outtakes and live performances , " Croft said .
The 14 remastered albums , along with a DVD collection of the documentaries , will also be available for purchase together in a stereo boxed set .
A second boxed set , " The Beatles in Mono , " includes all of the Beatles recordings that were mixed for a mono release .
It will contain 10 of the albums with their original mono mixes , plus two additional discs of mono masters ( covering similar ground to the stereo tracks on " Past Masters " ) .
The mono " Help ! " and " Rubber Soul " discs also include the original 1965 stereo mixes , which have not been previously released on CD .
These albums will be packaged in mini-vinyl CD replicas of the original sleeves with all of the original inserts and label designs .
Even with the release date , what is old has become new .
Diehard Beatle - ologists may take note that the release date could be viewed as a nod to the Beatles track " One After 909 " from the " Let It Be " album -- or a reference to the White Album 's " Revolution 9 . " ( John Lennon , who was born on October 9 , occasionally talked about his fondness for the number 9 . )
Hemmingsen said making the music more accessible and attractive to a younger audience helps spread Beatlemania to a new generation .
" Their music is catchy , memorable , interesting and listenable , " said Hemmingsen , who was a youngster in England when the Beatles hit the scene and has been a fan ever since .
" The time that they evolved their music was an interesting time and their music reflected that time . "
Levine said the band has always captured fans from across generations .
" The songs have lasted for a long time because they are great songs , " he said .
" It 's just that simple .
Those are amazing , amazing albums . "

Earth
Day is n't for nearly a month , but tonight you 've got an opportunity to help the environment by doing something very simple : turn off all the non-essential lights and appliances in your home for an hour , starting at 8:30 pm local time .
Earth Hour began in Australia two years ago , and has since spread across the world , organized by the World Wildlife Fund .
My family participated last year , using candles and a wind - up flashlight to provide illumination while the four of us played games at the dining room table .
I suspect it has a lot to do with the games , but my kids are really excited about doing it again .
If you 've got kids , get them involved — explain to them about global warming , and why millions of people turning off lights and electrical appliances for an hour really does help the environment .
That , of course , is in addition to the primary goal of sending the message that sustainability is vital to the health of the planet .
I know it 's tough for us geek families to turn off the computer for a whole waking hour , but if mine can do it , so can just about anyone's .
Please leave comments with your suggestions ( family - friendly , please ) about what do with the TV - less and computer - less hour .
— Disgraced financiers like Bernard Madoff attract the headlines , but investment schemes happen everywhere , according to North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall .
The Securities Division in Marshall 's office is investigating 10 such pyramid schemes , and she said the sour economy is helping expose them .
" What we are seeing now in these incredibly difficult times ( is ) people are wanting their nest egg and they are wanting it out , " she said .
Pyramid schemes , which are also known as Ponzi schemes , rely on a steady flow of investors that allow those in charge to use new money to pay interest checks to older investors and keep them satisfied .
Meanwhile , the people running the scheme skim money off all investments to finance their own lavish lifestyle .
" The only way investors get paid is if new investors are putting their money in , " Marshall said .
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently sued a Raleigh man who operates a bank on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent .
The SEC alleges that William Wise and others used Millennium Bank as a front for a Ponzi scheme that cost hundreds of investors more than $ 68 million .
No criminal charges have been filed in the case , but a federal judge has frozen Wise 's assets , including all property in his million - dollar west Raleigh home , and turned them over to a receiver to be auctioned off to repay investors .
Wise has n't returned phone calls seeking comment .
Authorities say his whereabouts are unknown , but sources close to the investigation have told WRAL News the Canadian native has returned to that country .
While Madoff and Wise are accused of duping investors for many millions , smaller operations also cost people plenty of money .
Patricia Jacoby pleaded guilty last year to fraud for running an investment scheme out of an antiques store in Raleigh 's Five Points neighborhood .
" She played the part .
She looked like she was real , " said Nicholas Stratas , an attorney for two of Jacoby 's victims .
Stratas said his clients recovered some money when Jacoby pleaded guilty , but he said most victims are n't so lucky .
" ( For ) the majority of people , there are not enough assets left , and most get pennies on the dollar , if anything , " he said .
Marshall said people should investigate claims of guaranteed returns before investing .
Anyone with questions or suspicions about securities investments should call the toll - free hotline in her office , 800-688-4507 , she said .

Warnings have been issued about Somali pirates extending their reach A cargo vessel has been hijacked by suspected Somali pirates off the coast of Oman - the first such attack in the area , Nato says .
MV Charelle , under the Antigua and Barbuda flag , was attacked 60 nautical miles south of Sur on the Omani coast .
It was the " first case of armed robbery outside the [ pirates ' ] normal operations area , " Lt Cmdr Alexandre Fernandes told Reuters news agency .
The vessel is now thought to be heading towards Somalia .
Lt Cmdr Fernandes , on board a Portuguese anti-piracy patrol near the Gulf of Aden , said the pirates were " probably looking for other areas of operations where there are less patrols by warships " .
See map of how piracy is affecting the region and countries around the world
There was no information about the number of crew or their nationalities .
This week , the US Navy warned that Somali pirates were expanding their range of operations far beyond the East African coast .
One attack has been confirmed on a ship as far north as the Red Sea .
The gangs have also extended their raids down beyond the Seychelles .
The pirates were able to strike further away from the coast with the help of bigger mother ships , said the US Navy .
Somalia has been without a stable government since 1991 , allowing piracy to flourish .
More than 30,000 vessels annually transit the pirate - plagued Gulf of Aden and the busy shipping lane has offered rich pickings for raiders .
The gangs are currently holding 14 ships and more than 200 seamen in the region .
When first loaded , the map 's focus falls on Somalia where most of the pirates are based .

What is SRP ?
Many password authentication solutions claim to solve this exact problem , and new ones are constantly being proposed .
Although one can claim security by devising a protocol that avoids sending the plaintext password unencrypted , it is much more difficult to devise a protocol that remains secure when :
Attackers have complete knowledge of the protocol .
Attackers have access to a large dictionary of commonly used passwords .
Attackers can eavesdrop on all communications between client and server .
Attackers can intercept , modify , and forge arbitrary messages between client and server .
A mutually trusted third party is not available .
SRP is available to commercial and non-commercial users under a royalty - free license .
The Internet played a significant role in SRP 's early development ; without it , SRP would not have received anywhere near the amount of analysis and feedback that it has gotten since it was first proposed and refined .
It is thus fitting that the Internet at large can benefit from the fruits of this endeavor .
Since SRP is specifically designed to work around existing patents in the area , it gives everybody access to strong , unencumbered password authentication technology that can be put to a wide variety of uses .
The SRP distribution is available under Open Source - friendly licensing terms ( for the net . savvy reader , it 's a " BSD - style " license ) .
More information about the SRP project is available at this site , and a reference implementation , which includes versions of Telnet and FTP that incorporate SRP support , can be downloaded as well .
The links page has pointers to a wide range of projects and products , both commercial and non-commercial , that use SRP , as well as related work and papers that cover strong password authentication .
We are on the edge of one of those periods of history when the gimbals on which the established order is mounted shift and a new world order begins to emerge .
And these are , almost always , the most frightening and turbulent of times .
This recession will be different .
This time , we will not plummet down and then bounce back comfortably to where we were before it all started .
This is about something much deeper .
The tectonic plates of power , in this case economic power , are shifting and when it is over we in the Western nations will , relatively speaking , be weaker and those in the Eastern nations will be relatively stronger .
The last time we saw a shift of power on this scale was when the leadership of the world passed across the Atlantic from the old powers of Europe to the new emerging power of the United States in the last century .
And we all remember what followed that collapse of empires and the emergence of a new order .
Only then , though power shifted , the values did n't .
This time , we will experience not just a change of order , but a change of values too .
It is important , here to be clear exactly what is happening and what is not .
I am not saying that the rise of nations like China and India will be smooth or comfortable for them either .
In China in particular there is likely to be considerable turbulence as , having largely freed their economy and now have to try to free their society .
And Beijing is frightened by that – and they have every reason to be so .
Chinese history is littered with instances when this great nation , as disparate and ethnically diverse as Europe , stands at the edge of greatness and then descends into dissolution and chaos .
But , though this may alter the time scale and manner of China 's rise it will not alter their ultimate destination as one of the world 's great powers .
Some , especially among my more leftwing friends tell me , often with ill - disguised glee , that we are seeing the beginning of the end of American power in the world .
I do not believe that either .
The symptoms of decline in nations , as in humans are scleroticism , institutional arthritis and resistance to change .
And the United States shows none of these — as the still remarkable election of Barrack Obama very clearly shows .
Indeed it seems to me very probable that the United States will still be the world 's most powerful nation for one or two decades yet , which , in practical terms is as far ahead as it is reasonable to make predictions .
But , though the position of the United States as the world 's pre-eminent power , is not likely to change , the context in which she holds that position is now certain to .
We are no longer looking , as we have for more than the last half century , at a world dominated by single super power .
The globe is no longer going to be mono - polar in the way it has been for most of the life times of most of the people in this room .
The growth of new power centres means the emergence of a much more multi polar world – a world which will look much more like Europe in the nineteenth century .
And this will have a number of rather important consequences .
One will be a rise in regional groupings – of which history may say the EU was the first , albeit highly imperfect example .
Second and linked will be an increase in protectionism and probably a reversal of the movement towards free trade of the last half century – with all implications that carries for a destructive period of beggar my neighbour economic policies .
The third implication of this emerging pattern of world power , is for Europe .
In a much more multi sided world , the eyes of the US are likely to be at least as much , west across the Pacific , as east across the Atlantic .
The Atlantic relationship will remain a key relationship but it will no longer be the lynch pin for all other policies , as it has been over the last half century .
The US security guarantee , under which we have all sheltered since the second world war and which has enabled many of our European neighbours to take a free ride on Uncle Sam for their national security , no longer exists .
Such United States soldiers as are left in Europe , are here , not for our defence , but to support their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
My guess is that Europe will be less important to every future US president , including Barack Hussein Obama , than we have been to every past one , including George W Bush .
Indeed I suspect that , having loved to hate him , we Europeans may well find ourselves missing George Bush before too long .
George Bush may well turn out to be the last US president to have had an emotional tie to Europe .
In future we are likely to be judged by Washington , not on the basis of history , but according to a rather cool , even brutal appraisal of what we can deliver when it comes to pursuing our joint interests – and here the answer is not much , if Afghanistan is anything to go by .
The United States is increasingly going to have interests in the world which do not always coincide with those of Europe .
And we are going to have interests in the world which do not always coincide with theirs .
What this means that we Europeans are going to need in the future , to have a rather more subtle and sophisticated foreign policy than hanging on to the apron strings of our neighbourhood friend , the world 's only super power .
But that 's not the end of the story .
We , Europe , are losing the US as our protector of last resort and friend for all circumstances at a most difficult time .
We now have an increasingly assertive Russia , prepared to use the lever of energy , skilful at dividing and ruling , asserting the old Brezhnev doctrine of spheres of interest and backing it with force if they need to .
And we have a rising China .
And increasing economic power in the East .
If we do not realise that the right reaction of Europe to these new circumstances , is to deepen the integration of our institutions , especially when it comes to defence , foreign affairs and economic policy , then we are fools and the next few decades are going to be much more painful .
I know this does not run with the mood of the times only a week or so from European elections .
But the hard choice for us Europeans is nevertheless this ; to be safer together ; or to be poorer apart .
Arguably most important consequence of this new shape to world power is equally dramatic ; we are reaching the beginning of the end of the perhaps five century long period of the hegemony of western power , western institutions and western values over world affairs .
We are soon going to discover – no , we are already discovering — that , if we want to get things done , such as re-designing the world economic order , or intervening for peace , we cannot any longer just do them within the cosy Atlantic club ; we are going to have to find new allies in places we would never previously have thought of .
And they will be less congenial and have demands of their own .
The recent global financial crisis has made it very plain .
If we want a more ordered world at a time of great instability , we are going to have to provide a space at the top tables for nations that do not share our culture , our history , our world view or even our values .
This is an extract of Paddy Ashdown 's speech given at the 2009 Guardian Hay festival
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian demonstrators called for more mass protests on Tuesday , a day after hardline Islamic militiamen killed a man during a march by tens of thousands against a presidential election they say was rigged .
The Iranian capital has already seen three days of the biggest and most violent anti-government protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution after hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared winner of last Friday ’s vote .
“ Tomorrow at 5 p.m. ( 8:30 a.m. EDT ) at Vali-ye Asr Square , ” some of the crowd chanted at Monday ’s march , referring to a major road junction in the sprawling city of some 12 million .
Further protests , especially if they are maintained on the same scale , would be a direct challenge to authorities who have kept a tight grip on dissent since the overthrow of the U.S. - backed shah after months of demonstrations 30 years ago .
U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday he was “ deeply troubled ” by post-election violence in Iran .
“ The democratic process , free speech , the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected , ” he told reporters .
The United States and its European allies have been trying to engage Iran and induce the world ’s fifth - biggest oil exporter to halt nuclear work that could be used to make an atomic bomb .
Iran says it only wants nuclear energy to generate electricity .
Obama said he would continue pursuing tough , direct dialogue with Tehran but urged that any Iranian investigation of election irregularities be conducted without bloodshed .
The world was inspired by the Iranian protesters , he said .
“ WE FIGHT , WE DIE ”

Demonstrators filled a broad avenue in central Tehran for several kilometers ( miles ) on Monday , chanting “ We fight , we die , we will not accept this vote rigging , ” in support of Mirhossein Mousavi , the defeated moderate candidate .
Mousavi said he was “ ready to pay any price ” in his fight against election irregularities , his Web site quoted him as saying , indicating a determination to keep up the pressure for the election result to be annulled .
Slideshow ( 20 images )
Some formed a human chain in front of a building of the Basij Islamic militia , but others broke through and the hardline volunteer paramilitaries opened fire on the crowds sending thousands fleeing in havoc .
One man was killed and many wounded , said an Iranian photographer who witnessed the shooting .
Television footage showed one man , his leg covered with blood , being bundled onto the back of a taxi and driven away .
“ Tanks and guns have no use any longer , ” chanted the protesters in a deliberate echo of slogans used leading up to the 1979 revolution .
Members of Iran ’s security forces have at times fired into the air during the unrest and used batons to beat protesters who have pelted police with stones .
The Basij militia is a volunteer paramilitary force fiercely loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say on all matters of state in Iran .
Gunfire was also heard in three districts of wealthy northern Tehran on Monday evening and residents said there had also been peaceful pro-Mousavi demonstrations in the cities of Rasht , Orumiyeh , Zahedan , and Tabriz on Monday .
If you 're looking to get more context for what 's happening right now in Iran , let me direct you to two pieces of media .
First , you 'll find above a talk by Abbas Milani , the director of the Iranian Studies Program at Stanford University .
It was given last August at Google 's HQ in Mountain View , CA , and it overviews how power is structured in Iran and what drives President Ahmadinejad and the ruling clerics .
Then , about 15 minutes into the talk , Milani addresses the presidential election and underscores Ahmadinejad 's declining popularity and poor electoral chances .
Milani also reflects on the emerging democratic movement and its ability to get traction .
As you 'll see , many of his comments ( democracy will come on its own -- if we do n't start a war over nukes ) are starting to look rather prophetic .
But let 's not get too far ahead of ourselves .
Next , you can listen to a talk recorded this morning , which brings together Milani , Juan Cole ( the historian of the Middle East who writes the Informed Comment blog ) and Scott Peterson ( Istanbul bureau chief for The Christian Science Monitor ) .
This hour long conversation ( MP3 - iTunes ) delves into the election and its aftermath and examines what 's at stake for Iran , the Middle East and the US .

Before the telegraph , there was the optical telegraph , a chain of towers topped by large pivoting cross members , and spaced as far apart as the eye could see .
Developed by the Frenchman Claude Chappe at the end of the 18th century , optical telegraph lines once stretched from Paris out to Dunkirk and Strasbourg , and were in service for more than half a century :
Chappe created a language of 9,999 words , each represented by a different position of the swinging arms .
When operated by well - trained optical telegraphers , the system was extraordinarily quick .
Messages could be transmitted up to 150 miles in two minutes .
Several optical telegraph relay stations are still around , including one in Saverne , France that was renovated in 1998 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As Republicans wrangle over the ideological direction of the party , a new generation of conservatives is reaching out to GOP activists and honing the use of a 21st century megaphone to promote Republican policy goals through new media networking tools .
Patrick Ruffini , left , and David All are on the cutting edge of an evolving medium to connect with supporters .
Republicans received a wake - up call in 2008 after President Obama raised a historic sum of campaign cash and organized supporters like never before by mastering the power of the Internet .
Within days of losing the White House and additional seats in the House and Senate , prominent blogger and new media consultant Patrick Ruffini unveiled a Web site dedicated to helping restore the GOP to power .
The No. 1 priority listed on www.rebuildtheparty.com: " Winning the technology war with the Democrats . "
" We kind of took a step back and said , ' Look , we 're going to have a long debate over a number of years over where this party should go , where we should stand ideologically , ' " Ruffini said .
" But here 's some basic steps that we can take now to re-engage our grassroots base and to rebuild our party infrastructure and to recruit new leaders so that when we have that ... unifying purpose ... we will be ready to go . "

The challenge for liberal bloggers
Politicians no longer have to rely solely on the traditional media such as newspapers and TV to report on their activities .
Politicians are increasingly using social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with political supporters and constituents .
Last month , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele convened a " Tech Summit " in Washington with a goal of " advancing the GOP 's technology efforts . "
It is one of the many challenges facing Steele , who is charged with drafting and executing a plan to rebuild the party .
All said that Steele 's decision to hold the summit was a " clear sign " the new chairman understands technology is vital to a winning strategy .
" What that really did was for the first time kick open the doors to people like Patrick and myself and citizens throughout the country , " All said .

JERSEY CITY , New Jersey ( CNN ) -- Alfa Demmellash grew up on less than a dollar a day , and against the backdrop of torture and murder .
But these days she 's living the American dream and helping others do the same .
Alfa Demmellash helps low - income entrepreneurs in New Jersey start or grow their businesses .
" Entrepreneurs are at the very heart of what the American dream is all about , " says Demmellash , a native of Ethiopia .
And from her small office in Jersey City , her nonprofit , Rising Tide Capital , is helping small businesses flourish .
Robin Munn , who runs a flower shop in Jersey City , says the skills she learned through Demmellash helped her transform the way she operates her business .
" I was thinking about closing , but once I started taking the classes I found that the fire came back . "
Kim Bratten , a 39 - year - old painter and mother of six , says she 's seen her yearly income increase by 50 percent since she started working with Demmellash and her team .
" They put hope back into the community , " Bratten says .

Demmellash 's own struggle began in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , amid instability and unrest .
Thousands of Ethiopians -- including her aunt -- disappeared or were tortured and / or killed under the ruling military regime .
When Demmellash was 2 , her mother fled the country , leaving the toddler in the care of her grandmother and aunt .
Demmellash lived on less than a dollar a day but never considered herself poor .

Nearly a decade later , Demmellash and her mother reunited in Boston , Massachusetts .
But Demmellash found her mother was n't living the American dream she 'd envisioned .
" I [ thought ]
I would find my mom in a beautiful mansion with trees [ and ] gold everywhere , " recalls Demmellash , now 29 .
" I was shocked when I found her in her tiny apartment ... working very , very hard . "
Her mother had worked as a waitress during the day and a seamstress at night to earn money to bring her daughter to the United States .
Watching her mother sew beautiful gowns for low profits , Demmellash thought there had to be a way for her to increase what she was making as a seamstress .
" Even though she had the skills , she did not necessarily have the business skills , " she says , adding that her mother 's pricing " was completely off . "
Still , her mother worked tirelessly to keep her daughter adequately fed , clothed and in school .
Demmellash was later admitted to Harvard University , which she was able to attend with the help of " wonderful financial aid . "
At Harvard , Demmellash and classmate Alex Forrester discussed what their generation could do to alleviate poverty on a local level .
They set out to learn what resources people needed -- or as Demmellash says , " to find people like my mom . "
In 2004 , the pair started Rising Tide Capital ( RTC ) to help those who had ideas and abilities but needed the education and support to launch or grow their businesses .
" You hear a lot of talk about Main Street and Wall Street , but no one really talks about how exactly you go about helping the Mom - and - Pops , " says Demmellash .
The group runs the Community Business Academy , an intensive training session coupled with year - round coaching and mentorship to help individuals " really work on the hands - on management side of their business , " Demmellash says .
The organization supports underserved populations , including women , the formerly incarcerated , minorities , unemployed and working poor , and immigrants and refugees .
Demmellash and Forrester -- now married -- have helped 250 entrepreneurs and small - business owners in New Jersey so far , 70 percent of whom are single mothers .
RTC raises money from corporations and works with local governments for funding in order to provide classes and support its participants at affordable costs .
Participants pay a small materials and registration fee based on their income range : either $ 100 or $ 225 for the course that Demmellash says would cost thousands of dollars otherwise .
The organization has also built partnerships with micro-lenders , so when students are ready , the lenders provide financing .
" The ability to become self - reliant , to have economic hope , [ that is ] the fabric of this country and we have to fight for it , " Demmellash says .
Many of RTC 's students use the increased earnings from their new business to supplement their wages , allowing them to better provide for their families and transform the face of their communities , according to Demmellash .
" There are thousands of entrepreneurs , millions across this country , who do incredible things and make money to put food on the table , to pay their bills , and to save for the future and their children , " she says .
" If we were to literally bank on them , invest in them [ and ] support them ... that 's the kind of stuff that changes lives and strengthens families . "

An unheralded private equity firm in Oklahoma City emerged Wednesday as the only known suitor for General Motor Corp .'s Saturn brand , promising to keep the marque and its dealership network alive .
The firm , Black Oak Partners , said that if it acquires the brand , it would continue to distribute GM - made vehicles through 2011 and would also source vehicles from foreign manufacturers to badge as Saturns .
The move is the first public bid for Saturn or the other two brands GM has put up for sale , Hummer and Saab .
GM has said it needs to sell or shut down those lines to help it cut costs as part of its federally supervised restructuring .
The Detroit automaker , which has received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans , has been given until June 1 to show the Obama administration it is viable as a stand - alone company .

John Pappanastos , a spokesman for Black Oak , said the firm approached GM about Saturn last week and formally notified the Treasury Department of its interest Tuesday night , although the group had been preparing the offer “ for several months . ”
The two sides have not yet discussed a price .
Black Oak is owned by the family of auto dealer Bob Moore .
Bob Moore Auto Group holds 17 new - car franchises , including two Saturn dealerships .
GM spokesman Steve Janisse confirmed the bid .
He said it was one of a “ handful ” of offers the company was considering , but he declined to name the other bidders .
Janisse added that the automaker planned to update dealers late this week or early next week on the status of a Saturn feasibility study the company has been conducting .
Pappanastos , who is also chief executive of EFG Cos. , which is owned by Black Oak and sells insurance and other auto products , said a deal would help GM avoid costs associated with closing Saturn , save thousands of jobs and “ mitigate the potential for substantial local economic impact from Saturn retailer bankruptcies . ”

GM announced in early December that it would stop producing vehicles for Saturn after the 2011 model year and would wind down the brand if it did n’t find a buyer before that time .
It also said it would seek to sell Swedish brand Saab .
Hummer , meanwhile , has been on the block for nearly a year .
GM had been expected to reveal its plans for Hummer in early April , but it delayed the decision by several weeks .
In the first three months of the year , three dozen Saturn dealers closed , leaving GM with 384 dealerships nationwide and roughly 40 in Canada .
Pappanastos said Black
Oak decided to make its interest public in hopes it might dissuade other dealers from quitting the brand .
“ There ’s a huge sense of urgency among these people , ” he said .

Black Oak wanted to acquire Saturn through a new company called Telesto Ventures , which would operate Saturn as a distribution network selling vehicles such as “ clean diesels , electric and high - mileage cars , ” Pappanastos said .
It also plans to import vehicles from manufacturers that currently do not sell in the U.S. , he said , and that could include cars from China or India .
Some industry experts questioned the feasibility of spinning off a brand like Saturn , which no longer has manufacturing facilities dedicated only to making its cars .
“ Saturn is so integrated it ’s hard to imagine selling it off , ” said Jim Hossack of consultancy AutoPacific .
“ I do n’t see how they can make money off this . ”

Pappanastos said he felt that a private Saturn could be profitable at sales levels “ well below ” 250,000 units , although he felt it would not be profitable at only 100,000 units .
Last year , Saturn sold 188,004 vehicles in the U.S .
Because of its unusual structure , including a franchise operating committee that gives dealers a vote on business decisions , unloading Saturn presents distinct challenges to GM .
Rumors of possible bidders have included French automaker Peugeot and a group of dealers that reportedly hoped to acquire the brand rather than face forceable closure .
GM has said that it would continue to back Saturn through 2011 but would halt production of Saturn vehicles thereafter .

Last month , GM said it had retained Stephen Girsky , a former auto analyst for Morgan Stanley , to advise it on selling Saturn .
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
Though Pappanastos said some dealers would also take stakes in acquiring Saturn , some were hesitant to get involved in that aspect of the auto business .
John Bergstrom , owner of 25 dealerships in Wisconsin , said he had declined offers to participate in an attempt to purchase Saturn .
“ I have my hands full with just trying to sell cars , ” said Bergstrom , who on Wednesday closed four of his six Saturn showrooms because of declining sales .
He said he was busy trying to help the 170 laid off employees find jobs .
“ I just do n’t know how good we ’d be at the distribution side of the business . ”

Two British Muslims cleared of helping the 7 July bombers choose their targets were today sentenced to seven years in jail each for planning to attend a terrorist training camp .
Waheed Ali , 25 , and Mohammed Shakil , 32 , were yesterday found not guilty at Kingston crown court of conspiring to cause explosions with the four men who carried out the attacks that killed 52 people in 2005 .
The pair , who were arrested as they were about to board a flight to Pakistan in 2007 , were found guilty of conspiracy to attend a terrorist training camp .
They have already spent two years in jail on remand .
The judge , Mr Justice Gross , told Ali and Shakil they had committed an offence " at a serious level " .
" Your intention , but for your apprehension , was to attend a real camp and to use real guns in training at that camp , " he said .
" This was not play acting and you were determined players , not naive dupes . "
He told the pair they had a " very real prospect of reoffending " .
Gross said the most important factor in his sentencing decision was to deter others attending such camps .
The trial heard that an estimated 1,000 young Muslims from the UK visited training camps in Pakistan between 1998 and 2003 .
The judge said : " It must be made entirely clear , if necessary through sentences of an appropriate length , that such conduct is unacceptable . "
Referring to the acquittal of Ali , Shakil and co-accused Sadeer Saleem , 28 , on the separate charge of conspiracy to cause explosions , Mr Justice Gross said the jury 's decision must be respected .
" Defendants must receive a fair trial and must not be convicted unless the jury has been made sure of their guilt , " he said .
" That is a strength of our system .
By its verdict , the jury in this case indicated the crown had not made it sure the defendants were party to the conspiracy to cause explosions that ended in the July 7 bombings .
That verdict is to be respected . "
The head of Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism command , Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall , said Ali and Shakil shared the same extremist beliefs as the London bombers , with whom they had grown up in Beeston , Leeds .
They were acquitted of carrying out a reconnaissance mission in London with two of the men , Hasib Hussain and Jermaine Lindsay , seven months before the explosions .
They insisted the trip had been an innocent social outing for sightseeing and visiting family , and had nothing to do with the attacks .
During their two - day trip to London in 2004 the three visited the London Eye , the Natural History Museum and the London Aquarium .
The men were retried after an earlier jury failed to reach verdicts .
After eight days of deliberations the jury cleared them unanimously , along with Saleem .
The total cost of the two trials is likely to exceed £ 5 m and the families of the 7 July victims say the verdicts mean no one is likely to ever be brought to justice for the attacks .
They are demanding a full independent inquiry into the atrocity .
Bereaved families and survivors have called on the government to publish a second Intelligence and Security Committee ( ISC ) report into the bombings without delay .
LANSING , Mich . | Lynn Allen was born with severe hemophilia .
In 1978 , Mr. Allen discovered he had been infected with HIV and hepatitis C through a contaminated blood transfusion .
Now in chronic pain , the Williamston , Mich. , man , once a rehabilitation counselor and social worker , is disabled , using a wheelchair to get around .
His medication of choice : medicinal marijuana , which has stimulated his appetite and allowed him to maintain his weight .
He is among the growing number of Michigan residents who have received state approval to use and grow the herb for certain medical conditions under a new law passed resoundingly by Michigan voters in November .
Do n’t call him a pothead , he says .
He smoked weed in college but did n’t use it again for 30 years .
Now he views himself as an informed consumer who has found something that works .
“ There have been people within my own family that did n’t think it was appropriate until they learned more about it , ” says Mr. Allen , 52 .
“ I think that will probably be the case for a lot of people as they learn the benefits it has to offer .
“ There is a lot of bias against marijuana because it is n’t a regulated prescription drug , ” he adds .
“ In my case , we did try other medication , but this has been the most effective for me .
I think it shows a lot of compassion on the part of voters and those who are trying to make the system work so that people like me can benefit from this medicine . ”
As Michigan works out the kinks of a new medical - marijuana law — passed by 63 percent of voters — its future success could serve as the bellwether for other states considering similar legislation .
Thus far , 13 states have passed medicinal - marijuana legislation .
About a dozen more are considering bills that would allow those with serious illnesses like cancer , multiple sclerosis and AIDS to smoke marijuana to alleviate some symptoms , including nausea and loss of appetite .
“ We do believe that Michigan is a precursor for other Midwestern states , ” says Greg Francisco , the executive director of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Association , which is bringing together new users to help educate them and encourage ethical consumption .
“ We think there are other states that are close on our heels , and it ’s only a matter of time , ” he said .
“ In the meantime , we are hearing people are relocating here — they want to live in a compassionate state .
We think this has brought some migration back into Michigan . ”
So far , 2,377 applications for marijuana - user identification cards have been received by the state ’s department of community health .
Of those , 1,903 applicants have been issued registration cards , with 1,412 of those applying as patients and 496 applying as caregivers who can grow and administer the medical pot under state guidelines , said James McCurtis Jr. , Michigan Department of Community Health spokesman .
Just 320 applications have been denied .
Applicants are typically denied because they did not properly fill out the application or they did not include the fee with the application , Mr. McCurtis said .
The state ’s first medical marijuana clinic opened in the Detroit suburb of Southfield on Dec. 4 .
Doctors there evaluate patients and write approval forms for medicinal marijuana .
The state ’s clinics , however , do not sell the medicinal cannabis , but have drawn the ire of some local government leaders who fear they may open the doors for abuse and crime .
The Michigan law allows those with a doctor ’s recommendation to register for permits through the state .
They can possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and are allowed to grow up to 12 plants in enclosed and locked facilities .
They can designate a caregiver who is allowed to grow up to 12 plants per patient .
Caregivers are limited to five patients .
Opponents say they fear that the excess that might be grown could make its way to the black market .
A couple of Michigan municipalities — Fenton Township and Clio — are considering ordinances to ban medicinal - marijuana dispensaries .
One Detroit suburb , Royal Oak , is considering allowing sellers of medicinal marijuana to grow and sell pot in storefronts along the city ’s business district , offering a transparent way to deal with the law and allowing growers to be regulated in the open as a business .
The zoning ordinance would have to be approved by city commissioners .
Mr. Francisco says clearer state guidelines are needed for not only localities trying to adapt to it fairly but also law enforcement and prosecutors along with other stakeholders as they move forward and implement the law .
“ We do n’t mind reasonable regulation and oversight , ” he said .
“ We just want some clear guidelines to work with . ”
Some local police leaders have been vocal opponents of the Michigan medicinal - marijuana statute .
Gene Basar , a police chief from Howell , Mich. , who serves as president of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police , calls it a “ terrible , terrible law ” that he fears will lead to a spate of costly lawsuits .
“ This is the nose under the tent to the legalization of marijuana , ” Mr. Basar told the Livingston Daily newspaper .
The Michigan law has sparked concerns of lawsuits including issues over the growth of too many plants by caregivers and speculation over the possible distribution and sale of excess marijuana for recreational use .
There has also been some concern that physicians who write medical - marijuana recommendations for patients could ultimately be held liable if the user was involved in an accident while under the influence .
But William J. Johnson , executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations Inc. in Alexandria , Va. , said his rank - and - file officers have not registered “ a real sense of concern or outrage as these state laws have passed . ”
“ Our folks are going to do the best they can to enforce the laws in any given states they happen to be working in .
Assuming that it is legitimate and a health care provider has approved a prescription , I do n’t think our people would have any problem with it any more than any other prescribed drug .
“ I ’m not minimizing the abuse of controlled substances or drug abuse , but there are so many other challenges out there , ” he said , citing job losses , layoffs , decreased budgets and increased responsibilities in the post - Sept. 11 climate .
“ There is so much more that is on law enforcement ’s plate . ”
Last month , the Minnesota legislature passed a medicinal - marijuana bill that would allow legal pot use for terminally ill patients but would not allow them to grow it .
The measure enjoyed bipartisan support , but Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed it .
Mr. Pawlenty indicated that he had sympathy for patients with terminal illnesses but said he thought the legalization of medical marijuana use could ultimately cause “ serious public safety and health risks . ”
Chris DeLaForest , a former Republican state legislator , said he is optimistic that medical marijuana will return as an issue , even though the governor there intervened .
He says there is widespread support for medical marijuana among Minnesotans and thinks of it as a “ not if , but when ” issue across the nation .
“ Before Michigan , folks had said it was more of a left - coast phenomenon , given that California started things off , then you had Oregon and Hawaii and Washington following along , ” said Mr. DeLaForest , now a lobbyist for Minnesotans for Compassionate Care .
“ But when Michigan became the first Midwest state and did so overwhelmingly , I think that demonstrated clearly that across America , the public is embracing marijuana for medical purposes . ”
Ed Orlet , a former Ohio state legislator who represented an inner-city district in Dayton for 13 years , says he believes that Ohio will one day pass its own medicinal - marijuana law .
A bill was introduced in 2008 and only received one hearing but could be reintroduced in a session this year , said Mr. Orlet , a consultant from Columbus who now works with the National Drug Policy Alliance on medical marijuana and other drug reforms .
He has followed the Michigan law closely and points to a recent Ohio Poll from the University of Cincinnati that found that 73 percent of respondents said doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana for patients who needed it .
By contrast , however , a majority of Ohioans in the same poll — 60 percent — did not favor legalizing marijuana .
Other Midwestern states such as Illinois and Wisconsin also have considered legislation but are further behind in their progress in getting a measure passed .
Marijuana proponents , including the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , are nonetheless buoyed by the movement of medicinal laws and note that a nearly a fourth of the nation now lives in states that have approved such initiatives .
Supporters predict that it ’s only a matter of time before Americans , many of whom grew up in an era where recreational pot use was generally acceptable , treat marijuana much the same way they do alcohol , noting the rising costs associated with drug convictions and prison sentences along with costs incurred by police and law enforcement to fight what was once called the “ war on drugs . ”
“ I think it has sunk in to people that the last three presidents of the United States have smoked marijuana .
It has n’t stopped them from living successful lives , ” said Bruce Mirken , the MPP ’s communications director .
“ I think there is a growing realization that when used with some level of responsibility , it really is not all that dangerous . ”
While you ca n’t precisely measure an illegal commodity , says Mr. Mirken , an estimated 100 million Americans have acknowledged using marijuana with about 15 million saying they used it in the past month .
“ The Michael Phelps brouhaha … most of the country reacted with a collective shrug , ” Mr. Mirken said of the Olympic swimmer ’s personal foible after published photos showed him getting high at a party .
“ Kellogg ’s got more heat for dropping him [ as a product model ] than he got for being photographed with a bong . ”
Some recent polls have shown support for legalizing marijuana period .
In California , a recent Field poll of 901 registered voters found that 56 percent said they agreed with the statement “ Legalize marijuana for recreational use and tax its proceeds . ”
A Zogby poll released in early May of about 4,000 voters found that a little more than half of Americans , 52 percent , embraced legalizing , taxing and regulating marijuana , while an ABC News / Washington Post survey in April found the figure to be slightly lower at 46 percent .
A Rasmussen Reports poll conducted in May found that 41 percent of voters think the nation should legalize and tax marijuana as a way to help the nation pull out of its financial problems , but 49 percent opposed such an idea .
“ Until recently , those numbers have never gotten out of the mid-30s , ” Mr. Mirken said .
“ Anyway you cut it , there has been a noticeable shift in public opinion . ”
California ’s Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently called for a broader discussion of the nation ’s marijuana laws .
His state is suffering from a massive budget deficit projected to grow to as much as $ 28 billion at the end of the 2009 - 10 budget year .
“ I think it ’s time for a debate , ” Mr. Schwarzenegger said .
“ I think all those ideas of creating extra revenues , I ’m always for an open debate on it . ”
President Obama also entered the marijuana fray with his choice of a new drug czar , former Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske , who has said he embraces treating drug addiction over putting drug users in jail .
The Obama team has said it has no plans to raid medical - marijuana dispensaries in states where they are legal .
Their views show a shift in attitude and a more moderate tone from the new administration than the tough talk over drugs during the previous Bush administration .
Marijuana opponents , however , argue that there are far better and legal ways to help those who need relief for pain and that states that are legalizing medical marijuana are setting themselves up for future social woes .
They argue that pot -growing and the money it brings in from street sales — including what they fear will be the excess grown by licensed caregivers — will create a path for criminal activity , including gangs .
They fear a larger path to total legalization .
Judy Kreamer , president of Educating Voices , a nonprofit education group in Naperville , Ill. , that opposes medicinal marijuana , has fought medical - marijuana proponents who she says have made aggressive and expensive media buys in Illinois with efforts aimed at passing a state law there .
“ What they are able to do is go out and pull on people ’s heartstrings , having them come in to testify in a wheelchair , ” she said of efforts to pass legislation .
“ Perhaps there are a very few people who are seriously ill who believe this helps them , but on the other side of the scale , you have hundreds of thousands of young people being given the wrong information and walking away with the wrong impression .
Their take on it is that if this is a medicine , it ’s got to be safe .
What ’s the big deal ?
Why not use it . ”
For those who are chronically ill , pot ’s medicinal benefits are unrivaled , say those who use it to help manage symptoms .
They argue that naysayers and even some physicians need to look at new research and data and talk to those that it has helped .
“ I think it would open up their minds even more , ” say Roger Maufort , 56 , of Jackson , Mich. , who has registered as a caregiver under the Michigan law .
It allows him to grow medicinal marijuana for his wife , who is suffering from chronic pain .
He said he watched as his wife ’s sister became addicted to narcotic prescription drugs for chronic pain that he says cost her a marriage and career and damaged her life .
He did not want to see the same thing happen to his spouse .
“ The more I investigated , the more I realized the benefits that this could have , ” Mr. Maufort said .
“ I realized how little knowledge there is out there and how much is exaggerated and suppressed by our government . ”
He understands the criticism on this issue , but argues that “ two - thirds of Michigan voters [ who approved the legislation ] are not potheads . ”
“ This has been a godsend for my wife .
It helps her sleep through the night , ” said Mr. Maufort , who started the Compassion Club of Jackson , one of several support groups that are sprouting up for caregivers and patients around the state .
“ It does n’t eliminate her pain but it puts it in the background so that it ’s not in the forefront of her daily life . ”
Mike Engle , a medicinal - marijuana patient from Ypsilanti , Mich. , said he first became aware of pot ’s medicinal value when he lived in Germany .
After a car accident in 2004 — he says he got in his car and drove while asleep on the prescription sleep medications Ambien and Valium and hit another driver head - on — doctors urged him to have damaged vertebrae in his neck fused .
He did not want to have that operation so he began to treat the pain , using marijuana that he inhales from a vaporizer , which is a tube attached to an electric stand that acts as a filter for harmful smoke .
Now he has received doctor approval and applied for a permit from the state that will allow him to legally use and grow a few plants for others .
He argues that his medical - marijuana use is far superior to what has been prescribed to help him deal with pain , which also includes bursitis in one of his hips .
It has helped him to relax and lessen his need for other stronger medications , which he says is healthier long - term .
“ The overprescription of narcotics kills people , ” said Mr. Engle , 50 , a former stockbroker who attends Eastern Michigan University in hopes of becoming a drug counselor .
“ The overprescription of marijuana makes people sleepy . ”
Now as he works to educate himself and others to the benefits of medicinal marijuana , he calls himself “ an insurgent in the drug wars ” fighting against what he describes as a host of propaganda and drug corporations hellbent on protecting their profit margins .
If a successful business model was n’t on the line , he thinks things would change — in perception and in the law .
“ Truth and science wins , ” he says .
“ My pain management consists of concentrated cherry juice , medicinal cannabis and yoga .
There is n’t much room for a pharmaceutical company or a doctor to make money off of that . ”

RAMAT GAN , Israel , May 6 ( Reuters ) - A five - year - old hippopotamus named Lieber died in an Israeli safari park on Wednesday as he was being castrated by an international medical team .
A German veterinarian jumped up and down on the unconscious animal 's 1.5 - tonne body in an unsuccessful effort to restart Lieber 's heart , which had stopped after a second dose of anaesthetic was administered to repair a torn suture .
Sagit Horowitz , a spokeswoman for the Ramat Gan Safari Park near Tel Aviv , said its hippo herd of 40 was the largest in captivity in the world and officials feared any further population growth could lead to aggression among the animals .
Four other males at the park survived their castration and another was scheduled to undergo the procedure later in the day , she said .
" The risk involved is very high , we knew ( this ) before we started , " said Austrian vet Chris Walzer who came to Israel along with two colleagues , a German and Frenchman , to castrate the hippos , whose testicles are internal .

She asked , ‘ What ’s on TV ? ’
I said , ‘ Dust . ’

My wife and I are watching “ Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ” while we were in bed ..
I turned to her and said , “ Do you want to have sex ? ”
“ No , ” she answered .
I then said , “ Is that your final answer ? ”
She did n’t even look at me this time , simply saying , “ Yes . ”

Saturday morning I got up early , quietly dressed , made my lunch , grabbed the dog , and slipped quietly into the garage .
I hooked up the boat up to the truck , and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour .
The wind was blowing 50 mph , so I pulled back into the garage , turned on the radio , and discovered that the weather would be bad all day .
I went back into the house , quietly undressed , and slipped back into bed .
I cuddled up to my wife ’s back , now with a different anticipation , and whispered , “ The weather out there is terrible . ”
My loving wife of 10 years replied , “ Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that ? ”
And that ’s how the fight started …

I rear - ended a car this morning .
So , there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car .
You know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just seem funny ?
Yeah , well I could n’t believe it ….
He was a DWARF !!!
He stormed over to my car , looked up at me , and shouted , “ I AM NOT HAPPY !!! ”
So , I looked down at him and said , “ Well , then which one are you ? ”
And then the fight started …..

After retiring , I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security .
The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver ’s license to verify my age .
I looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home .
I told the woman that I was very sorry , but I would have to go home and come back later .
The woman said , ‘ Unbutton your shirt ’ .
So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair .
She said , ‘ That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me ’ and she processed my Social Security application .
When I got home , I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office .
She said , ‘ You should have dropped your pants .
You might have gotten disability , too . ’
And then the fight started ….

My wife and I were sitting at a table at my high school reunion , and I kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a
nearby table .
My wife asked , ‘ Do you know her ? ’
‘ Yes , ’ I sighed , ‘ She ’s my old girlfriend .
I understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago , and I hear she
has n’t been sober since . ’
‘ My God ! ’ says my wife , ‘ who would think a person could go on celebrating that long ? ’
And then the fight started …
******************************************
I took my wife to a restaurant .
The waiter , for some reason , took my order first .
“ I ’ll have the strip steak , medium rare , please . ”
He said , “ Are n’t you worried about the mad cow ? ” ”
Nah , she can order for herself . ”
And then the fight started …
******************************************
A woman is standing nude , looking in the bedroom mirror .
She is not happy with what she sees and says to her husband , ‘ I feel horrible ; I look old , fat and ugly .
I really need you to pay me a compliment . ’
The husband replies , ‘ Your eyesight ’s damn near perfect . ’
And then the fight started …

According to a recent study , there were more electronic records being exposed in 2008 than in the previous four years combined .
The study suggests that most breaches could have been avoided had the proper precautions been put in place .
An astounding 99 % of breaches were done through servers and applications , rather than desktop computers , notebooks , mobile phones or portable media combined .
Verizon Business Data Breach Investigations
A 2009 Verizon Business Data Breach Investigations Report ( PDF ) analyzed 90 confirmed breaches from 2008 that affected 285 million records .
A previous report from Verizon covering 2004 through 2007 saw 230 million records compromised .
Only about a third of the breaches investigated by Verizon have been publicly disclosed , and additional disclosures are expected by the end of this year .
However , many of the breaches will be undisclosed due to the absence of any applicable disclosure requirement laws .
It 's not known whether or not the massive 2008 Heartland Data Systems breach is included in the breaches Verizon investigated .
( Source : informationweek.com )
91 % of Breaches Linked to Organized Crime
Verizon 's report found that 91 % of all the compromised records were linked to organized crime .
Default credentials and SQL injection attacks were among the most common and customized malware attacks that doubled .
Peter Tippett , VP of research and intelligence for Verizon Business Security Solutions , referred to the report as a " wake - up call , " saying businesses need strong security and a proactive approach , particularly because the economic crisis may lead to even greater criminal activity .
Because the black market has been flooded with ' dumps ' ( credit card magnetic stripe sequences sufficient for counterfeiting ) , the value associated with selling stolen credit card data has dropped from between $ 10 and $ 16 per record in mid-2007 to less than $ 0.50 per record today .
93 % of Breaches From Financial Institutions
Cyber - criminals are now focusing on stealing PINs ( personal identification numbers ) associated with bank accounts , allowing cash to be stolen from its victims ' bank accounts , which perhaps explains why 93 % of the 285 million compromised records in 2008 came from financial institutions .
69 % of breaches investigated by Verizon were discovered by third parties , suggesting that organizations being breached need better control of the data they 're responsible for overseeing .
81 % of organizations affected by the breaches had been identified as noncompliant by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ( PCI DSS ) they were subject to .
However , the other 19 % that were compliant were also breached .
More Money Spent Cleaning Up Breaches
Verizon recommends avoiding shared credentials , changing default credentials , reviewing user accounts , testing applications and reviewing code , smarter patch management strategies , employee termination procedures , application logging and monitoring , and finding agreement on what represents suspicious or anomalous network behavior .
The report ( PDF ) is available from Verizon .
( Source : informationweek.com )
Eastern Europe , East Asia and North America account for 82 % of these breaches .
As noted by the Tech Herald , the companies responsible for protecting the breached data spent more money cleaning up the breaches than they would have to prevent the breaches in the first place .

WASHINGTON  A challenge to a $ 79.5 million punitive damages award against Philip Morris USA ended with a whimper on Tuesday when the Supreme Court announced that it should not have agreed to hear the case after all .
The case , brought by the widow of a heavy smoker , was before the court for the third time .
The question this time was , in essence , whether the Oregon Supreme Court had acted with lawless impudence in refusing to follow the United States Supreme Court ’s instructions in an earlier decision in the case .
In 2007 , in its second ruling in the case , the United State Supreme Court said that jurors might have impermissibly calculated the damages against Philip Morris at the trial in 1999 .
The jury instructions allowed for the possibility of awarding damages based in part on harm to other , unnamed smokers in addition to Jesse D. Williams , the man whose widow , Mayola Williams , brought the lawsuit .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. lawmakers plan far - reaching insurance market reforms , and would require that businesses and individuals purchase medical coverage as they seek to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system , an early draft of Senate legislation said on Saturday .
The legislation seeks to provide health coverage for all Americans and would prohibit insurance companies from refusing to cover anyone because of health history .
It also would outlaw annual or lifetime limits on coverage .
The bill would require individuals and businesses to purchase insurance .
The business community is likely to raise strong objections to the employer requirement in the measure , being drafted by the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee headed by Senator Edward Kennedy .
The sweeping healthcare overhaul is a top legislative priority for Democratic President Barack Obama , who says he wants Congress to send him a bill by October .
To help small businesses and individuals without employer - provided insurance , the Kennedy committee bill would establish government operated “ gateways ” for them to purchase affordable medical coverage .
The gateway , or insurance exchange as some have called it , would act as a clearinghouse that would help customers compare plans and prices .
The bill also provides for a sliding scale of subsidies to help people with incomes up to 500 percent of the poverty level purchase insurance .
Exceptions would be made for poor people and some small businesses .
The bill also would make millions more people eligible to join the Medicaid health program for the poor .
Kennedy ’s committee is one of two writing the massive overhaul .
The Senate Finance Committee headed by Senator Max Baucus is working on similar legislation and also will decide how to pay for the subsidies and a proposed new government plan that many Democrats want to compete with private insurers .
Republicans and insurance companies oppose the idea of a new public plan , arguing that it would drive many firms out of business and lead to a total government system .
Kennedy ’s spokesman Anthony Coley said the legislative language that was being widely circulated in Washington was an earlier draft of the bill .
Lawmakers are still fine - tuning the details in closed door sessions with an aim toward holding open committee sessions in the next few weeks .
Both Baucus and Kennedy have said they would like to achieve broad bipartisan support on the bill , which is expected to be brought to the Senate for a vote in July .
If the Finance Minister really wants to know the depth of this " global economic firestorm " , all he has to do is to ask the people who created it .
About 150 of the world 's most influential powerbrokers in government , industry , banking , media and academia are meeting from May 14 to 17 at the Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel in Vouliagmeni , Greece .
This group is called the Bilderberg Group and operates under the Chatham House rules -- meaning that no details of whatever has been discussed can ever be leaked to the media .
It seems , however , that top of their agenda this year is whether to have a prolonged depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation and poverty or an intense short depression that eventually leads the way to a sustainable economic world order .
Bilderberg could also be fostering a false picture of economic recovery , encouraging people to invest in stocks and shares again only for them to lose their money as another massive downturn is created by an economic false flag operation .
It is frightening that decisions made by this non-elected cabal can affect every citizen in the world today .

When you have a group of tenants move out , it ’s time to take a deep breath and go in to assess the damage .
There ’s a good chance that you have n’t seen your property for anywhere between a few months and a few years , so it can be a daunting thing to inspect what other people have done to your property .
Having had the occasional glimpse into other people ’s lives through various house parties and seeing what people tend to do to their rented accommodation , it ’s fair to say that sometimes there ’s no guarantee that the walls will still be there .
Even if you do n’t have any landlord - insurance , you can at least take solace in the fact that there is an excellent juicy security deposit that you can dip into if needs be , but what exactly can you take out of that ?
Damage :
If the property is damaged , you can take money out of the deposit to cover this .
What you ca n’t however , make money for is normal wear and tear , which is a frustratingly ill - defined term .
What will classify as reasonable to take out of a deposit is best established by putting yourself in the tenants ’ shoes .
Slightly scuffed carpets or faded curtains might not be a good thing to complain about , but a gaping hole in the ceiling , on the other hand , might be .
Missing items :
If there ’s anything on your inventory that has mysteriously disappeared , this is one to flag up .
Sometimes there might be a good reason for it .
I once had to throw away a wardrobe that came with my flat because it was missing a door , making it structurally unsound , and the inside was a blotchy blue / green colour with mould .
It was also soggy .
Even in this case , however , the landlord got a phone call not necessarily to ask for permission , but to explain that I was saving him the bother of calling out a hazmat team , so it certainly was n’t a surprise when it came time for us to leave the property .
Cleaning :
There are two times that you can take cleaning fees out of the deposit .
The first is if you have already agreed to seek professional cleaning fees from the deposit at the beginning of the tenancy , which is not uncommon .
The second is if the property is genuinely filthy and been left in no fit state .
It is not the same as “ well it could use a bit of a vacuum ” but covers a real sense of grime and squalor .
Unpaid rent :
Any due rent can be taken out of the deposit .
Although they really should n’t , some tenants assume that the deposit is there to cover their last month .
Advertising and agency fees :
If tenants have broken specific clauses of the tenancy agreement or have n’t exited it properly , you might be able to cover agency and advertising costs for putting the property back on the market .
However , it is not the norm , and it ’s worth taking advice before you launch into this .
It is typically only if the tenants have messed you around that you can do this .
Some things to bear in mind :
To make your life a little bit easier , take the following three things in mind .
1 ) Do n’t look for things to take out of the deposit , and do n’t try and pull a fast one if the damage is n’t all that bad .
If you ’re not careful , you could find yourself taken to a small claims court , and as you are probably aware , the law sides very slowly on the side of the tenants .
If you feel that there is a little bit of damage that is n’t entirely fair for you to put up with , it can sometimes be worth cutting your losses and taking the hit financially .
2 ) You can only claim for actual financial loss .
You ca n’t impose a punitive fine on your former tenants if they have done something that you told them they could n’t , like having noisy neighbour - aggravating parties or keeping a dog .
If that dog caused damage , on the other hand , that ’s a different matter .
3 ) Legally , you must return the deposit to the tenants within 14 days of them asking for it , so you should n’t hang around when deciding what to take out of it .
Summary
Renting out your property is a daunting process .
It is on the other side of the rent equation , and everyone has stories of terrible tenants , shifty letting agents and greedy landlords .
The best thing you can do is make sure you are not the latter , but make sure you are not taken advantage of by the former two .

Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , whose false tortured confession was used as basis for Bush 's war , has reportedly committed suicide ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/10/2009 , 8:18 pm PT
British journalist and historian Andy Worthington , an expert and author on Guantanamo , reports that the man who had supplied a key false tie between Iraq and al - Qaeda --- after being tortured in Egypt , where he had been rendered by the U.S. --- has died in a Libyan prison .
" Dead of suicide in his cell , " according to a Libyan newspaper .
Worthington has excellent coverage of the story tonight , which , he says , is " ablaze " in the Arabic media , but so far unreported in all but one English language outlet .
" This news resolves , in the grimmest way possible , " Worthington writes , " questions that have long been asked about the whereabouts of Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , perhaps the most famous of ' America 's Disappeared ' - prisoners seized in the ' War on Terror , ' who were rendered not to Guantánamo but to secret prisons run by the CIA or to the custody of governments in third countries - often their own - where , it was presumed , they would never be seen or heard from again . "
The " emir " of a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan , al - Libi " was one of hundreds of prisoners seized by Pakistani forces in December 2001 , crossing from Afghanistan into Pakistan .
Most of these men ended up in Guantánamo after being handed over ( or sold ) to US forces by their Pakistani allies , but al - Libi was , notoriously , rendered to Egypt by the CIA to be tortured on behalf of the US government . "
Worthington reports :
In Egypt , he came up with the false allegation about connections between al - Qaeda and Saddam Hussein that was used by President Bush in a speech in Cincinnati on October 7 , 2002 , just days before Congress voted on a resolution authorizing the President to go to war against Iraq , in which , referring to the supposed threat posed by Saddam Hussein 's regime , Bush said , " We've learned that Iraq has trained al - Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases . "
Four months later , on February 5 , 2003 , Secretary of State Colin Powell made the same claim in his notorious speech to the UN Security Council , in an attempt to drum up support for the invasion .
" I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these [ chemical and biological ] weapons to al - Qaeda , " Powell said , adding , " Fortunately , this operative is now detained , and he has told his story . "
As a Newsweek report in 2007 explained , Powell did not identify al - Libi by name , but CIA officials - and a Senate Intelligence Committee report - later confirmed that he was referring to al - Libi .
Al - Libi recanted his story in February 2004 , when he was returned to the CIA 's custody , and explained , as Newsweek described it , that he told his debriefers that " he initially told his interrogators that he ' knew nothing ' about ties between Baghdad and Osama bin Laden and he ' had difficulty even coming up with a story ' about a relationship between the two . "
The Newsweek report explained that " his answers displeased his interrogators - who then apparently subjected him to the mock burial .
As al - Libi recounted , he was stuffed into a box less than 20 inches high .
When the box was opened 17 hours later , al - Libi said he was given one final opportunity to ' tell the truth . '
He was knocked to the floor and ' punched for 15 minutes . '
It was only then that , al - Libi said , he made up the story about Iraqi weapons training . "
Worthington concludes : " The most important question that needs asking just now , of course , is whether it was possible for al - Libi to commit suicide in a Libyan jail , or whether he was murdered .
I doubt that we will ever find out the truth ... Whatever al - Libi ’s actual crimes , his use as a tool in a program of ' extraordinary rendition ' and torture , exploited shamelessly not to foil future terrorist plots but to yield false information about al - Qaeda and Saddam Hussein , remains a low point in a ' War on Terror ' that has few redeeming features . "
UPDATE : 16 hours later , and virtually zero coverage of this story in the U.S. corporate mainstream MSM .
Amazing .

Tony Acevedo , right , meets with a governor of Mexico in 1945 .
It was Acevedo who first inspired CNN users .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- I 'll never forget holding World War II medic Tony Acevedo in my arms .
He wept and convulsed for more than 10 minutes , his body constricting and tightening in a way I 'd never seen before .
" I 'm sorry , " he said , repeating , " I 'm sorry .
I want to say more , but I can't . "
I held his hand and hugged him until he calmed .
I had asked what I thought was a simple question .
" When I say the name Erwin Metz , what comes to your mind ? "
That 's when the demons of 1945 took over .
Metz was one of the Nazi commanders who headed a slave labor camp known as Berga an der Elster , where 350 U.S. soldiers -- 80 of whom had been targeted for being Jewish -- were beaten , starved and forced to work in tunnels at a secret V - 2 rocket factory .
They worked 10 to 12 hour days with only 400 calories of food , mostly bread made from sawdust .
More than 100 soldiers died at the camp or on a forced death march of more than 200 miles .
Other Berga survivors had described Metz : " A real bastard . "
" Butcher of the Earth . "
They said he talked with a high - pitched lisp .
Behind his back , the soldiers called him Donald Duck .
But he wreaked hell on the men .
He shot one soldier , Morton Goldstein , through the head , execution - style , according to the survivors .
Acevedo described seeing Metz dump ice water on one emaciated soldier .
The soldier died of shock moments later .
Acevedo catalogued the atrocities in a diary he kept hidden in his pants , using a Sheaffer fountain pen to record what he saw all around .
When the soldiers were on their forced death march , Acevedo asked to use his pen for a tracheotomy to save a soldier named George Buddeski .
Metz refused .
Flip through the pages of Acevedo's diary »
" You 're going to kill him then , " Acevedo responded .
Metz grabbed a rifle from a guard and cracked the young medic across his face .
Acevedo suffered permanent nerve damage from the blow .
Buddeski died April 13 , 1945 , on the death march on what the soldiers call Hell 's Highway .
The soldiers learned of another death that day : President Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
" Your Jew president has died , " the Nazis said mockingly .
There , in the middle of Germany , the American soldiers bowed their heads .
" We held a prayer service for the repose of his soul , " Acevedo 's diary says .
Amid the chaos and death all around them , these men -- these soldiers who suffered so much -- took the time to stop and pray for their president .
When CNN first reported Acevedo's story in November , I had no idea it would lead to what I witnessed this weekend : The U.S. Army reversing course on six decades of silence and recognizing the Berga soldiers for what they went through .
It 's always been a touchy subject for the Army .
The U.S. government in 1948 commuted the death sentences of Metz and his superior , Hauptmann Ludwig Merz .
The men walked free in the 1950s , one of dozens of convicted war criminals whose sentences were commuted as part of an effort to bolster Germany , which was facing the threat of Soviet expansion .
In explaining its decision on the Berga commanders , the War Department said , " Metz , though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners , was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape . "
Read the War Department 's explanation for commuting their sentences »
That prisoner was Goldstein , the one shot through the head .
When you read that document , it does n't sit too easy .
The government excuses the killing of one soldier .
Berga soldiers will tell you they were never called to testify against Metz or Merz .
They say they could 've told of many other atrocities .
When Metz and Merz were freed , the survivors felt the Army betrayed the war ethos of " leave no soldier behind . "
They eventually got on with their lives .
Many went on to the top of their professions .
They 're all the most patriotic Americans you 'll ever meet .
As the survivors reached their 70s and 80s , many began wondering why the government still refused to recognize them .
It nagged them .
It angered some of them .
No ranking Pentagon official had described Berga as a " slave labor camp . "
Heading into last weekend , the six Berga survivors present knew a two - star general was being sent to meet with them .
Many were skeptical :
What can a general do at this point to make us feel better ?
Surely , a two - star wo n't call it a " slave labor camp " after all this time .
Nah , he 'll toe the company line .
These were men who'd been disappointed before .
They did n't want to set expectations too high this time .
But there at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando , Florida , something magical transpired .
See photos of the Berga men being honored »
U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles did a sit - down interview with me , while six Berga survivors -- Samuel Fahrer , 86 ; Morton Brooks , 83 ; Sidney Lipson , 85 ; Peter Iosso , 83 ; Wallace Carden , 84 ; and Edward Slotkin , 84 -- watched .
" It was n't a prison camp .
It was a slave labor camp , " Boles said .
Watch the general set the record straight after six decades »
I was stunned in that moment .
I 'll even admit I got choked up .
I knew history had just been made , the legacy of the Berga soldiers preserved for all time .
The men looked on stoically and I knew what they were thinking : " Drash , pull yourself together !
We got a two - star in our presence ! "
I was thinking about all that transpired in the last eight months .
I thought about Bernard " Jack " Vogel and Izzy Cohen , who were forced to stand without food and water for days , pushed to their deaths .
Cohen was a 32 - year - old father of two young children .
I had met with his 90 - year - old wife , Florence , and their daughter , Nomi , months before .
Florence is a diminutive woman , the epitome of class and grace .
She told me a story I 'll never forget .
When Izzy left for war , he kissed his family goodbye at a train station in California .
He looked at her and said , " Whatever happens happens . "
Those were the last words he ever spoke to her .
When she was notified Izzy was a prisoner of war on March 16 , 1945 , one relative shouted , " That 's just like Izzy to take the easy way out of war . "
Izzy Cohen died three weeks later , a victim of the Holocaust .
Tears filled Florence 's eyes as she spoke .
She changed the family name , so her son would never be targeted as a Jew .
I thought about Martin Vogel , the brother of the man who died with Izzy .
Martin called one day in November , crying his eyes out .
" Are you the one who did the story on the medic , Tony Acevedo ? " he said , struggling for words .
" My brother is the one who died in his arms . "
Martin Vogel adored his older brother .
They were best friends .
He entered the Army so he could be just like his brother .
They were 19 and 17 .
He had searched for decades for answers to Bernard 's death .
" A month does n't go by that it does n't come up in the course of my own thoughts , " he said .
" But to me , it 's always there . "
At the time his brother died such a horrific death , Martin Vogel was just a few hundred miles away .
He was guarding a POW camp inside Germany where U.S. troops treated their Nazi captives under the Geneva Conventions .
To this day , Martin , now 82 , can't speak about his brother without crying .
More than a dozen other families of Berga victims have reached out .
I 've listened to each one and put them in touch with Acevedo for answers about their loved ones .
I 'm not the first to report on Berga .
Authors Mitchell Geoffrey Bard , Flint Whitlock and Roger Cohen have written books on it .
The late Charles Guggenheim made a documentary about Berga .
But what happened in recent months , I can only attribute to the power of online media and the ease of access to communicate .
You can scroll through Acevedo's diary and read the War Department document explaining why Metz and Merz were set free .
Millions of you read the pieces , e-mailed them around and rallied around these weathered war heroes .
It took on a life of its own .
Hundreds of you lobbied Rep. Joe Baca , D - California , and Rep. Spencer Bachus , R - Alabama .
The two congressmen then pressed Army Secretary Pete Geren to recognize the soldiers .
It was humbling when Boles , the two - star general , told me that my reporting and my colleagues on CNN television preserved the men's legacy , culminating with the Army recognizing them .
That feels mighty good .
It was even more humbling talking with the fellas .
They all survived the Battle of the Bulge , when a million young men went head - to - head on the battlefield .
It was an honor to see the six survivors present in Orlando receive flags flown over the Pentagon in their honor ; Samuel Fahrer was awarded the Bronze Star , one of the nation 's highest medals .
" Just as they never left their fallen comrades , we will never leave them , " Boles said .
" You were good soldiers and you were there for your nation . "
I wished the other Berga survivors were there , especially Acevedo .
But Acevedo did n't make the trip .
His wife is ill .
If he was going to leave her side , he felt the right thing would be to get honored in Washington .
A soldier with pride .
A medic to the end .
My final message is to my generation and the next .
Do n't be so quick to shove grandpa and grandma into a nursing home .
Sit down with them .
Listen to them .
Hear their stories .
The greatest generation .
They 're cut from a different cloth and we 're losing them too fast .

" There is far more violence in the Bible than in the Qur'an ; the idea that Islam imposed itself by the sword is a Western fiction , fabricated during the time of the Crusades when , in fact , it was Western Christians who were fighting brutal holy wars against Islam . " [ 1 ]
So announces former nun and self - professed " freelance monotheist , " Karen Armstrong .
This quote sums up the single most influential argument currently serving to deflect the accusation that Islam is inherently violent and intolerant :
All monotheistic religions , proponents of such an argument say , and not just Islam , have their fair share of violent and intolerant scriptures , as well as bloody histories .
Thus , whenever Islam 's sacred scriptures — the Qur'an first , followed by the reports on the words and deeds of Muhammad ( the Hadith ) — are highlighted as demonstrative of the religion 's innate bellicosity , the immediate rejoinder is that other scriptures , specifically those of Judeo - Christianity , are as riddled with violent passages .
Medieval times :
The Crusades were violent and led to atrocities by the modern world 's standards under the banner of the cross and in the name of Christianity .
But the Crusades were a counterattack on Islam .
Muslim invasions and atrocities against Christians were on the rise in the decades before the launch of the Crusades in 1096 .
More often than not , this argument puts an end to any discussion regarding whether violence and intolerance are unique to Islam .
Instead , the default answer becomes that it is not Islambut rather Muslim grievance and frustration — ever exacerbated by economic , political , and social factors — that lead to violence .
That this view comports perfectly with the secular West's " materialistic " epistemology makes it all the more unquestioned .
Therefore , before condemning the Qur'an and the historical words and deeds of Islam 's prophet Muhammad for inciting violence and intolerance , Jews are counseled to consider the historical atrocities committed by their Hebrew forefathers as recorded in their own scriptures ; Christians are advised to consider the brutal cycle of violence their forbears have committed in the name of their faith against both non-Christians and fellow Christians .
In other words , Jews and Christians are reminded that those who live in glass houses should not be hurling stones .
But is that really the case ?
Is the analogy with other scriptures legitimate ?
Does Hebrew violence in the ancient era , and Christian violence in the medieval era , compare to or explain away the tenacity of Muslim violence in the modern era ?
Violence in Jewish and Christian History
Along with Armstrong , any number of prominent writers , historians , and theologians have championed this " relativist " view .
For instance , John Esposito , director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim - Christian Understanding at Georgetown University , wonders ,
How come we keep on asking the same question , [ about violence in Islam , ] and do n't ask the same question about Christianity and Judaism ?
Jews and Christians have engaged in acts of violence .
All of us have the transcendent and the dark side .
…
We have our own theology of hate .
In mainstream Christianity and Judaism , we tend to be intolerant ; we adhere to an exclusivist theology , of us versus them . [ 2 ]
An article by Pennsylvania State University humanities professor Philip Jenkins , " Dark Passages , " delineates this position most fully .
It aspires to show that the Bible is more violent than the Qur'an :
[ I ] n terms of ordering violence and bloodshed , any simplistic claim about the superiority of the Bible to the Koran would be wildly wrong .
In fact , the Bible overflows with " texts of terror , " to borrow a phrase coined by the American theologian Phyllis Trible .
The Bible contains far more verses praising or urging bloodshed than does the Koran , and biblical violence is often far more extreme , and marked by more indiscriminate savagery .
…
If the founding text shapes the whole religion , then Judaism and Christianity deserve the utmost condemnation as religions of savagery . [ 3 ]
Several anecdotes from the Bible as well as from Judeo - Christian history illustrate Jenkins ' point , but two in particular — one supposedly representative of Judaism , the other of Christianity — are regularly mentioned and therefore deserve closer examination .
The military conquest of the land of Canaan by the Hebrews in about 1200 B.C.E. is often characterized as " genocide " and has all but become emblematic of biblical violence and intolerance .
God told Moses :
But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance , you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive , but you shall utterly destroy them — the Hittite , Amorite , Canaanite , Perizzite , Hivite , and Jebusite — just as the Lord your God has commanded you , lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods , and you sin against the Lord your God . [ 4 ]
So Joshua [ Moses ' successor ] conquered all the land : the mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes , and all their kings ; he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord , God of Israel had commanded . [ 5 ]
As for Christianity , since it is impossible to find New Testament verses inciting violence , those who espouse the view that Christianity is as violent as Islam rely on historical events such as the Crusader wars waged by European Christians between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries .
The Crusades were in fact violent and led to atrocities by the modern world 's standards under the banner of the cross and in the name of Christianity .
After breaching the walls of Jerusalem in 1099 , for example , the Crusaders reportedly slaughtered almost every inhabitant of the Holy City .
According to the medieval chronicle , the Gesta Danorum , " the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles . " [ 6 ]
In light of the above , as Armstrong , Esposito , Jenkins , and others argue , why should Jews and Christians point to the Qur'an as evidence of Islam 's violence while ignoring their own scriptures and history ?
Bible versus Qur'an
The answer lies in the fact that such observations confuse history and theology by conflating the temporal actions of men with what are understood to be the immutable words of God .
The fundamental error is that Judeo - Christian history — which is violent — is being conflated with Islamic theology — which commands violence .
Of course , the three major monotheistic religions have all had their share of violence and intolerance towards the " other . "
Whether this violence is ordained by God or whether warlike men merely wished it thus is the key question .
Old Testament violence is an interesting case in point .
God clearly ordered the Hebrews to annihilate the Canaanites and surrounding peoples .
Such violence is therefore an expression of God 's will , for good or ill .
Regardless , all the historic violence committed by the Hebrews and recorded in the Old Testament is just that — history .
It happened ; God commanded it .
But it revolved around a specific time and place and was directed against a specific people .
At no time did such violence go on to become standardized or codified into Jewish law .
In short , biblical accounts of violence are descriptive , not prescriptive .
This is where Islamic violence is unique .
Though similar to the violence of the Old Testament — commanded by God and manifested in history — certain aspects of Islamic violence and intolerance have become standardized in Islamic law and apply at all times .
Thus , while the violence found in the Qur'an has a historical context , its ultimate significance is theological .
Consider the following Qur'anic verses , better known as the " sword- verses " :
Then , when the sacred months are drawn away , slay the idolaters wherever you find them , and take them , and confine them , and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush .
But if they repent , and perform the prayer , and pay the alms , then let them go their way . [ 7 ]
Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day , and do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden – such men as practise not the religion of truth , being of those who have been given the Book – until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled . [ 8 ]
As with Old Testament verses where God commanded the Hebrews to attack and slay their neighbors , the sword - verses also have a historical context .
God first issued these commandments after the Muslims under Muhammad 's leadership had grown sufficiently strong to invade their Christian and pagan neighbors .
But unlike the bellicose verses and anecdotes of the Old Testament , the sword - verses became fundamental to Islam 's subsequent relationship to both the " people of the book " ( i.e. , Jews and Christians ) and the " idolaters " ( i.e. , Hindus , Buddhists , animists , etc. ) and , in fact , set off the Islamic conquests , which changed the face of the world forever .
Based on Qur'an 9:5 , for instance , Islamic law mandates that idolaters and polytheists must either convert to Islam or be killed ; simultaneously , Qur'an 9:29 is the primary source of Islam 's well - known discriminatory practices against conquered Christians and Jews living under Islamic suzerainty .
In fact , based on the sword - verses as well as countless other Qur'anic verses and oral traditions attributed to Muhammad , Islam 's learned officials , sheikhs , muftis , and imams throughout the ages have all reached consensus — binding on the entire Muslim community — that Islam is to be at perpetual war with the non-Muslim world until the former subsumes the latter .
Indeed , it is widely held by Muslim scholars that since the sword - verses are among the final revelations on the topic of Islam 's relationship to non-Muslims , that they alone have abrogated some 200 of the Qur'an 's earlier and more tolerant verses , such as " no compulsion is there in religion . " [ 9 ]
Famous Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun ( 1332-1406 ) admired in the West for his " progressive " insights , also puts to rest the notion that jihad is defensive warfare :
In the Muslim community , the holy war [ jihad ] is a religious duty , because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force ...
The other religious groups did not have a universal mission , and the holy war was not a religious duty for them , save only for purposes of defense ...
They are merely required to establish their religion among their own people .
That is why the Israelites after Moses and Joshua remained unconcerned with royal authority [ e.g. , a caliphate ] .
Their only concern was to establish their religion [ not spread it to the nations ] …
But Islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations . [ 10 ]
Modern authorities agree .
The Encyclopaedia of Islam 's entry for " jihad " by Emile Tyan states that the " spread of Islam by arms is a religious duty upon Muslims in general … Jihad must continue to be done until the whole world is under the rule of Islam …
Islam must completely be made over before the doctrine of jihad [ warfare to spread Islam ] can be eliminated . "
Iraqi jurist Majid Khaduri ( 1909 - 2007 ) , after defining jihad as warfare , writes that " jihad … is regarded by all jurists , with almost no exception , as a collective obligation of the whole Muslim community . " [ 11 ]
And , of course , Muslim legal manuals written in Arabic are even more explicit . [ 12 ]
Qur'anic Language
When the Qur'an 's violent verses are juxtaposed with their Old Testament counterparts , they are especially distinct for using language that transcends time and space , inciting believers to attack and slay nonbelievers today no less than yesterday .
God commanded the Hebrews to kill Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites — all specific peoples rooted to a specific time and place .
At no time did God give an open - ended command for the Hebrews , and by extension their Jewish descendants , to fight and kill gentiles .
On the other hand , though Islam 's original enemies were , like Judaism's , historical ( e.g. , Christian Byzantines and Zoroastrian Persians ) , the Qur'an rarely singles them out by their proper names .
Instead , Muslims were ( and are ) commanded to fight the people of the book — " until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled " [ 13 ] and to " slay the idolaters wherever you find them . " [ 14 ]
The two Arabic conjunctions " until " ( hata ) and " wherever " ( haythu ) demonstrate the perpetual and ubiquitous nature of these commandments :
There are still " people of the book " who have yet to be " utterly humbled " ( especially in the Americas , Europe , and Israel ) and " idolaters " to be slain " wherever " one looks ( especially Asia and sub-Saharan Africa ) .
In fact , the salient feature of almost all of the violent commandments in Islamic scriptures is their open - ended and generic nature : " Fight them [ non-Muslims ] until there is no persecution and the religion is God 's entirely .
[ Emphasis added . ] " [ 15 ]
Also , in a well - attested tradition that appears in the hadith collections , Muhammad proclaims :
I have been commanded to wage war against mankind until they testify that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God ; and that they establish prostration prayer , and pay the alms - tax [ i.e. , convert to Islam ] .
If they do so , their blood and property are protected .
[ Emphasis added . ] [ 16 ]
This linguistic aspect is crucial to understanding scriptural exegeses regarding violence .
Again , it bears repeating that neither Jewish nor Christian scriptures — the Old and New Testaments , respectively — employ such perpetual , open - ended commandments .
Despite all this , Jenkins laments that
Commands to kill , to commit ethnic cleansing , to institutionalize segregation , to hate and fear other races and religions … all are in the Bible , and occur with a far greater frequency than in the Qur'an .
At every stage , we can argue what the passages in question mean , and certainly whether they should have any relevance for later ages .
But the fact remains that the words are there , and their inclusion in the scripture means that they are , literally , canonized , no less than in the Muslim scripture . [ 17 ]
One wonders what Jenkins has in mind by the word " canonized . "
If by canonized he means that such verses are considered part of the canon of Judeo - Christian scripture , he is absolutely correct ; conversely , if by canonized he means or is trying to connote that these verses have been implemented in the Judeo - Christian Weltanschauung , he is absolutely wrong .
Yet one need not rely on purely exegetical and philological arguments ; both history and current events give the lie to Jenkins 's relativism .
Whereas first - century Christianity spread via the blood of martyrs , first - century Islam spread through violent conquest and bloodshed .
Indeed , from day one to the present — whenever it could — Islam spread through conquest , as evinced by the fact that the majority of what is now known as the Islamic world , or dar al - Islam , was conquered by the sword of Islam .
This is a historic fact , attested to by the most authoritative Islamic historians .
Even the Arabian peninsula , the " home " of Islam , was subdued by great force and bloodshed , as evidenced by the Ridda wars following Muhammad 's death when tens of thousands of Arabs were put to the sword by the first caliph Abu Bakr for abandoning Islam .
Muhammad's Role
Moreover , concerning the current default position which purports to explain away Islamic violence — that the latter is a product of Muslim frustration vis -à - vis political or economic oppression — one must ask :
What about all the oppressed Christians and Jews , not to mention Hindus and Buddhists , of the world today ?
Where is their religiously - garbed violence ?
The fact remains :
Even though the Islamic world has the lion 's share of dramatic headlines — of violence , terrorism , suicide - attacks , decapitations — it is certainly not the only region in the world suffering under both internal and external pressures .
For instance , even though practically all of sub-Saharan Africa is currently riddled with political corruption , oppression and poverty , when it comes to violence , terrorism , and sheer chaos , Somalia — which also happens to be the only sub-Saharan country that is entirely Muslim — leads the pack .
Moreover , those most responsible for Somali violence and the enforcement of intolerant , draconian , legal measures — the members of the jihadi group Al - Shabab ( the youth ) — articulate and justify all their actions through an Islamist paradigm .
In Sudan , too , a jihadi - genocide against the Christian and polytheistic peoples is currently being waged by Khartoum 's Islamist government and has left nearly a million " infidels " and " apostates " dead .
That the Organization of Islamic Conference has come to the defense of Sudanese president Hassan Ahmad al - Bashir , who is wanted by the International Criminal Court , is further telling of the Islamic body 's approval of violence toward both non-Muslims and those deemed not Muslim enough .
Latin American and non-Muslim Asian countries also have their fair share of oppressive , authoritarian regimes , poverty , and all the rest that the Muslim world suffers .
Yet , unlike the near daily headlines emanating from the Islamic world , there are no records of practicing Christians , Buddhists , or Hindus crashing explosives - laden vehicles into the buildings of oppressive ( e.g. , Cuban or Chinese communist ) regimes , all the while waving their scriptures in hand and screaming , " Jesus [ or Buddha or Vishnu ] is great ! "
Why ?
There is one final aspect that is often overlooked — either from ignorance or disingenuousness — by those who insist that violence and intolerance is equivalent across the board for all religions .
Aside from the divine words of the Qur'an , Muhammad 's pattern of behavior — his sunna or " example " — is an extremely important source of legislation in Islam .
Muslims are exhorted to emulate Muhammad in all walks of life : " You have had a good example in God 's Messenger . " [ 18 ]
And Muhammad 's pattern of conduct toward non-Muslims is quite explicit .
Sarcastically arguing against the concept of moderate Islam , for example , terrorist Osama bin Laden , who enjoys half the Arab - Islamic world 's support per an Al - Jazeera poll , [ 19 ] portrays the Prophet 's sunna thusly :
" Moderation " is demonstrated by our prophet who did not remain more than three months in Medina without raiding or sending a raiding party into the lands of the infidels to beat down their strongholds and seize their possessions , their lives , and their women . [ 20 ]
In fact , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad 's sunna , pillaging and plundering infidels , enslaving their children , and placing their women in concubinage is well founded . [ 21 ]
And the concept of sunna — which is what 90 percent of the billion - plus Muslims , the Sunnis , are named after — essentially asserts that anything performed or approved by Muhammad , humanity 's most perfect example , is applicable for Muslims today no less than yesterday .
This , of course , does not mean that Muslims in mass live only to plunder and rape .
But it does mean that persons naturally inclined to such activities , and who also happen to be Muslim , can — and do — quite easily justify their actions by referring to the " Sunna of the Prophet " — the way Al - Qaeda , for example , justified its attacks on 9/11 where innocents including women and children were killed : Muhammad authorized his followers to use catapults during their siege of the town of Ta'if in 630 C.E. — townspeople had refused to submit — though he was aware that women and children were sheltered there .
Also , when asked if it was permissible to launch night raids or set fire to the fortifications of the infidels if women and children were among them , the Prophet is said to have responded , " They [ women and children ] are from among them [ infidels ] . " [ 22 ]
Jewish and Christian Ways
Though law - centric and possibly legalistic , Judaism has no such equivalent to the Sunna ; the words and deeds of the patriarchs , though described in the Old Testament , never went on to prescribe Jewish law .
Neither Abraham's " white - lies , " nor Jacob 's perfidy , nor Moses ' short - fuse , nor David 's adultery , nor Solomon 's philandering ever went on to instruct Jews or Christians .
They were understood as historical acts perpetrated by fallible men who were more often than not punished by God for their less than ideal behavior .
As for Christianity , much of the Old Testament law was abrogated or fulfilled — depending on one 's perspective — by Jesus .
" Eye for an eye " gave way to " turn the other cheek . "
Totally loving God and one 's neighbor became supreme law . [ 23 ]
Furthermore , Jesus ' sunna — as in " What would Jesus do ? " — is characterized by passivity and altruism .
The New Testament contains absolutely no exhortations to violence .
Still , there are those who attempt to portray Jesus as having a similarly militant ethos as Muhammad by quoting the verse where the former — who " spoke to the multitudes in parables and without a parable spoke not " [ 24 ] — said , " I come not to bring peace but a sword . " [ 25 ]
But based on the context of this statement , it is clear that Jesus was not commanding violence against non-Christians but rather predicting that strife will exist between Christians and their environment — a prediction that was only too true as early Christians , far from taking up the sword , passively perished by the sword in martyrdom as too often they still do in the Muslim world . [ 26 ]
Others point to the violence predicted in the Book of Revelation while , again , failing to discern that the entire account is descriptive — not to mention clearly symbolic — and thus hardly prescriptive for Christians .
At any rate , how can one conscionably compare this handful of New Testament verses that metaphorically mention the word " sword " to the literally hundreds of Qur'anic injunctions and statements by Muhammad that clearly command Muslims to take up a very real sword against non-Muslims ?
Undeterred , Jenkins bemoans the fact that , in the New Testament , Jews " plan to stone Jesus , they plot to kill him ; in turn , Jesus calls them liars , children of the Devil . " [ 27 ]
It still remains to be seen if being called " children of the Devil " is more offensive than being referred to as the descendents of apes and pigs — the Qur'an 's appellation for Jews . [ 28 ]
Name calling aside , however , what matters here is that , whereas the New Testament does not command Christians to treat Jews as " children of the Devil , " based on the Qur'an , primarily 9:29 , Islamic law obligates Muslims to subjugate Jews , indeed , all non-Muslims .
Does this mean that no self - professed Christian can be anti-Semitic ?
Of course not .
But it does mean that Christian anti-Semites are living oxymorons — for the simple reason that textually and theologically , Christianity , far from teaching hatred or animosity , unambiguously stresses love and forgiveness .
Whether or not all Christians follow such mandates is hardly the point ; just as whether or not all Muslims uphold the obligation of jihad is hardly the point .
The only question is , what do the religions command ?
John Esposito is therefore right to assert that " Jews and Christians have engaged in acts of violence . "
He is wrong , however , to add , " We [ Christians ] have our own theology of hate . "
Nothing in the New Testament teaches hate — certainly nothing to compare with Qur'anic injunctions such as : " We [ Muslims ] disbelieve in you [ non-Muslims ] , and between us and you enmity has shown itself , and hatred for ever until you believe in God alone . " [ 29 ]
Reassessing the Crusades
And it is from here that one can best appreciate the historic Crusades — events that have been thoroughly distorted by Islam 's many influential apologists .
Karen Armstrong , for instance , has practically made a career for herself by misrepresenting the Crusades , writing , for example , that " the idea that Islam imposed itself by the sword is a Western fiction , fabricated during the time of the Crusades when , in fact , it was Western Christians who were fighting brutal holy wars against Islam . " [ 30 ]
That a former nun rabidly condemns the Crusades vis -à - vis anything Islam has done makes her critique all the more marketable .
Yet statements such as this ignore the fact that from the beginnings of Islam , more than 400 years before the Crusades , Christians have noted that Islam was spread by the sword . [ 31 ]
Indeed , authoritative Muslim historians writing centuries before the Crusades , such as Ahmad Ibn Yahya al - Baladhuri ( d. 892 ) and Muhammad ibn Jarir at - Tabari ( 838-923 ) , make it clear that Islam was spread by the sword .
The fact remains : The Crusades were a counterattack on Islam — not an unprovoked assault as Armstrong and other revisionist historians portray .
Eminent historian Bernard Lewis puts it well ,
Even the Christian crusade , often compared with the Muslim jihad , was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation .
But unlike the jihad , it was concerned primarily with the defense or reconquest of threatened or lost Christian territory .
It was , with few exceptions , limited to the successful wars for the recovery of southwest Europe , and the unsuccessful wars to recover the Holy Land and to halt the Ottoman advance in the Balkans .
The Muslim jihad , in contrast , was perceived as unlimited , as a religious obligation that would continue until all the world had either adopted the Muslim faith or submitted to Muslim rule . …
The object of jihad is to bring the whole world under Islamic law . [ 32 ]
Moreover , Muslim invasions and atrocities against Christians were on the rise in the decades before the launch of the Crusades in 1096 .
The Fatimid caliph Abu ' Ali Mansur Tariqu'l - Hakim ( r. 996-1021 ) desecrated and destroyed a number of important churches — such as the Church of St. Mark in Egypt and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem — and decreed even more oppressive than usual decrees against Christians and Jews .
Then , in 1071 , the Seljuk Turks crushed the Byzantines in the pivotal battle of Manzikert and , in effect , conquered a major chunk of Byzantine Anatolia presaging the way for the eventual capture of Constantinople centuries later .
It was against this backdrop that Pope Urban II ( r. 1088 - 1099 ) called for the Crusades :
From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears , namely , that a race from the kingdom of the Persians [ i.e. , Muslim Turks ] … has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword , pillage and fire ; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country , and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures ; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion . [ 33 ]
Even though Urban II 's description is historically accurate , the fact remains :
However one interprets these wars — as offensive or defensive , just or unjust — it is evident that they were not based on the example of Jesus , who exhorted his followers to " love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you . " [ 34 ]
Indeed , it took centuries of theological debate , from Augustine to Aquinas , to rationalize defensive war — articulated as " just war . "
Thus , it would seem that if anyone , it is the Crusaders — not the jihadists — who have been less than faithful to their scriptures ( from a literal standpoint ) ; or put conversely , it is the jihadists — not the Crusaders — who have faithfully fulfilled their scriptures ( also from a literal stand point ) .
Moreover , like the violent accounts of the Old Testament , the Crusades are historic in nature and not manifestations of any deeper scriptural truths .
In fact , far from suggesting anything intrinsic to Christianity , the Crusades ironically better help explain Islam .
For what the Crusades demonstrated once and for all is that irrespective of religious teachings — indeed , in the case of these so - called Christian Crusades , despite them — man is often predisposed to violence .
But this begs the question :
If this is how Christians behaved — who are commanded to love , bless , and do good to their enemies who hate , curse , and persecute them — how much more can be expected of Muslims who , while sharing the same violent tendencies , are further commanded by the Deity to attack , kill , and plunder nonbelievers ?

A. J. Baime ’s new book , “ Go Like Hell : Ford , Ferrari , and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans , ” is set in the 1960s but evokes a world that now seems vanished and fantastical .
General Motors and Ford , far from bankrupt , are two of the mightiest companies in the world .
Gas is as plentiful as water , and almost as cheap .
Nobody buys a car because of its fuel efficiency or its safety features .
All that matters is how fast it goes .
Race drivers are heroic figures who appear on the cover of Time and Newsweek almost as often as they turn up in emergency rooms or the morgue .
When Ralph Nader starts complaining about the Corvair , G.M. hires private detectives to dig up dirt on his private life .
The centerpiece of the story is the quest by Henry Ford II , or the Deuce , as he was known , to end Ferrari ’s string of victories at Le Mans , the 24 - hour road race that at the time was probably the world ’s most dangerous sporting event .
He was convinced that Ford ’s racing success would translate into sales back home in the showroom , but he was also locked in a personal rivalry with the imperious Enzo Ferrari , head of the Italian car company .
It took Ford three tries and countless millions , but he finally prevailed when a Ford GT40 Mk II , driven by Bruce McLaren , won at Le Mans in 1966 .
In many ways , though , the feud persists .
There are still car enthusiasts who prefer the elegance and nimbleness of the Ferrari , and those who swear by the muscle and straight - ahead speed of the Ford GT .
Mr. Baime , an executive editor at Playboy , where he oversees the automotive coverage , is partial to Ferraris , and recently borrowed a bright red $ 300,000 599 GTB Fiorano and drove it to the Monticello Motor Club , a private track in the Catskills .

We are citizens , and Obama is a politician .
You might not like that word .
But the fact is he ’s a politician .
He ’s other things , too — he ’s a very sensitive and intelligent and thoughtful and promising person .
But he ’s a politician .
If you ’re a citizen , you have to know the difference between them and you — the difference between what they have to do and what you have to do .
And there are things they do n’t have to do , if you make it clear to them they do n’t have to do it .
From the beginning , I liked Obama .
But the first time it suddenly struck me that he was a politician was early on , when Joe Lieberman was running for the Democratic nomination for his Senate seat in 2006 .
Lieberman — who , as you know , was and is a war lover — was running for the Democratic nomination , and his opponent was a man named Ned Lamont , who was the peace candidate .
And Obama went to Connecticut to support Lieberman against Lamont .
It took me aback .
I say that to indicate that , yes , Obama was and is a politician .
So we must not be swept away into an unthinking and unquestioning acceptance of what Obama does .
Our job is not to give him a blank check or simply be cheerleaders .
It was good that we were cheerleaders while he was running for office , but it ’s not good to be cheerleaders now .
Because we want the country to go beyond where it has been in the past .
We want to make a clean break from what it has been in the past .
I had a teacher at Columbia University named Richard Hofstadter , who wrote a book called The American Political Tradition , and in it , he examined presidents from the Founding Fathers down through Franklin Roosevelt .
There were liberals and conservatives , Republicans and Democrats .
And there were differences between them .
But he found that the so - called liberals were not as liberal as people thought — and that the difference between the liberals and the conservatives , and between Republicans and Democrats , was not a polar difference .
There was a common thread that ran through all American history , and all of the presidents —
Republican , Democrat , liberal , conservative — followed this thread .
The thread consisted of two elements : one , nationalism ; and two , capitalism .
And Obama is not yet free of that powerful double heritage .
We can see it in the policies that have been enunciated so far , even though he ’s been in office only a short time .
Some people might say , “ Well , what do you expect ? ”
And the answer is that we expect a lot .
People say , “ What , are you a dreamer ? ”
And the answer is , yes , we ’re dreamers .
We want it all .
We want a peaceful world .
We want an egalitarian world .
We do n’t want war .
We do n’t want capitalism .
We want a decent society .
We better hold on to that dream — because if we do n’t , we ’ll sink closer and closer to this reality that we have , and that we do n’t want .
Be wary when you hear about the glories of the market system .
The market system is what we ’ve had .
Let the market decide , they say .
The government must n’t give people free health care ; let the market decide .
Which is what the market has been doing — and that ’s why we have forty - eight million people without health care .
The market has decided that .
Leave things to the market , and there are two million people homeless .
Leave things to the market , and there are millions and millions of people who ca n’t pay their rent .
Leave things to the market , and there are thirty - five million people who go hungry .
You ca n’t leave it to the market .
If you ’re facing an economic crisis like we ’re facing now , you ca n’t do what was done in the past .
You ca n’t pour money into the upper levels of the country — and into the banks and corporations — and hope that it somehow trickles down .
What was one of the first things that happened when the Bush Administration saw that the economy was in trouble ?
A $ 700 billion bailout , and who did we give the $ 700 billion to ?
To the financial institutions that caused this crisis .
This was when the Presidential campaign was still going on , and it pained me to see Obama standing there , endorsing this huge bailout to the corporations .
What Obama should have been saying was :
Hey , wait a while .
The banks are n’t poverty stricken .
The CEOs are n’t poverty stricken .
But there are people who are out of work .
There are people who ca n’t pay their mortgages .
Let ’s take $ 700 billion and give it directly to the people who need it .
Let ’s take $ 1 trillion , let ’s take $ 2 trillion .
Let ’s take this money and give it directly to the people who need it .
Give it to the people who have to pay their mortgages .
Nobody should be evicted .
Nobody should be left with their belongings out on the street .
Obama wants to spend perhaps a trillion more on the banks .
Like Bush , he ’s not giving it directly to homeowners .
Unlike the Republicans , Obama also wants to spend $ 800 billion for his economic stimulus plan .
Which is good — the idea of a stimulus is good .
But if you look closely at the plan , too much of it goes through the market , through corporations .
It gives tax breaks to businesses , hoping that they ’ll hire people .
No — if people need jobs , you do n’t give money to the corporations , hoping that maybe jobs will be created .
You give people work immediately .
A lot of people do n’t know the history of the New Deal of the 1930s .
The New Deal did n’t go far enough , but it had some very good ideas .
And the reason the New Deal came to these good ideas was because there was huge agitation in this country , and Roosevelt had to react .
So what did he do ?
He took billions of dollars and said the government was going to hire people .
You ’re out of work ?
The government has a job for you .
As a result of this , lots of very wonderful work was done all over the country .
Several million young people were put into the Civilian Conservation Corps .
They went around the country , building bridges and roads and playgrounds , and doing remarkable things .
The government created a federal arts program .
It was n’t going to wait for the markets to decide that .
The government set up a program and hired thousands of unemployed artists : playwrights , actors , musicians , painters , sculptors , writers .
What was the result ?
The result was the production of 200,000 pieces of art .
Today , around the country , there are thousands of murals painted by people in the WPA program .
Plays were put on all over the country at very cheap prices , so that people who had never seen a play in their lives were able to afford to go .
And that ’s just a glimmer of what could be done .
The government has to represent the people ’s needs .
The government can’t give the job of representing the people ’s needs to corporations and the banks , because they do n’t care about the people ’s needs .
They only care about profit .
In the course of his campaign , Obama said something that struck me as very wise — and when people say something very wise , you have to remember it , because they may not hold to it .
You may have to remind them of that wise thing they said .
Obama was talking about the war in Iraq , and he said , “ It ’s not just that we have to get out of Iraq . ”
He said “ get out of Iraq , ” and we must n’t forget it .
We must keep reminding him :
Out of Iraq , out of Iraq , out of Iraq — not next year , not two years from now , but out of Iraq now .
But listen to the second part , too .
His whole sentence was : “ It ’s not enough to get out of Iraq ; we have to get out of the mindset that led us into Iraq . ”
What is the mindset that got us into Iraq ?
It ’s the mindset that says force will do the trick .
Violence , war , bombers — that they will bring democracy and liberty to the people .
It ’s the mindset that says America has some God - given right to invade other countries for their own benefit .
We will bring civilization to the Mexicans in 1846 .
We will bring freedom to the Cubans in 1898 .
We will bring democracy to the Filipinos in 1900 .
You know how successful we ’ve been at bringing democracy all over the world .
Obama has not gotten out of this militaristic missionary mindset .
He talks about sending tens of thousands of more troops to Afghanistan .
Obama is a very smart guy , and surely he must know some of the history .
You do n’t have to know a lot to know the history of Afghanistan has been decades and decades and decades and decades of Western powers trying to impose their will on Afghanistan by force : the English , the Russians , and now the Americans .
What has been the result ?
The result has been a ruined country .
This is the mindset that sends 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan , and that says , as Obama has , that we ’ve got to have a bigger military .
My heart sank when Obama said that .
Why do we need a bigger military ?
We have an enormous military budget .
Has Obama talked about cutting the military budget in half or some fraction ?
No .
We have military bases in more than a hundred countries .
We have fourteen military bases on Okinawa alone .
Who wants us there ?
The governments .
They get benefits .
But the people do n’t really want us there .
There have been huge demonstrations in Italy against the establishment of a U.S. military base .
There have been big demonstrations in South Korea and on Okinawa .
One of the first acts of the Obama Administration was to send Predator missiles to bomb Pakistan .
People died .
The claim is , “ Oh , we ’re very precise with our weapons .
We have the latest equipment .
We can target anywhere and hit just what we want . ”
This is the mindset of technological infatuation .
Yes , they can actually decide that they ’re going to bomb this one house .
But there ’s one problem :
They do n’t know who ’s in the house .
They can hit one car with a rocket from a great distance .
Do they know who ’s in the car ?
No .
And later — after the bodies have been taken out of the car , after the bodies have been taken out of the house — they tell you , “ Well , there were three suspected terrorists in that house , and yes , there ’s seven other people killed , including two children , but we got the suspected terrorists . ”
But notice that the word is “ suspected . ”
The truth is they do n’t know who the terrorists are .
So , yes , we have to get out of the mindset that got us into Iraq , but we ’ve got to identify that mindset .
And Obama has to be pulled by the people who elected him , by the people who are enthusiastic about him , to renounce that mindset .
We ’re the ones who have to tell him , “ No , you ’re on the wrong course with this militaristic idea of using force to accomplish things in the world .
We wo n’t accomplish anything that way , and we ’ll remain a hated country in the world . ”
Obama has talked about a vision for this country .
You have to have a vision , and now I want to tell Obama what his vision should be .
The vision should be of a nation that becomes liked all over the world .
I wo n’t even say loved — it ’ll take a while to build up to that .
A nation that is not feared , not disliked , not hated , as too often we are , but a nation that is looked upon as peaceful , because we ’ve withdrawn our military bases from all these countries .
We do n’t need to spend the hundreds of billions of dollars on the military budget .
Take all the money allocated to military bases and the military budget , and — this is part of the emancipation — you can use that money to give everybody free health care , to guarantee jobs to everybody who does n’t have a job , guaranteed payment of rent to everybody who ca n’t pay their rent , build child care centers .
Let ’s use the money to help other people around the world , not to send bombers over there .
When disasters take place , they need helicopters to transport people out of the floods and out of devastated areas .
They need helicopters to save people ’s lives , and the helicopters are over in the Middle East , bombing and strafing people .
What ’s required is a total turn­around .
We want a country that uses its resources , its wealth , and its power to help people , not to hurt them .
That ’s what we need .
This is a vision we have to keep alive .
We should n’t be easily satisfied and say , “ Oh well , give him a break .
Obama deserves respect . ”
But you do n’t respect somebody when you give them a blank check .
You respect somebody when you treat them as an equal to you , and as somebody you can talk to and somebody who will listen to you .
Not only is Obama a politician .
Worse , he ’s surrounded by politicians .
And some of them he picked himself .
He picked Hillary Clinton , he picked Lawrence Summers , he picked people who show no sign of breaking from the past .
We are citizens .
We must not put ourselves in the position of looking at the world from their eyes and say , “ Well , we have to compromise , we have to do this for political reasons . ”
No , we have to speak our minds .
This is the position that the abolitionists were in before the Civil War , and people said , “ Well , you have to look at it from Lincoln ’s point of view . ”
Lincoln did n’t believe that his first priority was abolishing slavery .
But the anti-slavery movement did , and the abolitionists said , “ We ’re not going to put ourselves in Lincoln ’s position .
We are going to express our own position , and we are going to express it so powerfully that Lincoln will have to listen to us . ”
And the anti-slavery movement grew large enough and powerful enough that Lincoln had to listen .
That ’s how we got the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .
That ’s been the story of this country .
Where progress has been made , wherever any kind of injustice has been overturned , it ’s been because people acted as citizens , and not as politicians .
They did n’t just moan .
They worked , they acted , they organized , they rioted if necessary to bring their situation to the attention of people in power .
And that ’s what we have to do today .

Harvesting firewood has many rewards : exercise , satisfaction , saving money , and the security of having your own fuel supply for winter warmth .
Here are some pointers in the art of cutting your own with maximum safety and minimal effort .
Instead of just cutting green wood and letting it dry over the summer , consider going after aged hardwood , those dead trees that are losing their bark .
I call this “ vintage firewood ” because it has aged like fine wine .
If you love a blazing hot fire , this is your ultimate fuel .
Gear to get
A big part of your success will depend on your gear .
You ’ll need lots of it , but after the initial outlay , your heating costs go way down .
Chain saw .
Go as big as you can afford .
I struggled for years with a little 1.8 cu. in .
engine saw .
Now I have a 3.5 cu. in .
model that can really cut !
I suggest at least a 3 cu. in .
saw .
Test start it outside the showroom and check for easy starting , smooth idling , and a working bar oiler .
Rev the engine , then dip the bar tip near the ground .
You should see some sign of oil flying off the chain if the oiler is an automatic one .
Do n’t get a saw so heavy you ’ll have trouble using it .
I consider a chain saw very dangerous .
Remember that this tool can cut your leg or your head off in two seconds .
I took a waterproof marker and marked a long line on the side of the saw 20 inches from the bar tip .
Now I have a built - in log measure .
Gas .
Get regular gas and add gas stabilizer ( such as STA - BIL ) to it as soon as you get home .
This keeps the gas from gunking up .
You ’ll also need two cycle oil to add to the gas .
Bar oil .
Get a good quality brand by the gallon to save $ $ .
Gear bag .
Every time you head into the woods be prepared to spend the night .
All sorts of accidents can happen , so your gear bag could save your life .
I use a small canvas bag covered on the outside with a plastic grocery bag .
A sharp hatchet and six - inch long wedge are essential for freeing your saw from being pinched in a bad cut .
Include a large space blanket , a bunch of hard candy , water bottle , matches , and a signal whistle .
You ’ll need your bar adjusting wrench occasionally .
A spare wool hat and pair of thick gloves are a good idea .
If you ’re alone , a walkie talkie or cell phone would be great to have .
Add a small first aid kit or a war surplus combat bandage in case you suffer a deep cut .
I also bring two 12 oz .
dry gas bottles , one filled with bar oil and the other with gas mixture .
Wrap them tightly in a thick plastic bag to contain any spillage .
An old bike can be converted to a tool for hauling heavy logs from the woods , but you should not overload it and you must always be mindful of the kind of terrain you ’re taking it over .
Clothes .
Dress warmly , even in warm weather .
A hard hat is a good idea ; use a chin strap .
Under the hard hat wear a wool hat .
Most of your body ’s heat loss is through your head .
Safety goggles are a must and ear protectors are good if you have a loud saw .
Wear tight - fitting clothes with no scarves or necklaces that can get caught in the chain .
Thick gloves and boots complete your wardrobe .
Do n’t forget an orange vest or jacket if it ’s hunting season .
Selecting trees
With your fueled and oiled - up saw in one hand and gear bag in the other , you ’re ready to hit the woods .
I cut almost all oak and maple , avoiding pine and spruce .
Even dried , these last two produce a fair amount of creosote , which can cause devastating stove pipe and chimney fires .
With the exception of oak , aged wood needs to be found before it hits the ground and rapidly rots away .
Dead trees can be tricky to spot at a distance .
Crumbling top branches and peeling bark are good signs .
I ’ve developed the habit of peeling off a big section of bark at eye level on my walks through the woods .
This trick really helps spot trees when cutting time arrives .
Since I have to haul my logs out by hand , I try not to cut anything larger than nine inches in diameter .
Even aged oak is heavy .
Avoid badly rotted trees that fall apart in your hands .
Cutting down
Once you ’ve found a suitable dead tree , make sure there is a felling line .
A tree hemmed in by others close by is n’t worth bothering with .
Clear away the base area and any eyepoker branches near the tree .
Make sure you have good footing , especially in snowy and wet weather .
Drop your gear bag and saw 10 feet away , out of the felling line .
If the tree is thin enough to be shakable , put on all your protective gear and shake the trunk as hard as you can , looking up at the top all the while .
This whipping action often cracks off any “ widowmaker ” branches just waiting to snap off and stab you in the neck !
If any break off , run do not walk several yards away .
Next , plan the exact felling line .
A tree that ’s already leaning more than a few degrees in one direction will usually fall that way .
Now comes the big question : to notch or not ?
Someone could write a small book on the art of notching , but it wo n’t be me .
I almost never bother , unless I ’m cutting a large tree .
The notch advantage here is that it helps make a clean cut with minimal splintering of the trunk as it falls over .
Most trees come down smoothly with just one 20 or 30 - degree cut at the base .
Make sure any cutting companions are at least 50 feet away , to one side of the felling line .
Rev your saw to full speed before cutting and use the teeth at the bar ’s base to bite into the wood to help prevent kickback .
Always keep all parts of your body out of the saw ’s cutting plane .
Putting your head over even an idling saw could be dangerous .
One slip and your face will meet some sharp teeth when you hit the ground .
Once the tree starts definitely falling , release the throttle and quickly retreat at least 20 feet away at a right angle to the felling direction .
Standing behind that tree can be fatal .
Either springy top branches or your tree landing on a smaller , springy one can cause the trunk to break free from the cut and slam back like a battering ram faster than you can duck .
Debranching
Debranching is routine so it ’s very easy here to get careless and cut toward your leg or in line with your head .
Do n’t let your guard down .
I like to cut off all the branches before sectioning up the tree .
Toss them well out of your way and you ’re ready to start sectioning .
Begin at the top so that the bottom half will be lighter and easier to handle .
Using your saw ’s measuring mark , make shallow cuts to mark two logs then cut through at the third mark .
If your log length is less than 16 inches , add another log length to make your sections about five feet long .
As I approach the base of a thick tree , those marks get several inches closer together .
This makes the last few sections much lighter and the logs easier to split .
Watch for embedded nails , fence wire , and small rocks in the wood .
They can damage your chain and cause kickback .
When cutting sections flat on the ground , you should cut three quarters of the way through .
Do this until you can cut a section with air under it , then roll the trunk a half turn and finish the cuts .
Hauling out
For hauling from the woods during the winter , the author ’s homemade sled , complete with metal runners , does the trick of removing logs from the forest .
The sled should never be overloaded .
It makes going uphill more difficult and it can make going downhill treacherous .
Now comes the hardest part , getting those heavy logs home .
Cutting , splitting , and stacking in place is fine if you plan to use a pickup or ATV to haul the wood out soon .
I want to get those logs back to my woodpile ASAP for two reasons .
A sudden ice or snow storm could cut you off from your wood or someone might come along and take a strong liking to your beautiful logs .
I ’ve built two log haulers that make the job much easier .
My bike and the wood for my sled both came from a landfill dump .
For the bike find one with a straight frame and wheels , take off all the gear , fenders , and seat .
Make a new log seat out of a 16 - inch long piece of 2 by 6 - inch lumber .
Support that piece with a base built around the seat post .
Add boat cleats or large steel rings at each end and tie a 3 - foot long piece of thin rope to the far cleat .
Turn the handlebars up enough to create a carrying bracket up front .
Put on wide tires with rugged tread .
Use the bike only in dry weather .
Wet leaves or ice or snow make this hauler unsteady because the tires can slip and push the load onto you .
For snowy winter conditions my beefy sled is perfect .
It ’s made from two 1 ¾ by 6 - inch boards that are 60 inches long .
The top three 2 by 4 connectors are each 18 inches long .
The lower connectors are several inches off ground level and angled forward to plane the sled up over light snow .
Secure all connectors with 4 - inch long screws ( and a monster screwdriver ) .
Cut some smooth curves on the front ends , then stain all the wood .
Drill 4 holes about 2 inches deep at the corners and drop in some 12 - inch long bolts to keep the logs in the sled .
You ’ll need metal runners or the sled wo n’t slide much .
I used sheet aluminum .
Take your bottom , curved length measurement and your runner width to a sheet metal shop .
Have them cut the length and triple the runner width to allow for side overlaps , then ask them to bend each piece to form a U - shape the exact runner width .
Once home , put some shallow notches in the front curve area and nail the metal to each side of each runner with galvanized nails .
Drill two rope holes in front and put in a 27 - foot length of 3/8 inch rope .
I prefer manila because it stays warm and flexible in cold weather .
By doubling the rope you reduce its bite into your waist or shoulders .
If you ’ll be pulling up steep hills , do n’t overload the sled and overexert yourself .
Watch out going down slopes , also .
Do n’t let the sled pick up a lot of speed and run you down .
Logs in motion pack a punch .
Splitting
Once you ’ve bucked your logs into stove - size pieces , splitting the giant ones can be a chore .
I recently moved up from using a splitting maul to a hydraulic splitter .
It ’s a 4 - foot long steel “ I ” beam with a wedge at one end and a 10 - ton jack at the other .
Pumping two long handle levers moves the jack and rams a log against the wedge to split it .
This beauty requires no gas or electricity and really saves your back .
Check tool catalogs such as Harbor Freight Tools for one .
It costs about $ 150 .
Store your split logs under some sort of solid roof .
Tarps tend to load up with snow and ice , then rip and leak like crazy .
Completely dry wood is important for maximum heat output .
Yes , cutting your own firewood is a lot of work , but think of it as a free gym workout .
You ’ll find that the satisfaction and security of having those hunks of superb fuel stacked out back is fantastic .
Of course , saving hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on heating costs is the big reward .
It ’s real hard to have too much firewood , so keep on cutting .
At a time when BitTorrent sites are increasingly at odds with the music industry and file - sharing continues to flourish despite legal action , new thinking is called for .
Instead of joining the conflict with BitTorrent sites , Honor Roll Music has decided to sponsor isoHunt instead , one of the leading torrent search engines .
Awesome New Republic is a two member indie band based in Miami , Florida .
Both band members graduated at Frost School of Music and their first album , released in 2005 , was well received by the critics .
Together with their label Honor Roll Music they decided to try out quite an innovative marketing strategy to promote their latest album .
In order to get the word out , the label booked a monthly banner advertisement campaign on isoHunt , and linked that to a torrent file of the album that everyone can download for free .
By doing so they hope to get people excited about their music and eventually build a strong fanbase .
“ As far as we know , we are the first record label / band to advertise directly on a torrent search engine , ” Colin Foord , the creative brain behind the campaign told TorrentFreak .
“ We are sponsoring is oHunt with a banner that links directly to our homepage where the album can be downloaded for free . ”
Awesome New Republic ’s banner on isoHunt
In a music industry that is changing quickly , Honor Roll Music recognizes that torrent sites such as isoHunt should not be vilified , but turned into partners instead in order to reach millions of music fans eager to discover and download new music .
BitTorrent sites have proven to be a stepping stone for developing artists , rather than a threat .
With a limited marketing budget the label can’t afford to buy ad space on all major torrent sites , but the isoHunt sponsorship is a sign of good faith and shows that they do recognize the value of reaching out to the millions of active BitTorrent users .
The latest Awesome New Republic album titled “ Rational Geographic Vol 1 ” is available on several torrent sites , and everyone is free to download a copy and share it with friends .
Volume II will be released in July and Volume III , with a physical 3 - volume bundle , in October .
• Max Mosley : ' I will not stand for re-election now we have peace ' • Parallel Formula
One championship headed off at key meeting
Formula
One 's world governing body the FIA and the F1 teams association Fota have agreed today there will be no parallel championship next season following talks in Paris to avert a threatened breakaway .
The cost - cutting deal followed a meeting of 120 members of the FIA and came in the wake of weeks of bitter argument between the two bodies that centred on proposed tough spending limits from next season .
" There will be no split .
We have agreed to a reduction of costs , " said the FIA president Max Mosley .
" There will be one F1 championship , but the objective is to get back to the spending levels of the early 90s within two years . "
As a result of the deal Mosley said he would not seek to extend his time in office : " I will not be up for re-election now we have peace , " he said .
The 69 - year - old has been under pressure amid the disagreements emanating from the proposed budget cuts but had announced over the weekend that he was seriously considering running for a fifth term as head of F1 's governing body .
Bernie Ecclestone commented that he was " very happy common sense has prevailed " .
Eight teams – Ferrari , McLaren , BMW Sauber , Renault , Toyota , Red Bull , Toro Rosso and Brawn GP – had said they were pulling out of F1 last Friday after talks broke down over the introduction of a voluntary £ 40 m budget cap from next season .
The Paris meeting offered an opportunity for member clubs to hear from teams about their plan to break away from the FIA and set up a rival series , a proposal that had led the FIA to prepare a legal claim against Fota .
It is apparent a trade - off has unfolded - with the current teams now due to be on the grid for 2010 , and without Mosley as ruler .
It has to be remembered though that five years ago , in June 2004 , Mosley announced he would stand down from his position in October of that year - only to rescind his decision a month later .
Next year 's line - up
The following teams have been accepted for the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship :
Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro
Vodafone McLaren Mercedes
BMW Sauber F1 Team
Renault F1 Team
Panasonic Toyota Racing
Scuderia Toro Rosso
Red Bull Racing
AT&T Williams
Force India F1 Team
Brawn GP Formula One Team
Campos Meta Team
Manor Grand Prix
Team US F1

March is among the teams to have lodged an entry for the 2010 Formula 1 World Championship .
March Racing Organisation still exists as a non-trading registered company , despite not having any involvement in motorsport since the F1 team collapsed in the build - up to the 1993 season .
The company is owned by British businessman and chairman of English football club Swindon Town , Andrew Fitton , who acquired March in 1993 .
The team is unwilling to make any further comment on its plans until the FIA announces its 2010 entry list on June 12 .
AUTOSPORT understands that March has nominated Cosworth as its engine supplier on its application and would have to start up its operation from scratch should it be granted an entry .
March Engineering was co-founded by FIA president Max Mosley , along with Alan Rees , Robin Herd and Graham Coaker .
In 1970 , it made its first foray into F1 as both a works team and a customer car supplier , with the Ken Tyrrell - run March 701 of Jackie Stewart taking a debut pole .
In all , March started 197 grands prix , winning the 1970 Spanish , 1975 Austrian and 1976 Italian Grands Prix , before dropping out of F1 for good after the 1992 season , during which it scored just three points .
March is one of a number of teams that has lodged entries for F1 .
Among its rivals for entries are Prodrive , Lola , Team Superfund , Team US F1 , Litespeed , Epsilon Euskadi and Campos Meta1 .
iRobot has built over 2,000 machines for the military .
Most of ’em are 50 pounds plus , and more than three feet long .
But , lately , the company has been working on an itty - bitty version of its Packbot reconnaissance machine — one that weighs less than a pound , and is about the size of a paperback book .
The idea is for a soldier to dispatch a swarm of these “ Ember ” bots to scout out a possibly - hostile building , instead of sending a single , large Packbot .
Once inside , the Embers would set up an ad - hoc wireless network , and then autonomously scurry around the floor ( kind of like iRobot ’s Roomba vaccum cleaning automaton ) .
Tiny flippers will help them vault over objects .
Cameras will beam the scene back to the G.I .
Under a Darpa ’s LANDroids program , iRobot has shown nine of the robo-critters networked together .
The company is a year into a three year , $ 2.5 million deal to develop the Embers .
Ultimately , the goal is make the little robots so easy to use and so cheap that they ’re considered disposable .
And that could change the way soldiers wage urban war .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , U.S. troops today employ thousands of robots .
But they ’re still considered specialized tools , used mostly to hunt for and get rid of improvised bombs .
Make robots this small , and this user - friendly , however , and every infantryman will be able to carry ’em around .
The soldiers will find all kinds of new ways to use their pocket - sized scouts – from tracking down insurgents to monitoring checkpoints to sneaking into militant hideouts .
You can imagine the little robots everywhere .

Editor 's note : Buzz Aldrin , whose new book is " Magnificent Desolation , " was one of the two American astronauts who were the first people to set foot on the moon .
Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon in a photo taken by Neil Armstrong , his colleague on the 1969 mission .
( CNN ) --
Four decades have passed since the summer of 1969 , when Neil Armstrong , Mike Collins and I flew America 's first lunar landing mission .
The passage of time has not faded either the memory of that summer or the importance of what we achieved , for our mission was about more than just exploring the moon .
On July 20 , 1969 , Neil and I were peering out the window of our lunar lander , the Eagle , as it descended toward the lunar surface .
The ship 's computer was steering us toward a field of boulders the size of cars .
That same computer -- with less power than today 's pocket calculators -- was signaling that it was overworked and dangerously overloaded .
Our single tank of fuel was nearly empty as we approached the surface , invisible to us , cloaked in a cloud of swirling dust .
Neil took manual control and flew us toward a smoother terrain .
Then , as the shadow of our landing gear appeared etched onto the surface in the gloom , a light on our console flashed that contact had been made .
" Houston , Tranquility Base Here , " Neil radioed to the listening world back home .
" The Eagle has landed ! "
For more than two hours , we explored the moon 's dusty surface .
We could easily tell that the planet we had landed on was very different from our home .
The horizon visibly curved away in the distance , a sign of the moon 's much smaller landscape .
When my boot struck moon dust , the soils flew away in a straight line , a sign of the lighter gravity load , one - sixth that of Earth .
When I looked around the stark landscape , it was a magnificent desolation .
An uninviting world greeted us in eerie silence , hostile to our presence and to all visitors from Earth .
The following day , we rocketed up off the surface , rejoined Mike Collins orbiting alone in our command ship , the Columbia , and headed home to a hero 's welcome .

That welcome took us all around the world in parades , banquets and greetings from millions .
I was astonished that so many had followed every facet of our flight from start to finish , almost as if they were part of the adventure .
That spirit , of a world come together in celebration of a peaceful scientific achievement , was perhaps our greatest legacy .
More than just exploring a hostile new world , Apollo 11 was about bold vision and great risk , about the obstacles a great nation could overcome with dedication , courage and teamwork .
It was about choosing a goal that exceeded our grasp -- and then reaching across history to make it happen .
For me , the most difficult part of the mission was n't what happened during the flight but what happened after we came home .
Without a new mission to train for , I felt lost and without a purpose .
My personal life was marked by deep depression and bouts of drinking .
Nothing I did seemed to have meaning or motivation for me .
I left the Air Force , the space program , and was adrift .
But then , as I began to recover my bearings , something wonderful happened .
I met a woman , Lois Driggs Cannon , who helped me to climb out of my depression and see a role for me in space -- but this time while on Earth .
I came to dedicate my life to opening space to the average person and crafting designs for new spaceships that could take us far from home .
But since Apollo ended , such travels were only in our collective memory .
For these past decades , our country has achieved great things in space .
It has built a reusable spacecraft and flown it more than 100 times .
It has orbited great observatories that have unlocked the secrets of the universe .
Most impressively , it has helped construct an orbiting laboratory that offers the prospect of long - term research into the effects of space flight , research that can not just improve the health and safety of our astronauts but also of people on Earth .
But what America has n't done is inspire the world -- and itself -- with a bold vision for our future in space .
We have remained , since our Apollo days , locked in Earth orbit .
But five years ago , NASA was tasked with returning to the moon by 2020 , rerunning the moon race that we won 40 years ago .
Not surprisingly , this new race has failed to ignite the imagination of young Americans -- or their leaders .
What we truly need is not more Cold War - style competition but a destination in space that offers great rewards for the risks to achieve it .
I believe that destination must be homesteading Mars , the first human colony on another world .
By refocusing our space program on Mars for America 's future , we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969 .
We won the moon race ; now it 's time for us to live and work on Mars , first on its moons and then on its surface .
Exploring and colonizing Mars can bring us new scientific understanding of climate change , of how planet - wide processes can make a warm and wet world into a barren landscape .
By exploring and understanding Mars , we may gain key insights into the past and future of our own world .
Just as Mars -- a desert planet -- gives us insights into global climate change on Earth , the promise awaits for bringing back to life portions of the Red Planet through the application of Earth Science to its similar chemistry , possibly reawakening its life - bearing potential .
Four decades ago , I was privileged to have been part of a great mission of exploration and discovery .
But America 's future in space has only just started .
It is time for us to continue the journey .

This week , it 's the co-op proposal , designed to leave the risk pools so fragmented and the co-ops so small as to have zero influence on the insanely inflated prices in the health care market .
Yeah , we know why the Rick Scott groupies like this idea .
Kent Conrad , Max Baucus , Ben Nelson , Joe Lieberman and Harry Reid , I 'm talking to you .
Because we 're sick of hearing your lame excuses .
We 're tired of necessary legislation like health care reform being watered down , sandbagged and sabotaged because you want to cave to the insurance industry .
We 're sick of your craven cowardice .
We gave your party the majority so you can fulfill promises to fix our economy , extricate us from Bush 's wars and repair a health care system that 's so badly broken that up to 100,000 people die every year from inadequate health care in the richest country in the world .
Harry Reid , you 're the Senate Majority Leader .
Stop sniveling .
Do n't tell us that you do n't have the votes .
Go get the votes .
That 's your job .
Try acting like LBJ instead of a jellyfish , and you 'll be amazed at how much can be done with a little arm - twisting .
And do n't tell me that you need 60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate .
The only reason that is the case is because you allow it to be the case .
It does n't take sixty votes to pass a bill .
It takes 51 .
Perhaps you could make it clear to fellow members of your party that it 's unacceptable for a Democrat to vote against cloture for a Democratic bill , but they 're perfectly free to vote against it in the final vote if they have to object .
And if all that fails , you 've got reconciliation , if you 've got a pair ...

Kent Conrad , do n't tell me that the only way to get cloture on a bill is to water it down and cave in to unreasonable Republican demands .
Perhaps you 've forgotten that past senators in this quandry deal with it by going on the bobblehead shows , but instead of saying " We do n't have the votes , " they say " The opposition are holding this bill hostage by refusing to let it come to an up - or - down vote ! "
It 's amazing how many Republicans will start walking back when they 're publicly shamed for obstructionism .
You only need a couple .
I could keep giving this sort of condescending " advice " , but you know , and we , the voters all know the real game that 's going on .
So let me ask you a question .
Are you going to grow a pair , show some strength and start acting in the best interests of the country and your voters ?
Or are you going to continue to play games with us , feeding us lines of bullshit designed to fool us into complacency , so you can take a dive for your buddies in the insurance industry who 've given you hundreds of thousands of dollars in tasty campaign money ?
I 've got news for you .
We the People have wised up .
We 're no longer falling for Harry and Louise ads.
88 % of us want either single - payer or a public option .
And most of us have been , at the minimum , screwed out of thousands of dollars of insurance premiums , deductibles and medical bills .
Some of us have been driven into bankruptcy or chronic illness because of our broken system .
That makes us really , really pissed off .
We 're no longer buying the old excuses .
We 're all laughing at the Republicans who are crying about " socialized medicine "
And some of us do n't even watch much TV anymore as we become an Internet society .
That means that if you stand with us , do the right thing , even at the expense of your insurance friends , we 'll watch your back and stand with you .
If you continue with the same old bullshit , those tasty millions in insurance lobby money wo n't save you from electoral defeat .
So stop feeding us bullshit .
You promised us health care reform .
GET IT DONE !!!
UPDATE : I got a request to post some phone numbers and contact information , so people reading this can contact their Congresscritters and Senators and give them some public pressure .
YOU GOT IT !!!
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
The lawyer representing an Iranian - American journalist jailed by Tehran for espionage said Monday he was optimistic she would be acquitted on appeal .
Roxana Saberi was sentenced Saturday to eight years in jail on charges of spying for the United States in a verdict that could complicate Washington ’s efforts for reconciliation with the Islamic Republic after three decades of mutual mistrust .
But in an intervention welcomed by her defense lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Tehran ’s general prosecutor Sunday to ensure that the 31 - year - old freelance reporter enjoys full legal rights to defend herself .
In a decree to Tehran ’s top court official , judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi said the “ different dimensions of this case ... must be considered at the appeals stage in a careful , quick and fair way . ”
Khorramshahi told Reuters : “ I ’m very hopeful and optimistic she will be acquitted in the appeal stage , or at least that there will be a reduction in her sentence . ”
“ The attention of the head of government to this issue and case can have a positive impact on the proceeding , ” he said , confirming he planned to lodge the appeal early next week .
Analysts cautioned against seeing Saberi ’s conviction as a sign of Tehran rebuffing overtures by the new U.S. administration of President Barack Obama , who has offered a new beginning of engagement if Iran “ unclenches its fist . ”
Iran , which marked its annual armed forces day Saturday with a relatively low - key parade and little sign of the usual anti-Western slogans , says it would welcome constructive talks with world powers on its disputed nuclear work and other issues .
Saberi , who is a citizen of both the United States and Iran , was arrested in January for working in the country after her press credentials had expired .
“ I do n’t think it has got anything to do with the Obama opening , ” said Ali Ansari , an Iran expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland .
“ It may affect it but I do n’t think it was driven or determined by it . ”
Ansari said he would not be surprised if her sentence was reduced on appeal .
GOODWILL GESTURE ?
Obama said Sunday he was “ deeply concerned ” for the safety of Saberi and urged Tehran to free her , saying he was confident she was not involved in spying .
Iran ’s foreign ministry spokesman , Hassan Qashqavi , said the United States should respect rulings issued by the Islamic state ’s courts , but that Saberi had the right to appeal .

An Iranian court has sentenced Iranian - American freelance journalist Roxana Saberi to eight years in jail , her lawyer told Reuters April 18 , 2009 .
Saberi was accused of spying for the United States .

Referring to the statement by Obama , who has worked as a civil rights lawyer , Qashqavi said one should not express views on a case without studying its contents : “ I ’m sure some American officials have also studied law , ” he said .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said releasing Saberi , who has worked for the BBC and U.S. National Public Radio ( NPR ) , would serve as a goodwill gesture .
Her father , Reza Saberi , told NPR Saturday she had been coerced into statements that she later retracted .
Reporters Without Borders , the Paris - based media rights group , has called Saberi ’s conviction “ unjust under the Iranian criminal code ” and said it was a warning to foreign reporters working in Iran ahead of its June presidential election .
Washington cut ties with Iran shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979 , but Obama is seeking to engage it on a range of issues , including the nuclear dispute .
Iran says it wants to see a real switch in Washington ’s policies away from those of former President George W. Bush , who led a drive to isolate the country because of its nuclear program .
Iran says it only wants to generate electricity , but the United States suspects it seeks to build an atomic bomb .
So what do you do when you 're an anti-spending , pro-secession conservative governor whose publicly - owned mansion needs $ 21 million in repairs to recover from fire damage ?
Apparently , you do something like this ( via diarist gsadamb [ update : and also Velvet Revolution ] ) :
AUSTIN , Texas – While Gov. Rick Perry is criticizing Washington bailouts , state lawmakers are planning to use $ 11 million in federal stimulus money to help rebuild the badly burned Texas Governor 's Mansion .
Approximately $ 10 million in state tax money will also be spent on a renovation , which is expected to cost about $ 20 million , officials said Thursday .
This , of course , is the same Rick Perry who , along with a handful of other Republican extremists , rejected stimulus money for jobless Texans , and recently said that Texas would consider seceding if the federal government did n't dramatically cut spending .
Perry 's office says he 's working with the Republican lawmakers who are securing the federal funds , but do n't be surprised if Perry changes his tune on the renovations once word starts to get out about the $ 11 million federal price tag .
Do n't cry for him while this all gets worked out , however -- he 's currently living in a publicly - funded $ 10,000 per month rental .
The governor has been living in a three - story , limestone home with a heated pool , an outdoor cabana and a guest house .
The state is paying some $ 9,900 - a- month in rent while the Governor 's Mansion undergoes renovations , records show .
Being the " frugal secessionist " is such hard work , is n't it ?

Just like its rivals for consumers ’ disposable income , America ’s $ 90 - billion - a - year gaming and casino industry is significantly driven by database marketing .
But gaming customers are very different in one major respect .
While adult patrons of a hit movie , for example , know they will spend about $ 8 to $ 10 on a ticket , perhaps buy soda and popcorn and then head home , some casino customers lose huge sums of money while a few others might actually make a profit , especially those who are skilled at games such as blackjack .
Can casino owners more accurately identify and predict which of their regular customers will lose the most money ?
How often will these customers visit ?
How will they allocate their bets among slots and tables ?
By targeting those players , can casinos follow up with a more effective direct marketing campaign ?
The questions inspired two Wharton faculty members and a colleague at New York University ’s Stern School of Business to see if they could develop a mathematical model to identify these most lucrative customers .
The three researchers — marketing professors Raghuram Iyengar and Jehoshua Eliashberg , and Sam K. Hui , a marketing professor at Stern — say that the answer is an unqualified yes .
Indeed , they wonder why casinos are n’t already using these tools .
The issue for casinos “ is one of attracting their best customers , ” said Iyengar , noting that most casinos and slots parlors already collect some types of extensive marketing data on their customers .
“ Our list overlaps somewhat with their list , but the lists are not identical . ”
The casinos are reaching out to their customers , “ but they could be doing it better . ”
The study by Iyengar , Eliashberg and Hui — entitled “ A Model for Gamers ’ Revenue in Casinos ” — develops a mathematical model which integrates gamers ’ frequency of casino visits , their total wagers and the distribution of those bets at table games versus slots machines .
The researchers determined if revenue from specific players was derived from “ skill ” or “ luck , ” and they were able to identify players who are highly skilled or perhaps revenue - producing high rollers .
Avoiding ‘ Unattractive Customers ’
In addition , the team looked at ways that demographics could provide casino owners with valuable marketing insights .
The data suggested , for example , that women devote more of their spending to slot machines than to table games like blackjack , and that men have a higher level of skill at the gaming tables than women .
Iyengar and Eliashberg suggested that more useful information could have been gathered if they had been given more specific demographic data .
“ This information would really help [ casinos ] target more precisely the most attractive customers , because you certainly do n’t want to target the unattractive customers , ” Eliashberg said .
“ You want to spend your money where you get the most bang for your buck . ”
While the characteristics they studied are fairly unique to the gaming industry , the authors said there are other business situations in which customers can be identified and targeted based on their specific skills or unusual customer behavior .
For instance , they noted that better modeling of customer behavior might help hotel managers to more intelligently market the use of mini-bars or business centers , or allow car - rental firms to target extra-cost products like GPS units or satellite radios .
But it is the sheer size of the casino industry in the United States that makes it such a strong candidate for this kind of individualized predictive modeling , more commonly known as database marketing .
Americans spend more money on gaming than on trips to the cinema by a 10 - 1 ratio , and more money is lost during a typical casino visit than is spent in an average visit to a mall .
Of the $ 90 billion spent on legalized gaming , according to the American Gaming Association , some $ 59 billion is spent in casinos as opposed to lotteries or pari-mutuel wagering .
Unique aspects of the casino industry suggest that casino operators should be developing different tools for customer relationship management than , for example , mall operators — who analyze how much customers spend on a typical visit to a store and what products they purchased .
Through the use of gaming loyalty cards and other tools , casino executives have the ability to more closely track the performance of individual gamers .
Access to such player - level behavior , together with mathematical modeling , can help uncover a gambler ’s level of skill — an important consideration in determining the individual targets of direct marketing campaigns .
“ The use of mathematical models to predict future behavior is very important [ because ] the most recent profitable gamer is not necessarily going to remain [ the ] most profitable in the future , ” Eliashberg said .
“ You have to look at the frequency of going to a casino in general and combine it with all sorts of aspects of wagering behavior .
Does the customer wager more on slot machines or at the tables ?
You also have to look at the skill level .
You need a model for human beings . ”
Iyengar and Eliashberg noted that casinos already perform broad mathematical calculations — based on aggregate behavior — in an effort to predict their overall revenues and profits .
The goal of this research , they said , was to come up with a mathematical model that would measure the difference between a typical player ’s theoretical and real spending relative to the player ’s skill level .
The use of a “ formal model , which makes clear distinctions among individual gamers , ” is a more effective tool than a casino operator ’s “ judgment based on intuition , ” Eliashberg stated .
‘ Share of Wallet ’
The data that researchers examined came from a major U.S. casino operator with gambling facilities in a number of U.S. locations .
It provided the authors with detailed information — gathered through the use of loyalty cards — on more than 1,500 customers who made a total of about 9,000 casino visits from December 2004 through April 2007 .
The gaming company also offered age and gender information for about 400 of those customers .
To determine the skill of the players , the authors ran through a series of complex calculations based upon factors , including the particular games the individual played , the expected take by the casino versus the actual take , and whether a gambler ’s winning or losing on one visit affected behavior on the next .
While the researchers noted that more work must be done to learn how a gambler ’s skill improves at a game , such as blackjack , over time , they believe their model can be a powerful starting point .
For example , the authors predict that this new and more detailed type of data can be combined with customer survey results to obtain much better information on so - called “ share of wallet ” — that is , how much of the money that a gambler budgets for the casino is actually lost on a visit .
Beyond that , they also urge additional research on casino promotional activities — such as complimentary hotel stays or cash - back awards — in order to develop a better sense of how marketing efforts affect high and low revenue gamblers differently .
In addition , they note that the customized data could help operators as they weigh how to better design their casino floor space to increase revenues , such as the use of environmental cues to encourage gambling or altering the ratio of table games to slot machines .
“ The behavior may change from one facility to another , but we believe this information is helpful in designing your facility in line with customer behavior , ” Eliashberg said .
In future research , the authors note , they would like to examine more demographic data such as relationship status , home address , profession and education level to gain even more insights into gambling habits .
According to Iyengar , the research has implications in other industries .
“ A sales force manager could better understand how a person makes a sale , ” Iyengar said .
“ It might make a difference if they could figure out whether it ’s the product that ’s selling or whether it ’s the skill level of the sales person . ”
Jewish World Review June 2 , 2009 / 10 Sivan 5769 The Speech President Obama Wo n't Dare Give in Egypt By Dennis Prager
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
This week , President Barack Obama is scheduled to give a major address in Cairo to the Muslim world .
He is likely to reiterate what he has stated previously to Muslim audiences , that America has no battle with Islam , deeply respects Islam and the Muslim world , and apologizes for any anti-Muslim sentiment that any Americans may express .
Here is what an honest address would sound like :
" Thank you for the honor of addressing the Egyptian people and the wider Muslim world .
" I am here primarily to dispel some of the erroneous beliefs many Muslims have about America and to thereby reassure you that America has no desire to be at war with the Muslim world .
" To my great disappointment , many Muslims have come to believe that my country has declared war on Muslims and Islam .
" Because of this widespread belief , I said in an interview with al - Arabiya a few months ago , that we need to restore " the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago . "
" Lets ' look a little deeper at that relationship .
For the truth is , as noted by the Pulitzer - Prize winning columnist for the American newspaper the Washington Post , Charles Krauthammer , in the last 20 - 30 years America did not just respect Muslims , it bled for Muslims .
We Americans engaged in five military campaigns on behalf of Muslims , each one resulting in the liberation of a Muslim people : Bosnia , Kosovo , Kuwait , Afghanistan and Iraq .
" Bosnia and Kosovo , as well as the failed 1992 - 93 Somalia intervention to feed starving African Muslims  in which ]
43 Americans were killed  were all humanitarian exercises .
In none of them was there a significant U.S. strategic interest at stake .
So , in fact , in these 20 years , my country , the United States of America has done more for suffering and oppressed Muslims than any other nation , Muslim or non-Muslim .
" While I recognize that gratitude is the rarest positive human quality , I need to say  because candor is the highest form respect  that America has not only not received little gratitude from the Muslim world , it has been the object of hatred , mass murder , and economic attack from Muslim individuals , groups , and countries .

" In 1973 , Muslim terrorists attacked the American embassy in Sudan and murdered our country 's ambassador , Cleo Noel , and the chief deputy of the mission , George C. Moore .
Later in 1973 , the Arab oil embargo against America sent my country into a long and painful recession .
In 1977 , Muslim militants murdered the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon , Frances E. Meloy , and Robert O.Waring , the U.S. economic counselor .
In 1979 radical Muslims violently attacked my country 's embassy in Teheran , and for 14 months held American diplomats hostage , often in appalling conditions .
In 1998 , Muslim militants bombed the American embassy in Nairobi , killing 12 Americans and 280 Kenyans , and bombed our embassy in Tanzania , killing another 11 Americans .
Then , on Sept. 11 , 2001 , 19 Muslims who had been living in America slit the throats of American pilots and flight attendants and then flew airplanes into civilian buildings in New York City , burning 3,000 innocent Americans to death .
" So , my friends here in Egypt , between America and the Muslim world , who exactly has been making war on whom ?
" I have enormous differences with my predecessor , President George W. Bush .
But please remember that less than a week after thousands of Americans were slaughtered in the name of your religion , President Bush went to the Islamic Center in Washington , D.C. , and announced that Islam was a religion of peace .
Moreover , in a country of 300 million people , of whom only a few million are Muslim , there is virtually no recorded incident of anti-mosque or other anti-Muslim violence despite the butchery of 9/11 and the popular support for Osama Bin Laden that we saw in the Muslim world after 9/11 .
" I ask you to please ask yourselves what Egypt 's reaction would have been had 19 Christians , in the name of Christianity , slaughtered 3,000 Egyptians .
How would the Christians of Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East have fared ?
" As it is , because of persecution by Muslim majorities , Christians have been leaving the Middle East in such great numbers that for the first time since Christ , there are large parts of the Middle East that have become empty of both Jews and Christians .
" Yet , at the same time , millions of Muslims have moved to Western countries and to America .
It is fair to say that the freest , and often the safest , place in the world for a practicing Muslim is the United States of America .
" Muslim - Americans are treated exactly as other Americans are treated .
It is exceedingly rare to hear any anti-Muslim bigotry in my country .
And while there is some criticism of the Muslim world , but there is far more criticism of Christianity in America than of Islam .
" Unfortunately , in much of the Muslim world today anti-Jewish speeches and writing are frequently identical to the genocidal anti-Semitism one heard and read in Nazi Germany .
This is a blight on your civilization .
How can you seriously charge that America is at war with Islam when in fact it is much of the Islamic world that is at war with Jews and Christians ?
" I know that you would like me to announce that America is abandoning its support for Israel .
But every president since Harry Truman , Democrat and Republican , has been passionate about enabling Israel to defend itself from those who wish to destroy it .
And that , dear Muslims , is the issue .
America will continue to support a two - state solution to the Arab - Israeli dispute , but the issue has never really been about two states .
It has always been about Palestinians and other Arabs and Muslims recognizing Israel 's right to exist as a Jewish state .
" As a friend of Egypt and of the Muslim world , I want to say something from the bottom of my heart :
The day the Arab world ceases obsessing over the existence of a Jewish state the size of Belize will be a great day for the Arab and Muslim worlds .
Your obsession with Israel has cost you dearly in every area of social development .
This is easily demonstrated .
If Israel were destroyed  and the so - called " right of return " of millions of third - generation Palestinian refugees would ensure that outcome as effectively as would a nuclear device from Iran  what difference would that make to the Egyptian economy , to Egyptian lack of freedoms , or anything else that matters to Egyptians ?
In my opinion , none whatsoever .
Preoccupation with Israel has simply enabled the Arab world to not look within for 60 years .
" Finally , my fellow Americans would feel more confident in American - Muslim relations if they had ever seen a large demonstration of Muslims anywhere against all the terror committed by Muslims in the name of Islam  whether in London , Madrid , New York , Bali , Cairo , or Mumbai .
The mark of a great civilization  and Arab civilization was indeed once great  is a willingness to criticize itself .
" Thank you again for this opportunity to address you .
I could have patronized you by exaggerating American misdeeds and ignoring yours .
But I have too much respect for you .

Sunday 's Titans - Steelers game has been postponed as a result of the multiple positive COVID - 19 cases affecting the Titans , a league source tells PFT .
The Titans have shut their facility down for the week because of the positive tests , which yesterday included three players and five staff members , and today included a fourth player .

A set of photographs showing the private side of Adolf Hitler have been published for the first time .
The colour pictures come from the collection of Hugo Jaeger , Hitler 's personal photographer , who captured him on camera him from 1936 to the final days of his rule in 1945 .
Jaeger hid thousands of transparencies in a leather suitcase at the end of the war .
The case was found by six US soldiers as they searched a house near Munich where he was staying but they were more interested in a bottle of cognac he had also slipped inside .

Did you know that seventeen year old Julie Dales of Canada won the recent Beatbox Battle Online World Championship ?
You may not be aware such an event was going on , but even if you ’re not into such things , it ’s one of those cool videos you should check out .
Here ’s her audition from YouTube :
and here ’s and earlier demonstration of her talents :
What 's in a name ?
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet , but if its name ended in " pod , " it might attract the ire of Apple 's shark - like legal team .
Apple 's obsession with the blockbuster success of its iPod has driven the corporation to chase down many companies attempting to use the media player 's three - letter suffix in their product or business names .
Names that have come under fire include MyPodder , TightPod , PodShow , and even Podium .
On Monday , Sector Labs , a small business whose Video Pod trademark has been blocked by Apple , took legal action to fight back .
" It appears that Apple is not only trying to put an iPod in everybody 's hands and white earbuds in everyone 's ears but to control the use of our language and most particularly the word ' Pod , ' " Sector Labs '
lawyers wrote in a 239 - page response to Apple 's trademark opposition , which has blocked Video Pod 's development .
" If we are not careful , in
Apple 's quest for dominance , they will soon attempt to take over the words ' Phone ' and ' Tunes ' — let us hope they do not attempt a coup over the exclusive rights to the letter ' i ' . "
Apple 's trademark scuffle with Sector Labs is not unique .
The corporation began cracking down on businesses attempting to use the word " pod " as far back as 2006 .
One of the earliest examples involved Podcast Ready , which developed a podcast - downloading application called MyPodder .
Apple sent a cease - and - desist to Podcast Ready , claiming that " pod " has become commonly associated with Apple 's famous iPod , and using the three - letter word could cause consumer confusion .
Apple subsequently took the same action against several other companies , including TightPod , an independent business that sold protective covers for notebooks , which later renamed itself to TightJacket .
A low - profile example involved a start - up called PodShow , a social networking web site for video podcasters .
Though the start - up later renamed itself to Mevio to coincide with a site redesign , it 's worth noting that Apple in June
2008 filed an opposition to the company 's usage of PodShow .
Seven months later , Apple withdrew that opposition [ pdf ] .
A Hoovers search query turns up about 600 companies that use the word " pod " in their name , including Peapod and PODS International .
But clearly , Apple has n't given up on the battle for this word .
Just last week , Apple sent a cease - and - desist letter to Pivotal , a company marketing an iPhone stand called Podium .
In that letter ,
Apple cited the same reasons — consumer confusion and protecting its intellectual property .
Pivotal told Wired.com that it plans to file a formal response to Apple on Wednesday .
" I absolutely understand a company protecting their intellectual property , " said Scott Baumann , president of Pivotal , in a phone interview .
" But to start taking ownership of the letters P - O - D — a word that 's in the dictionary — certainly seems far - reaching to me .
It certainly seems like a stretch . "
Though
Sector Labs ' response to Apple was published only Monday , the start - up 's trademark scuffle with Apple over Video Pod began March 6 ,
2007 , when Apple filed an opposition to the registration of the Video
Pod trademark .
In the face of that opposition , Sector Labs halted development and funding of the product .
Apple then filed a motion for summary judgment — asking for a ruling to be made without going to trial .
But rather than throw in the towel , Sector Labs owner Daniel Kokin filed a response to Apple 's motion for summary judgment , continuing the fight .
In its response , Sector Labs claims the Video
Pod , a video projector designed to work with a DVD player and other input devices ( not the iPod ) , has been in development since 2000 — a year before Apple launched its first iPod. Sector Labs ' legal team added that Apple has the burden to prove that a probability of consumer confusion exists .
" The ordinary reasonable consumer must be confused about the source of the
Video Pod itself , " Sector Labs ' response reads [ pdf ] .
" Apple 's opposition falls far short of establishing that it is probable that consumers would actually be confused . "
Pinnacle Law Group principal Eric
Farber , who is representing Sector Labs , said Apple 's intention is clearly to intimidate smaller companies who would more easily fold under the pressure of a corporation as large as Apple .
" Apple is using their power and strength to attempt to knock out very legitimate marks at a stage for start - ups that is very critical , where a great many of them do n't have the money to fight a behemoth like Apple , " Farber said in a phone interview .
Apple 's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on this story .
Apple 's fans typically leap to defend the corporation , but Wired.com readers commenting on last week 's story about Podium unanimously disapproved of Apple 's actions .
" Apple 's got a good point about such flagrant use of the syllable ' pod , ' " commented Max Beta .
" Why , just last week I was tricked into going into the office of someone who claimed to be some kind of ' doctor . '
The guy did n’t know anything about music or iPods® , and he had some kind of weird foot fetish .
You should n't be able to call yourself a podiatrist unless you are associated with Apple in some way ! "
Apple must file a response to Sector Labs by April 1 , and then Sector Labs will have the opportunity to respond as well .

He continues , Here is an email I wrote to FOSS Nepal mailing list .
I wanted to post a similar message to some international mailing lists ( like the FSF , EFF ) but I know only of announcement mailing lists of that kind .
If you have something to suggest , please do .
We 're committed to doing everything we can to make sure that in the future Nepal becomes a country where digital liberties are fully respected .
It 's my personal dream to make our constitution a model for all other developing ( or otherwise ) countries as far as digital liberties are concerned .
There are many issues on which your suggestions would be valuable .
If you 've interesting examples from history , they 'd help too .
If you 're a legal expert , please mention the legal hassles our issues could generate .
If you 're from the FSF , the EFF etc , please provide your insights .
If you 're just another citizen like me , how would you like your government to address file sharing , privacy , anonymity , platform neutrality , open standards , etc ?

While playing inFamous , a new game that puts you in the shoes of an electrically charged bike messenger with ambiguous morals , I continually flashed back to Bionic Commando .
Both games cast you as a gruff antihero in a ruined city , where you use superpowers to climb skyscrapers , leap around ruins and take out swaths of enemy soldiers .
Besides the fact that the somewhat lame Bionic Commando is linear while inFamous plops you into a Grand Theft Auto - style open city , the two games are quite similar in style .
So why is inFamous , released Tuesday for PlayStation 3 , engaging where its competition is merely frustrating ?
It ’s not about peculiarities of the games ’ control schemes , details of their level design or the difficulty curves encountered by first - time players .
It ’s because inFamous keeps you engaged , never dumping you out to a long loading screen if you die , always making you feel like you ’re progressing even when you ’re struggling .
Yes , inFamous suffers from a host of little problems , but all those minor missteps get smoothed over by the fact that you never want to stop playing the game .
The makers of inFamous obeyed the cardinal rule of good game design :
They kept everything fun .
Let ’s back up a bit .
InFamous is the first PlayStation 3 game from Sucker Punch Productions , creator of the Sly Cooper action series for PS2 .
In InFamous , you play Cole , a bike messenger who finds himself delivering a package that explodes in a massive ball of electricity , wiping out a whole mess of people , throwing the city into chaos and imbuing him with electric superpowers .
Besides giving the player a chance to spend 20 hours or so frying the inevitable waves of bad people that tend to descend on post - apocalyptic cities , inFamous ‘ central conceit is that Cole can choose whether to be good or bad .
In real life , making decisions that are selfish versus generous tends to be a gray area .
Not so in inFamous : Choosing between the game ’s good and evil story branches revolves almost entirely around a dozen or so critical points in the story , at which you can choose to either do something nice ( help a stranger defend his stash of helpful goodies ) or mean ( kill him and take them for yourself ) .
If you choose to do good , Cole will be loved by all the people of the city ; if you choose to be a jerk , they ’ll run from him .
Otherwise , the story does n’t change much — good or bad , you ’re still trying to face down a mysterious enemy and figure out why they set that electric bomb off in the first place .
The story kept me interested , even if the telling was a bit choppy .
The big plot points occur during comic book - style cinematic interludes with no dialogue — just narration from Cole .
These are much nicer to look at than the uneven 3 - D gameplay graphics , but they ’re so stylistically different that the two do n’t mesh well .
If you just want to keep the story moving , you can take on the lengthy “ story missions ” that are scattered about the city .
But I found it more beneficial to tackle the game ’s wide range of side missions before advancing the plot .
Playing the side missions , which generally only take a few minutes each , allows you to clear out bad guys from the city and earn more experience points , which you can spend on new powers .
While the powers you earn as a good or bad character are slightly different , most of them involve producing electricity from your fingertips in various forms : from little balls of lightning that act like grenades to big ol ’ lightning storms that mow down rows of bad guys at once .
The downside to this unique concept is that it never really makes sense why one ball of blue lightning works on certain enemies when all the others do n’t .
Why do I need to use grenades to kill one enemy , but not another ?
Are n’t they all just … balls of blue lightning ?
The powers that you ’ll be most happy to unlock and upgrade are the ones that let you travel around Empire City in style .
By the game ’s end , you ’ll be grinding on telephone wires and train tracks , flying for short distances and generally moving from place to place quickly without having to touch the ground .
The city is a modern metropolis with the exception of the fact that it does not bury its power lines ; this is excellent for Cole , as he can ride them from building to building .
Some of my favorite missions were built around line - riding :
You ’re given a set amount of time to race between satellite dishes on top of buildings , and you have to use the wires perfectly to make it in time .
These missions are largely about trial and error , as you find the perfect path between the dishes .
This is precisely the sort of thing that could get frustrating , but inFamous makes the discovery process compelling .
How ?
When you miss a dish , you ’re instantly jumped back to the beginning of the course to start again — no loading screen , no laborious backtracking to the start of the race .
It ’s not like Prince of Persia , where there ’s zero penalty for failure :
You must learn from your mistakes and execute the run perfectly to win .
But it ’s a pleasant learning experience that feels great when you finally nail the task .
This is how nearly every mission in inFamous feels .
There are a great variety of them : escorting prisoners to jail , clearing out a gang of enemies , finding hidden packages , riding electrified buses , destroying electrified buses , etc .
Some take two minutes , some might take 20 .
But generous checkpoints are scattered throughout each , so that you rarely get that feeling of repetition .
And even if you do fail over and over , you ’re still earning lots of experience points by slaughtering enemies .
So it ’s never a total loss .
By making sure that you ’re never beaten over the head with frustrating , difficult moments , inFamous renders what in other games would be major problems into minor , almost trifling annoyances .
So what if your enemies have ungodly accuracy , meaning that most of your deaths result from five simultaneous headshots from five guys on five different buildings half a mile away in five different directions ?
So what if the game falls victim to “ kitchen sink ” game design , throwing everything at you all at once because it ca n’t think of any other way to boost the difficulty level ?
You ’re never more than a few moments away from another try , and you can always try a different strategy .
The only area in which I was truly disappointed by inFamous was the boss battles .
There are only three , and they ’re uninspired — rather than having to puzzle out a strategy or use your weapons in thoughtful combination , you ’re pretty much just dodging bullets and rapid - firing anything you can think of .
InFamous is often compared , especially by me , to Microsoft ’s Crackdown , a similar game about a superpowered enforcer in a GTA - style open city .
The similarities go beyond the superhero trappings .
What makes both games great is the carrot - and - stick design that keeps you playing “ just one more mission , ” until it ’s way past your bedtime .

Canada is considered to be one of the safest places to invest in the world .
The Canadian landscape is rich in resources , the financial sector is fundamentally sound and our commodity - backed currency is one of the strongest among developed markets .
The Canadian stock market has been handily out - performing other indexes around the globe , with the TSX Composite Index averaging 15 percent growth per year over the past 20 years .
As safe and promising as the Canadian economy appears , there are also plenty of risks for investors .
Let ’s take a look at the pros and cons of investing in Canada .
THE PROS
Resource rich :
Canada is the largest exporter of minerals in the world and that resource focus has created a thriving mining industry .
60 percent of all public mining companies in the world are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchanges .
There are over 3,600 companies listed on the two Canadian stock exchanges , and nearly 1,500 are mining stocks .
Another 10 percent are oil and gas companies .
Canada also has the world ’s largest source of potash , which is necessary for makingfertilizer .
Investors can look to Canada for opportunities to capitalize on the increasing world demand for precious metals , oil and gas and agriculture resources .
Financially sound :
According to a survey by the World Economic Forum , Canada ’s banking system is the soundest in the world , indicating that Canada ’s major banks are generally healthy with excellent balance sheets .
This strong financial position means that Canadian banks now borrow at considerably lower rates than those of many of their international counterparts .
While the six major banks in Canada held off on dividend increases during the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 , half of them have already raised their dividend this year , with the other half expected to do so by the end of 2011 .
Strong currency :
Driven by the recent surge in commodity prices and depreciating US Dollar , the loonie has strengthened and now trades slightly above par with the greenback .
Given the current state of the US economy and the increasing demand for Canadian resources , look for this trend to continue in the short term .
Foreign investors purchasing stocks directly on the Canadian exchanges ( and thus in Canadian dollars ) , are not only protecting their investments against the U.S. dollar losing value , they also stand to gain with every small drop of the greenback .
THE CONS
Lack of diversification :
The Canadian market is very poorly diversified .
More than 70 percent of the TSX Composite Index is made up of only three sectors ( Energy , Materials , and Financials ) .
While there are a few strong utilities and telecoms to choose from across the country , the consumer retail , health care and technology sectors are sorely lacking .
TSX Top 10 Companies by Market Cap
Company Symbol Sector Royal Bank of Canada RY Financials Toronto - Dominion Bank TD Financials Suncor Energy Inc SU Energy Bank of Nova Scotia Halifax BNS Financials Barrick Gold Corp ABX Materials Canadian Natural Resources CNQ Energy Potash Corp of Saskatchewan POT Materials Goldcorp Inc G Materials Bank of Montreal BMO Financials Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM Financials
Small market :
Not only are the majority of sectors in the TSX under - represented , the Canadian economy is also very small , making up just 4 percent of the global market .
As far as diversification goes , investing in Canada is like taking a tiny slice of an already small piece of pie .
With most of your investments concentrated in 3 sectors , you could leave yourself at risk if there is a pull - back in commodity prices , the price of oil drastically falls , or there is a financial crisis similar to what happened in the US a few years ago .
Currency risk :
The loonie has been soaring lately , primarily driven by rising commodity and resource prices .
But Canadian interest rates remain at ultra- low levels , and as inflation heats up , this puts the Bank of Canada in a predicament .
If the Bank of Canada raises interest rates too quickly , they risk driving the loonie up even further against the US Dollar which could cripple an already weakened Canadian manufacturing sector that heavily relies on exports .
However if interest rates remain at these historic low levels , Canada is at risk for higher inflation and a real estate bubble .
The Canadian economy has been on a tremendous run over the past two decades .
Whether it remains an investor ’s haven for the next 20 years depends on whether these pros outweigh the cons .

The landscape of Salar De Uyuni is a breathtaking sight to behold for travelers from all around the world who go through plenty to witness the true splendor of these salt - filled plains .
But those reflective plains which mirror the sky and stretch endlessly as photographer ’s delight , could very soon turn into the next Middle East of the world - brazen , abrasive , dry and exploited land , not just home of a huge environmental struggle but also the next big political conflict .
But why is it that the vast and seemingly never - ending landscape hidden away from the world for many centuries , have now become a potential minefield for conflict ?
Lithium — the element that powers all the green cars , laptops , mobiles and every other fancy gadget you own , is lying in plenty under this surface .
For every automobile maker in the world , there is absolutely no doubt that those who control the supply and production of Lithium , will dictate the economy of the world in the next few decades ,
And it ’s this immense potential hidden under these salt flats that is attracting the world today .
So what is the problem in digging it up , you ask ?
After all , this will mean zero-emission vehicles and greener tomorrow .
Well , yes and no at the same time .
All the Lithium might help us build the greener roads for tomorrow , but it will come at a very heavy price for Bolivia .
The slat flats will no doubt be destroyed , mining in the region will suck up the last drop of water and before you know it , this would turn into an over - exploited and useless wasteland .
Something no local resident would approve of .
While the local government will no doubt hold off world pressure for a while — as it is unwilling to trade its natural treasure for cash at this point , one is forced to believe this will happen at some point in the future anyway .
Hatred for the West and a respect for the locals means that the Bolivian government is taking an absolute no -nonsense policy from anyone right now and is pretty clear that Salar De Uyuni “ belongs to the people of Bolivia and not to the world ” .
Despite that , it will be interesting to see how long they will sit on the cash pot with growing hunger and unemployment and even if they do .
Some say that using this vast stretch of land and extracting all the speculated 5 - 9 million tons of Lithium underneath is worth the localized destruction as it will help give cleaner roads and skies to the entire planet .
“ Small sacrifice for the sake of greater good of environment ” the experts say , but we sure hope it ’s going to be a choice that will be purely left to Bolivia and the people of Salar De Uyuni .

Western powers are seeking to undermine Iran by spreading " anarchy and vandalism " , the foreign ministry says .
A spokesman said foreign media were " mouthpieces " of enemy governments seeking Iran 's disintegration .
He spoke as Tehran remained tense but quiet amid heavy security aimed at preventing new protests against the result of Iran 's presidential election .
Iran 's Guardian Council says it found irregularities in 50 constituencies , but denied that affected the result .
Challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi says the vote was rigged in favour of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and must be re-run .
Mr Mousavi has told his supporters , who have taken to the streets in their tens of thousands for more than a week , to continue their protests but not to put their lives in danger .
How can they say they are unbiased when their TV channel is like a war headquarters ?

Iran asks BBC reporter to leave Consequences of engagement Suspicions behind election
At least 10 people were reported to have been killed in clashes between protesters and police and militia forces on Saturday .
That violence followed a warning on Friday from Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , that further demonstrations against the election result would not be tolerated .
Iranian state media said 457 people were detained over Saturday 's violence .
International campaign group Reporters Without Borders says 23 local journalists and bloggers have been arrested over the past week .
Opposition supporters passing messages online said they planned to carry candles at a rally in Tehran on Monday evening in memory of those killed .
However , heavy security on the streets meant it was not clear whether they would be able to gather freely .
The protests began after incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was named as the winner of the presidential election of 12 June .
Results showed Mr Ahmadinejad won the election by a landslide , taking 63 % of the vote , almost double that of Mr Mousavi , his nearest rival .
Following complaints , the powerful Guardian Council , which oversees the electoral process , now says it has found evidence that more votes were cast in some constituencies than there were registered voters .
But the number " has no effect on the result of the elections " , a council spokesman said .
The BBC's Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , who is in Tehran , says this crisis has highlighted divisions within Iran 's ruling elite .
Mr Mousavi saying the Islamic Republic needs root and branch reform , and it is hard to imagine Iran being the same place at the end of this crisis , our correspondent says .
' Contacting the enemy '
Speaking at a news conference on Monday , foreign ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi accused Western governments of explicitly backing violent protests aimed at undermining the stability of Iran 's Islamic Republic .
" Spreading anarchy and vandalism by Western powers and also Western media ... these are not at all accepted , " he said .
ANALYSIS Jeremy Bowen
BBC Middle East editor , Tehran
Mr Mousavi needs to find a way of channelling his popular support and to exploit the backing he also has amongst some of Iran 's senior clerics and politicians .
At the same time though , the supreme leader and the president are determined to hold to their position .
The question for the opposition is how to get that energy coming off the streets to make inroads with the elders at the top level .
This is a very tight - knit group of people who have been together for 30 years or more .
What makes this different and unique is that in the past , although there has been unrest , there has never been a break in the elite .
He said the West was acting in an " anti-democratic " manner , instead praising Iran 's commitment to democracy and stressing once again that the results of the presidential election were unimpeachable .
Iran has strongly criticised the US and UK governments in recent days , and Mr Qashqavi reserved special scorn for the BBC and for the Voice of America network , which he called " government channels " .
The BBC and other foreign media have been reporting from Iran under severe restrictions for the past week .
The BBC 's permanent correspondent in Iran , Jon Leyne , was asked to leave the country on Sunday .
" They [ the BBC and the VOA ] are the mouthpiece of their government 's public diplomacy , " Mr Qashqavi said .
" They have two guidelines regarding Iran .
One is to intensify ethnical and racial rifts within Iran and secondly to disintegrate the Iranian territories . "
" Any contact with these channels , under any pretext or in any form , means contacting the enemy of the Iranian nation .
" How can they say they are unbiased when their TV channel is like a war headquarters and in fact they are blatantly commanding riots .
Therefore their claims are absolutely wrong .
Their governments have ratified decisions so that they can act in this way . "

Meanwhile , Mr Mousavi , whose supporters make up most of the protesting crowds , urged them to continue their rallies .
" Protesting against lies and fraud is your right .
In your protests continue to show restraint , " a statement on his website said .
On Sunday , thousands of security officers were out on the streets but protesters stayed away .

Economic Extinction of the Least Financially Fit
I was settling down with a little microwave pizza as I was watching the YouTube.com video that was featured at InformationClearingHouse .info , titled “ The REAL Maverick : Present Economy Worse Than Depression ” which was an interview with Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Benoit Mandelbrot .
Mr. Taleb is a famous economist and author of The Black Swan , a pivotal book concerning the catastrophic effects of improbable events , which shows that sudden , unforeseen cataclysmic discontinuities happen often enough to kick the living hell out of any stupid attempt to “ invest for the long term . ”
He was accompanied on stage by Dr. Benoit Mandelbrot , a professor of mathematics who famously brought us Chaos Theory ( better known as “ The Butterfly Effect ” ) and the revelations of fractal geometry , and I thought to myself , “ Wow !
This is going to be great !
Improbable events are actually going to turn out to be fractal ?
Wow ! ”
But it was more than that , as Mr. Taleb starts off correctly saying that the economy is more dangerous now than at any time since the American Revolution , which took both the moderator and me somewhat aback , and that the banking system , as currently configured , is “ a monstrous giant built on feet of clay . ”
Impatient to get to the interesting part , I cut him off by entering an objection , mostly because I am a nasty , jealous little creep who is envious of Mr. Taleb ’s intelligence and success , but also on the grounds that Mr. Taleb is not a recognized expert on sculpture , giants , the stability of feet , nor the load - bearing properties of clay , and I demand that his remarks be stricken from the record .
The judge looked down at me with a scowl , and said , “ You ca n’t object , you moron !
This is not a trial !
You are watching your computer !
There are no judges , and I am just a figment of your imagination , just like all your ‘ friends ’ that nobody else can see , either !
Hahaha ! ”
Perhaps fearing an adverse ruling from the bench concerning my objection explains why Mr. Taleb suddenly left the subjects of giants , clay and feet , and went on to say that the point was that “ Never in the history of the world have we faced so much complexity combined with so much incompetence in understanding its properties . ”
I thought that he would then explain that his own work and that of Mr. Mandelbrot have proved , conclusively , that “ complexity ” is a guarantee of eventual failure , as having a lot of moving parts means that there are more things that can go wrong , any one of which is a potential “ butterfly in the Amazon randomly flapping its wings ” that will cause catastrophic failure in the near future , and all those parts means that there are more things that WILL go wrong in the future , as one by one each of these myriad things will break , sometimes failing in clusters , and always at the worst possible time , but which you muddle through until one day a meteor appeared out of the sky and killed the dinosaurs .
Well , there was nothing about dinosaurs , but at the very least I thought that he would – at least !
– say that he has shown that anyone using the normal bell - curve of probability theory to model long - term systems is an idiot because it assumes that the improbable never happens , which it nevertheless does , which is why it is called “ improbable ” rather than “ impossible , ” and anybody betting everything they have , or will have , on such an obvious statistical fact deserves what they get , which is , obviously , financial death in a perfect example of the Darwinian extinction of the least fit .
He did not , and even Benoit Mandelbrot was not ready to comment about the ramifications of things , but would only allow that “ Everything which involves turbulence is enormously more complicated , not just a little bit more complicated . ”
They both admit to having trouble sleeping at night because of these horrific economic things , which is , I assume , because they do not have enough gold , silver or oil with which to prosper and have a wonderful time as the government destroys the value of the paper money by letting the Federal Reserve create so much money and credit so that it allows the government to deficit - spend unlimited amounts of money .
Hey !
That must be it !
Follow my reasoning here , but if they had enough gold , silver and oil , then they would know that they could buy their way out of any trouble that comes along , and make money while waiting for trouble to arrive , since gold will , on average , go up in value the whole time because the purchasing power of the currency is going down the whole time because the Federal Reserve is creating excessive money and credit the whole time so that the government can deficit - spend the whole time !
That ’s why I “ buy gold , silver and oil because – whee !
– this investing stuff is easy ! ”
Interpretations
But perhaps because of their backgrounds , Judge Sotomayor and Justice Thomas came to view their campus experiences in very different ways .
Even by the standards of the Jim Crow South , Mr. Thomas ’s childhood was marked by bitter blows and isolation .
He was taunted not only by classmates at his all - white high school but also by blacks , who called him “ ABC , ” for “ America ’s Blackest Child , ” on account of his dark skin .
A black among Catholics and a Catholic among blacks , he sometimes seemed to fit in nowhere at all .
Mr. Thomas learned he could rely only on himself .
His father left when he was a toddler .
A few years later , his mother sent him to live with his grandparents , dumping his possessions in grocery bags and sending him out the front door , he wrote in his autobiography , “ My Grandfather ’s Son . ”
Ms. Sotomayor also grew up without a father ; hers died of heart problems when she was 9 .
But her mother was a sustaining force , supporting the family by working as a nurse .
In a recent speech , Judge Sotomayor recalled her mother and grandmother chatting and chopping ingredients for dinner .
“ I ca n’t describe to you the warmth of that moment for a child , ” she said .
In New York , Puerto Ricans were pitied for poverty and blamed for crime .
Popular images were dominated by the gangs of “ West Side Story ” and bumbling comics with broken English .
According to friends , Ms. Sotomayor was not active in her high school ’s small Latino club .
Ethnicity was not something to be ashamed of , they said , but they did not really celebrate it either .
But on Princeton ’s manicured campus , Ms. Sotomayor explored her roots in a way she never had on trips to Puerto Rico or in “ Nuyorican ” circles back home .
In a Puerto Rican studies seminar , she absorbed the literature , economics , history and politics of the island , and by senior year , she was writing a thesis on its first democratically elected governor .
In its dedication , she sounds newly enchanted with her heritage .
“ To my family , ” she wrote , “ for you have given me my Puerto Rican - ness . ”
“ To the people of my island , for the rich history that is mine , ” she continued .
Enlarge By Robert Deutsch , USA TODAY Megan Hurley , senior legal counsel at PepsiCo , works out at PepsiCo headquarters in Purchase , N.Y. , with the help of massage therapist and personal trainer John Monroe .
Companies , desperate to slice fat from their budgets during this recession , increasingly are targeting workplace wellness programs .
Smoking cessation and weight - loss programs are among those being considered for the chopping block , says Laurel Pickering , executive director of the New York Business Group on Health , a coalition representing employers on health benefit issues .
" When ( companies ) are looking for something to cut , and the CFO comes to the HR people and says , ' Why should we keep this program ? ' it 's difficult for the HR person to say , ' It 's important , ' " Pickering says .
WELLNESS DEBATE : Some say programs are ' Big Brother ' A big problem :
It can take years to analyze the impact of these programs , and even then , the return on investment is n't always clear .
The attack on such programs comes even as political power players , benefits officers and top health care academics aggressively tout workplace wellness as a way to boost productivity and reduce health care costs .
Just last month , President Obama hosted a wellness gathering at the White House with top company executives , as well as union and public health officials , to learn more about such initiatives .
He deemed the confab the start of an " ongoing process , " and his advisers have already had a follow - up meeting with corporate and academic experts on the topic .
Other governmental leaders also have latched onto the issue .
For instance , a bill making its way through the Senate would give tax credits to firms that offer wellness programs .
But even with all the high - profile attention , some companies have had to revamp those initiatives in the quest for healthier bottom lines .
Pfizer , dealing with the sour economy and a corporate restructuring , scaled back on the monetary incentives it offers employees to participate in its wellness program , says Janet Rodriguez , a senior manager at the company .
A strong history Faced with the uncertainty of what shape the health care overhaul will take and with health care expenses rising more than 6 % a year , companies are n't willing to completely abandon wellness .
Pfizer , for instance , did n't cut the number of programs it offered , just the amount it gives to employees who participate .
One - third of employers said they had such programs in an August MetLife survey .
That 's up from just over a quarter in 2005 .
Big firms are almost all self - insured for health insurance plans and , therefore , pay for employees ' health care costs from their own coffers .
Slightly more than 60 % of companies with 10,000 or more employees said they had a wellness program in 2008 , up from 47 % in 2005 , according to the MetLife survey .
In 2008 , the median health care cost per employee was $ 7,173 , according to a survey by human resources consultants Watson Wyatt and employer coalition National Business Group on Health .
IBM , which spent $ 1.3 billion on health care for its employees , dependents and retirees in 2008 , continues to invest in wellness , though it has cut expenses in other ways , including layoffs .
In 2004 , it introduced financial incentives for employees to participate in initiatives such as a 12 - week physical fitness program — and spent more than $ 133 million on incentives through 2008 .
While it can be difficult to determine a definite return on investment , IBM tapped into the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan to try to analyze the program 's returns .
Results showed that it saved about $ 80 million in reduced health claims , says Joyce Young , IBM 's director of well - being .
PepsiCo has invested heavily in well - being .
Its Purchase , N.Y. , headquarters offers pilates , yoga and spinning classes as well as a free laundry service for those who do n't want the hassle of washing their sweaty gym clothes .
Senior legal counsel Megan Hurley says that PepsiCo's $ 20 - a- month gym has not only helped her to stay in shape but led her to tackle marathons and triathlons .
In addition to using the gym , she visits the on - site medical department for flu shots and skin - cancer screenings .
Keeping healthy employees such as Hurley fit — and productive — is vitally important to a company 's success , says Dee Edington , director of Michigan 's Health Management Research Center .
The cost of an ailing worker goes beyond just medical expenses , he says .
There 's also the monetary cost of paying for disability leave , as well as the strain on productivity if an ill person is n't effective at work .
Employee incentives
While some employees are enthusiastic about wellness programs , many are sitting on the sidelines .
" A big issue is getting noticed and getting employees to participate , " says LuAnn Heinen , National Business Group on Health vice president .
Workers — stressed by the economic downturn — are often more focused on work and finances than eating right and exercising .
Nearly half of employees surveyed by the National Business Group on Health in July said work demands prevent them from having a healthier life .
That poll was taken before the full brunt of the economic downturn was felt .
Almost 60 % of those surveyed by the American Heart Association in March said the economy has affected their ability to take care of their health .
Many are delaying preventive - care appointments , not taking medications , skipping the dentist or canceling gym memberships .
To boost buy - in , companies are offering perks that include everything from gift certificates to discounts on their insurance premiums .
They 're also penalizing folks .
In 2008 PepsiCo introduced a $ 600 surcharge for smokers .
It already offered a smoking - cessation program , but that year , it enhanced it by adding nicotine - replacement therapy such as patches and gum .
" The combination of those two elements led to a tenfold increase in participation and increased the quit rate from 20 % to 34 % in 2008 over 2007 , " says Greg Heaslip , benefits vice president .
The incentive of cold hard cash worked at IBM .
Its offer of a rebate of up to $ 300 a year " got everyone 's attention " and helped to ramp up participation in its programs , Young says .

Medical device maker Medtronic Inc. says it paid nearly $ 800,000 over the past three years to a former Army surgeon accused of fabricating a study that reported positive results for one of the company 's key spine products .
Some of the consulting payments occurred during the time that the surgeon , Timothy R. Kuklo , was shopping his favorable study of Medtronic 's Infuse bone - graft product to medical journals .

Well , maybe not .

The recommendation from the UK - headquartered cancer charity amounts to an outright avoidance of all processed meats : bacon , ham , pastrami , hot dogs , bologna , sausage , pepperoni , beef jerky , liverwurst , and certain kinds of ground beef and meatballs .

“ I will press to ensure that we fully understand what led to this tragedy , and that we are doing everything we can to ensure that our men and women in uniform are protected as they serve our country so capably and courageously in harm ’s way , ” he said .
Typically , soldiers not on duty are required to remove the ammunition from their weapons while at American military facilities in Iraq .
It was not known why the shooter had a loaded weapon .
The base is heavily fortified with blast walls and razor wire .
The killing of Americans by their fellow soldiers has been uncommon in Iraq , but not unheard of .
Most recently , in September 2008 , an American soldier was arrested after the shooting deaths of two comrades at their patrol base near Iskandariya , about 25 miles south of Baghdad .
The soldiers had been assigned to a unit based at Fort Stewart , Ga .
The case is currently in military court .
In June 2005 , two officers serving with the New York Army National Guard at a base near Tikrit died after an antipersonnel mine was placed next to a window , and a supply specialist was charged in the deaths .
The supply specialist was acquitted in military court last year .
In April 2005 , Sgt. Hasan Akbar , of the 101st Airborne Division , was sentenced to death for a grenade attack on fellow soldiers in March 2003 in Kuwait , at the beginning of the American - led war in Iraq .
Sergeant Akbar , who was the first American since the Vietnam era to be prosecuted on charges of murdering a fellow soldier in wartime , was convicted of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder after he threw grenades into tents and then opened fired on soldiers .
He killed two officers and wounded 14 soldiers at Camp Pennsylvania .
The death toll from Monday ’s shooting was the highest for American service members in a single attack since April 10 , when a suicide truck bombing killed five near the police headquarters in the northern city of Mosul .
The men were caught after unearthing the remains of a teenage girl who had poisoned herself after failing her university entrance exams last year , a newspaper in Xianyang in China 's Shaanxi province reported .
I 've lost count of how many times Barack Obama has claimed he was going to change the way Washington does business , how he was going to cut off the role of the big corporate lobbyists , stop government use of secrecy to cover for illegal actions , make government more accountable and transparent , stop corruption , and end cronyism .
The record indicates that all these are part of the Big Lie - - a concerted effort to deceive his own followers and the nation .
Only the establishment media is silent about this growing dichotomy .
None of the White House press corps dares question him in public about his backtracking .
The Republican opposition ( who backed these same evil practices when they were in power ) has taken notice , but not as much as principled liberals who feel betrayed by his promises of change .
This week I 'll start off by reviewing the magnitude of the hypocrisy and deception .
It 's an impressive listing .
The addition of new regulations that only pretend to solve the financial corruption between government and Wall Street and the draconian new Health Care reform packages are bad enough , but it is the continuance of government secrecy , spying , indefinite detention without charge , and cronyism that is the greatest danger to our liberties .
Perhaps no one has documented this more than Glen Greenwald , writing for Salon.com .
" ' My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government ' -- Barack Obama , January 28 , 2009 .
Promising ' a new era of openness in our country , ' President Obama [ said ] : ' Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency ' -- CNN , January 21 , 2009 .
" A democracy requires accountability , and accountability requires transparency ...
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in Freedom of Information Act [ FOIA ] , and to usher in a new era of open Government ' -- Barack Obama , January 21 , 2009 .
Greenwald demands to know , " Has Obama fulfilled those pledges and lived up to those commitments -- even remotely ?
Just examine the facts and judge for yourself .
" February 9 , New York Times : ' In a closely watched case involving rendition and torture [ Mohamed v. Jeppesen Data ] , a lawyer for the Obama administration seemed to surprise a panel of federal appeals judges on Monday by pressing ahead with an argument for preserving state secrets originally developed by the Bush administration . '
" February 21 , Huffington Post : ' The Obama administration , siding with former President George W. Bush , is trying to kill a lawsuit that seeks to recover what could be millions of missing White House e-mails . '
" February 27 , AP : ' The Obama administration has lost its argument that a potential threat to national security should stop a lawsuit challenging the government 's warrantless wiretapping program .
. . .
The Obama administration , like the Bush administration before it , claimed national security would be compromised if a lawsuit brought by the Oregon chapter of the charity , Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , was allowed to proceed . '
" April 7 , The Atlantic : ' The Obama Administration still wants to keep its secrets .
Yesterday , the Justice Department [ in a case brought against Bush officials for illegal spying ] embraced the argument that the state secrets privilege . . . should shut down any litigation against the National Security Agency for its arguably illegal warrantless surveillance program . '
" April 28 , NY Times : A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit brought by five men who say they were tortured as part of the Central Intelligence Agency 's ' extraordinary rendition ' program could proceed , dealing a blow to efforts by both the Bush and Obama administrations to claim sweeping executive secrecy powers .
'
" May 12 , Washington Times : ' The Obama administration says it may curtail Anglo - American intelligence sharing if the British High Court discloses new details of the treatment of a former Guantanamo detainee .
. . .
In February , the British Foreign Office claimed that the U.S. government had threatened to reduce intelligence cooperation if details of the interrogations and treatment of Mr. Mohamed were disclosed .
'
" May 14 , Washington Post : ' President Obama yesterday chose secrecy over disclosure , saying he will seek to block the court - ordered release of photographs depicting the abuse of detainees [ including rape ] held by U.S. authorities abroad . '
" May 22 , San Francisco Chronicle : ' A federal judge on Friday threatened to severely sanction the Obama Administration for withholding a top secret document he ordered given to lawyers suing the government over its warrantless wiretapping program .
. . .
The National Security Agency has also refused the judge 's previous orders to provide security clearances to two of the charity 's lawyers so they can view the top secret document .
'
" June 1 , Washington Post Editorial page : ' The [ Graham - Lieberman ] measure , supported by the White House and passed May 21 as an attachment to a Senate funding bill , would put beyond the reach of FOIA any photographs taken between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Jan. 22 , 2009 . . .
[ W ] hat makes the administration 's support for the photographic records act so regrettable [ is that in ] taking a step aimed at protecting the country 's service members [ who acted criminally ] , Mr. Obama runs the risk of taking two steps back in his quest for more open government .
" June 9 , Washington Post : ' The Obama administration objected yesterday to the release of certain Bush - era documents that detail the videotaped interrogations of CIA detainees at secret prisons , arguing to a federal judge that doing so would endanger national security and benefit al - Qaeda 's recruitment efforts .
In an affidavit , CIA Director Leon E. Panetta defended the classification of records describing the contents of the 92 videotapes , their destruction by the CIA in 2005 and what he called ' sensitive operational information ' about the interrogations .
'
" June 12 , AP : ' The Obama administration has decided to keep secret the locations of nearly four dozen coal ash storage sites that pose a threat to people living nearby .
The Environmental Protection Agency classified the 44 sites as potential hazards to communities while investigating storage of coal ash waste after a spill at a Tennessee power plant in December .
'
" June 16 , McClatchy : ' Defense Department officials are debating whether to ignore an earlier promise and squelch the release of an investigation into a U.S. airstrike last month , out of fear that its findings would further enrage the Afghan public , Pentagon officials told McClatchy Monday .
'
" June 16 , ABC News : ' After being briefed today on President Obama 's firing last week of Gerald Walpin , Inspector General of the Corporation for National and Community Service , Sen. Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , said the president did not abide by the same law that he co-sponsored -- and she wrote -- about firing Inspectors General .
. . .
' The legislation which was passed last year requires that the president give a reason for the removal , ' McCaskill , a key Obama ally , said that the president 's stated reason for the termination , ' Loss of confidence ' is not a sufficient reason .
'
" June 17 , Washington Post : " President Obama has embraced Bush administration justifications for denying public access to White House visitor logs even as advisers say they are reviewing the policy of keeping secret the official record of comings and goings .
" Finally , it 's worth emphasizing that the above excerpts pertain only to transparency issues .
None of this has anything to do with what The New York Times in May -- referring to Obama 's Bush - replicating policies on detention , rendition , denial of habeas rights , military commission and the like -- described as ' how he has backtracked , in substantial if often nuanced ways , from the approach to national security that he preached as a candidate , and even from his first days in the Oval Office . '
No matter how you look at it , this is quite a record . " ( End Excerpt ) World Affairs Brief - Commentary and Insights on a Troubled World .

Who knew it could be this easy to reform health care ?
Michael Steele , that 's who :
So if it ’s a cost problem , it ’s easy :
Get the people in a room who have the most and the most direct impact on cost , and do the deal .
Do the deal .
It ’s not that complicated .
If it ’s an access question , people do n’t have access to health care , then figure out who they are , and give them access !
Hello ?!
Am I missing something here ?
If my friend Trevor has access to health care , and I do n’t , why do I need to overhaul the entire system so I can get access he already has ?
Why do n’t you just focus on me and get me access ?
Because I ’ve been starting to keep a closer eye on my traffic I ’ve been logging everything to my databases .
When writing reports for this information I noticed that there was huge amounts of traffic from bots .
Yahoo , Google , MSN and many others have been hammering my sites quite a lot lately .
Since I ’m writing my reports in PHP I needed a quick little function to identify whether the visitor was real traffic or some machine scraping my site .
I could n’t find one after a few quick Google queries but the solution was trivial so I wrote my own .
Hopefully this will save someone a few minutes .
The function is as simple as possible and it seems to be working so far .
I ’ve been watching it for awhile and it has n’t missed any yet .
I ’m assuming that it ’s not going to catch everything but it would be nice to get most .
Any bot user agent string suggestions would be helpful .
//returns 1 if the user agent is a bot function is_bot ( $user_agent ) { // if no user agent is supplied then assume it's a bot if ( $user_agent == " " ) return 1 ; // array of bot strings to check for $ bot_strings = Array ( " google " , " bot " , " yahoo " , " spider " , " archiver " , " curl " , " python " , " nambu " , " twitt " , " perl " , " sphere " , " PEAR " , " java " , " wordpress " , " radian " , " crawl " , " yandex " , " eventbox " , " monitor " , " mechanize " , " facebookexternal " ) ; foreach ( $ bot_strings as $ bot ) { if ( strpos ( $user_agent , $bot ) !== false ) { return 1 ; } } return 0 ; }

Have you recently been injured in what seemed like a minor accident ?
It might have happened quickly , and without leaving any cuts or bruises .
Perhaps you felt fine for the most part , so you brushed it off and decided not to see a doctor about it .

Vice President Joe Biden gave a wide ranging interview to Meet the Press today , where he expressed doubt about the legitimacy of the recent Iranian presidential election .
Biden said ,
It sure looks like the way they ’re suppressing speech , the way they ’re suppressing crowds , the way in which people are being treated that there ’s some real doubt about that . ”

Biden said , “ Well , you know , we do n’t have all the details .
It sure looks like the way they ’re suppressing speech , the way they ’re suppressing crowds , the way in which people are being treated that there ’s some real doubt about that .
I do n’t think we ’re in a position to say .
It was surprising that the assertion was he won by what , 60 - some percent of the vote ?
And so I think we have to wait and see .
But it , it , it did n’t seem on its face to be as clear cut as so many … ”
The vice president expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the election , “ Actually going back and taking a look –for example , 70 percent of the vote comes out of the city .
That ’s not Ahmadinejad ’s strong place .
The idea he could get , you know , 68 or whatever percent of the vote and , and in a circumstance like that seems unlikely . ”
Host David Gregory said it looked like Biden had doubts .
Biden replied , “ Well , you know , I , I have doubts , but I –we ’re going to withhold comment until we have a , you know , a thorough review of the whole process and how they react in the aftermath . ”
The result of this Iranian election defies the logic of electoral politics .
In Iran there was an incumbent president of a nation whose economy has gotten worse being challenged by a moderate reformer , who seemed to have momentum and popular support , and on Election Day there was a massive turnout that should have favored the challenger , but the official results show a landslide incumbent victory .
Biden is correct .
It does n’t add up .
However , it is wise for the administration to withhold any definitive comment until more is known .
If the Obama administration issues too strong of a public statement condemning the election too soon , they could appear to be meddling in Iranian domestic politics , which would help the anti-American President Ahmadinejad .
Even though the vice president wo n’t officially state it , it looks like something highly irregular occurred in this election .
We 've become familiar with Reese here atbecause of his brilliant writing about Cuba and we 've had numerous discussions about his recent book , Dateline Havana .
In 2007 Reese published The Iran Agenda-- The Real Story of U.S. Policy And The Middle East Crisis and last week he returned from another trip to Iran .
I 've been praying he'd write a post forand he just did .
Anyone with even the slightest interest in the cataclysmic events unfolding in Iran over the past two weeks will find this absolutely essential reading .
[ Editors note : Down with Tyranny mistakenly published a preliminary draft of Reese Erlich ’s article “ Iran and leftist confusion . ”
Below is the final and authorized version of the article . ]
Reese :
When I returned from covering the Iranian elections recently , I was surprised to find my email box filled with progressive authors , academics and bloggers bending themselves into knots about the current crisis in Iran .
They cite the long history of U.S. interference in Iran and conclude that the current unrest there must be sponsored or manipulated by the Empire .
That comes as quite a shock to those risking their lives daily on the streets of major Iranian cities fighting for political , social and economic justice .
Some of these authors have even cited my book , , as a source to prove U.S. meddling .
Whoa there , pardner .
Now we ’re getting personal .
The large majority of American people , particularly leftists and progressives , are sympathetic to the demonstrators in Iran , oppose Iranian government repression and also oppose any U.S. military or political interference in that country .
But a small and vocal number of progressives are questioning that view , including authors writing foronline , , and prominent academics such as retired professor James Petras .
They mostly argue by analogy .
They correctly cite numerous examples of CIA efforts to overthrow governments , sometimes by manipulating mass demonstrations .
But past practice is no proof that it ’s happening in this particular case .
Frankly , the multi-class character of the most recent demonstrations , which arose quickly and spontaneously , were beyond the control of the reformist leaders in Iran , let alone the CIA .
Let ’s assume for the moment that the U.S. was trying to secretly manipulate the demonstrations for its own purposes .
Did it succeed ?
Or were the protests reflecting 30 years of cumulative anger at a reactionary system that oppresses workers , women , and ethnic minorities , indeed the vast majority of Iranians ?
Is President Mahmood Ahmadinejad a “ nationalist - populist , ” as claimed by some , and therefore an ally against U.S. domination around the world ?
Or is he a repressive , authoritarian leader who actually hurts the struggle against U.S. hegemony ?
Let ’s take a look .
But first a quick note .
As far as I can tell none of these leftist critics have actually visited Iran , at least not to report on the recent uprisings .
Of course , one can have an opinion about a country without first - hand experience there .
But in the case of recent events in Iran , it helps to have met people .
It helps a lot .
The left - wing Doubting Thomas arguments fall into three broad categories .
Michael Veiluva , Counsel at the Western States Legal Foundation ( representing his own views ) wrote on the “ [ U.S. peace groups ] are quick to denounce the elections as ‘ massively fraudulent ’ and generally subscribe to the ‘ mad mullah ’ stereotype of the current political system in Iran .
There is a remarkable convergence between the tone of these statements and the American right who are hypocritically beating their chests over Iran 's ‘ stolen ’ election .
Bartle Professor ( Emeritus ) of Sociology at Binghamton University , New York , James Petras wrote “ [ N ] ot a single shred of evidence in either written or observational form has been presented either before or a week after the vote count .
During the entire electoral campaign , no credible ( or even dubious ) charge of voter tampering was raised .
” Actually , Iranians themselves were very worried about election fraud prior to the vote count .
When I covered the 2005 elections , Ahmadinejad barely edged out Mehdi Karoubi in the first round of elections .
Karoubi raised substantive arguments that he was robbed of his place in the runoff due to vote fraud .
But under Iran ’s clerical system , there ’s no meaningful appeal .
So , as he put it , he took his case to God .
On the day of the 2009 election , election officials illegally barred many opposition observers from the polls .
The opposition had planned to use text messaging to communicate local vote tallies to a central location .
The government shut down SMS messaging !
So the vote count was entirely dependent on a government tally by officials sympathetic to the incumbent .
I heard many anecdotal accounts of voting boxes .
arriving pre-stuffed and of more ballots being printed than are accounted for in the official registration numbers .
It seems unlikely that the Iranian government will allow meaningful appeals or investigations into the various allegations about vote rigging .
A study by two professors at Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies at University of St. Andrews , Scotland , took a close look at the official election results and found some major discrepancies .
For Ahmadinejad to have sustained his massive victory in one third of Iran ’s provinces , he would have had to carry all his supporters , all new voters , all voters previously voting centrist and about 44 % of previous reformist voters .
Keep in mind that Ahmadinejad ’s victory takes place in the context of a highly rigged system .
The Guardian Council determines which candidates may run based on their Islamic qualifications .
As a result , no woman has ever been allowed to campaign for president and sitting members of parliament were disqualified because they had somehow become un -Islamic .
The constitution of Iran created an authoritarian theocracy in which various elements of the ruling elite could fight out their differences , sometimes through elections and parliamentary debate , sometimes through violent repression .
Iran is a classic example of how a country can have competitive elections without being democratic .
Jeremy R. Hammond writes in the progressive website Foreign Policy Journal : “ [ G ] iven the record of U.S. interference in the state affairs of Iran and clear policy of regime change , it certainly seems possible , even likely , that the U.S. had a significant role to play in helping to bring about the recent turmoil in an effort to undermine the government of the Islamic Republic .
" Eric Margolis , a columnist for Quebecor Media Company in Canada and a contributor to the“ While the majority of protests we see in Tehran are genuine and spontaneous , Western intelligence agencies and media are playing a key role in sustaining the uprising and providing communications , including the newest electronic method , via Twitter .
These are covert techniques developed by the US during recent revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia that brought pro-US governments to power .
” Both authors cite numerous cases of the U.S. using covert means to overthrow legitimate governments .
The CIA engineered large demonstrations , along with assassinations and terrorist bombings , to cause confusion and overthrow the parliamentary government of Iran ’ Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 .
The U.S. used similar methods in an effort to overthrow Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 2002 .
( For more details , see my book . ) Hammond cites my bookand my interview on Democracy Now to show that the Bush Administration was training and funding ethnic minorities in an effort to overthrow the Iranian government in 2007 .
All the arguments are by analogy and implication .
Neither the above two authors , nor anyone else of whom I am aware , offers one shred of evidence that the Obama Administration has engineered , or even significantly influenced , the current demonstrations .
Let ’s look at what actually happened on the ground .
Tens of millions of Iranians went to bed on Friday , June 12 , convinced that either Mousavi had won the election outright or that there would be runoff between him and Ahmadinejad .
They woke up Saturday morning and were stunned .
“ It was a coup d’etat , ” several friends told me .
The anger cut across class lines and went well beyond Mousavi ’s core base of students , intellectuals and the well - to - do .
Within two days hundreds of thousands of people were demonstrating peacefully in the streets of Tehran and other major cities .
Could the CIA have anticipated the vote count , and on two days notice , mobilized its nefarious networks ?
Does the CIA even have the kind of extensive networks that would be necessary to control or even influence such a movement ?
That simultaneously gives the CIA too much credit and underestimates the independence of the mass movement .
As for the charge that the CIA is providing advanced technology like Twitter , .
In my commentary carried on Reuters , I point out that the vast majority of Iranians have no access to Twitter and that the demonstrations were mostly organized by cell phone and word of mouth .
Frankly , based on my observations , no one was leading the demonstrations .
During the course of the week after the elections , the mass movement evolved from one protesting vote fraud into one calling for much broader freedoms .
You could see it in the changing composition of the marches .
There were not only upper middle class kids in tight jeans and designer sun glasses .
There were growing numbers of workers and women in very conservative chadors .
Iranian youth particularly resented President Ahmadinejad ’s support for religious militia attacks on unmarried young men and women walking together and against women not covering enough hair with their hijab .
Workers resented the 24 percent annual inflation that robbed them of real wage increases .
Independent trade unionists were fighting for decent wages and for the right to organize .
Some demonstrators wanted a more moderate Islamic government .
Others advocated a separation of mosque and state , and a return to parliamentary democracy they had before the 1953 coup .
But virtually everyone believes that Iran has the right to develop nuclear power , including enriching uranium .
Iranians support the Palestinians in their fight against Israeli occupation , and they want to see the U.S. get out of Iraq .
So if they CIA was manipulating the demonstrators , it was doing a piss poor job .
Of course , the CIA would like to have influence in Iran .
But that ’s a far cry from saying it does have influence .
By proclaiming the omnipotence of U.S. power , the leftist critics ironically join hands with Ahmadinejad and the reactionary clerics who blame all unrest on the British and U.S.James Petras wrote :
“ Ahmadinejad ’s strong position on defense matters contrasted with the pro-Western and weak defense posture of many of the campaign propagandists of the opposition … .
” “ Ahmadinejad ’s electoral success , seen in historical comparative perspective should not be a surprise .
In similar electoral contests between nationalist - populists against pro-Western liberals , the populists have won .
Past examples include Peron in Argentina and , most recently , Chavez of Venezuela , [ and ]
Evo Morales in Bolivia . ” Venezuela ’s Foreign Ministry wrote on its website “ The Bolivarian Government of Venezuela expresses its firm opposition to the vicious and unfounded campaign to discredit the institutions of the Islamic Republic of Iran , unleashed from outside , designed to roil the political climate of our brother country .
From Venezuela , we denounce these acts of interference in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran , while demanding an immediate halt to the maneuvers to threaten and destabilize the Islamic Revolution . ” From 1953 - 1979 , the Shah of Iran brutally repressed his own people and aligned himself with the U.S. and Israel .
After the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Iran brutally repressed its own people and broke its alliance with the U.S. and Israel .
That apparently causes confusion for some on the left .
I have written numerous articles and books criticizing U.S. policy on Iran , including Bush administration efforts to overthrow the Islamic government .
The U.S. raises a series of phony issues , or exaggerates problems , in an effort to impose its domination on Iran .
( Examples include Iran ’s nuclear power program , support for Hamas and Hezbollah , and support for Shiite groups in Iraq . )
During his past four years in office , Ahmadinejad has ramped up Iran ’s anti-imperialist rhetoric and posed himself as a leader of the Islamic world .
That accounts for his fiery rhetoric against Israel and his denial of the Holocaust .
( Officially , Ahmadinejad “ questions ” the Holocaust and says “ more study is necessary . ”
That reminds me of the creationists who say there needs to be more study because evolution is only a theory . )
As pointed out by the opposition candidates , Ahmadinejad ’s rhetoric about Israel and Jews has only alienated people around the world and made it more difficult for the Palestinians .
But in the real world , Ahmadinejad has done nothing to support the Palestinians other than sending some funds to Hamas .
Despite rhetoric from the U.S. and Israel , Iran has little impact on a struggle that must be resolved by Palestinians and Israelis themselves .
So comparing Ahmadinejad with Chavez or Evo Morales is absurd .
I have reported from both Venezuela and Bolivia numerous times .
Those countries have genuine mass movements that elected and kept those leaders in power .
They have implemented significant reforms that benefitted workers and farmers .
Ahmadinejad has introduced 24 % annual inflation and high unemployment .
As for the position of Venezuela and President Hugo Chavez , they are simply wrong .
On a diplomatic level , Venezuela and Iran share some things in common .
Both are under attack from the U.S. , including past efforts at “ regime change . ”
Venezuela and other governments around the world will have to deal with Ahmadinejad as the de facto president , so questioning the election could cause diplomatic problems .
But that ’s no excuse .
Chavez has got it exactly backward .
The popular movement in the streets will make Iran stronger as it rejects outside interference from the U.S. or anyone else .
This is no academic debate or simply fodder for bored bloggers .
Real lives are at stake .
A repressive government has killed at least 17 Iranians and injured hundreds .
The mass movement may not be strong enough to topple the system today but is sowing the seeds for future struggles .
The leftist critics must answer the question :
Whose side are you on ?
Jeremy Hammond , bristling at the implication that he's a leftist , responded to Reese 's post at his blog at the
Labels : CIA , Iran , Reese Erlich , twitter
The request from four major record labels to fine the Pirate Bay operators for every day the site remains up and running was declined by the Swedish District Court today .
Contrary to what the labels had requested , the court said it wants to hear the defendants before it will take any action .
In an attempt to prevent The Pirate Bay from linking to copyright infringing material , Universal , EMI , Sony and Warner have asked the court to issue penalties to the site ’s operators for every day they continue to keep the tracker and website online .
In the request to the District Court , music industry lawyer Peter Danowsky had pointed out that The Pirate Bay links to hundreds of music albums to which the record labels own the rights .
The labels consequently demanded action , and wanted the Pirate Bay team to remove the torrents , close the site or pay up .
The labels further asked the court to apply financial penalties immediately , without hearing the opinions of the defendants .
Interestingly , Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde has stated that they were never asked by the record labels to remove any of the torrents Danowsky referred to in his request to the District Court .
Sunde , who is one of the defendants himself , despised the actions of the record labels and said that they are only interested in money and power , and not the artists they claim to represent .
After reviewing the case , the District Court has denied the labels ’ demands today , and said that they will give the Pirate Bay operators a few weeks to state their position in the dispute .
The record labels are also given a week to , should they chose , appeal the District Court ’s decision to the Court of Appeal .
Judge Caroline Hindmarsh who reviewed the demands and made the decision said : “ I do n’t think these are circumstances where the case must be tried immediately .
Usually you get to make your statement before a demand like this is granted ”
The record labels have not yet decided whether to appeal the District Court ’s decision .
“ We will decide tomorrow if we will appeal or not ” , said Peter Danowsky in a comment .
Meanwhile , The Pirate Bay keeps serving millions of BitTorrent users as usual .
Adults should be banned from smoking in cars when children are passengers , the new head of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has said .
In a BBC News website Scrubbing Up column , Professor Terence Stephenson , said children deserved protection .
" You can't inflict this on your colleagues any more .
Why should we treat our children 's health as a lower priority ? " he said .
A Department of Health spokesman said it would review smoking laws next year .
Read Professor Stephenson 's column here
Professor Stephenson , who recently took over as head of the college , said children should not have to breathe in their parents ' cigarette smoke .
" Why on earth would you light up in your car whilst your children are sitting happily in the back ?
" On the assumption that you would n't pass the packet round and invite the kids to light up , why make them breathe tobacco smoke at all ? "
He said the Canadian province of New Brunswick , California , South Australia and Cyprus had already introduced such legislation successfully .
And Professor Stephenson said second - hand smoke had been linked to chest infections , asthma and ear problems in children .
' Impractical suggestion '
Deborah Arnott , chief executive of the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health ( ASH ) , backed a complete ban on smoking in vehicles .
" Smoking just one cigarette , even with the window open , creates a greater concentration of second - hand smoke than a whole evening 's smoking in a pub or a bar .
" That 's not just bad for children but for adults too , especially those who already have heart or lung diseases . "
And a spokeswoman for the road safety charity , Brake , said smoking while driving meant people were not concentrating on the road .
" All that can add up to not having proper control of your vehicle or dangerous driving . "
She said it might be useful to have a law banning smoking in the same way there was in force regarding using hand - held mobile phones .
But Neil Rafferty , Scottish spokesman for Forest , the pro-smokers ' rights group , said : " We do n't think that children should be exposed to smoke in a car but a ban would be a waste of police and court time .
" Would it be OK if you opened the sunroof or a window while smoking ?
It 's an impractical suggestion .
" People like those at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health should be more realistic about what is possible . "
A Department of Health spokesman said it would look at whether current anti-smoking laws needed to be extended .
He added : " We would always strongly recommend that people do not smoke in cars , especially those used to transport children . "
What To Tell The Next Generation
I have kids .
I think a lot about the world I brought them into ; how far we ’ve come and how far we have to go .
Some days , I think I have no idea where to start .
Other days , I remember where to start : start now , with what I have , where I am .
We all learn the sexual culture a piece at a time .
If our early learning is all screwed up , it may take us a lifetime to figure it out .
( I ’m reminded of a perhaps obscure Melissa Etheridge lyric : “ There ’s a hole in these jeans / I only wanted to fade / I ’ve been ripping out the seams / Somebody else made tonight ” . )
We live in a culture that tells women that they are powerful and interesting when sexual , that begs them to be sexual , but that usually punishes and devalues them for it .
We live in a culture that tells boys it ’s a competition , a joke and a prerequisite without telling them what “ it ” is , what it should be for them and their partners .
Mostly , we talk around it and hope they figure it out .
That ’s a stupid strategy , popular only because adults are too embarrassed to act like adults in front of their own children .
So I started thinking before they could walk about what to say about sex .
My children will eventually become adults , in all probability sexual beings , and I ca n’t just close my eyes and hope they figure it all out .
Last May , I had a chance to sort though some of those things in a thread about abstinence - only education at Feministing ( here ) .
I ’m revisiting this now , and reprinting it here with only slight edits , because it still reflects my thinking .
What I ’m aiming for is a model for my kids to work from when they are making the decisions that young people make , whatever their gender expression , whoever their partner (s ) , whatever they are thinking about doing .
When it ’s time for them to decide whether they are ready for sex , I will provide them a better answer than “ no . ”
Because that does n’t work , and because it ’s not our view .
Instead , since they will ultimately make that decision alone , without me standing over them , they need to know how to decide .
(1) Consent
They need to know that they need to feel safe , know their limits will be respected , believe their partner sees them as an equal .
They need to hear and respect their partner ’s limits and see their partner as an equal .
They need to know that consent is not the absence of “ no , ” that consent is the presence of “ yes , ” it is affirmative , enthusiastic participation .
Sex with a partner who is merely willing to acquiesce is wrong ; if their partner is not into it , I expect them not to push .
(2) Limits
If they ca n’t talk about what both of their boundaries are , what they want to do , then they also will not be prepared to say when they are over their heads , moving too fast or want to stop .
If they are with a partner who ca n’t verbalize limits , how could they know if their partner is okay ?
The only way to make sure that both people are getting what they want is to know that both people are willing to actively say what they want .
That ’s a high standard , but in my view it ’s a lot more realistic than “ wait until marriage , ” and a lot more likely to lead to a lifelong healthy view of sex .
(3) Respect
They need to know that they and their partner have the same view of what it means .
Are they both in love ?
Is this a relationship or not ?
What are the rules of the relationship ?
If it ’s just play , are they both prepared to say that it means neither partner has any expectations of the other ?
(4) Safety
They need to know what precautions to take and be able to discuss them .
If they ca n’t walk into a drug store , buy condoms and lube and tell their partner they intend to use them , they are not ready .
When they are ready to answer those questions for themselves and resolve them with their partners , they can go ahead and do what they like ; if they are not ready then they need a reason to say that , even when there are no authority figures there to wag a finger .
That ’s not to say that we want to encourage early sexual activity .
We plan on telling them honest information about how teens nationwide stack up , to counter the rumor mill about who did what .
We do n’t want them thinking they are late to the game if they are not sexually active at 16 or 17 ; they have a lot of company , though much of the culture would lead one to conclude that 14 - year - olds are having intercourse in the hallways or school , it ’s not true .
And we plan to de-emphasize intercourse : lots of women do n’t really enjoy penetration until they are older ( though that ’s not universal ) , not everyone prefers intercourse to oral or manual stimulation , and it comes with a lot of risks that other sexual activities reduce .
There are alternatives to hysteria and denial .
One such alternative is to teach our children from childhood , progressively , assuming that they will become adults who will make these decisions for themselves and preparing them to do so .
The countdown has completed , but now what ?
Kojima Productions replaced one countdown with another .
So we will see in a little over 199 hours or a little over 8 days 120 hours or 5 days .
At least it was n’t a Rick Roll .
[ Update ]
There are a few more messages in the rain : 3 5 E e Seems to indicate MGS5 at E3 .
Not sure what the Lower Case E means .

US reporter manages to escape Afghan captors
A US reporter managed to escape the Taliban compound where he has been held since he was abducted last year , reports say .
New York Times reported David Rohde managed to escape with an Afghan journalist who was abducted with him last November .
Together , they scaled the wall of the compound in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan region where they were being held , with the aid of a Pakistani army scout .
Rohde , along with his companion Tahi Ludin , were abducted along with an Afghan driver who was accompanying them , last November 10 by Afghan militants while they were in the vicinity of Kabul , the Afghan capital .
Rohde relates that their third companion is still being held .
Kristen Mulvihill , Rohde ’s wife , expressed sincere gratitude to the US government for the recent developments , and just wish that she can be reunited with her husband as quietly as possible .
Mulvihill and Rohde have been married for only nine months , seven of which were months when Rohde was in captivity .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had his flight , uh , terminated on Friday evening when the cockpit of his jet filled with smoke .
The plane , en route to Santa Monica Airport , instead touched down at Van Nuys Airport after the pilot reported the smoke coming from the instruments .
Schwarzenegger , who has been TwitPic-ing many of his trips around the state , posted an image of the plane on the runway after the landing , along with the Tweet : " A little adventure just now when my plane made an emergency landing .
All 's ok , though . "

This has not been a week in which the Republican Party has covered itself in glory .
From fairly obscure staffers to major political players , the words coming from the mouths , keyboards , and twitter accounts of Republicans about their president has gone from bad to appalling in 4.9 seconds .
Consider the parade of over - the - top ( to say nothing , on at least a couple occasions , of bitterly racist ) messaging we have been treated to in the past few weeks :
Our first nominee -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor :
Cantor told the AP that Mr. Obama 's plans for the auto industry represent governmental micromanagement and said watching the administration operate is " almost like looking at Putin 's Russia . "
Pretty bad , but when we get to the end of the parade , it is pretty unlikely that Cantor even makes it to the medal stand .
Especially when he gets pressed by one of his own mates in the House : Illinois Congressman Mark Kirk :
In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , Kirk said he told Chinese officials " the budget numbers that the U.S. Government has put forward should not be believed . "
He went on to say that Congress will wind up spending even more .
So , apparently now the playbook includes the compulsion to clip the President 's knees ( and , of course , the Democrats ) , even if that entails trying to scare the bejeezus out of our biggest creditor in order to do so .
We have also learned in the last few weeks that the GOP derangement towards Obama need not be policy - driven .
Several stories came out within the past week which had some lower - level GOP fish going to a familiar place -- the racial thing .
First , we were treated to South Carolina activist and one - time GOP candidate Rusty DePass comparing an escaped gorilla to an ancestor of Michelle Obama , and then trying to walk it back by weakly claiming it was not a racial commentary , but rather a critical comment about ... you guessed it ... evolution .
Then , within hours of the DePass revelation , we learned that another South Carolinian , who does communication work for GOP politicos down that way , posted this on his Twitter account ( emphasis his ) :
JUST HEARD OBAMA IS GOING TO IMPOSE A 40 % TAX ON ASPIRIN BECAUSE IT'S WHITE AND IT WORKS .
Charming , and as with DePass , followed shortly thereafter by a fairly pathetic apology attempt , again via Twitter :
I realize that my comments were hurtful , wrong and have no place in civil discourse .
...and... yet ... somehow that realization did not arrive into your consciousness BEFORE you tapped out that original message ?
Then on Monday , we were treated to a GOP staffer from Tennessee who got called out for distributing racist tripe via email .
Monday , over at MSNBC's First Read , Domenico Montanaro pointed out that such rhetoric is n't helping the GOP gain any yardage :
Just asking , but has n't this been one of the GOP 's biggest problems since Obama became president ?
Republicans have legitimate things to criticize , but their rhetoric has sometimes been way too hot -- and has gotten in the way of the party 's message .
Well , some folks here would probably quibble with some of Montanaro 's argument here ( specifically , the idea that the GOP critique is legitimate ) .
His basic point , nonetheless , is incredibly valid -- one of the most important ingredients of Obama 's political success has been the GOP 's tendency to completely lose their marbles dealing with the President .
That tendency seems to be escalating , not abating , as time has gone on .
Sure , there is some component of the Republican base who pumps a fist and gets fired up every time an elected official or a talk - radio mouthpiece ratchets up the invective .
And , when you are desperately trying to attract not just voters but also money , energy , and volunteers , the base is a force which can not be ignored .
The Republicans know that , and in their present state , surely part of their plan is apparently using this supercharged criticism of the president to remind the base that they are " fighters " who deserve their support .
But all of this base commentary ( and " base " could be used on a couple of levels , ca n't it ? ) is exacting quite a substantial toll on the GOP , in terms of their credibility .
Outside of their narrowly construed base ( growing narrower with each month , according to some polls ) , voters do not have some grand antipathy for Obama .
They are not particularly frightened by him , nor are they convinced that his remedies are evil incarnate .
Therefore , the kind of over - heated rhetoric and hyperbole ( to say nothing of outright racism in some corners ) we have seen lately IS GOING to lose them yardage .
It makes them look partisan and alarmist at best , and completely unhinged and cartoonish at worst .
The fact that this level of harsh rhetoric has been there since minutes after his inauguration has not helped in convincing folks of the sincerity of their discontent .
It 's " boy who cried wolf " , on a political stage .
The Republicans are working their fingers and vocal cords to the bone to sell it , but with each passing day it becomes more apparent that Americans , by and large , are n't buying .
That , incidentally , might explain why even though a steady ( and fairly sizeable ) number of people consider themselves to be conservatives , the number of people admitting to be Republicans has been plummeting .
Microsoft's ( MSFT ) cost - cutting measures drove it to lay off thousands of employees .
As expected , it also led to some perks being discontinued for its remaining employees .

For instance , Microsoft wo n't pay for its employees ' Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone data service plans anymore , even if they 're used significantly for work purposes .
Nor will it pay for Research In Motion ( RIMM ) BlackBerry service , or a new Palm Pre. Instead , it will only reimburse data plans for Microsoft Windows Mobile - powered smartphones .
That 's not particularly alarming :
Many companies have never reimbursed employees for personally owned devices .
And some relevant divisions will be able to keep the status quo .
For example , we 've heard that Razorfish -- the ad agency Microsoft owns -- is still paying for any mobile plan / carrier / platform .
But for many Microsoft employees who use their devices to do company work on the road , it no doubt feels like a shafting .
Compared to the iPhone , new BlackBerry software , or even Google ( GOOG ) Android , today 's Windows Mobile is clunky and unappealing .

Sapphira and Ananias of the Bible
Sapphira 's story took place when the church was new and growing .
" All the believers were one in heart and mind . "
They loved one another and shared everything so that no one would be in need .
The tale of Sapphira and her husband Ananias follows a story of the generosity of Barnabas , who sold a field and brought all the money to the apostles to distribute among the needy .
Acts 5:1 - 11Ananias and Sapphira also sold a piece of property .
The Bible says that , with his wife 's full knowledge , Ananias kept back part of the money but brought the rest to the apostles , pretending to give it all .
However , the apostles were not deceived .
Peter confronted Ananias , accusing him of being under the influence of Satan .
Realizing that his deceit had been discovered , Ananias fell down dead and was carried out to be buried .
Three hours later , Sapphira came in , unaware of her husband 's death .
Peter asked her about the transaction and she confirmed the misinformation that Ananias had given .
Outraged , Peter accused her of testing the Holy Spirit .
The men who had buried her husband returned just in time to carry out Sapphira 's body to be buried her beside him .
I have been tempted to feel sorry for Sapphira , who perhaps , only stood by her man .
But , I think that Ananias and Sapphira must have conspired together to deceive the disciples and the family of believers .
Did they forget whose family they were in ?
They must have coveted the prestige of giving such a gift to the church but not the sacrifice .
Giving to the church was always a free - will offering .
They might have truthfully said that they sold their land and wanted to give a portion of the money or they could have kept it all for themselves .
But when they lied , they lied to the Holy Spirit - to God Himself - and they paid the penalty of death .
Sapphira and Ananias put their own greed first - their greed for money and their greed for notoriety .
They tried to deceive God and His people .
The church was young then and the deaths of Sapphira and Ananias served as an example of how seriously God regarded dishonesty in His church .
Are n't we lucky that God does n't strike down every person who lies to Him today .
Our churches might be very small .
But there is a kind of death that comes as a result of deceit .
It is the death of the bond of fellowship between believers and the death of the intimate relationship we should have with our Lord .
God still hates deceit .
Are n't we blessed that He is merciful and very patient .
Maybe
He is saying , " Now lets try this honesty thing just one more time to see if you can get it right .
" Galatians 6:7
" Do not be deceived ; God can not be mocked .
A man reaps what he sows .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has n’t had an easy time of it since finally succeeding Tony Blair in 2007 .
The dour Scotsman has suffered from the fallout of his Labour party ’s having been in power too long to retain the public ’s goodwill .
His reputation as an expert on financial issues turned out to be a liability rather than an asset when the global economy went in the tank in 2008 .
And to top it all off , he now has an alliance partner in Washington in Barack Obama , whose contempt for the United Kingdom and its government , as well as the whole concept of the “ special relationship ” with Britain , is not exactly a secret .
Brown is facing an election sometime this spring , which no one thinks he can win — even though his Conservative opponent David Cameron seems to be losing popularity as he tries to coast into office by simply not being Brown .
So when he was called today before the commission investigating Britain ’s decision to go to war alongside the United States in Iraq , Brown might have thrown both the Americans and his former boss and rival Blair under the bus and tried to curry favor with a British electorate , which seems to view the war and the close ties between the U.S. and the Blair government with equal disdain .
But if Brown is going down , he ’s not doing it like an anti-American weasel .
He told the Chilcot Commission that the decision to go to war in Iraq “ was the right decision made for the right reasons . ”
Though he later said that he thought the Americans had n’t planned adequately for the rebuilding of the country ( no kidding ) and also made it clear that he was not included in most of the high - level conversations about the war , he stuck by the decision made by Blair and did n’t give any ground to those who have tried to argue that the former prime minister made inappropriate promises of support to George W. Bush .
History , and not the leftist propaganda that has dominated the media discussion of Iraq in both the United States and Britain in recent years on this issue , will be the ultimate judge of the rightness of the decision to liberate Iraq .
Many mistakes were made and many lives were lost .
But though the testimonies of both Blair and Brown were different in tone — with Blair emphasizing the morality of the decision to topple Saddam Hussein , while Brown stuck to the legal questions of the Iraqi dictator ’s flouting of UN resolutions — both reaffirmed the just nature of the war .
Whether or not Brown is reelected , and there are plenty of good reasons for the British to throw Labour out — it must be stipulated that he conducted himself as an American ally today .
If Brown is on the way out , let ’s just hope David Cameron proves to be as faithful a friend to the United States as were Blair and Brown .
And let ’s also hope that Barack Obama treats him better than he has treated Brown .

Ellie - A on January 24 , 2020 :
I think for a small percentage of people marriage can be great .
At least some of the time .
If you manage to find someone compatible , who does n't change that much over the years , who wants the same things , who does n't cheat , etc .
Then good for you .
The rest of us either end up divorced , cheated on , abused , or just plain fall out of love for no real reason and have dead marriages .
Most of the people I know are either divorced , in miserable loveless marriages , or never married to begin with and no longer care .
I used to want love , romance , a traditional wedding , a husband , etc .
After 4 failed long term relationships , a lot of mediocre / bad dates , then one very abusive relationship ...
I 'm fairly certain that 's my dating life over and done with .
I panicked for the first year I was single and absolutely hated being alone .
Especially having to attend two weddings for my brother and sister and getting hounded on why I still had n't settled down .
Then I remembered the insults , the fighting , the gold - digging , the debt , my having to work all hours under the sun to pay it off , being ignored , having to compromise on everything I wanted , sex with someone that stopped making any effort whatsoever , and choosing between a filthy house and me doing all the housework ( because apparently living in a rubbish tip was fine with them ) .
Screw that !
I 've been single for four years now and the panic has gone away .
I 've proven to myself that I can do all of the things I once assumed I needed a man for .
The rest I can pay professionals to do ( fixing the roof , plumbing , electrical work , etc ) .
I 've got very good at managing and investing money , and no longer have my idiot ex's spending habits dragging me down .
I sometimes miss sex , but modern porn is good enough these days ( and if I really wanted I could get a one night stand or just pay for incredible 100 % selfish sex ! ) .
I 'm lucky to have family , so I will never truly be alone .
But I do n't have to waste time , money , energy and emotion trying to keep someone happy now .
Maybe it would be different if I wanted kids .
That 's the only reason left that I can think of to get married .
But I never have .
I have a huge family and used up all of my maternal instinct on free babysitting for other people 's kids .
I have neices , nephews and cousins I can always borrow if I want , but I 've lost any desire to have my own children .
I love men .
I think the majority of guys are wonderful people .
I enjoy talking to and working with them ( and being friends , if their owners allow it ) .
But they always want things I can't give them and the price of a relationship / marriage for me is far higher than what I would get back in return .
Marriage just is n't a good investment .
Good luck to any married people out there .
I wish you well .
But unless I find someone who ticks all the boxes , it just is n't worth it to me .
And I can think of far more benefits than just those listed above .

It 's really a shame that relationships between men and women have become so broken that most men are choosing to remain single or have given up trying to fit the impossible role we are forced to play .

A Good Man Like Me That Really Wanted A Good Wife And Family on November 01 , 2017 :
Well a lot of what i have said was the very truth , which unfortunately this is a very completely time that we live in now .
And there are many of us good men nowadays that are certainly not single by choice either , and the way how women have changed is the real reason why unfortunately .
And i am very surprised that you did agree with me since most women really do n't .
Being single for me is really no fun at all , especially when the holidays come around .
And it is very obvious why many of us men do n't care about the holidays at all , especially when we 're all alone too .
If i had a choice which i definitely would 've been married with a family already .
Peace .
Smarmy2 on July 24 , 2017 :
At " A Good Man Like Me That Really Wanted A Good Wife And Family "
I agree with a lot of what you said .
I also find it incredible that you managed to type a 1000 word essay on it without a single period , or punctuation of any kind .
Imjustgladyouusedspacesbetweenyourwords .
A Good Man Like Me That Really Wanted A Good Wife And Family on March 26 , 2017 :
Well today it is very unfortunate for many of us good men that really hoped to meet a good woman to settle down with to have a family which has really become very extremely difficult for us since the women of today have really changed for the worst of all unfortunately .
Trying to start a conversation with a woman that we would really like to meet has become very dangerous for many of us men that really have very bad luck with women since they 're very much to blame anyway .
I had a woman that Cursed at me at one time when all that i have said to her was good morning and how are you which she was ready to chew my head off for no reason at all .
I know a couple of other friends of that had this happened to them as well since i really believe that many of these single women today unfortunately have a very severe mental problem to act this way with us good innocent men that are really looking for a relationship today which does n't want to happen for us .
It is very sad how the women of today are now which most of them are very sad and pathetic altogether as well as losers too when they 're dealing with us men which many of them are Gay anyway especially since there are a lot of women out there lately that really hate us men which makes it even more very sad for us since many of us really hate to be single and alone all the time when we really should n't be at all in the first place to begin with .
It is real fact that most of the good old fashioned women of years ago were the very complete opposite of what these women are today since finding real true love in those days definitely came so very easy for the men back then to be born at such a much better time since our time really sucks today finding real true love ourselves .
Now i finally figured it out why our family members were very extremely blessed finding real love with one another back then since most of the women in those days certainly had a great personality , very good manors , very easy to start a conversation with , and most of the time the women made a very great wife as well .
In fact most of the men were also very faithful to their women and made their marriage work as well since both men and women years ago were struggling to make ends meat which they did work very hard together as well .
And now you have all of these reality TV shows as well as social media that has certainly corrupted many of these women 's minds that has really made it worse altogether now .
It is just too very bad for us good men that we were n't born many years sooner which we really could 've avoided this mess from the very beginning since many of us really would 've been all settled down ourselves too since it does take two too tango .

And you do n't have to worry about your spouse planning to kill you for your life insurance or assets .
Charli Renee on March 05 , 2014 :
Okay first , thank you , each and everyone of you as I found these comments insightful and entertaining .
What a sweet research project ....
Aside from the bitter single ppl or the defensive married ppl , I have been enlightened by many of your insights and opinions .
I am excited about embracing my single 'ness , even to the extent of choosing it .
Being in a happy marriage requires energy and effort and the same is true of being happily single .
There are perks and advantages of both scenarios .
Most would agree unhappy single trumps unhappy marriage , and many would argue happily married trumps happily single , but that is subjective to each individual .
I have just enough issues and baggage to know that perhaps at my ripe old age of 48 it's high time I invest my energy in learning to not only survive my " table for one " status but thrive in it .
Everyone has to decide and accept what is best for his or her life but if one has n't the inclination for sharing , giving , and forgiving , often , than it 's probably not a good idea to marry cuz those are the essential ingredients to a successful marriage , and all parties need apply all these components consistently .
When both parties are taking precious care of each other and of his or her self , well , than its a great place to be .
I love lots about being single but appreciate much about having another too .
Honestly , I just think how you know which is better or if you are with the right person is one do they bring out the best in you most of the time , visa - versa .
Also , you know if your more suited to be single or married , if you are more happy , healthy and productive when your single or perhaps more so when you are in a healthy marriage .
I also think if you lack the ability to align your actions with words , do n't pretend you can , accept reality and live accordingly .
And if your insecure and unhappy , definitely work on making the single self whole , as it's impossible to have a healthy union with a broken unit .
We are not going to be happy and content 24/ 7 but honestly , for now , I am happy and content single most all of the time .
So , today single is a sweet place to be .
No matter what , laugh , love and appreciate on my friends .

SpeakingTheTruth on July 22 , 2013 :
well since most of the women today do CHEAT , it is very obvious why there are so many of us single men out there today .
and looking for a good faithful one is very impossible today .
Billy Mack on May 10 , 2013 :
I think it 's very critical all of us realize American culture has changed so much over the past 40 years .
Sex roles have been redefined and readjusted .
Dating rituals have not quite caught up to that .
Online dating should make it easier , but I found that works best for people under 40 .
If you are older , you will have a very tough struggle finding even reasonably decent prospects .
Again it 's a numbers game .
Where you live , your age , M/F ratios will have a huge impact on your success out there .
Sadly our culture has pushed men back in terms of being providers and protectors .
Many women want to have it all , do it all , and stay alone .
When I was younger , I had that mindset too .
It 's a dead end , lose it now .
Once you age up , it 's very lonely from 40 on .
I also find the world just is n't too friendly .
Most chances for friendship will end by then .
Most people around you are absorbed into their own lives and personal dramas .
You wo n't be needed in their lives .
As you get older you also just either give up looking , or you get comfortable being lonely .
I last dated over ten years ago .
I would n't know what to say on a date today , how to act , and so on .
I 'm out of practice , and after only 5 dates in my whole life , I 'm still pretty rough .
AS I posted long ago , I started too late , and I was never able to catch up .
You can't catch up in midlife as I learned the hard way .

Считается , что отопление жилища за счет солнечной энергии возможно в очень ограниченных областях земного шара .
Однако , по многолетним наблюдениям метеорологов , на широт е Минска с апреля по сентябрь на 1 м 2 поверхности падает 297600 МД ж солнечной энергии .
При норме энергопотребления на 1 м 2 отапливаемого хохотания 70 квт•ч / год , что значительно выше , чем во многих страна х Западной Европы , годовое потребление энергии составит всего 25200 МДж .
Следовательно , израсходуется только 10 % солнечной энергии , и ее будет достаточно как для отапливания , так и для горячего водоснабжения круглый год .

I 'm only 16 but I 'm very confused on whether to stay single or get married .
Marriage is such a schlep , it 's all moonshine and roses at the start and before you know it , you 're just two people lying on two opposite sides of a bed farting at each other ( I love Anger Management ) :P
But if you 're single , your time is your time and it goes slower and there 's enough time to do whatever you want .
Chase all your dreams , meet millions of people who can be befriended and inspire you and then unfriended when you 're bored .
And you do n't have to be lonely if you have an awesome job and if you adopt a child , if you perhaps live with a flatmate .
You do n't need a partner to sometimes tell you that you are amazing or you are crazy .
If you know your strengths and weaknesses , you can make yourself happy .
I plan on being celibate if I stay single , due to religion and because there is more to life than sex .

WTF on December 05 , 2012 :
well the place where i come from is very pro-marriage and no one has a clue as to why anybody should get married in first place .. funnily the common reason that people give when i prod them as to why they are tying the knot is not convincing enough ..
they are shit scared that they would have no one to take care of them when they grow old .. its like a safety net .. at the cost of sounding chauvinistic i feel that there is nothing for a guy in a marriage .. love , care and affection sounds sooo cliche .. as far as sex is concerned its neither free nor great .. coz pampering a woman is like trying to satisfy a glutton and after a while sex becomes predictable .. does anybody ever gets excited to BRUSH TEETH .. marriage is for safeguarding women .. its a ploy to keep men forever bound to an archaiac system

Hi guys I 'm on the verge of getting married but have been really depressed about it .
The day I got engaged was like a funeral .
I have 2 months to call it off and am thinking seriously ending it .
I want to do wat ever I want when ever I want .
I can't give up my flashy clothes the bed and my classical cars .
She cums and I feel I will have to have permission for these things .
Im 33 never been in a relationship as it scares me half to death and now the difficulty will cum by saying to her it's over I 'm torn with wat or how I should end it .

Yeah , it is good to have a head of your own , readers .
The man who wrote this is happily married with no regrets , and is working on ways to stay married .
Way to go , author !
When I was single , I enjoyed it , although I was fairly disciplined .
I did not have to bump my head too many times .
I was raised by father , mother , and protective brothers .
But , when I married my husband , I gladly said goodbye to the single life .
It is thrilling to find something better than the best .
This hub rocks !
I voted up and other positives .
Mr. Awesome on August 25 , 2012 :
Hey .
This list is true .
I 'm 26 , still single , and happy about it .
My friend ( he 's 27 ) just broke up with gf , that he lived with for 5 years .
Now he 's depressed and has a broken heart , and have to do everything from zero again .
In these days you cannot trust anyone , because I think there is no true love left in this world , only " profit " ..

good to stay alone .
cuz you can do anything if you want to do .
purpush of life by without love .
NoDate4Me on June 25 , 2012 :
@zebra ,
you nailed it !
There should be a list of the different things that the high horse married people say to the single people as advice .
It 's just laughable .
Among my favorites are
1 ) " You have to put yourself out there " .
" Sell yourself on what a good mate you would be for someone " .
- This usually comes from someone who got married right out of high school and thus never had to go put themselves out there .
2 ) " Shoot , if it were me , I 'd talk to anyone and everyone I even thought was the least bit attractive " .
- Again , says someone who is married and it comes from someone who claims they would do this and that and be this awesome outgoing person IF they were single yet in their married reality , they are a cricket .
3 ) " Try church , that is ALWAYS a way to meet single people " .
- Really ?
So , if I pick a church and just show up , the church members will be all well and good with somebody using their place of worship as a place to hook up .
And of course , again , says someone who is .... all together now .... married .
4 ) " It will happen eventually " .
- Okay then ......
Zebra on June 25 , 2012 :
I love how married people have all this " advice " for single people when in reality , married people do n't have a clue when it comes to single life .
A lot of people got married right out of high school or just simply married the first person they dated .
They certainly are n't in any position to give advice .
Then of course , you have the ones who were actually single for awhile and waited until their mid-late 20's to get married .
People in that category did at least go through the dating process so they have some room to talk .
But , not a lot .
Because even given the fact that they were once single , they change once they tie the knot and are n't that same person anymore .
Not to mention the fact that the world is always changing .
So , what worked for them when they were single may not work for a single person in today 's world .
No married person can really tell a single person squat .
And , to be fair , single people are in no position to dole out advice to married people .
Neither side truly knows how the opposite side really is .
Yet , it 's the married ones who LOVE to look down their noses at the single people .
As if they are beneath them in some way .
Newsflash .
Being married does n't make you better than ANYONE who is single .
NoDate4Me on June 25 , 2012 :
@denise ,
Seriously , why are you here ?
You 've met someone , you 're happy .
Great .
Why do you find it necessary to come on here and run people down for choosing to be single ?
Does that make you feel better ?
I can't speak for everybody on here , but I 'm single because I really have no choice .
I 'm 39 and have NEVER even been on a date before !
You think I wanted that ?
Hell no !!
But , it is what it is , and there is n't a thing I can do about it .
So , I look at some of this list and try to find some solace in it .
A lot of the reasons are really grasping for straws , but some make sense .
So , good grief to you , show some compassion for those whose lives are n't all peaches and cream .
Just try and imagine being and old man with zero dating experience .
Just for a moment .
denise on June 24 , 2012 :
what a horrible and depressing list and I 'm not even sure what the " permission to orgasm " comment means .
if you think this way and you are in a relationship -- END it now !
I did n't even think I was in a good relationship until I read this .
Now I think I may have met the love of my life .
Good grief !
maxilo20 on June 20 , 2012 :
Also , in my opinion its not good to settle .
Its always good to follow your heart and wait for the right person .
trust me , being in a relationship with someone for almost 2 years made me realize why was I in a relationship to begin with ?
I do pray to God that I find the right person .
But lately , I 've been seeing alot of people settling because they are afraid of being alone .
I think we are afraid of what loneliness represents , than actually what alone really is .
NoDate4Me on June 11 , 2012 :
Well , seeing as how I am 39 and have never even been ON A DATE , I guess I better look at those 101 reasons as seeing the glass half full .
It 's not that I have n't wanted to .
But , life has not worked out that way for me .
I knew some girls in high school , but they only wanted to be friends .
I did not go to college , but even if I had , it 's not like that would have made any difference anyway .
One friend of mine who went to college had hopes of his luck with girls turning around , but he said that was no better than high school .
He said the social scene left a lot to be desired .
People lived in dorms and what not , but the school made everybody go home on the weekends , which in essence , made it no better than high school .
In four years of college , he did not meet the first new person .
Since I did n't go to college , I went to work straight out of high school and that of course provides a single guy with even less opportunities to meet women .
To make matters harder , I was at a time in my life where the women in my age range were ending the dating phase of life and looking toward the future .
Here I was in my early 20's still waiting on that first date , and girls my age ( if they were n't married yet ) were in serious relationships and were thinking about the next phase of life .
Marriage , house , kids , retirement , etc .
By the time you get to be my age , well , it 's too just simply too late .
I can't start a dating life 20 years past the time everybody else my age finished theirs .
It just does n't work that way .
Would I be happier married ?
I can't say .
Would I be happier single ?
Well , I still can't say .
All I can say is being woman - less is all I have ever known .
And it sure as sh*t was n't something I chose .
So , for you people on here up on your high horse saying crap like " loneliness kills " well , you need to take a second and remember that some people are single forever and a day and can't really do anything about it .
SithSeeker on May 17 , 2012 :
and I can make mistakes too .
love it .
SithSeeker on May 17 , 2012 :
I disagree with staying single means you will eat Junk food , on the contrary my eating habits have improved because I do n't have other shoppers in the house that by crap .
I 'm a vegetarian , I use to get crap for it all the time .
I love being single and this list is almost spot on .
Yes , I would rather put my happiness first , is n't that what people do who decide to marry .
They want to be married and makes them happy otherwise they would n't do it .
Confirmed Bachelorette for life .
I love the peace , it is what I 've been looking for all my life .
Jesus on May 17 , 2012 :
Singledom is the next evolutionary stage of humanity .
The world is overpopulated , resources are running out , yet the idiots keep breeding .
Marriage is a contract between two people to raise a child .
Ask the government , thats how they describe it .
All my relationships made me want to be single , society pressures us to marry , but who wants to live a life of compromises and stress .
Some people do need other people , but if you are strong and happy with yourself then by all means stay single , do yourself and the earth a favour .
Besttimeofyourlife on May 14 , 2012 :
well .
i think marriage is the whole reason im living .
even though all of those 101 reasons are kinda true ,
happiness and love still beat those 101 reasons .
but if the single train is for u.. go ahead on hop on ... but just remember , lonliness is a killer !
there are plenty of fish in the sea ... so if one of them is rotten , go ahead and catch another one , and so on ....
good night !
Yousif Hussein on May 13 , 2012 :
I would like to add my perspective concerning being married sooner or later AND vise versa , because all depends on the life situation which one lives in .
For some , being married sooner has got much more benefits and matches his / her life better and mo9re accurate and for some others being for longer periods , even forever , suits the best .
I am still single and I am 35 .
Mine brings the opportunity of life in such a way together than get married and neglect about the further sub-sequences and aftermaths .
If you find it necessary that this shedding light on this substantial matters and have another side of idea , please do n't hesitate to share with me yours via :

Lauren on May 06 , 2012 :
Loved this post !
I 'm single and I love it .
Granted , there are times when I feel it would be really nice to have someone to talk to and have support from and certainly someone to do things and enjoy things with ( sometimes doing things on your own does get a little old ... i.e " enjoyed that movie ?
That 's great , there 's no one around to tell " ) .
But I love my own time , spending my own money , going where I want , etc .
I just started back to school to be a forensic anthropologist / archaeologist and I made that decision on my own without having to worry about anybody else .
And if I need to travel for my job , so be it ... I 'll just have to get someone to watch the dog !
And if I ever have kids , it 's easy enough to home school them and bring them with my on my travels .
There was a time when I was one of those girls who desperately wanted to get married asap but now I 'd rather take the time to hone my beliefs and stuff and get to know myself inside and out before worrying about anyone else .
If Mr. Right comes along , I 'll give him a chance but I 'm not really looking .
Everyone around me definitely does think that 's weird , lol Not to mention there 's always the feeling of being a " third wheel " ( since all my friends are married ) but that feeling can be easily dismissed most of the time and you can still have a lot of fun with them .
Will I ever get married , no idea .
But regardless , I do n't NEED to , I can certainly take care of myself .
Noah on April 30 , 2012 :
Thanks for the list , it makes me feel better .
I have been single my whole life ( I'm 21 ) .
I just can't decide if I want a relationship or not ( even though I 'm too shy to try anyway ) .
I always wonder if I 'm missing out on a big part of life .
What I 'm really afraid of is getting in a relationship , loving it , and then getting dumped and hating being single because I do n't have the confidence to ask girls out .
I figure I 'm better off not knowing what I 'm missing .
Mary Jai on April 30 , 2012 :
I am really annoyed by people who are in a relationship posting on here why being single sucks .
You all know you WISH you were single .
Kang on April 26 , 2012 :
To anyone who said single people are selfish .
Please , you are being hypocritical yourselves .
In 5 ( at least ) years from now , you will wish that you live in a single life again and so , you do n't have to deal with all the bullshit you have in your marriage life .
If you are happily married , then you should not be here and leave us , single people alone , please !!
we are living in a happy life now and stop trying to destroy our happiness .
I admit I 'm selfish BUT I 'm not like how you think I am .
I like to help my family and friends and I like to share my experiences .
Also , I like to volunteer for the community .
I sometimes babysit the kids if the parents need a babysitter .
Is n't that good enough ?
If no , then something is wrong with you .
I mean , seriously .
kunduz from unkonwn on March 22 , 2012 :

I 'm new here and I 've been considering writing a hub about the many benefits of being single .
So glad I did a search to see if it had already been done .
I do n't think I could top this !
Congrats on all your success .
Brittany on March 14 , 2012 :
This is Really good hub !!
but i still dont like being single some people do but not me .
i love you Noah Bender !!!
Ish on March 10 , 2012 :
I had to learn " the hard way " as we say that I need always to consider a person 's motive for saying something ....
I finally realized :
The persons who have been telling me ( and there a many , many of them , in many formats ) that " we are social creatures , " " no one wants to be alone " ( and so forth ) -- are , after all , THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE !
THEY LIKE THAT !
But !
It does not mean that I 'm like that , or should be like that , or need to be like that ... or , that I 'd be better off / happier like that ....
I so loved Ted Turner 's saying he is a loner ....
jim on March 02 , 2012 :
When iam single I 'm so much better being and staying that way !
I let myself always get suckered into relationships and several baby momas !
Never again will I ever try to help or make someone happy !
If I could go back in time to high school days I would have never bothered with any relationship !
Much better for me being single and happy than dating or engaged !
For people who are with someone I wish you well !!!
Ronald C Holmes. on March 01 , 2012 :
I believe a person should discover complete fullfillment with in a relationhip with his Creator and himself before seeking instead of trying to get other to fullfill themselves which always leave them lonely , empty , and frustrating inside and sometime cause a person to resort to violent out brust of anger , drinking liquor , drugs , or terminate their life .
Chelsea on March 01 , 2012 :
Not just men are happily single ....... I am ECSTATIC about my single - hood !
FREEDOM !
Contemplating on being single forever , never getting married , we only live ONCE !
I want to do what I want !
Live a full , long , successful life with MY career , MY home , and ONLY my family to enjoy and spend time with .
I want to travel and enjoy life drama - free .
YEAH I love this hub !

Wow , I think 80 - 90 of these could also be " reasons not to date shitty people . "
I 've never encountered most of these and if I did , I certainly would n't lower myself to tolerating them .
This is just a laundry list of complaints , not reasons to be free .
Innocent on February 24 , 2012 :
Thanks man , when my wife passed away my in - laws take everthing &left me with my kids .l starved very hard &prayed to god to be married again .l felt in love with another girlfriend whose atittude show me she is greed of boyfriends .l compare her with my late wife l found that it is better to stay single than to be married again !!!!
Paula on February 23 , 2012 :
Maybe my ex read this just right before he dumped me .
Lol that jerk !
I hope he is enjoying his freedom because I know I am ;)

All these things only really apply when you have a choice in the matter .
If you have no choice and never will any benefit is pretty hollow feeling .
bella on February 09 , 2012 :
sweetie , actually , valentine 's day if you 're single and not feeling like a foreveralone , costs nothing :p
sasidaran.p on February 07 , 2012 :
this is really good for me .
there are so many things we have to go through to get married .
even if you fall in love with someone we have to go through her way .
the person just says why i should love you .
many time we just hurt ourselves in search of love and some special .
Kwame a takyi on February 05 , 2012 :
Sometime being single is good , cus a lady i've been with from high school to 2008 left me for italy .

Chris on January 26 , 2012 :
Ally , I agree with you .
It 's so damn sad that so many people are illiterate .
Imagine these people having kids ?
They can't even spell simple English in an online forum .
No wonder we have so many dumb people today .
This is list is genius .
It 's perfectly valid .
People can tell me I 'm selfish for not wanting ( or needing ) women in my life but just ask who is happier .
I can do whatever I want whenever I want .
Can they ?
chachacharlie on January 18 , 2012 :
Thank you for this !
Not sure how I stumbled upon it , but glad I did .
So true most of them .
It might seem like selfishness , but I do n't think there 's anything wrong with loving yourself .
Most people who are in relationships for years on end do n't have a chance to do that .
I 've been a single gal for a long time and I do get down sometimes about it -- especially when people in relationships take advantage of flaunting themselves or rubbing it in when they know you 're single .
I know that those folks might not have it that great and probably are wishing they were like me !
Lots of folks are afraid of getting to know themselves -- they 're afraid of what they 'll find maybe ?!
I have benefited tremendously from living the single life and encourage those who have n't had a good period to themselves to experience it .
I 've had the greatest relationship with myself and no one can take that away from me .
But now , I 'm ready to go onto the next stage and be in a relationship , and I hope that it will be richer because of the care I 've given myself in the single life .
ally on January 18 , 2012 :
i'm sorry , but most of these people who wrote on the comments do n't no how to spell properly it 's frustrating .
And the person who wrote the 101 reasons to stay single is a genius .
More room , and to have the power to do what you want is amazing .
lulu on January 16 , 2012 :
after love flyes away , cause it always does , you have to work on your relationship .
but , of course you can always JUMP on a new loveeee and eat ice cream , again !!
you can do whatever you want .. until you get to this point , i was talking about , you do not even know its there ... its all chocolate and icea cream ... and aint nothing wrong with that ... when you get older , you want more ...
lala on January 16 , 2012 :
interesting post , but a lot of this stuff does n't matter if you 're in love .
a lot of it is stuff I love about having a partner - sharing a tiny space and bickering and being in love
lara on January 16 , 2012 :
as far as i know there are always 2 in a relationship and both reposnisble for the good and bad things they do .
so saying someone is guilty for everything is like saying you are perfect .
no one is perfect !
its a great plus if you tell the other person what hurted you .
maybe the other person does not know he hurted you with that what you have in mind .
if the other person is willing to listen , think about and see the mestake and of course apologize , than that is the best thing that can happen .
staying behind 4 walls does not solve anything .
single is not about staying alone and playing computer games all day.its about getting to know your self , seeing who you realy are and what you can be .
there is always someone who can break your heart , if your heart is broken from before .
if someone just hurts you , your heart cant break that fast .
toma on January 16 , 2012 :
102 : you r in a safe side no one will break ur heart !
lara on January 15 , 2012 :
yo , i am just getting a divorce .
he said he do not love me anymore .
i need it about a month to get my head together .
i have to say i just love your list .
specially , 91 , 98 , 100 and one was about kids ... i realy want to have a child and i pray that my wish will come true although i will probably stay single to the end .
mnaybe you are wright : maybe its time to see who the fuck am i and to develop my potentials to the fulliest .
maybe that is the reason i lost my love , to find another in myself .
looniestlove from Davao City , Philippines on January 13 , 2012 :
wow what a funny , interesting and somehow useful tips ... thanks for sharing this with us ... and it is really effective because you got a lot of comments from the readers ... well written as well ...
lili on January 09 , 2012 :
Number gazillion and one : Divorce is so freaking expenses and post - divorce taxes are a nightmare .
You think you know someone , you really , really do ...
Of course married men are happy .
They 're taking advantage of the married women ( in general ) .
When we figure out the scam , they get unhappy , too .
I was a big believer in traditional marriage until it screwed me over .
( It could n't happen to me , I would try harder !
Work harder !
Put up with more !
Adultery ?
No problem !
Lying ?
No prob !
Unemployment ?
Illness ?
I can TAKE it !
I BELIEVE in marriage !
And then , of course , he left .
Does n't want to sign the papers because that will lead to court - ordered child support . :)
Oh but I can * make it happen * if only I try hard enough . )
Take a note , kids .
Just shack up .
Think hard before having kids together .
Write a custody plan before you have kids .
What are you going to do if you break up .
Have it notarized .
Maybe even go before a judge to have it set in stone .
The kids ' wellbeing matters here , their stability and love from both parents .
The marriage certificate ?
It 's a piece of paper .
The kids are forever .
Save your money for their wellbeing , not for the lawyers .

NOT ALL WOMEN ARE GOLD DIGGERS MAYBE THE ONES YOU GOT Greg AND NOT ALL KIDS ARE SPOLED AND NOT ALL KIDS GET IN TROUBLE IN SCHOOL SOME DO YES BUT NOT ALL KIDS SO YOU Greg NEED TO BE MORE BETTER MAN AND YOU MIGHT GET BETTER WOMEN DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT ?

No gold diggers to deal with that only care about your money and not you .
You can retire earlier since you are n't supporting others .
No one to wreck your credit rating .
For those with incurable heretiary genetic issues , you wo n't be pressured on inflicting that on another generation of children .
No school squabbles no children getting in trouble at school .

With the single life you are never second guessed by others .
No bratty spoled children to deal with or pay for college .
No religious conflicts .
Mark on January 06 , 2012 :
For the last 13 years , I have been living with the most beautiful , loving , kind , tender and sweet blue - eyed girl .
She is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me .
The relationship is completely platonic and there will never be marriage .
I know I will lose her in the next few years but I enjoy every moment I have with her .
She is my cat .
She is better companionship than any human I have ever met .
I am not keen to share another person 's shit .
Got a box of my own , thanks , and it 's plenty for me .
All of the women I have met and started tentative relationships with over the years turned out to be very scary people .
I attract the psychos , I guess .
As for dying alone ... we all die alone .
My cats play mind games with me but they are not the vile ones humans play .
For all those who accuse us single people of being selfish , perhaps we are ... would n't it be better to recognize that in ourselves before committing to being legally manacled to another person ?
I KNOW I 'm selfish .
I 'm much better off being single and child - free .
bill on January 06 , 2012 :
This is absolutely a remarkable and well thought out list .
I am so happy to be single .
Yeah , it does have its few draw backs , but it outweighs all the draw backs being attached to a nagging , whining , money spending mate , especially with one that still has kids that hate you .
The only happy periods I can remember is when I am single between relationships .
I always mess it up by getting back with a women .
It starts on the fantasy lane , then the first fight , the the compromise and make up route , then the stick with her because I have invested so much time , then the final big fight , and then the heartache , depression , drinking , doing foolish things , settling down , and then enjoying my single life again .
Same old cycle with me all the time .
Seems like , when I am so happy , being single , up pops that woman .
I am like a moth and a light bulb .
I can't seem to stop flying into the hot blinding light .
I am glad your list has given me some light so that I will not mess up again .
I am going to make a large poster and paste it on my bedroom wall .
Great Job !!!

Well i do n't care how many reasons there i hate to be single i have been for about 4yrs now but not for long i meet this guy it just is so sad to see all my friends to have someone there for them when they need them and i have my family and friends but i want a boyfriend to love and IF ANY OF YOU GUYS THINK THAT IS GAY O WELL !!!

Unhappy in a marriage for best part of 8 years and live in separate parts of the house now but i cant date due to family pressure and others talking " married man etc " and trouble from " wife " .
I have one lovely child nearly 2 .
Catch 22 .
I think I will take the leap very soon and move out .
Just concerned about my boy how it will affect him .
clare roddy on December 30 , 2011 :
I hate being single it sucks !
Its so much better knowing that there is someone there who loves you for all that you are ( given that u have found " the one " ) someone who loves u and you can share everything with is so special !
I think its just about getting the balance right in a relationship , your dependency and independence both very different but both very vital in a happy lifestyle and fulfilling relationship :-) x

The headline number of 9.4 percent unemployment does n’t do any justice to the 26,000,000 unemployed or underemployed Americans .
Last month , we saw the unemployment situation improve when only 345,000 job losses came online .
This sure beats the 500,000 + months we had for six consecutive months .
Yet the actual unemployment rate jumped from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent .
This was the highest percentage jump in the recession tying another 0.5 percent monthly jump .
So what gives ?
In a nutshell , companies are not hiring .
So yes , job losses may have dropped but there are no new jobs to pick up the currently unemployed so the actual rate increases .
This is one of those nuances of the two surveys used by the BLS .
So what can we look at for a better indicator ?
We should be looking at actual hours being worked .
The decline in aggregate hours is the steepest since 1975 .
Take a look at this chart :
Now this may be the best leading indicator of when the employment situation will really turn around .
Given the current market volatility using the stock market as a leading indicator is completely flawed since this is the steepest recession since the Great Depression .
Old measures may not work .
We also have unique “ saved ” employment with many places going with furloughs or cutting back on overtime work .
Take a look at what happened in January in California with tens of thousands of state workers being furloughed :
“ ( SacBee ) Some were furious .
Others were sad , even tearful .
Many more accepted the news with graceful resignation , trying to hide their worries .
At the end of a week that brought nothing but more grim economic news , that ’s how dozens of state workers greeted the state personnel department ’s announcement that thousands of California public servants will be furloughed two Fridays a month and lose 10 percent in pay , starting Feb. 6 . ”
Now how this plays into the employment situation is when things do start picking up , the aggregate amount of hours work will be a first signal of any turnaround .
Why ?
Well think about the furloughs for example .
When work does pick up and the economy begins to turn around companies will first go to their currently hired full - time workers and give them more hours .
Companies will also offer more overtime when work starts picking up but this will benefit their current employees .
So this may not show up in the current employment data since it measures full - time employment and hires and this will only show up initially in aggregate hours .
Yet as you can clearly see on the aggregate hours chart above , we are still heading lower .
What is fascinating if you look at the gray recession bars above , almost every time once aggregate hours start moving up it nearly indicates the end of the recession for statistical purposes .
The amount of people working part - time jobs for economic reasons is off the charts :
With 9.1 million people falling into this category , our nation is quickly buffering this current recession with part - time work .
The official number of unemployed is 14.5 million so the part - time number is inching closer to the actual number of unemployed .
However , last month the part - time number stalled while the actual unemployment rate jumped .
So what this tells us is even at the part - time level , some companies are pulling back .
It is hard to project where things will go from here .
With so many stimulus programs at work , it is hard to say how this will translate but the bottom line is when it comes to employment , there are no green shoots .
The aggregate hours worked figure is probably one of those indicators that you want to follow closely because it will be a more accurate leading indicator of when the employment situation will change for those on main street .
The U - 6 rate is now up to 16.4 percent .
Back in December I made the assessment that we will feel a mini-depression once the U - 6 hit the 19 percent mark .
We are inching closer to that .
At the time , the U - 3 rate was at 6.7 % and the U - 6 rate was at 12.5 % .
And just to show how close these two track , this is how much they have increased since then :
6.7 % then – 9.4 % now = Change of 40 %
12.5 % then – 16.4 % now = Change of 31 %
The reason as we mentioned with part - time not hiring , is a reason why the U - 6 has fallen .
But at this rate , U - 6 will be at 20 percent by the end of 2009 .
The U - 3 rate will be in double - digits certainly by the end of the year ( probably the end of the summer ) .

Atheists have an image problem .
According to a study led by University of Minnesota sociologist Penny Edgell , published in 2006 , Americans have a lower opinion of them than homosexuals , Jews , Muslims and African - Americans .
They can't get elected to political office , and most people view them as outsiders .
Yet the disdain is comparatively quiet and abstract , rarely erupting into palpable conflict .
Part of the reason may be that nobody seems to know who atheists are , including atheists themselves .
This year 's North American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) reported that 2 % of US adults do n't believe in God , while another 10 % are n't sure .
Only 0.7 % , however , called themselves atheist and only 0.9 % agnostic .
In all , 15 % said they do n't have a religious affiliation , and 27 % that they wo n't have a religious funeral .
Even apparent atheists , it seems , sense a stigma around the label .
But is it deserved ?
" People who truly have no religion , " says David Yamane , editor of the journal Sociology of Religion , " are not very well understood . "
Thanks to an emerging community of researchers focusing their attention on the non-religious , that is beginning to change .
The ARIS , for instance , is based out of a new centre at Trinity College in Connecticut , the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture ( ISSSC ) , the only one of its kind in a country full of academic centres for the study of religiosity .
Its fellows produce demographic studies and curriculum materials about the history and development of non-belief .
Younger researchers have begun to take a lead in the field .
ISSSC fellow Ryan Cragun 's dissertation identifies " risk factors " for people who are likely to leave religious communities , including relocation , education , youth and marrying outside the faith .
Cragun is an atheist himself , but he does n't advertise this among his colleagues and research subjects for fear that negative stereotypes might get the better of them .
Neither does Joseph Hammer , a psychology graduate student at the University of Missouri , who has been eagerly forming networks with others studying the non-religious .
" We 're all looking to support each other in this , " he says .
Hammer is particularly concerned about discrimination that atheists and otherwise non-religious people suffer , and he has been investigating how clinical psychologists can be more attentive to their needs .
Others are driven to the field more by academic interest than personal inclination .
" I had never considered myself particularly interested in religion or non-religion , " recalls Lois Lee , a graduate student in sociology at the University of Cambridge who founded the Non-Religion and Secularity Research Network last year .
She came to it by accident in the course of studying other things .
" My historical and sociological analyses of various secular phenomena often led me to these topics , " she says .
She soon discovered irreligion to be " an obvious lacuna in our sociological understanding " .
It should go without saying that what these researchers are finding does n't lend much support to discrimination against non-believers .
Irreligious people are , on the whole , healthy , intelligent and well adjusted .
They tend to be less prejudiced and less authoritarian than fervent believers , says a study by Canadian psychologists Bruce Hunsberger and Bob Altemeyer .
What they lack in traditional religious belief they sometimes make up for with the occult or paranormal .
But they are also more sensitive than most to intellectual consistency , according to ISSSC fellow Frank Pasquale 's work on secularist groups in the Pacific Northwest since 2001 .
Eager to show Americans what a less religious society can look like , Pitzer College sociologist Phil Zuckerman spent a year conducting interviews in Denmark and Sweden , two of the least religious countries in the world .
In his book , Society without God , he portrays people living meaningful lives amid low crime , plentiful bike lanes and accessible healthcare .
" Society without God is not only possible , " he writes , " but can be quite civil and pleasant . "
Of all that Zuckerman and his colleagues are learning , perhaps the most important lesson , for now at least , is the simplest : by and large , non-religious people are just fine .
From the ' Linux routers ' files :
Vyatta , the feisty open source startup that is trying to take router market share from Cisco and Juniper - is getting an injection of $ 10 million today .
The $ 10 million is Vyatta 's ' C ' round of financing and is led by Citrix Systems .
That 's a decent sized investment from my point of view .
Aside from the dollars , Vyatta is now also part of the Citrix Ready product verification platform that will make Vyatta 's routers ready for Citrix 's cloud and virtualization offerings .
This is an interesting partnership - the way I see it , this partnership will give Citrix users / customers the ability to do an integrated routing / virtualization / remote desktop kind of stack .
Citrix however has its own hardware too , like the Netscaler lineup , so it 's not clear to me how the Vyatta partnership will compete - or just complement that offering .
For Citrix , they see Vyatta as complementary .
" Vyatta 's solution is very complementary to the Citrix Cloud Center product family , " said John Fanelli , vice president , solutions and community marketing at Citrix Systems in a statement .
" Together , our goal is to provide customers with tightly integrated virtual infrastructure solutions that deliver cost savings and greater efficiency in enterprise and data center environments .
Vyatta delivers a unique piece of the cloud puzzle by delivering open , scalable routing and security that is not tied to proprietary hardware . "
Technical solutions aside - the fact that Citrix is now a key investor in Vyatta also raises the question of whether Citrix might just acquire Vyatta outright .
It would give Citrix a more complete end - to - end stack against competitors like Cisco and provide differentiation against Blue Coat .
Time will tell how deep and how wide the Citrix / Vyatta partnership extends , but one thing is for sure - Vyatta has managed to convince at least one big vendor that an open source Linux router is the way forward for networking .

A £ 1 m government scheme to help failed asylum seekers and their children return home resulted in just one family leaving Britain , the BBC has learned .
The pilot scheme in Kent , run by the charity Migrant Helpline , was aimed at reducing the number of children locked up in detention centres each year .
The Children 's Society said it was a " real scandal " an opportunity to do more for the families had been missed .
The Home Office says it is committed to finding alternatives to detention .
' Unsuitable families ' Campaigners had estimated that each year 2,000 children are locked up in immigration removal centres with their parents who have been refused asylum .
The Home Office denies this .
For the first time , it revealed to the BBC on Wednesday that 991 children were detained at Yarl 's Wood immigration detention centre during 2008 .
Child detention has been criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons , non-governmental organisations and the Children 's Commissioner for England .
In an attempt to bring down those numbers , the UK Border Agency set up the one - year pilot project .
The aim was for families who had reached the end of their asylum claims to stay at an open residential unit and their children would go to school locally while ways were found to help them return home .
The project , which began in November 2007 , aimed to see 260 families pass through its doors .
There was a huge amount of learning that came out of that pilot and we hope that learning will be put to good use
Roy Millard , Migrant Helpline
But the scheme , which cost just over £ 1 m , dealt with just 13 families and only one returned home .
The first family did not arrive until the following January and the pilot ended a month early .
The Children 's Society report , which evaluated the project , said referral criteria were " unclear " which resulted in unsuitable families being sent to the centre by the UK Borders Agency .
Many were referred too late in the asylum process and had laid down roots , enrolled their children in schools and had established a routine of normal life , it said .
As a result , they were allowed to return to the community .
It also said the project was not well publicised , which led to confusion at the UK Border Agency about its purpose .
Other faults highlighted in the report were a lack of clear objectives from the start and flaws in the design of the project .
The author of the report , Lisa Nandy , said : " The project was mismanaged from start to finish .
" The money would have been well spent ; it 's just a real scandal that the opportunity was missed , " she added .
' Too late ' Commons Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that referrals to the centre came too late for many families .
Most families are held at the Yarl 's Wood detention centre in Bedford " Many of these families have been sitting in the queue for years .
When you deal with the case right at the end , nobody wants to go home , " he said .
Roy Millard , deputy chief executive of Migrant Helpline , maintains the scheme was not a failure and said valuable lessons were learned .
" There was a huge amount of learning that came out of that pilot and we hope that learning will be put to good use , " he said .
" There are complex cases , referred to in the project which we have learnt an awful lot from . "
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said : " The lessons we have learned have been used to design a new pilot currently running in Glasgow .
" This demonstrates our commitment to keep exploring alternatives to detention which increase voluntary returns and provide value - for - money to the taxpayer .
" This is a complex issue with no one - size - fits - all remedy , which is why these pilots are so crucial . "

News has just learned that the human population has been growing for some time .
It got us to wondering , what could possibly be the cause of this phenomenon ?
Could it be the ozone layer ?
Could it be Satan ?
Could it be parthenogenesis ?
Finally we have an answer , thanks to the groundbreaking work of Professor John Guillebaud , “ one of the UK ’s leading authorities on family planning , ” according to a news release by the Optimum Population Trust .
The root cause of population growth ?
Sex .
Now wait a minute .
Stay with me here .
I know that Prof. Guillebaud ’s conclusion sounds unlikely .
But he ’s a Scientist , and he ’s made a Breakthrough while conducting Scientific Research .
And in another amazing feat of logic , Prof .
Guillebaud has arrived at yet another seemingly tautological conclusion from his study .
He has good reason to believe that contraception prevents conception .
You scoff .
But that same study has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that black is the new black , and that what goes up nearly always ( P = .04 ) comes down .

SAN FRANCISCO  Relief may be finally on the way for engineering - starved employers .
For the first time since the dot - com bust , there is a jump in the number of undergraduate computer - science majors .
New enrollment in North American computer science and engineering programs rose 8 % during the 2007 - 08 school year from the year before , according to a report released Tuesday by the Computing Research Association , a trade group for about 200 university computing departments .
It is the first increase since 2002 .
" The perception that IT jobs are hard to come by is over , and the field is now considered an interesting place to be , " says Peter Harsha , director of government affairs for CRA , which also represents government research labs and research labs for tech companies such as Google , Microsoft and IBM .
The allure of popular technologies such as Web 2.0 , iPhone , Facebook and YouTube have drawn more teens into computer science and should boost enrollment figures next year , too , Harsha says .
Adding to the surge : Many undergraduates who once considered business and finance majors are focusing instead on computing , says Jeff Hollingsworth , associate chair at the University of Maryland 's computer - science department .
The dramatic shift should ease concern within the tech industry that the U.S. does not graduate enough computer - science students .
For years , that has driven tech vendors to outsource low - level programming jobs to India , China and elsewhere .
The spike in majors comes as especially comforting news for IBM and others that often could not fill enterprise - computing jobs because of a paucity of qualified college graduates .
" ( Information technology ) skills are now required to be more competitive in all professions — not just a technical company , " says Mark Hanny , vice president of alliances and academic initiative for IBM Software Group .
President Obama's $ 787 economic stimulus package underscores the importance of such skills in building a smart energy grid , modernizing health care and expanding broadband networks .
Indeed , eight in 10 U.S. college students see a growing need for more IT professionals as technology advances , according to a survey by IBM and the Marist Institute for Public Opinion , also released Tuesday .
The change is easy to spot at Carnegie Mellon University , says Sameer Chopra , a junior majoring in computer science there .
It used to be fairly easy to get into most classes .
Now , some have waiting lists of up to 40 people , he says .

Advertisement Police in Russia have broken up a protest by gay rights activists in Moscow , staged to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest .
Some 30 campaigners had gathered near a university in defiance of a ban on their march and many were dragged away by police when they shouted slogans .
British gay rights activist , Peter Tatchell , was among those detained .
A counter - demonstration by nationalist and religious groups was allowed to go ahead elsewhere in the Russian capital .
Equal rights
The gay rights group had been waving flags and chanting slogans demanding equal rights and condemning the treatment of gays and lesbians in Russia .
At least 20 were arrested as police moved in to disperse the protest .
As he was being taken away by police , Mr Tatchell shouted : " This shows the Russian people are not free . "
Speaking from a police station , he later told the BBC : " The way the police violently broke up our peaceful protest is an indication of a drift toward authoritarianism that is affecting all Russians . "
' Satanic '
The organiser of the gathering and leading campaigner , Nikolai Alexeyev , was also detained at the event , which took place in the south - west of the city .
Nikolai Alexeyev organised the event despite the ban The Eurovision Song Contest traditionally has a large gay following and activists in Russia had seen its staging in Moscow as a great opportunity to highlight what they say is deep prejudice , says the BBC's Moscow correspondent , Richard Galpin .
There have been many attacks on members of the gay community - they also say they risk being sacked by their employers and shunned by their families .
The Moscow mayor Yuri Luzkhov has described gay parades as " satanic " .
Anti-gay groups had threatened to take matters into their own hands if the police failed to stop the protest .
Several dozen nationalist and religious protesters earlier staged an anti-gay march near central Moscow .

Nato ordered the expulsion of the two Russian diplomats on Wednesday Russia has confirmed Nato has expelled two of its diplomats from Brussels , reportedly in retaliation for a spy scandal involving an Estonian official .
In a statement , the Russian foreign ministry described the expulsions as " outrageous " and a " crude provocation " .
Nato diplomats claimed the Russians were undercover intelligence agents .
The official , Herman Simm , was jailed for 12 years in February by an Estonian court for passing Nato defence and diplomatic secrets to Moscow .
The court where the former head of Estonia 's national security system was tried did not reveal which country he spied for , but investigators said Mr Simm passed nearly 3,000 documents to Russia .
They said he received 1.3 m kroons ( £ 74,000 ; $ 110,000 ) for the data .
The Kremlin denied any involvement .
Nato made no comment at the time , but the case , Estonia 's biggest spy scandal since the Cold War , was seen as an embarrassment for the former Soviet state , which joined the alliance in 2004 .
' Crude provocation '
On Thursday , Russia 's foreign ministry confirmed that Nato had expelled two of its diplomats , but said the move was unjustified .
" A crude provocation has been made in relation to two employees of Russia 's permanent mission to Nato on an absolutely trumped up pretext without any clear explanation , " it said .
There will be a response to such steps , which Nato will learn about shortly
Dmitry Rogozin
Russian ambassador to Nato Russia 's ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , said he had been informed by the alliance 's secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , on Wednesday that it had decided to withdraw the accreditation from two of his staff .
" I was told the following : ' Nato is outraged by Russia 's spying activities against Nato and alliance member states ' , " he said .
Mr Rogozin identified the diplomats as Viktor Kochukov , a senior counsellor at the Russian mission and the head of its political section , and Vasiliy Chizhov , a lower - level attache and the son of Vladimir Chizhov , Russia 's envoy to the European Union .
" There will be a response to such steps , which Nato will learn about shortly , " he warned , adding that " someone in the West strongly dislikes how relations between Russia and individual countries of Western Europe are developing " .
A Nato spokesman said he could not confirm the story because he could not comment on intelligence matters .
The move came as Nato held its first formal talks with Russian representatives since last summer 's war between Russia and Georgia over the breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Investigators said Simm , who used to be the chief of Estonia 's police service , had been working for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) since 1995 , when he joined the Estonian defence ministry .
Simm , who was convicted of treason , was ordered to pay 20.2 m kroons ( £ 1.15 m ; $ 1.71 m ) to the Estonian defence ministry for the cost of new security systems .

It ’s common knowledge : the iPhone ’s 2 - megapixel camera is nothing special .
It was unimpressive when it shipped , and every day it suffers more and more in comparison with modern point - and - shoot cameras , or even the latest camera phones .
The common feature wishlist among users is long , with many hungering for more megapixels , video capabilities , zoom , and autofocus .
While the camera is certainly a much - appreciated convenience , it does n’t lend itself to taking the kind of breathtaking pictures we expect from modern digital cameras .
( And yes , the 3 - megapixel camera in the iPhone 3G S should be an improvement ; we ’ll know more about that soon . )
But because of its convenience , the iPhone camera , like many mobile phone cameras , is often used merely as a kind of visual text message – the photo might not look great , but it gets the point across .
People use it effectively to send images via email or Twitter that say , “ Look at this giant burger I ’m about to scarf , ” or even “ There ’s a plane in the Hudson ! ”
And it works pretty well with Evernote for visual reminders .
But , as we ’ll see , the iPhone camera ’s technical limitations have n’t prevented some artists from making great art with it , much the way artists have long produced amazing images using old or unusual photographic equipment .
i Phone Photo Pioneers —
There ’s a rich history of photographers using crude or basic tools , like pinhole or Holga cameras , to produce beautiful and memorable images .
In many respects , those leading the charge of iPhone photo enthusiasm are seizing upon this tradition , though , ironically , their “ crude ” tool happens to be an expensive and sophisticated piece of technology .
Among the leaders of this pack are a professional photographer , a self - described amateur , and a passionate online group of committed hobbyists .
Chase Jarvis is a professional photographer based in Seattle , Washington .
In addition to running a photography studio that has garnered a slew of press and recognition , Jarvis has taken to using his iPhone for making images whose origins you would never suspect .
“ The best camera is the one that ’s with you , ” Jarvis writes , “ As such , I take between 1 and 1000 iPhone images every day … ”
He goes on to say he uses only native iPhone apps for editing instead of the expected choice , Photoshop .
Considering the crisp edges , bold colors , and dynamic compositions in his photos , it ’s a claim that can be hard to believe .
Greg Schmigel – a self - described amateur living in Maryland – is another well known name in the world of iPhoneography .
While Schmigel is humble about his involvement in the medium , his Web site Just What I See has attracted much attention .
Boasting hundreds of iPhone photos , most focusing on people in public places , Schmigel ’s site is a contemplation on the ephemeral beauty of the everyday .
Another pool of iPhone camera talent gathers on Flickr , the iPhone Photography Group .
With a collection of nearly 6,000 photos and over 250 active members from around the world , the Flickr group is an excellent spot to expand your conception of what an iPhone photo can look like .
Tools of the Trade —
At first glance , I could n’t figure out how many of these photos were made with the iPhone , but reading these sites made it clear that many were edited and enhanced using iPhone photo apps .
This , of course , is good news since it means that you too can achieve similar results without ever leaving your iPhone or purchasing expensive photo manipulation applications for the Mac .
The most popular apps , the ones that were referenced repeatedly in the Flickr group and whose effects became easy to spot , were CameraBag , ToyCamera , Photonasis , Photo fx , and TiltShift .
They enable users to apply various filters to alter the appearance of a photo .
For example , Camera Bag offers filters that “ age ” a photo and replicate the appearance of , say , a Polaroid from the 1980s , or a crisp black - and - white shot from the 1960s .
Similarly , ToyCamera approximates the warm lo - fi effects attained by , well , cheap toy cameras .
Tilt
Shift offers only one effect , but it ’s an intriguing one that replicates the effects of tilt shift photography , which can result in creating pictures that appear to be photographs of miniature versions of the real thing .
These sorts of apps are widely popular for their capability to emulate various camera effects and aesthetics .
In fact , at least one app has actually been rejected from the App Store for replicating too well a set of proprietary camera effects .
The Poladroid phone app , developed by Paul Ladroid , was rejected for containing features that “ resemble Polaroid photographs . ”
Given the number of validated apps containing similar features , this one will have to be chalked up to Apple ’s sometimes opaque review process ( see “ Developers Could Turn Away from iPhone App Store “ , 2008 -09 - 25 ) .
One last app worth mentioning is Stepcase ’s Darkroom ( previously called Steadycam ) .
Darkroom is interesting in that it helps you to take clearer pictures by using your iPhone ’s accelerometer .
When you press the shutter button on your iPhone , Darkroom waits till your accelerometer reads as being relatively stable before it snaps the shot – resulting in a clearer photograph , especially in low - light situations .
Another app called Night Camera does exactly the same thing .

Time - Traveling with Cameras —
One thing I could n’t help but notice after looking at hundreds of iPhone photographs is the apparent desire to mimic older photographic forms , techniques , and equipment .
As I mentioned , apps like CameraBag enable users to transform their photographs into what appear to be images from another era .
Maybe the explanation for this phenomenon is a simple one : that low - resolution images taken with the iPhone are well suited to impersonate other forms of low - end photography ?
Yet perhaps the reason lies deeper ; in the sudden and magical transformation from a mundane image to one with historical aura .
Maybe it ’s the wonder of time travel that ’s implied – I may not be able to build a time machine , but I can make it look like I was 25 years old in 1970 .
Or it ’s possibly just another face of the collective nostalgia we seem to have for our childhood eras .
Whatever the reason , it is curious that these effects are so ubiquitously utilized by users of what is one of the most innovative and forward - thinking technological devices we ’ve seen in recent years .
Of particular curiosity to me is that many of the images I came across replicated the appearance of Polaroid instant film – an apt ancestor of the iPhone photograph given its instantaneous nature .
But this relationship is also peculiar given that Polaroid , the company , announced this past year it will no longer continue making instant film .
The digital camera undoubtedly killed demand for physical instant film .
Yet , people still seem to want exactly the aesthetic that their new tools put to out to pasture .
It ’s a strange example of new technology destroying the old , only to come to resemble it .
It raises a funny question : in 10 years will artists be replicating the blurry pixelated quality of the 2 - megapixel iPhone camera from which most people now seek to escape ?
Energy :
Think of solar power , and you probably think of photovoltaic panels .
But there is another way to make electricity from sunlight , which arguably has even brighter prospects
AP
IN THE past few months BrightSource Energy , based in California , has signed the world 's two largest deals to build new solar - power capacity .
The company will soon begin constructing the first in a series of 14 solar - power plants that will collectively supply more than 2.6 gigawatts ( GW ) of electricity — enough to serve about 1.8 m homes .
But to accomplish this feat BrightSource will not use photovoltaic cells , which generate electricity directly from sunlight and currently constitute the most common form of solar power .
Instead , the company specialises in “ concentrating solar - thermal technology ” in which mirrors concentrate sunlight to produce heat .
That heat is then used to create steam , which in turn drives a turbine to generate electricity .
Solar - thermal power stations have several advantages over solar - photovoltaic projects .
They are typically built on a much larger scale , and historically their costs have been much lower .
Compared with other renewable sources of energy , they are probably best able to match a utility 's electrical load , says Nathaniel Bullard of New Energy Finance , a research firm .
They work best when it is hottest and demand is greatest .
And the heat they generate can be stored , so the output of a solar - thermal plant does not fluctuate as wildly as that of a photovoltaic system .
Moreover , since they use a turbine to generate electricity from heat , most solar - thermal plants can be easily and inexpensively supplemented with natural - gas boilers , enabling them to perform as reliably as a fossil - fuel power plant .
Besides these benefits , the main drivers for the growth of the solar - thermal industry are moves to limit carbon - dioxide emissions and requirements to increase the proportion of electricity produced from renewable sources .
According to New Energy Finance , about 12GW of concentrating solar - thermal power capacity is being planned worldwide — a vast amount , given that only about 500 megawatts ( MW ) of such capacity has been built to date .
To maximise the energy that can be collected from the sun , solar - power facilities are being constructed in regions that enjoy daily uninterrupted sunshine for much of the year .
According to Mark Mehos of America 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , solar - thermal power could in theory generate 11,000GW in America 's south - west .
That is about ten times America 's entire existing power - generation capacity .
Simple techniques for concentrating sunlight to generate heat date back thousands of years .
In China and ancient Greece , people focused the sun 's rays with mirrors or glass to light fires .
In times of war , the same approach is said to have been used to set enemy ships ablaze .
By the early 20th century several scientists had built simple machines that could run on concentrated heat from the sun .
A significant milestone was reached in 1913 when Frank Shuman , an American inventor , created the first large solar - thermal pumping station in Meadi , Egypt .
He designed a system based on five large reflectors , each 62 metres long and made of glass mirrors arranged to form a trough in the shape of a parabola .
Each parabolic trough focused sunlight onto a tube running along its length , heating the water inside it .
The resulting steam powered an engine connected to a pump capable of delivering 6,000 gallons of water a minute from the Nile to nearby fields .
Do try to concentrate
The modern history of solar - thermal power began after the oil crises of the 1970s , which prompted many nations to start to investigate clean and renewable energy sources as alternatives to fossil fuels .
Over the following decades America , Spain and a handful of other countries built solar - thermal pilot plants for research purposes .
The first company to implement the technology on a commercial scale was Luz International , an Israeli company founded in 1980 .
Drawing on prior research , Luz began building a series of solar - thermal power stations in California 's Mojave desert in the mid-1980s .
Like Mr Shuman before , the company used parabolic troughs to focus sunlight on to liquid - filled tubes , but instead of water they used oil as the heat - transfer fluid .
Once it reached a temperature of about 390 °C , the hot oil was pumped to a so - called “ power block ” where it went through a series of heat exchangers , turning water into steam and powering a conventional steam - turbine .
The turbine then turned a generator to produce electricity .

By 1990 Luz had constructed nine plants with a total capacity of 354MW .
At the time , solar - thermal power was producing about 90 % of all solar electricity in the world , says Arnold Goldman , the former chief executive of Luz , who is now chairman of BrightSource .
But when the price of natural gas fell and America 's tax incentives for solar power were not renewed , the industry came to a grinding halt .
For nearly two decades no new commercial solar - thermal plants began operating .
In the meantime , solar - photovoltaic technology slowly took over the market , and by 2007 worldwide installed capacity reached 9.2GW .
Although it is more expensive per kilowatt - hour , solar panels can be deployed in small , modular systems , and thus require much less capital investment .
Moreover , they can generate power off the grid , which turned out to be an important market for solar power in its early days .
Now , as the solar - thermal industry is experiencing a revival , parabolic - trough projects are garnering much of today 's investment money because of their proven track record .
To improve the economics still further , SkyFuel , a firm based in New Mexico , is replacing curved glass mirrors , which are expensive to make , with a thin , reflective low - cost film .
And other competing solar - thermal technologies that were developed in parallel with trough - based systems , but never commercialised , are also ready to be deployed .
Among them is an approach that BrightSource uses , in which a field of small , flat mirrors called “ heliostats ” redirect and concentrate sunlight onto a central receiver at the top of a tower .
The tower contains a fluid , typically water , which boils and the resulting steam is then transferred to a nearby “ power block ” , where it spins a conventional turbine .
The advantage of this “ power tower ” approach is that it can produce steam at a temperature of 550 °C and can thus achieve a higher thermal - to - electric efficiency than trough - based systems , says John Woolard , the chief executive of BrightSource .
In addition , he says , power - tower systems suffer from fewer pumping losses than trough - based designs .
The first commercial power - tower began operating in Spain in 2007 .
Another advance that makes solar - thermal power more economically and technologically viable than in the past is the ability to use a large number of smaller and less expensive mirrors , steered by computer systems , to ensure more accurate and automatic tracking and redirection of sunlight than was ever possible before .
Bill Gross , the chief executive of eSolar , a developer of “ power tower ” technology based in Pasadena , California , says his firm is using software to turn thousands of flat mirrors and shape them into a continuously evolving parabola around the tower .
Storage and hybrids
Both power - tower and parabolic - trough systems can store thermal energy in the form of hot , molten salt .
It is then possible to generate steam , and thus electricity , even when the sun is not shining .
Solar - thermal plants without storage can operate about 30 % of the year ; but with storage that number could climb to 70 % or higher .
Unfortunately storage is expensive , and is only economical when regulators provide incentives .
In Spain , for example , producers of solar - thermal power receive a guaranteed feed - in tariff .
That makes it particularly appealing for Spanish plants to have storage capabilities , to maximise their ability to sell electricity to utilities .
In America the main incentives for solar - thermal projects are a 30 % investment - tax credit or an equivalent cash grant .
As a result , American plants have to be built more cheaply in order to make a profit , and thus typically do not include storage .

Power from a parabola
A cheaper alternative to storage is hybridisation .
All the original Luz plants also have natural - gas boilers that can generate steam when the sun is not shining .
Because solar - thermal plants have a power block and turbine already in place , the extra cost is marginal .
Hybridisation could also be done the other way around , by using steam generated from solar - thermal collectors to help drive the turbines at existing coal or gas plants .
The Electric Power Research Institute , based in Palo Alto , is studying the feasibility of this approach as a means of reducing fuel costs and emissions at existing power stations .
In addition to parabolic troughs and power - towers there is also a third solar - thermal technology , which combines curved , dish - shaped mirrors with heat engines .
In a dish - engine design , the mirrors concentrate sunlight to generate heat , which then typically powers a Stirling engine — a machine that converts heat into mechanical energy by compressing and expanding a fixed quantity of gas .
The change in pressure drives the engine 's pistons , which drive a shaft that turns a generator to produce electricity .
Although they are highly efficient , Stirling engines have seen little practical use since their invention nearly two centuries ago , and so far there are no commercial solar - thermal systems that use this approach .
Critics of the technology say it involves too many moving parts , making it more complex and expensive to operate and maintain than competing technologies .
Stirling Energy Systems , based in Phoenix , Arizona , hopes to prove the doubters wrong .
It has signed two large power - purchase agreements , for up to 1,750 MW , and plans to fulfil them using dish - engine systems built in conjunction with its sister company , Tessera Solar .
Both projects are due to start construction as early as 2010 .
One obstacle hampering the growth of the entire field is the difficulty of obtaining financing for solar - thermal projects in the current economic climate , says Thomas Mancini , programme manager for concentrating solar - power at Sandia National Laboratories .
As a result , some announced projects may be delayed or perhaps never be built .
The situation has prompted some companies to change their business models : Ausra , a solar - thermal company based in Mountain View , California , has switched from being an independent power - producer to being mostly an equipment supplier , for example .
Although solar - thermal power produces no carbon - dioxide emissions , it can have some negative environmental impacts .
Both power - tower and trough - based systems are typically water - cooled , and require millions of gallons of water annually .
That can cause big problems , especially in desert environments .
The California Energy Commission recently urged NextEra Energy Resources , a renewable - energy company , to consider dry cooling instead of using water for its proposed solar - thermal power project in Kern County , California .
( Stirling - engine designs do not require water for cooling . )
Another potential problem when building power plants in remote locations is a lack of transmission lines , since it is difficult and expensive to get new transmission lines approved and built .
Despite these problems , many people think a massive scale - up of the industry is imminent .
Among them is Mr Woolard , who believes that solar - thermal power could regain its historical lead over the solar - photovoltaic approach .
Competition from photovoltaic systems for large - scale power generation should not be underestimated , however .
According to Mr Bullard , thin - film solar - cell modules are rapidly falling in price , and can generate electricity more cheaply than solar - thermal power in some situations .
But no matter which approach comes out on top , competition between the two technologies is sure to foster continued innovation , and a growing supply of clean electricity , in the years to come .

The Evolution of God Review : Robert Wright Interview
In today ’s online issue of Salon.com there is an interesting interview with Robert Wright , a well - known American journalist .
Wright is the author of a new book “ The Evolution of God , ” which approaches its subject from the logical standpoint that , more often than not , we have created our Gods to match our own evolving self - image and needs .
Wright refers to himself as a materialist in that he thinks that the answers to religious questions , including the evolution of God , lie in the facts on the ground .
All good so far .
But a problem arises in how Wright discerns what is fact , and what he chooses to include and not include in forming his opinions .
For example , when it comes to Jesus and what kind of person he was , Wright argues that Jesus probably was n’t the great prophet of peace and love that we all think :
The fact is , the Sermon on the Mount , which is a beautiful thing , does not appear in Mark , which was the first written gospel .
And these views are not attributed to Jesus in the letters of Paul , which are the earliest post - crucifixion documents we have .
You see Paul develop a doctrine of universal love , but he ’s not , by and large , attributing this stuff to Jesus .
So , too , with “ love your enemies . ”
Paul says something like love your enemies , but he does n’t say Jesus said it .
It ’s only in later gospels that this stuff gets attributed to Jesus .
This will seem dispiriting to some people to hear that Jesus was n’t the great guy we thought he was .
But to me , it ’s actually more inspiring to think that the doctrines of transnational , trans-ethnic love were products of a multinational , imperial platform .
Wright then goes on to tell the ugly story where Jesus initially refuses to heal the daughter of woman not from Israel , basically telling her that we do n’t serve dogs here .
Wright ultimately feels that Jesus was a typical messianic Jewish preacher who thought God was going to come down to Earth and straighten things out .
So , where to start ?
Well the doctrine of universal love was not left out of the Gospel of Mark .
In Mark , Jesus says that whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother ( 3:35 ) ; he criticizes John for trying to stop someone from doing the work of God simply because the guy was n’t one of their followers ( 9:38 - 40 ) ; and he states that loving our neighbor as ourselves is the second greatest commandment ( 12:30 ) .
That Jesus was a prophet without borders is clearly demonstrated when he laments , “ A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relations , and in his own home . ” ( 6:4 ) .
The anecdote where Jesus compares a mother and daughter to a dog appears as a distinct anomaly when viewed within the context of Mark ’s entire Gospel , which is why its authenticity must be questioned .
Considering the strong racist attitudes that Jesus had to overcome among his followers and how notoriously slow to learn they were ( 6:52 , 8:17 ) , it seems more reasonable to assume that this episode was made up .
As to the Kingdom of God , one would be hard pressed to say that Jesus thought this meant God was literally coming down to straightening things out here on Earth .
If that were so , why do we find him using obscure parables and metaphors for the Kingdom of God , at one point likening it to a farmer who scatters seed but who does n’t know how the seeds grows ( Mark 4:26 - 27 ) .
Surely if God were coming down to sort us all out , he would know how he was going to do it .
While examining his “ facts on the ground ” on the evolution of God , Robert Wright ultimately stumbles for two reasons :
1 ) Wright does not always take into account the prejudices and weaknesses of the people who passed down the story of Jesus , and who by human nature would manipulate Jesus ’s message to match their own self - image and needs , just as we ’ve done ( as Wright well notes ) with our perceptions of God .
2 ) Wright undoubtedly held the personal belief that it is “ more inspiring to think that the doctrines of transnational , trans - ethnic love were products of a multinational , imperial platform ” prior to writing his book “ The Evolution of God , ” and consciously or unconsciously discerned “ the facts ” in a way to match that supposition .
WASHINGTON The European parliamentary elections have dealt a devastating blow to the left .
Even if many of the victorious right - wing parties have been responding like socialists to the economic recession , the election results express mistrust in the ability of Europes true socialists to address the so - called failures of free enterprise .
In those countries where socialist parties are in power such as Spain , Portugal , Austria , Britain or Hungary they were resoundingly defeated .
In conservative - controlled countries such as France , Italy , Germany , Poland , Denmark , the Netherlands , Finland or the Flemish part of Belgium , the socialists also took a severe beating .
Only in two countries , Slovakia and Greece , did the left beat the right in the case of Greece because of an ethical scandal .
The right - wing parties will control roughly 40 percent of the European Parliament against the socialists  22 percent .
The rights triumph is primarily explained by the insecurity that Europeans feel in the face of the economic meltdown .
The peoples response has not been to seek protection against the fall of capitalism  and the collapse of the American model in socialism , as one would have expected in Europe , but to seek reassurance among those parties perceived , rightly or wrongly , as safe stewards and guarantors of the free - market system .
Even before the crisis , the European Union was registering the slowest rate of economic growth in the developed world .
Now a catastrophe is taking place :
The mighty German economy will shrink by more than 6 percent this year , and Spain , one of the success stories of the modern era , is nearing 20 percent unemployment .
Not to speak of central and eastern Europe , where extremism has been on the rise since the first manifestations of the crisis .
Exacerbating an already bleak socioeconomic environment , the brutal recession has instilled more fear among Europeans than at any time since the worst days of the Cold War .
Despite their faults and excesses , Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi are perceived as better managers of the free enterprise system than their foes .
The electorate is much more fearful of left - leaning leaders and their parties who seem to be questioning the free - market model and pushing for a substitute .
That this should be the attitude of Europeans at a time when their governments are applying fiscal and monetary stimulus remedies to the moribund economy would appear contradictory .
After all , the Europe in which the state has committed $ 2.5 trillion to bank rescues , about three times the package approved by the U.S. Congress last year , is one in which right - wing governments already outnumber those of the left .
But Europeans seem to be saying :
If we are going to have socialism , we would rather have it applied by leaders who dont have much faith in it and deep down are not aiming to reverse the system .
Particularly noteworthy is the result in Germany , where the free - market liberals , known by the initials FDP , won 11 percent of the vote , almost doubling their performance in 2004 .
Their advance means that after the general election scheduled for September , the current coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats will likely be replaced by a new coalition between the Christian Democrats and the FDP .
The implications could be momentous .
Partly because of the pressure from the Social Democrats and partly because her own party ( and its Bavarian Social Christian cousin ) has a legacy of statism , Chancellor Angela Merkel has had to make concessions to government interventionism .
The authorities have incurred much new debt and come to the rescue of companies such as Opel , Arcandor , and Schaeffler .
With the FDP in a government coalition , Germany could begin to lead the developed world away from the interventionist mania gripping its leaders .
One should not pass over the other important headline of the hour the gains made by extremist , xenophobic parties in the Netherlands , Austria , Hungary , Slovakia , Finland and , to a lesser extent , Britain , where the British National Party obtained a seat .
Herein lies a major challenge for the victorious right - wing parties .
They are the ones in a position to marginalize the right - wing extremists .
The danger is that the democratic right will absorb part of the extremist agenda , thereby legitimizing it .
Should it be tempted to do so , it would render Europe a grave disservice and resuscitate the catatonic socialists .
With the lack of medical services in Gaza , critically ill patients must travel into Israel for treatment .
Many are asked to collaborate with Israeli intelligence services before they receive aid .
It has been alleged that if they refuse to become informers they are refused medical treatment .

The raids followed a joint investigation with the FBI
Nine people have been arrested in an investigation into a online music scam involving stolen credit cards worth hundreds of thousands of pounds .
It is believed a gang uploaded music to iTunes and Amazon for sale and then spent about £ 459,000 buying the tracks using 1,500 stolen credit cards .
Apple and Amazon then paid royalties on the sales totalling £ 184,000 .
The Met 's E - Crime Unit made the arrests after raiding properties in London , the West Midlands and Kent on Wednesday .
It follows a joint investigation with the FBI that began in February .
Det Ch Insp Terry Wilson , from E - Crime Unit , said : " This has been a complex investigation to establish what we believe to be an international conspiracy to defraud Apple and Amazon .
" We are now making it more risky for criminals who seek to exploit the internet and commit e-crime across national borders . "
Six men and three women were arrested at various addresses across England including London , Birmingham , Kent and Wolverhampton .
All nine are in custody at police stations in London and the Midlands on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering .
Here 's a truly progressive proposal to reform the privately - owned , debt - based monetary system .
Two time presidential candidate Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) will soon be introducing this legislation which truly is the way out of recession and back to prosperity .
The following article summarizes the legislation and also provides a link where the proposed American Monetary Act can be read .
THE WAY OUT
The primary cause of a recession is a shortage of money in the hands of the American people , the way out of recession is to put more money in their hands .
Under the present monetary system this can only be done by borrowing more and going deeper in debt .
It is difficult for people to understand that we have no money , instead we circulate bank - created interest - bearing debt as a " substitute money . "
The American Monetary
Act takes three simple steps to correct this debt problem .
(1) Incorporate the Federal Reserve Banks into the U. S. Treasury where all new money is created by government as real money , not interest - bearing debt , and spent into circulation to promote the general welfare ; monitored to be neither inflationary nor deflationary .
(2) Eliminate Fractional Reserve Banking in a manner that makes the federal government the only entity with the power to create , issue and regulate our money , as Article I , Section 8 , Clause 5 of the United States Constitution mandates .
(3) As the " debt- money " created by the privately owned Federal Reserve System and the commercial banks disappears when debts are paid , it will be replaced with real money spent into circulation to rebuild our badly decayed public infrastructure , which includes roads , bridges , dams , water and sewage plants , mass transit , schools , etc .
It also includes universal health care and education for all .
This will create millions of high paying jobs .
Also a substantial stimulus check will be sent out to immediately put money back in the hands of the American people .
We do n't need to " get credit flowing , " we need to get real money flowing .
All of this will be an interest - free , debt - free , inflation - free dividend to the American people .
What the so - called " too big to fail " banks do n't want you to know is that all of their money was created in the form of debt , and when they can no longer create more " debt - money " it will disappear as the debts are paid or defaulted , which means we will have to replace their debt money by spending real U. S. dollars into circulation .
Then we will finally get the benefits we should have received in the first place - and all these benefits come without debt , without taxes , and without inflation .
It will be a permanent money supply , not temporary as the present bank - created " debt- money " which disappears when debts are paid .
The real money we will need to spend into circulation to replace this " debt- money " is literally trillions of dollars .
And it all will appear as a bonus or dividend for the people .
This will be permanent money with no debt or interest charges attached .
To allow this recession or depression to continue when the way out is well known is inexcusable .
The American Monetary Act IS the way out of the present recession .

Step 1 : The Federal Reserve Bank of New York " buys " assets , normally government securities for sale on the open market , by creating the " money " to buy them out of thin air , and , in the process , the big banks are given , free of charge , an equal amount of new , so - called " reserves . "
These " reserves " become the basis for a 10 to 33 fold expansion of " debt- money " which will be loaned into existence by the banking system - with an interest charge attached .
We must all realize that , as Congressman Kucinich says , " The Federal Reserve is no more Federal than Federal Express . "
It is privately owned and controlled by the " too big to fail " banks .
Step 2 : Based on new " reserves " just created out of thin air and given to the big banks free of charge , the banking system uses the Federal Reserve 's Fractional Reserve System to expand or multiply those " reserves " by 10 to 33 times .
These so - called " reserves " are sometimes called " high - powered dollars " because of their multiplier effect .
The required reserve on demand deposits is presently 10 % for big banks and 3 % for smaller banks .
So , for the big banks , if they received , for example , one million of new " reserves " just created out of nothing by the Fed , they can create out of nothing , and loan out at interest , ten times that amount .
If and when any of these new " reserves " trickle down from the big banks to the small banks , those banks , with a 3 % reserve requirement on demand deposits , can create out of nothing , and loan out at interest , 33 1/3 times the amount of new " reserves " just received .
That 's the whole process as simply as it can be stated .
The end result is that , using the example of one million of new " reserves " , our people and their government and businesses are deeper in debt , interest bearing debt , not one million dollars deeper , but someplace between $ 10 million and $ 33 million deeper .
The more " debt - money " we have , the deeper in debt we are .
The American Monetary
Act eliminates this debt - based system and takes back the power to create , issue and regulate our money .
This legislation is the way out of recession and back to prosperity .
The banking system presently holds over $ 7 trillion of deposits .
These are all in the form of interest - bearing " debt- money . "
When banks can no longer create money and loan it into circulation with an interest charge attached , all $ 7 trillion will disappear as debts are paid or defaulted .
But we need this $ 7 trillion in our economy , so the government , under the American Monetary Act , will replace the " debt- money " as it disappears with real U. S. money spent directly into circulation as a tax - free , debt - free , interest - free dividend to the American people .

Testing with PHPUnit and Selenium
NetBeans IDE for PHP supports PHPUnit automated tests .
Thanks to PHPUnit , NetBeans IDE provides code coverage for PHP , similar to the code coverage the IDE provides for Python .
Test output appears in the same feature - rich output window that the IDE 's JUnit and Python test runners use .
NetBeans IDE also supports the Selenium portable test framework , in combination with PHPUnit .
A Selenium plug - in is available from the Update Center .
Installing this plugin adds a Selenium server to the IDE 's registered servers and adds Selenium test options to the PHP menus .
Contents
To follow this tutorial , you need the following software and resources .
Software or Resource Version Required NetBeans IDE PHP download bundle A PHP engine , including PEAR Version 5 .
A web server Apache HTTP Server 2.2 is recommended .
PHPUnit Version 3.4.0 or later .
PHPUnit 's Skeleton Generator
As version of PHPUnit .
Installing PHPUnit
Use PEAR to install PHPUnit as described in the PHPUnit documentation and PHPUnit 's Skeleton Generator as described in the Skeleton Generator documentation .
Install PHPUnit version 3.4.0 or later .
No special setup is needed .
After PHPUnit is installed , NetBeans can recognize it .
Note that you need to have PEAR installed with your PHP engine .
Also note that PHPUnit documentation says PHPUnit is usually installed to the local PEAR directory .
They give a path of / usr / lib / php / PHPUnit , but on XAMPP for Windows it is XAMPP_HOME \php\PEAR\PHPUnit .
To check that NetBeans IDE recognizes your PHPUnit installation , open Tools > Options ( On Mac , open NetBeans Preferences ) and look at the PHP window .
Open the Unit Testing tab .
The paths to your PHPUnit and Skeleton Generator scripts should appear .
If a script is not there , click Search next to the empty field .
The IDE searches you local system for the script .
Alternatively , click Browse and browse for the script .
Creating and Running PHPUnit Tests
NetBeans IDE can create and run PHPUnit tests on all PHP classes in a file .
To be sure that the test generator will work , give the PHP file the same name as the first class in the file .
To create and run PHPUnit tests for a class :
Create a PHP project named Calculator .
In this project , create a file named calculator . php .
In this file , type or paste the Calculator class from the Skeleton Generator chapter of the PHPUnit documentation .
<? php class Calculator { public function add ( $a , $ b ) { return $ a + $ b ; } } ?>
Add a comment block with the @assert annotation and some sample input and output .
Note that one incorrect assertion is included in this example .
<? php class Calculator { /** * @assert ( 0 , 0 ) == 0 * @assert ( 0 , 1 ) == 1 * @assert ( 1 , 0 ) == 1 * @assert ( 1 , 1 ) == 2 * @assert ( 1 , 2 ) == 4 */ public function add ( $a , $ b ) { return $ a + $ b ; } } ? >
Note :
You can use annotation code completion to add @assert annotations .
Navigate between parameters with the Tab key , or click Enter after filling in a parameter value .
In the Projects window , right - click the Calculator . php node and select Tools > Create PHPUnit Tests .
Note that you can create tests for all files in a project in the context menu for the Source Files node .
The first time you create tests , a dialog opens asking you for the directory in which you want to store test files .
In this example , the Browse function was used to create a tests directory .
Note :
You can manually write multiple tests for a project .
If you write multiple tests , you can sort them into subfolders of the test file directory , such as " important " or " quick . "
You can then run tests in a subfolder by right - clicking that folder and selecting Run Tests .
The IDE generates a skeleton test class in a file called CalculatorTest.php , which appears in your Projects window and opens in the editor .
Note that a test is created for each @assert annotation .
/** * Generated from @assert ( 1 , 1 ) == 2 . */ public function testAdd4 ( ) { $ this ->assertEquals ( 2 , $ this ->object -> add ( 1 , 1 ) ) ; }
You can test either an individual file or the entire project .
To test the project , right - click the project 's parent node and select Test , or press Alt - F6 .
To test the Calculator . php file , right - clict the file 's node and select Test , or press Ctrl - F6 / ⌘- F6 .
This example has only one class in one file , so the results are the same .
The IDE runs the tests and displays the results in the Test Results window .
A more verbose textual version of the results is displayed in the Output window .
Using Test Groups
You can select which groups of tests to execute when the test suite is run .
For example , you could have some tests you want to run only in a production environment and other tests that you want to run in both production and development environments .
You would place the former tests in a production group and the latter tests in both production and development groups .
When you run the test suite in your development environment , you select only the development test group to execute .
You must enable test groups for a PHP project before you use test groups on any file in that project .
To mark a test as part of a test group , annotate the test method with @group [ group name ] .
To create and run test groups :
In the Projects window , right - click the Calculator node and select Properties .
The Project Properties open .
In the Project Properties , select the PhpUnit category .
Select Ask for Test Groups Before Running Tests .
Click OK .
Open CalculatorTest.php in the editor .
For the methods testAdd , testAdd3 and testAdd5 , add the annotation @group production .
For the methods testAdd2 and testAdd4 , add the annotations @group production and @group development .
Right - click the Calculator . php node and select Test .
A dialog opens , asking you which test groups to run .
Select " development " and click OK .
The IDE only runs the tests that are annotated with @group development .
For more information about PhpUnit test groups in NetBeans IDE , see the NetBeans IDE for PHP blog post Using PHP Unit Test Groups .
Test Results and IDE Output
The results of PHPUnit tests are displayed in two of the IDE 's windows , Test Results and Output .
The Test Results window has a graphic pane and a short text pane .
The Output window gives a more verbose textual version of the output .
In this section , you explore the Test Results and Output windows in detail .
In the Test Results window , you get information about failed tests from these locations :
Messages in the UI pane attached to the tree entry for the failed test
Text in the right - side pane , including links to the lines of test code that failed
Tooltip text that appears when you hover the cursor over a failed test in the UI pane
The Test Results window includes the following buttons on the left side :
Rerun the test
Show failed tests
Show passed tests
Show tests that passed but with errors
Navigate between showing the next test result or the previous test result
The Output window shows the full output of the PHPUnit script .
It can be useful when you cannot identify the cause of an error with the information in the Test Results window .
Like Test Results , the Output window includes links to the test class line that failed .
It also includes buttons on the left side for rerunning the test and for opening the PHP Options window .
Code Coverage
NetBeans IDE for PHP offers code coverage along with PHPUnit support .
( The IDE also offers code coverage for Python ) .
Code coverage checks whether all your methods are covered by PHPUnit tests .
In this section , you see how code coverage works with your existing Calculator class .
To use code coverage :
Open Calculator.php and add a duplicate add function , called add2 .
The Calculator class now looks like the following : <? php class Calculator { /** * @assert ( 0 , 0 ) == 0 * @assert ( 0 , 1 ) == 1 * @assert ( 1 , 0 ) == 1 * @assert ( 1 , 1 ) == 2 * @assert ( 1 , 2 ) == 4 */ public function add ( $a , $ b ) { return $ a + $ b ; } public function add2 ( $a , $ b ) { return $ a + $ b ; } } ?>
Right - click the project node .
From the context menu , select Code Coverage > Collect and Display Code Coverage .
By default , Show Editor Bar is also selected .
The editor now has a code coverage editor bar across the bottom .
Because code coverage has not been tested , the editor bar reports 0 % coverage .
( It also displays this after you click Clear to clear test results . )
Click
Test to test the open file or All Tests to run all tests for the project .
The Test Results display .
In addition , the Code Coverage bar tells you what percentage of your executable code statements is covered by tests .
In the editor window , covered code is highlighted in green and uncovered code is highlighted in red .
Warning :
If you re-generate the test files AFTER adding the add2 function , the PHPUnit tests will not run .
This is because PHPUnit creates two conflicting testAdd2 functions .
Do not differentiate functions by appending numbers at the end if you plan to use PHPUnit on more than one such function .
See the the PHPUnit documentation .
In the Editor Bar , click on Report ...
The Code Coverage report opens , showing the results of all tests run on your project .
Buttons in the report let you clear the results , run all the tests again , or deactivate code coverage ( click Done ) .
You can add another class to your project , delete and recreate the test files and look at the code coverage report again .
Your new class is listed .
In the following report , the Calculator class again has a function that is not included in the tests .
Using Project - Specific Configurations
In the IDE , you can select the following custom configurations for your project :
A bootstrap file
An XML configuration file
A test suite
A custom PHPUnit script
To set a project - specific configuration :
Right - click the project 's node or the project 's Test Files node and select Properties .
This opens the Properties dialog .
Select the PHPUnit category .
A dialog opens in which you can select a custom bootstrap , XML configuration , PHPUnit script , or test suite file .
If you are not familiar with the structure of bootstrap or XML configuration files , you can use NetBeans IDE to generate a skeleton for you .
You can also find instructions about using the dialog by clicking Help .
The bootstrap option is required for projects that use a custom class loader , for example by implementing the __autoload ( ) magic function .
You also use the bootstrap option if you need to include a file in advance , such as a file that defines global constants used by multiple classes in your project .
The XML configuration file allows you to define options that you use in a command line call .
There is a complete introduction in the PHPUnit manual .
You can also use the XML configuration file to define php.ini settings and global vars for your test cases .
You can set the bootstrap option in the XML configuration file too .
If you set a custom test suite , you run that suite whenever you select Run > Test Project .
This is particularly useful when you wish to run only a subset of your tests , or if you want to use recently added features of PHPUnit that you have to add manually , such as Data Providers .
Note that you may of course define as many test suites as you want and run them separately by right - clicking the file in your project explorer and choosing " run " .
To prevent confusion , NetBeans notifies you if you are using a custom Test Suite .
The notification can be found in the Test Results and in the Output window .
You can use a custom PHPUnit script for a project , instead of the default script selected in Tools > Options .
The custom PHPUnit script can include any command - line switches described in the PHPUnit manual .
Running Tests on the Selenium Framework
Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web applications .
The tests can be written as HTML tables or coded in a number of popular programming languages and can be run directly in most modern web browsers .
Selenium can be deployed on Windows , Linux , and Macintosh .
For more details see the Selenium web site .
NetBeans IDE has a plugin that includes a Selenium server .
With this plugin , you can run Selenium tests on PHP , Web Application , or Maven projects .
To run Selenium tests on PHP , you need to install the Testing Selenium package to your PHP engine .
To run Selenium tests on PHP :
Open a command prompt and run the command pear install Testing_Selenium - beta .
You need PHP_HOME / php / PEAR on your Path .
If the command is successful , the prompt will display install ok : channel://pear.php.net/Testing_Selenium-0.4.3 .
In the IDE , open Tools > Plugins and install the Selenium Module for PHP .
In the Projects window , right - click the project node for your Calculator project .
Select New >
Other .
The New File wizard opens .
Select Selenium and click Next .
The first time you create a Selenium test , a dialog opens asking you to set a directory for Selenium test files .
This should be a separate directory from PHPUnit test files .
Otherwise , the Selenium tests run every time you run unit tests .
Running functional tests like Selenium usually takes more time than running unit tests , therefore you will probably not want to run these tests every time you run unit tests .
Accept the defaults in the Name and Location page and click Finish .
The new Selenium test file opens in the editor and appears in the Projects window .
The Run Selenium Tests item is now added to the project 's context menu .
Click this item , and the Selenium test results display in the Test Results window , the same as PHPUnit tests .
More Exercises
Here are a few more ideas for you to explore :
Add a second class to Calculator . php , such as a Calculator2 class that multiplies $ a and $ b. Delete and regenerate the tests .
class that multiplies $ a and $ b. Delete and regenerate the tests .
If you try the multi-part Creating a CRUD Application tutorial , create a Selenium test for the final project .

It is no doubt that Tata Nano is going to rock the automobile world with its great performance at this price .
This affordable car has thus attracted lots of people and the company has received more than 206,000 applications till now and its even coming says Tata motors spokesperson .
Due to various constraints , the company ran a lottery to choose the applicants to buy the available 100000 Nanos and is informing the results to the selected applicants in person .
Tata Motors also has mentioned that the first 100000 applicants who are selected will get their Nano by the end of next year as delivery of the cars will begin by July ’09 .
In the remaining 106000 people who are in the waiting list 55000 opted out their name from lottery for future Nanos and the company has announced some discounts for these people in all Tata products .
These discounts will even be available to those who are still in contention for winning their Nano .
The money that Tata collected as booking fee will earn some interest for the customers which is 8.5 % if the car is delivered within two years and 8.75 % if it takes more than that time .

Via BuzzFlash , the photos they do n't want us to see .
A sample , from a 2006 Australian newspaper article :
There are more disturbing ones than the one above , 15 in all .
Sarah Palin is again responding forcefully to a perceived attack on one of her children , this time attacking an Alaska blogger who edited a picture of her and her baby son , Trig , to replace Trig 's face with the image of a conservative Alaska talk show host , Eddie Burke .
Emails Palin's spokesman Meghan Stapleton :
Recently we learned of a malicious desecration of a photo of the Governor and baby Trig that has become an iconic representation of a mother 's love for a special needs child .
The mere idea of someone doctoring the photo of a special needs baby is appalling .
To learn that two Alaskans did it is absolutely sickening .
Linda Kellen Biegel , the official Democrat Party blogger for Alaska , should be ashamed of herself and the Democratic National Committee should be ashamed for promoting this website and encouraging this atrocious behavior .
Babies and children are off limits .
It is past time to restore decency in politics and real tolerance for all Americans .
The Obama Administration sets the moral compass for its party .
We ask that special needs children be loved , respected and accepted and that this type of degeneracy be condemned .

Well I guess were not alone here , an exploration squad was down in the basement areas when they heard banging and moans from down there .
That gives me the creeps , but they said they locked , bolted and barricaded the door so I ’m sure were safe .
Tuesday , day 4 , Evening
Soo tired , we spent the whole day hauling stuff around , barricading the lower doors and the entrances , I think we all got a little paranoid and just went nuts blocking all the doors .
My muscles ache from all the lifting and the cut on my arm is itching like crazy .
Thursday , day 6
I am still tired from Tuesday , I guess the adrenalin , my beer gut and the lifting had a heavy toll on me .
I think being cooped up like this is affecting me .
Ive noticed I seen to drool a lot now and daydreaming , i’ll just be standing around in my own little world until someone asks me to help out .
I ’m not even sure what I think about .
Weird .
The food tastes like ash too , I could kill for a nice steak right now .
The cut on my arm is looking a little Grey , it might be the light though .
Friday , day
I tired .
Su tird .
The others shouted as me day .
Not sure why , I hunger still .
The cut is fine now , both arms grey , so that ’s ok .
Day day
Keep shaking .

I just noticed a comment left on one of my YouTube videos regarding Miss California .
It was SO incredible and shocking to SEE these two names ( Palin / Prejean ) together , and written in reference to a United States presedential election that I think I may be speechless ; so I 'm just going to post it for you to take a gander at yourself :

Hubble snaps first optical photo of exoplanet
After eight years and repeated photographs of a nearby star in hopes of finding planets , University of California , Berkeley , astronomer Paul Kalas finally has his prize : the first visible - light snapshots of a planet outside our solar system .
( Paul Kalas / UC Berkeley , NASA , ESA )
Only 25 light years from Earth , the planet - probably close to the mass of Jupiter - orbits the star Fomalhaut at a distance about four times that between Neptune and the sun .
Formally known as Fomalhaut b , the planet could have a ring system about the dimension of Jupiter 's early rings , before the dust and debris coalesced into the four Galilean moons .
The planet 's existence was suspected in 2005 , when images Kalas took with the Hubble Space Telescope 's Advanced Camera for Surveys showed a sharply defined inner edge to the dust belt around Fomalhaut , in the southern constellation Piscus Austrinus ( southern fish ) .
The sharp edge and off - center belt suggested to Kalas that a planet in an elliptical orbit around the star was shaping the inner edge of the belt , much like Saturn 's moons groom the edges of its rings .
" The gravity of Fomalhaut b is the key reason that the vast dust belt surrounding Fomalhaut is cleanly sculpted into a ring and offset from the star , " Kalas said .
" We predicted this in 2005 , and now we have the direct proof . "
" It will be hard to argue that a Jupiter - mass object orbiting an A star like Fomalhaut is anything other than a planet , " said coauthor James R. Graham , professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley .
" That does n't mean it 's exactly what we expected when we went hunting for planets in this system . "
The discovery will be reported Nov. 14 on Science Express , an online site that posts articles in advance of their print publication in the journal Science .
The Science paper is complemented by an article to appear in The Astrophysical Journal ( ApJ ) that analyzes the interaction between the planet and the dust belt surrounding Fomalhaut and cinches the estimation of the planet 's mass .
" Every planet has a chaotic zone , which is basically a swath of space that encloses the planet 's orbit and from which the planet ejects all particles , " said Eugene Chiang , a UC Berkeley associate professor of astronomy and of earth and planetary science , and first author of the ApJ paper .
" This zone increases with the mass of the planet , so , given the size of the chaotic zone around Fomalhaut b , we can estimate that its likely mass is in the vicinity of one Jupiter mass . "
( ESA , NASA , and L. Calçada [ ESO for STScI ] )
Kalas , Graham , Chiang and UC Berkeley graduate student Edwin S. Kite are coauthors of both papers , along with Mark Clampin of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. The other authors of thepaper are Michael P. Fitzgerald of the Institute of Geophysics & Planetary Science at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , and John Krist and Karl Stapelfeldt of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Kalas has focused on the star Fomalhaut since his days 15 years ago as a graduate student , when he used early optical CCD technology to look for dust surrounding Fomalhaut .
In 1998 , submillimeter - wavelength radio observations of the disk showed that cold dust was distributed in a ring around the central star , much like the ring of comets called the Kuiper Belt in our solar system .
In 2004 , Kalas began using Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys to probe the dust belt and , three years ago , he showed that the disk 's inner edge was sharply delineated , suggesting that an unseen planet orbits Fomalhaut and shapes the edge .
He now has two photographs of the planet , taken in 2004 and 2006 , which show that its movement over a 21 - month period exactly fits what would be expected from a planet orbiting Fomalhaut every 872 years at a distance of 119 astronomical units , or 11 billion miles .
One astronomical unit ( AU ) is the average distance between the Earth and the sun , or 93 million miles .
" I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star , " Kalas said .
" It 's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen . "
Because of the relatively low mass and distant orbit of the planet , it can not be detected by today 's standard technique , which is to measure the tiny wobble a planet induces in its star .
Astronomers hoping to photograph extrasolar planets have taken a different approach , looking in the infrared at young stars in hopes of detecting the warm glow from cooling planets .
Fomalhaut b is not seen in the infrared , however .
Instead , Kalas snapped photos in visible light , which for most planets would be impossible because of the bright glare of the star .
Even with Hubble 's coronagraph to block the star 's light , the new planet would not have been detected if it had been much closer to its star , or much dimmer .
" To make this discovery at optical wavelengths is a complete surprise , " he said .
" If we 're seeing light in reflection , then it must be because Fomalhaut b is surrounded by a planetary ring system so vast it would make Saturn 's rings look pocket - sized by comparison .
Fomalhaut b may actually show us what Jupiter and Saturn resembled when the solar system was about a hundred million years old . "
Kalas noted that all other reported images of extrasolar planets have either been disproven or the planets have masses so uncertain they could be brown dwarfs , which are failed stars with masses above 13 Jupiter masses and that glow bright in the infrared .
The Fomalhaut science team , on the other hand , used not only the observed brightness of Fomalhaut b to estimate the mass , but also the fact that a massive planet or brown dwarf would push Fomalhaut 's dust belt farther away than what is observed .
Chiang thinks he can narrow the mass to between 0.3 and 2 Jupiter masses , most likely one Jupiter mass .
" Any more massive than that and its gravity would destroy the vast dust belt encircling the star , " Kalas said .
The belt extends from 133 to about 200 AU from the star , and Chiang estimates that , in dust alone , it has a mass that exceeds three Earths .
" There 's so much solid material in the belt that it could easily form the basis of a core for a Jupiter - mass planet .
This is consistent with Fomalhaut b having formed in situ , at an unprecedentedly large distance from its host star , " Chiang said .
Fomalhaut is about 200 million years old and will burn out in about a billion years , making it a short - lived star compared to our sun , which is now about 4.5 billion years old and expected to burn another 5 billion years .
Its short life is a result of being 16 times brighter than the sun , but this also makes the star appear from the planet 's surface about as bright as our sun appears from Neptune , despite the fact that it lies four times farther from Fomalhaut than Neptune does from the sun , Kalas said .
" Fomalhaut b sits in a frigid location , but it 's not too different from that of Neptune in our solar system , " he said .
Interestingly , the planet mysteriously dimmed by half a stellar magnitude between the 2004 and 2006 observations .
Fomalhaut b could have a hot outer atmosphere heated by bubbling convection cells , or the brightness change could indicate there is hot gas at the inner boundary of the ring around the planet .
" This is not your theorist 's ideal planet , it is obviously more complicated than we thought , " Graham said .
The researchers are awaiting repair of Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Near Infrared Camera to resume their observations to confirm the planet 's orbit , discover the source of its unusual brightness in the visible , and perhaps find other planets .
" There is plenty of empty space between Fomalhaut b and the star for other planets to happily reside in stable orbits , " Kalas said .
" We 'll probably have to wait for the James Webb Space Telescope to give us a clear view of the region closer to the star where a planet could host liquid water on the surface . "
The research was supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation .
Dear Cecil :
Do bras keep breasts from sagging as you get older ?
I 've heard reports that they do nothing at all .
Curious
Cecil replies :
Oh , bras probably do something .
It ’s just that nobody can agree on what it is .
I wo n’t pretend to have the definitive answer , but here ’s what we ’ve established so far :
(1) The medical term for breast sagging is breast ptosis .
One often hears that “ the French have a word for it , ” “ it ” being any inscrutable aspect of daily life .
However , if the French ever get stumped , ask a doctor .
(2) The upper and lateral portion of the breast , as long as we ’re working on our vocabulary , is known as the tail of Spence .
This is an extremely difficult fact to work into ordinary conversation .
(3) There is , so far as your columnist can discover , zero evidence that bras prevent saggy breasts .
( I ’m not about to keep saying “ breast ptosis , ” which sounds like something you ’d take penicillin for . )
My assistant Gfactor —
Una is still recovering from creme brulee duty — scoured the medical journals and turned up nothing .
Admittedly this would n’t be an easy thing to study : though yes , I ’m sure you could find 10 or 20 million guys who’d be happy to help , ho ho ho , my guess is if you actually had to stare at ( palpate , whatever ) human flesh day after day and rate its sagginess , the novelty would eventually wear off .
(4) Bras originated in 1863 as an alternative to corsets .
The purpose of corsets , we can agree , was to squeeze a woman ’s body into something more closely resembling the 19th - century ideal of beauty , which had the unfortunate side effect of making it impossible to breathe .
One may argue that bras are likewise intended to enhance the female figure but in a less drastic manner .
(5) Be that as it may , bras have always been touted for their health benefits , and given that they chased out corsets , who can argue ?
The original patent application for a bra , submitted by Luman Chapman , asserts that his breast supporter helps avoid “ injuries to the breasts and abdomen . ”
By 1927 bra makers were claiming their products supported “ drooping busts ” and strengthened “ weakened tissues . ”
A 1952 article in Parents magazine ( then called Parents ’ Magazine ) , which offers the bizarre suggestion that one should periodically trace the silhouette of one ’s daughter ’s breasts ( presumably unclothed ) to gauge their development , also exhorts parents to get their girls training bras at the first sign of puberty lest the poor kids ’ breasts drop .
(6) Bra manufacturers do n’t necessarily believe their products prevent sagging .
In a 2000 article in the Independent we find John Dixey , chief executive of Playtex , agreeing with surgery professor Robert Mansell on this point .
Mansell : Sagging is “ a function of the weight , often of heavy breasts , and these women are wearing bras and it does n’t prevent it . ”
Dixey : “ We have no medical evidence that wearing a bra could prevent sagging , because the breast itself is not muscle so keeping it toned up is an impossibility . ”
Others have greater faith .
In a 1990 Runner ’s World article , exercise physiologist and biomechanics researcher LaJean Lawson compares the bouncing of breasts during running to the stretching that occurs when a woman “ wears heavy earrings all the time ” and recommends sports bras during exercise .
(7) In contrast to pretty much everything else you hear on this subject , we do have some scientific evidence that sports bras are a good idea , though for reasons having little to do with sagging .
For a 1999 article in Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport , Mason et al had women exercise at varying degrees of strenuousness while wearing different types of bra or no top at all ; the subjects reported much less breast pain when clad in a sports bra .
OK , the total number of subjects was three , which is not going to win anyone the Nobel Prize , but at least they were making an effort .
(8) I do n’t dispute that many if not most women need breast support while exercising and that large - breasted and lactating women need support just for walking around .
The question is whether a nonpregnant , nonlactating woman of average endowment needs to wear a bra routinely .
Women ’s breasts , even small ones , clearly sag over time , and it ’s not hard to believe the steady tug of gravity on minimally supported tissue partly explains why .
( Other factors : significant weight loss , postpartum atrophy , and postmenopausal involution . )
Conceivably a bra could delay the process .
However , not to harp on this , we do n’t know it for a fact .
(9) Then again , maybe it does n’t matter .
I ’d suggest bras are primarily a tool of fashion : they give women an approximation of the idealized female shape plus some control over jiggle , cleavage , and nipple protrusion — the undeniable fact being that most people look better , and feel more comfortable , with clothes on than with them off .

Two games have recently been released that bear several striking similarities .
Both of these games are open - world sandbox titles featuring superpowered antiheroes who begin to realize a host of awesome abilities with which to distribute justice and / or malice as they see fit .
While they share a lot of features , the two games are certainly distinguishable , taking the superhero model in different directions .
However , that does n't mean we 're not going to compare and fight about them anyway , just because we can .
Contrasting the two games , it is very obvious that Prototype is better than inFAMOUS , and anybody who disagrees is a despicable moron who does n't know anything about videogames and should probably just die .
Read on to feel justified in agreeing with me , or to be shamed by just how incorrect and rubbish at life you truly are .
1. Alex Mercer is n't a pussy :
Apparently , Cole is supposed to be a superhero , which does n't explain why , exactly , he 's an utter pussy who could n't hold his own in a fight against Anne Frank .
While Mercer is able to take on an entire army , a special forces group , and a city full of infected mutations at the same time , Cole struggles against junkies and hobos , barely able to defend himself against a few druggies dressed in trashbags .
It 's disgustingly pathetic .
Mercer is pulling the tops off tanks , hijacking helicopters , and absorbing monsters into his own skin .
Cole is hanging off the sides of buildings take wimpy little electric potshots at some loser with a shotgun .
If Cole were to audition for the Justice League , Batman would give him a wedgie and then laugh him out of the building .
He'd be right to do so .
If Mercer turned up for the same audition , he 'd probably just eat Batman .
This is because Mercer is n't dickless like Cole is .
2. Chain link fences :
On the subject of Cole being a pussy , what kind of lame , worthless " hero " can't deal with a chain link fence ?
Many are the times in inFAMOUS when enemies will safely hide behind fences , happily shooting the shit out of you while your electricity attacks harmlessly disperse along the metal that stands between you and retribution .
Unable to do anything to remove the fences , Cole is absolutely helpless in this situation .
Quite why the game 's villains did n't just trap him in a big metal chainlink box , I do not know .
He 'd have been able to do nothing but cry .
While playing Prototype , I came across a few chain link fences .
Remembering Cole 's shame from inFAMOUS , I conducted a little test titled , " Is Alex Mercer defeated by fences like that idiot Cole ? "
The result of this test is very conclusive -- Alex Mercer can punch chain link fences into tiny fucking pieces .
Mercer is to fences what Ed Kemper was to the severed heads of college girls .
If any enemies dared to stand behind a fence and shoot at Mercer , he 'd pull that shit right down and then cut the prick into tiny little pieces .
Meanwhile , all Cole has to do is see a bit of thin metal and he runs away with shit streaming down his legs .
3. Upgrades :
Both inFAMOUS and Prototype feature an experience system that can be used to upgrade characters .
However , only one game features upgrades that are actually worth getting .
If you 'd have guessed that inFAMOUS was that game , you 'd be a fucking twat .
Let 's compare the two experiences -- after several hours of playing inFAMOUS , I had finally eked enough XP to purchase one or two powers that were barely useful .
After five minutes of playing Prototype , I had more XP than I knew what to do with and was soon gliding from the rooftops , slicing people to bits with claws , and performing mid-air dashes .
Prototype showers the players with rewards and then treats them like a kid in a candy store .
inFAMOUS makes you work severely hard , earning maybe up to 5 XP per kill , for such shitty powers as " barely effective stomp attack that usually causes more harm than good " or " melee damage that you wo n't need because enemies are always hiding miles away from you . "
Prototype has more upgrades , better upgrades , and better upgrades for those upgrades .
inFAMOUS has a rubbish gliding ability that Mercer embarrassingly outmatches .
4. Prototype is n't spelled all stupid :
Seriously , inFAMOUS ?
What the fuck is with that grammar ?
Prototype is just Prototype .
It 's not prTROToTYpE or pr0t0ty p3 or P.R.O.T.O.T.Y.P.E. Simply Prototype. inFAMOUS is stupid and pretentious .
That kind of spelling makes it look like Apple designed the game .
It 's a fucking videogame , not a shitting iPod .
inFAMOUS loses the battle of the names , which is a real and serious battle and not just an arbitrary , contrived point of contention invented to generate fanboy rage .
Sony should come back when it learns to spell things properly , not like some 14 - year - old girl 's LiveJournal .
Seriously , PlayStation ?
With a capital S !?
GET REAL , SONY !
Or should I say sOnY !?
P.S : Some people have tried to argue that Prototype is spelled [ PROTOTYPE ] and this is stupider .
It 's actually not though .
Brackets are n't letters so it is not a spelling you idiots , and sometimes Sega can be spelled SEGA .
Because of these reasons , this means I am still right .
I have reasons .
5 . Enemy variety :
Say what you will about Prototype ( although mainly say it's better than inFAMOUS , because it is ) , the game certainly does n't shy away from having a variety of enemy types with which to deal .
Tanks , choppers , soldiers , supersoldiers , mutants , robots , there is plenty to fight and plenty of ways to go about it .
inFAMOUS comes up short yet again , thanks to enemies that pretty much behave in exactly the same way from the very start of the game to the very end .
The gangs of inFAMOUS look pretty good , but there is nary a difference between them .
The Reapers and the Dustmen are just model swaps as opposed to anything else .
Occassionally you get a powerful opponent called a Conduit , but they are few and far between , leading to the same , repetitive battles throughout the whole experience .
Also , inFAMOUS is ghey .
I saw it being ghey a bit and it looked at me when it did it .
6 . The Prototype comic book has an awesome rapetrap story in it :
In the Prototype comic book , there is a bit set in Vietnam , and some soldiers are talking .
One of the soldiers mentions his friend , who tried to rape a fourteen - year - old girl but was unsuccessful because he , and I quote , " Got his dick sliced up real good on account of the little slope sticking glass in her cooch for just such an occasion . "
Proof , if proof be needed , that Prototype is better than inFAMOUS .
InFAMOUS does n't even have a comic ( that I 've been bothered to read ) , let alone one with Vietnamese cooch glass rapetraps .
7. Running up buildings >
Climbing like a spastic monkey :
Mercer and Cole both have very different ideas about what Parkour is .
One of them thinks the best way to get around town is to slowly climb up buildings , trying to guess where the player wants to go and generally grabbing the wrong thing to frustrate everybody and become a prone target for enemies .
One of them just runs the fuck up a building and then flies to wherever the Hell he wants to go .
One of them 's a total prick .
One of them is called Alex Mercer and he likes to run up buildings .
While playing as Mercer , you can dash through the streets and gleefully have him jump instantly over cars , push through crowds and dash up vertical surfaces .
As Cole , you can run a bit fast and be worried about jumping in case he magnetizes himself to a lamp post or whatever else happens to be in the way .
That is when Cole does n't just glitch through the road .
8. Water :
" Wah wah wah , I 'm Cole , I can't get wet because I 'm full of electric magic and that means I 'll get hurt ! "
Cry me a river , bitch .
Oh wait , you can't because if you did that you 'd get wet and then you 'd die !
What a frigging pansy .
Cole can't get wet because he's an immense wanker and gets hurt just whenever he touches the stuff .
Once again , you come up trumps on Prototype .
If Alex Mercer happens to fall in water , he stays submerged for a second before thinking , " fuck this drowning shit " and leaps heroically out of the blue and onto dry land .
Meanwhile , Cole can't even take a bath and so obviously stinks of shit and smegma .
How can he even drink ?
He can't , apparently .
Cole is destined to die of thirst , while Mercer can drink whatever the hell he likes .
9 . The head of developer Sucker Punch is racist :
Probably .
10 . Final Fantasy XIII is coming to the Xbox 360 :
The last and most important point is that Final Fantasy XIII is coming to the Xbox 360 , even though PS3 fans said it never ever would .
This means they were wrong about it , and if they were wrong about FFXIII , who knows what else they could be wrong about ?
Maybe , for example , they could be wrong about inFAMOUS being better than Prototype , since every PS3 fan on the planet obviously loves inFAMOUS so much ?
Yes , yes that is exactly the thing that has happened that I am writing about !
Square Enix 's personal and hate - filled betrayal of everything PS3 fans hold dear is proof positive that Prototype is better than inFAMOUS , as well as Killzone 2 , Uncharted and LittleBigPlanet .
I have come to this conclusion using a little thing called logic , and you can't dispute logic , so do n't even bother trying you idiot .
There you have it .
I have sufficiently proven that Prototype is blatantly better than inFAMOUS , and if for some reason you still do n't agree with me , you are obviously some sort of fucking retard who needs to go drown in a swamp .
Space junkies and wannabe astronauts rejoice – we ’ve got exclusive video of Virgin Galactic ’s recent test flight in the Mojave .
Wired.com got its mitts on the first official cockpit video and other footage from the recent test of Virgin Mothership Eve at the Scaled Composites skunkworks operation in sunny SoCal .
Scaled Composites and Virgin tend to keep the test results hush - hush but say “ several recent published articles have been sufficiently inaccurate and negative ” to make them “ set the record straight . ”
They could be referring to reports by FlightGlobal that VMS Eve , the prototype of the White Knight 2 that took to the air , suffered a tail strike during an April 20 flight and experienced rudder problems .
Scaled Composites , in a statement ( .pdf ) , called the test “ very successful ” and said , “ we only needed to adjust the rudder forces . ”
Yeah , yeah .
Get to the video …
Pretty cool , huh ?
White Knight 2 ’s will make its public debut next month at a fly - over during the groundbreaking for Virgin Galactic ’s Spaceport America terminal .

If you ’re interested , here ’s the text of the statement Scaled Composites issued about the test :
Scaled Composites has historically not released technical status information of its flight test programs while the tests are being conducted .
An obvious downside of a public flight test program is that if the team feels like their learning might be taken out of context by the public that they may make decisions that do not properly address test safety instead of public perception .
Accordingly , Scaled has made no comment about the active White Knight Two flight test program .
However , several recent published articles have been sufficiently inaccurate and negative that we have decided , with our customer ’s approval , to set the record straight and report briefly on key test results to date .
The WK2 has a fully mechanical , reversible control system with no boost or augmentation of any kind .
This always represents a challenge from the standpoint of aerodynamic design , since as vehicle size increases , so do control forces .
The decision to use a simple , reliable mechanical system on the WK2 is not unusual ; aircraft as large as the B - 36 and the DC - 9 have un-boosted controls for the same reasons .
Thus , the WK2 was designed to provide acceptable pilot feel forces without boosted controls .
We always expected that the aerodynamics would have to be adjusted as we conducted flight tests in order to optimize the forces ( not too heavy , not “ overbalanced ” and thus too light or unstable .
Regardless of aircraft size , it is not unusual to expend a significant portion of the flight tests to optimize pilot feel forces .
The good news from the first WK2 flights is that we only needed to adjust the rudder forces .
The first flight , with the gear down , also illuminated that the main landing gear wake significantly affected these forces .
As a result , we have made three modifications to the rudder aerodynamic balances , along with adding vortex generators to ensure we
achieved the maximum effectiveness of these changes .
We concluded the rudder aerodynamic modification tasks following flight 3 .
The basic stability of the WK2 about all three axes is strongly positive , and the aerodynamic design predictions match the flight test data very closely .
We have now completed a significant portion of the longitudinal center of gravity envelope expansion with excellent results .
Systems development is coming along well , and we will be flying to high altitudes ( above 50,000 ft ) this summer .
Flight 4 , conducted on 20 April was very successful , with gear retraction , cg envelope expansion , and systems evaluations .
During a touch and go landing , we encountered a significant thrust asymmetry ( not a fault of the engines or the design but of an asymmetric idle thrust setting ) that resulted in a large yaw upon power - up for the takeoff part of the maneuver .
Both rudders were lightly scraped ( less than 1/4 inch of material ) while recovering from this asymmetry .
The aircraft behaved extremely well throughout the recovery , and we thoroughly understand the root cause of the asymmetry .
Only procedural changes are required to ensure we do not experience it again .
This was not a function of the crosswind at landing , which was within previously demonstrated levels .
We appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight .
In the mean time , do be cautious of what you read if it does not come from either our flight test team or our customer .
Also , to state the obvious , you should question the motivations of a publication that reports design or flight test information that is based only on speculation .

Amateur video accounts showed at least one large protest gathering , on Shirazi Street , though it was unclear how long it lasted .
But in the network of Internet postings and Twitter messages that has become the opposition ’s major tool for organizing and sharing information , a powerful and vivid new image emerged : a video posted on several Web sites that showed a young woman , called Neda , her face covered in blood .
Text posted with the video said she had been shot .
It was not possible to verify the authenticity of the video .
The Web site of another reformist candidate , Mehdi Karoubi , referred to her as a martyr who did not “ have a weapon in her soft hands or a grenade in her pocket but became a victim by thugs who are supported by a horrifying security apparatus . ”
Accounts of the election ’s aftermath in the state - run press suggested that the government might be laying the groundwork for discrediting and arresting Mr. Moussavi .
IRNA , the official news agency , quoted Alireza Zahedi , a member of the Basij militia , as saying Mr. Moussavi had provoked the violence , sought help from outside the country to do so and should be put on trial .
The Fars news agency quoted a Tehran University law professor as saying that Mr. Moussavi had acted against “ the security of the nation . ”
State television suggested that at least some of the unrest was instigated by an outlawed terrorist group , the Mujahedeen Khalq , which does not have a strong following in Iran .
Mr. Moussavi was not seen in public on Sunday but showed no sign of yielding .
In his Web posting , he urged followers to “ avoid violence in your protest and behave as though you are the parents that have to tolerate your children ’s misbehavior at the security forces . ”
He also warned the government to “ avoid mass arrests , which will only create distance between society and the security forces . ”

El libro será presentado este jueves en el Museo de Culturas Populares
The unelected ayatollahs of the Republican Party have assailed Sonia Sotomayor with a barrage of racial vilification that speaks not to her qualifications but to the shameful character of the modern GOP .
For the offense of stating , perhaps artlessly , that her background gives her a different perspective than the white males who dominate the federal bench , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich denounced the president ’s Supreme Court nominee as “ a Latina woman racist . ”
The charge was repellent — itself plainly designed to incite racial animosity .
Gingrich paid no attention to the context of Sotomayor ’s remarks or to her point that as a judge you have to “ check your assumptions . ”
He ignored her obvious meaning — that , like Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court , a judge from a previously excluded minority can enrich the vision and wisdom of the judicial process .
This view was long ago endorsed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. , who said : “ The life of the law has not been logic ; it has been experience . ”
All judges read statutory or constitutional language through the prism of their own lives and what they know of the world .
If all that counted were logic and words , and their meaning was forever plain and unambiguous , there would be no dissenting opinions .
( Indeed , a recent study reinforces the insight of Holmes and Sotomayor : Judicial panels that include at least one woman are 15 percent more likely to rule for the plaintiff in a sex discrimination case than panels that are all - male . )
The other charges against Judge Sotomayor range from the misleading to the contrived and irrelevant .
She was a member of a three - judge panel that upheld the city of New Haven ’s decision to void a promotion test for firefighters on the grounds that it discriminated against minorities .
But she was merely upholding long - established precedent .
Although the activist Roberts Supreme Court may overrule the panel ’s decision , affirmative action is still written into federal regulations and laws .
And what about Judge Sotomayor ’s observation — so shocking , shocking to her critics — that federal circuit courts are where “ policy ” is made ?
It ’s inescapably true .
District courts try cases ; appellate benches set the policies with their binding , circuit - wide interpretations of law .
As University of Texas law professor Frank Cross puts it , the circuit courts exercise “ the greatest policymaking role in the judicial system . ”
Or take the allegation that she ’s a tough questioner who interrupts lawyers from the bench .
There ’s a whiff of sexism here :
Is the practice supposed to be the exclusive province of men such as Justice Antonin Scalia ?
Or is Sotomayor supposed to be seen and not heard , like the notoriously mute Clarence Thomas ?
Facts do n’t matter to the GOP ’s ayatollahs .
Is n’t it appalling , howls the xenophobic ex-Congressman Tom Tancredo , that Sotomayor was on the board of the national Hispanic civil - rights group La Raza ?
But contrary to Tancredo ’s lies , the group is not a secessionist movement advocating an independent Hispanic homeland across the Southwest .
It ’s a garden variety ethnic lobby .
George W. Bush spoke to the national convention of La Raza in 2000 , when he was courting Hispanic support .
Undeterred , Tancredo has libeled Sotomayor as a member of “ the Latino KKK . ”
Less luridly , Nevada Sen .
John Ensign questions whether she has “ the right intellect ” — a classic code for denigrating nonwhites .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had a brilliant reply , wondering aloud what rank Sotomayor ’s critics had achieved “ in their class at Princeton , but my sense is it ’s not second . ”
That should have ended the argument .
Instead , commentator Fred Barnes emerged from the conservatives ’ amen corner to push the intellect canard , suggesting that in this era of affirmative action , maybe the only grades at some elite universities are “ D - minus ” and “ summa cum laude . ”
For the record , Sotomayor was also awarded what Princeton describes as “ the highest general distinction ” it confers on an undergraduate .
Neither I nor my fellow Georgetown alum Pat Buchanan were summa cum laude , either .
But on MSNBC , Buchanan denigrated Sotomayor as “ that woman , ” and even refused to say whether he favored civil rights .
Glenn Beck , who never received a college degree , carried the smear campaign to an obscene low when he referred to Sotomayor as a “ Latina chick lady . ”
( He ’d be fired from Fox Sports Network for the hate speech he is paid to purvey on Fox News . )
And then there ’s the de facto head of the Republican Party , the similarly degree - free Rush Limbaugh , who has compared the judge to David Duke .
Elected Republicans , trapped between their rabid base and the doomsday scenario of permanently alienating Hispanics , are mostly trying to have it both ways .
On “ Meet the Press , ” Alabama ’s Jeff Sessions , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , bobbed and weaved , unwilling to say whether he thought Sotomayor was “ a racist ” while championing the right of his party ’s loudmouths to “ make the analogies they want . ”
Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , who has her eye on the Governor ’s race next year , says she ’ll resist a filibuster against Sotomayor , but her Texas colleague John Cornyn darkly warns against “ race - conscious decisions . ”
Is all this just a case of elephants gone mad ?
Sadly , no .
The shameful truth is that much of the success of the modern Republican Party is founded on appeals to racial division .
The strategy was born in 1964 , when GOP standard bearer Barry Goldwater campaigned against the Civil Rights Act .
In his landslide loss to Lyndon Johnson , Goldwater carried five states in the Deep South .
Richard Nixon took note , and the GOP ’s “ Southern Strategy ” was born again and here to stay .
At the 1968 Republican Convention , Nixon denounced “ busing ” and “ the use [ of ] the South as a whipping boy . ”
As president , he maintained his hostility to civil rights , which he had favored in the 1950s , as a cynical political choice .
Ronald Reagan extended the racial franchise .
Over the objection of his pollster , Richard Wirthlin , Reagan opened his 1980 general election tour in Philadelphia , Miss. , the notorious killing field where three civil - rights workers had been brutally murdered in 1964 .
There , Reagan swore his allegiance to “ states rights ” in front of a delirious crowd of disaffected whites .
As President , Reagan sought unsuccessfully to thwart renewal of the Voting Rights Act , and resisted creation of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa .
He also favored tax breaks for segregated schools .
In an anonymous interview he gave during Reagan ’s presidency , Republican operative Lee Atwater — he was revealed as the source after his death — detailed the evolution of his party ’s race - baiting .
“ You start out in 1954 , ” he said , “ by saying ‘ nigger , ’ ‘ nigger , ’ ‘ nigger . ’
By 1968 , you ca n’t … that backfires .
So you say stuff like forced busing , states ' rights , and all that stuff . ”
As George H.W. Bush ’s chief strategist in 1988 , Atwater added a new chapter when he made Willie Horton , an African - American convict who had committed rape while on a prison furlough in Massachusetts , the moral centerpiece of Bush ’s campaign .
With their attacks on the nomination of Judge Sotomayor , the Republicans have moved beyond African - Americans to Hispanics .
GOP strategists warn that the party can’t hope to win another presidential contest without sizable support from Hispanics .
But after more than four decades of taking their race rhetoric raw , the Republican base is n’t very responsive to arguments based on demographic trends .
They ’re determined to raise the stars and bars forever and maintain racial purity .
At stake here are not just electoral equations , or the confirmation of a superbly talented justice for the high court , but the soul of what used to be the Party of Lincoln .
Republican senators must decide — soon — whether they are prepared at long last to break with the night riders and reclaim the banner of a Republican Party that can bear the light of a new day .

The rumor — whether true or not — that Michael Jackson missed his cryonics appointment , but instead arrangements are being made to have him plastinated by the ever - controversial Gunther von Hagens would not surprise anybody , if true .
Rather , one is — to some degree — surprised that Jacko did not arrange for the greatest return engagement in entertainment history
On the other hand , the corporeal world did not treat him altogether kindly .
Sure , he had riches to spend ( his own , and then other people ’s ) and he was positioned to give dramatic expression to his ego in extraordinary ways .
Indeed , after the phenomenal success of Thriller , he could declare himself the King of Pop and more or less get away with it .
( Perhaps he should have had himself entombed instead like Tutankhamen .
Or given his use of Stalinist imagery to promote HIStory , he might have chosen to preserve himself in a glass case along the lines of Mao and Lenin ) .
Whatever .
Jackson went through serious trials and tribulations and received a lot of abuse for being " weird . "
The popular story is that Jackson was loved and respected for his " innovative " music — his song and dance act , and his videos , but he alienated a good portion of his audience by doing odd stuff .
Some of us may prefer to flip that around .
While Jackson was a marvelous singer and performer , and he had some fine and funky musical moments , his musical oeuvre was entirely conventional , as were most of his videos .
Indeed , Jackson and the lyrical and musical sensibilities that he represented were basically reactionary .
It was a step backwards from the musical innovations popularized by The Beatles and others ( including others like George Clinton and Sly Stone , in the funk genre ) .
A " top 40 " musical culture that could incorporate the lyrical ideas of a Dylan or a Bowie or a Curtis Mayfield or an Elvis Costello has largely been displaced by the empty entertainment tropes represented by American Idol , and Jackson is the idol of Idol .
Then again , there ’s another way of looking at that story .
In the days when rock was " important " — for every David Bowie or John Lennon , there were hundreds like Uriah Heep , Emerson Lake and Palmer , Billy Joel… " poets " who wanted to express themselves via rock and roll but who maybe should have known better .
The " Disco Sucks " movement may have been partly a reaction to the dumbing down of rock lyrics ( or at least an abandonment of its quasi - adolescent rebellious themes ) , but it was also a reaction against disco ’s mixed - race , mixed - sexual preference , multi- gendered , urban party uprising .
Jackson ’s first ( and best ) solo album , Off The Wall , was released in 1979 , during the disco era .
While he was n’t a disco artist in the sense that Gloria Gaynor was , it was dance music and it went into heavy rotation at Studio 54 and no doubt wherever club goers gathered around the globe .
Jackson emerged as a solo artist into a rock culture that still had a hint of androgyny ( from the ’ 70s ) and in which the word " freak " was a compliment rather than an insult ( from the ’60s ) .
Nonconforming celebrities were cheered on , as opposed to being snarked to death .
While for the most part , Jackson paid attention throughout his career to no one other than himself , some of that zeitgeist may have rubbed off on him .
Jackson was a ‘ " permissive " ’ 70s person .
And had he been an ’ 80s person , he may have been altogether more constrained in his pursuits .
So Jackson , in his own way , " freaked freely " … but was he a transhumanist ?
In the intervew from our first issue , which we posted to our front page on Friday , Christopher Dewdney concentrates on Jackson ’s defiance of his biological limitations in terms of his transformation of his inherited features — his cosmetic surgery and his change of skin color ( he might also have included his cross - genderish style of dress and makeup ) .
In More Than Human , Ramez Naam predicted that during the next decade , we will be able to genetically alter our skin colors ( and this would not necessarily be limited to the usual boring choices .
Start being purple ? ) .
This would certainly be a radical transhuman shift , but changing his features is not the only way Jackson gave expression to a dissatisfaction with " natural " life as a given , and showed his interest in mutation and expanded possibilities — and dabbled ( at the very least ) in transhumanist tropes .
We can also include his use of a hyperbaric oxygen chamber — according to rumors , in hopes that it was a key toward longevity .
Foolish , certainly , but another indication that Jackson was reaching for something other .
Jackson ’s fascination with mutation — for better and for worse — was also manifested in his purchase of John Merrick ’s ( the " elephant man " ) skull .
Hey , he even prefigured the contemporary fascination with Zombies with his most popular video for Thriller .
Jackson also lived in a sort - of virtual reality .
Having reached his adulthood ( sort of ) in an age before VR , he used his wealth to build his own alternative reality in the only way he could — physically — as manifested most particularly on his Neverland Ranch .
There , Jackson " programmed " his own version of a J.M. Barrie Peter Pan world , and populated it with children ( and firewalls , otherwise known as body guards ) .
He proceeded to marry a virtual reality — the daughter of the King — and , later , via surrogates — he took on his own virtual children to raise up .
As a child star , Jackson was in some ways predestined to live a virtual life , and the abuse he experienced at the hands of his father guaranteed that he would pursue fantasy ( and the fantastic ) .
Last but not least , there is Jackson ’s neotony .
Quoting Wikipedia : " Neoteny ( pronounced / niːˈɒtɨniː / ) , also called juvenilization , is the retention , by adults in a species , of traits previously seen only in juveniles ( a kind of paedomorphosis ) , and is a subject studied in the field of developmental biology .
In neoteny , the physiological ( or somatic ) development of an animal or organism is slowed or delayed ( alternatively , seen as a dilation of biological time ) . "
Neotony in a species can be an evolutionary trait — a sign that a species is going to mutate within generations .
In the 1970s , Timothy Leary — himself an early transhumanist — popularized the notion that the refusal of boomer and post - boomer generations to embrace traditional " terminal " adulthood signified a coming evolution in the human species .
Leary ’s notion of paedomorphosis was that generations would remain in a sort of adolescent phase up until the birth of the posthuman .
But Jackson never got that far .
The private " virtual " M.J. was a child — a pre-teen — and that ’s where the Jackson story went sour .
If Jackson diddled any pre-teens , this is — of course — reprehensible .
Even those of us at the edge of this dynamic period in transitional humanity must recognize some boundaries .
Pathology may precede potential in this odd and challenging transition phase moving toward an incomprehensible future , but some virtual fantasies must remain virtual , if at all .
Of course , M.J. was never convicted of sexual acts with children .
But he probably died as the result of the emotional strain brought on by his trials , his public shunning , and his period of self - exile , or from the prescription painkillers he took to dull that pain .
In the end , Jackson ’s life reads as tragedy , but context is everything .
Given the opportunity , most of us would probably take some of the drama along with some of the glory , the adventure , the money , the indulgences , the ego strokes … .
I mean , it was a pretty rich life — in all senses of the word .
Michael Jackson is obviously not an example of transhumanism to be followed .
But he is a signpost on the road to post - humanity .
I believe the future will study him from that perspective , and in some odd way , it will learn from his many mistakes .

But this DIY inverted bookshelf manages to be both .
Instructables explains how to build your own .

Instead of storing your books upright on top of the shelf , the inverted bookshelf holds all of your books in place using elastic webbing so you can hang them below the shelf — all the while allowing you to still take them out and put them back on as needed .
To make one , you 'll need your basic tools , some elastic webbing that 's strong enough to hold the books , and a staple gun .
To ensure that the elastic does n't break and send your books tumbling to the floor , you 'll need to do some careful measuring .
In the case of a book where the average width is one inch , for example , the ideal length of elastic will be around 14 inches .
For your smaller books , using one strap should do .

Here 's an article on the kinds of things other than assassination attempts , vandalism , and break - ins that Dr. Tiller and his staff have had to endure for years .( once Operation Rescue West ; the group split ) , who moved to Wichita in order to shut George Tiller 's clinic down :
" There 's only one problem : Tiller is a hard man to find , let alone intimidate .
After more than a decade as one of the anti-abortion movement 's favorite targets , he keeps a low profile , drives an armored car and lives in a gated community in a house with a state - of - the - art security system .
More pointedly , he has made it clear that he 's not susceptible to scare tactics .
In 1993 , Tiller was shot in both arms by an anti-abortion protester .
He returned to work the next day .
Newman is well aware of Tiller 's resilience .
That 's why Operation Rescue is going after clinic workers like [ clinic 's administrative assistant ] Sara Phares .
The employees have no guards posted at their homes , no cameras monitoring their yards .
If Newman can provoke enough of them to quit , his job will be done .
He 'll effectively shut Tiller down . "

WASHINGTON --
Although women are still underrepresented in the applicant pool for faculty positions in math , science , and engineering at major research universities , those who do apply are interviewed and hired at rates equal to or higher than those for men , says a new report from the National Research Council .
Similarly , women are underrepresented among those considered for tenure , but those who are considered receive tenure at the same or higher rates than men .
The congressionally mandated report examines how women at research - intensive universities fare compared with men at key transition points in their careers .
Two national surveys were commissioned to help address the issue .
The report 's conclusions are based on the findings of these surveys of tenure - track and tenured faculty in six disciplines -- biology , chemistry , mathematics , civil engineering , electrical engineering , and physics -- at 89 institutions in 2004 and 2005 .
The study committee also heard testimony and examined data from federal agencies , professional societies , individual university studies , and academic articles .
In each of the six disciplines , women who applied for tenure - track positions had a better chance of being interviewed and receiving job offers than male applicants had .
For example , women made up 20 percent of applicants for positions in mathematics but accounted for 28 percent of those interviewed , and received 32 percent of the job offers .
This was also true for tenured positions , with the exception of those in biology .
However , women are not applying for tenure - track jobs at research - intensive universities at the same rate that they are earning Ph.D.s , the report says .
The gap is most pronounced in disciplines with larger fractions of women receiving Ph.D.s ; for example , while women received 45 percent of the Ph.D.s in biology awarded by research - intensive universities from 1999 to 2003 , they accounted for only 26 percent of applicants to tenure - track positions at those schools .
Research is needed to investigate why more women are not applying for these jobs , the committee said .
" Our data suggest that , on average , institutions have become more effective in using the means under their direct control to promote faculty diversity , including hiring and promoting women and providing resources , " said committee co-chair Claude Canizares , Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics and vice president for research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" Nevertheless , we also find evidence for stubborn and persistent underrepresentation of women at all faculty ranks . "
The surveys revealed that most institutional strategies to try to increase the proportion of women in the applicant pool -- such as targeted advertising and recruiting at conferences -- did not show significant effectiveness , the report says .
One strategy did appear to make a difference : Having a female chair of the search committee and a high number of women on the committee were associated with a higher number of women in the applicant pool .
The report also assessed gender differences in the following areas :
ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES : Men and women reported comparable access to many institutional resources , including start - up packages , travel funds , and supervision of similar numbers of postdocs and research assistants .
And in general , men and women spent similar proportions of their time on teaching , research , and service .
Although at first glance men seemed to have more lab space than women , this difference disappeared when other factors such as discipline and faculty rank were accounted for .
However , men appeared to have greater access to equipment needed for research and to clerical support , the report said .
TENURE : In every field , women were underrepresented among candidates for tenure relative to the number of female assistant professors .
In chemistry , for example , women made up 22 percent of assistant professors , but only 15 percent of the faculty being considered for tenure .
Women also spent significantly longer time as assistant professors .
However , women who did come up for tenure review were at least as likely as men to receive tenure .
SALARY : Women full professors were paid on average 8 percent less than their male counterparts , the report says .
This difference in salary did not exist in the ranks of associate and assistant professors .
CLIMATE AND INTERACTION WITH COLLEAGUES : Female faculty reported that they were less likely than men to engage in conversation with their colleagues on many professional topics , including research , salary , and benefits .
This distance may prevent women from accessing important information and may make them feel less included and more marginalized in their professional lives , the committee observed .
While on average institutions have done more to address aspects of career transitions under their control , the report notes , one of the remaining challenges may be in the climate at the departmental level .
OUTCOMES : On most key measures -- grant funding , nominations for awards and honors , and offers of positions at other institutions -- there is little evidence of differences in outcomes .
In terms of funding for research , male faculty had significantly more funding than female faculty in biology ; in other disciplines , the differences were not significant .
The committee urged further research on unanswered questions , such as why more women are not applying for tenure - track positions , why female faculty continue to experience a sense of isolation , and how nonacademic issues affect women 's and men's career choices at critical junctures .
" Overall the newly released data indicate important progress , and signal to both young men and especially to young women that what had been the status quo at research - intensive universities is changing , " said committee co-chair Sally Shaywitz , Audrey G. Ratner Professor in Learning Development and co-director of the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity , Yale University School of Medicine .
" There is a movement toward more gender equity than noted in previous reports or often publicly appreciated .
At the same time , the findings show that we are not there yet .
The gap between female graduates and the pool of female applicants is very real , and suggests that focus next be placed on examining challenges such as family and child responsibilities , which typically impact women more than men . "

McKittrick : World War Three .
For two years now , John McCain has been entirely consistent on Iran : every last statement he 's made -- at least , those that I 've seen -- has been ( a ) fabulously uninformed and ( b ) dangerously bellicose .
He 's still at it , apparently .
There is no question that President Obama 's more prudent path is the correct one right now .
There is also no question that the neoconservatives are trying to gin up this situation into an excuse for not engaging with the Iranian government in the near future -- and also as a rationale for their dearest , looniest dream , war with Iran ... neoconservatives like McCain and Wehner just can't seem to quit their dangerous habit of making broad , extreme statements based on ideology rather than detailed knowledge of the situation in Iran and elsewhere .
This was always the main problem with McCain 's candidacy -- he would have been a trigger - happy President ...
What makes this such a tenuous situation is that Khamenei 's legitimacy has been in question from the day he succeeded Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 .
It was widely understood among intelligence analysts that Khamenei did not have the religious credentials to succeed Khomeini as supreme leader , Iran 's head of state who is supposed to be the most learned religious cleric .
In fact , Khamenei is not even really an ayatollah - - his license was in effect bought -- and he has no popular religious following as other legitimate ayatollahs do .
It does n't help that Iranian leaders of Khomeini 's generation have never particularly liked Khamenei and see him as a man who muscled his way into power , perhaps even by killing Khomeini 's son , the person most likely to challenge his rule .
" No one in their right mind can believe " the official results from Friday 's contest , Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri said of the landslide victory claimed by Ahmadinejad .
Montazeri accused the regime of handling Mousavi 's charges of fraud and the massive protests of his backers " in the worst way possible . "
" A government not respecting people 's vote has no religious or political legitimacy , " he declared in comments on his official Web site .
" I ask the police and army personals ( personnel ) not to ' sell their religion , ' and beware that receiving orders will not excuse them before God . "
Yesterday John McCain stepped up his participation in Republican Party obstructionism against Barack Obama .
By noon he was yowling and howling about health care reform .
McCain is firmly in the camp that wants no substantive change .
And far be it from me to assign motives , although perhaps I should point out that McCain has received more direct payments from the Medical Industrial Complex ( $ 8,887,912 ) and from the Insurance Industry ( $ 2,895,602 ) than anyone else in either house of Congress .
Yes , indeed ; he's # 1 .
And he 's expected to sing for his supper .
He backs the Insurance Industry 's proposal that all Americans be given a tax credit so they can spend it the private insurers who most Americans -- those whose careers are not underwritten by them -- hate and distrust .
Having defecated all over the reform plans , McCain scurried off to his true love : joining with 2 other horsemen of the Apocalypse , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham , in stirring up a war scenario against Iran .
In a stunningmagazine essay , Joe Klein , fresh off the plane from Tehran , asserts that McCain is clearly unhinged .
No , he was n't singing " Bomb , Bomb , Bomb , Bomb , Bomb Iran " again -- not exactly , anyway .
That does n't mean the situation in Iran is n't dangerous .
Fortunately we have a firm and thoughtful hand on the wheel of the ship of state -- not a homicidal maniac like Cheney , Lieberman or McCain or a cheap political opportunist like Mitt Romney , Mike Pence or Eric Cantor .
In the new issue offormer CIA operative -- and author of The Devil We Know : Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower -- Robert Baer makes a great point : the election and the aftermath is n't really about Ahmadinejad ; it 's about Iran 's real ruling elite for whom the clownish and bellicose Ahmadinejad is the front man : Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Khamenei and the heads of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , the army and the hard - liners in the secret police who prop him up .
Baer suggests that a real senior ayatollah , Rafsanjani , Chairman of the Assembly of Experts and the Expediency Council , is where we should be looking for signs that Khamenei 's run may be coming to a halt .
Reporting from Tehran for McClatchy yesterday , Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay , point to a different senior ayatollah : Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri who publicly stated that the election was rigged .
This is a big deal .
If it 's true that Rafsanjani has called an " emergency " meeting of the 86 clerics who make up the Assembly of Experts , as CNN is reporting , things could well come to a head -- and fast .
They have the power , at least in theory , to replace Khamenei .
Iran 's right - wing government has started trying to control the flow of information , kicking out foreign journalists and it has apparently assassinated Mohammed Asgari , the Interior Ministry official who blew the whistle on the vote rigging :

Run-length encoding
Run -length encoding is a simple compression scheme in which runs of equal values are represented by the value and a repeat count .
For example , a supermarket cashier might process this line of shopping
as
4 bananas
3 apples
2 bananas
1 pineapple
3 apples
Unix packs in its very own run length encoder , uniq -c .
It works just fine — so long as the values you want to encode are newline separated byte strings , that is .
Let ’s use a sequence of coin tosses as an example stream .
$ RANDOM generates random numbers .
We use the least significant bit of these numbers as an index into an array containing the values heads , tails .
$ HT = ( heads tails ) $ toss ( ) { echo $ {HT [ $ RANDOM &1 ] } ; } $ toss ; toss ; toss heads tails tails $ tosses ( ) { while [ 1 ] ; do toss ; done ; } $ tosses | head tails tails tails heads tails heads heads heads tails tails
Passing a fresh sample from this same stream through our run-length encoder we get :
$ tosses | uniq -c | head 2 heads 1 tails 1 heads 1 tails 1 heads 6 tails 3 heads 1 tails 4 heads 1 tails
An awk script can be used as a run-length decoder .
( There must be a neater way , using sed maybe ? )
$ runlendec ( ) { awk '{ while ( $ 1--) print $ 2 } ' ; } $ tosses | head | tee orig.log | uniq -c | runlendec | tee encdec.log heads tails heads tails heads heads tails tails heads heads $ diff orig.log encdec.log
Here , we toss a coin 10 times teeing the original sequence to a file .
The next two links in the pipeline compress and decompress the sequence , teeing the results to another file .
Finally , as a sanity check , we confirm the round trip results are the same .
Run-length encoding in Python
This Unix run-length codec is fun , but of limited practical use .
One good feature , though , is the way it operates on streams of data ( including infinite streams ) , leaving clients free to decide how best to slice and buffer these streams .
Python has a fine library of high - level stream transformation tools from which we can build a generic and flexible run-length codec in just a few lines .
Since I want to progress from run-length coding to something more advanced , I ’ll leave discussing how to implement this codec for now , but if you ’d like to write your own version , here ’s a description suitable for doctesting .
Import the run-length codec functions and compress a short string .
>>> from runlength import compress , decompress >>> comp = compress (' AABBBACC ')
The returned compressor is a stream ( an iterable ) . >>> next ( comp ) ( 2 , 'A ' )
Pull the rest of the stream into memory . >>> rest = list ( comp ) >>> rest [ ( 3 , ' B ' ) , ( 1 , ' A ' ) , ( 2 , ' C ' ) ]
Simple decompress example . >>> concat = ''.join >>> concat( decompress ( rest ) ) ' BBBACC '
Compress , decompress also work with infinite streams , like the a2b3 stream , which repeatedly cycles two pairs . >>> from itertools import cycle , islice >>> a 2b3 = cycle ( [ ( 2 , 'a ' ) , ( 3 , 'b ' ) ] ) >>> dec = decompress ( a2b3 ) Pull 8 values from the decompressed stream . >>> concat( islice ( dec , 8 ) ) ' aabbbaab '
Now compress the decompressed stream , and explore a few items . >>> comp = compress ( dec ) >>> next ( comp ) ( 2 , 'b ' ) >>> list ( islice ( comp , 2 ) ) [ ( 2 , 'a ' ) , ( 3 , 'b ' ) ]
DEFLATE
The Wikipedia page on run-length encoding identifies monochrome images as good candidates for run-length compression .
The white and black pixels typically group into long runs .
Indeed , any simple image using a limited palette should reduce well using this compression scheme .
The chessboard above is 256×256 pixels , each square being 32×32 pixels .
We could run-length encode this 64 K pixel image as 256×8 = 2 K runs of 32 pixels , a decent saving .
( Actually , we should do slightly better , noting that there are runs of length 64 at the chessboard rank boundaries , but you get the idea . )
( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) , ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) , .... ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W ) ( 32 , B ) ( 32 , W )
Like a paletted image , a block of text — the web page you ’re reading now , for example — employs a limited alphabet .
Although the characters in this text do n’t usually group into long runs there ’s plenty of repetition , especially in the raw HTML : all the occurrences of < div > , < span > and class used for CSS styling , for example .
The DEFLATE compression algorithm uses a clever twist on run-length encoding to remove this redundancy :
The compressed data consists of a series of elements of two types : literal bytes ( of strings that have not been detected as duplicated within the previous 32 K input bytes ) , and pointers to duplicated strings , where a pointer is represented as a pair < length , backward distance > .
( RFC - 1951 )
( In addition , a multiple - level dynamic Huffman encoding scheme reduces the space needed for the strings , distances and lengths themselves . )
There ’s more to these pointer elements than first appears : the length can exceed the backward distance .
Thus the sequence :
heads heads heads heads heads
can be deflated as the literal type heads
followed by the pointer type < 24 , 6 > .
If you ’ve spotted the potential for recursion , good !
The inflating stream can reference itself , which can reference itself , which can … Confusing ?
Zipping pixels
PNG images use DEFLATE compression ( as implemented by zlib ) to save on pixel storage space .
Here ’s a binary view of the raw data in the chessboard graphic shown above , all 137 bytes of it .
The 64 K pixels themselves compress into a 88 byte IDAT chunk , of which the final 8 bytes are a checksum and ( I think ? ) some padding .
Maybe the image could be squeezed harder , but I ’m impressed !

Here ’s a trace of how zlib inflates the compressed pixels in this IDAT chunk .
( Source code available via anonymous SVN at http://wordaligned.org/svn/etc/zlib_trace.)
inflate : allocated inflate : reset inflate : zlib header ok inflate : dynamic codes block ( last ) inflate : table sizes ok inflate : code lengths ok inflate : codes ok inflate : literal 0x00 inflate : literal 0xff inflate : length 3 inflate : distance 1 inflate : literal 0x00 inflate : length 3 inflate : distance 1 inflate : length 24 inflate : distance 8 inflate : length 25 inflate : distance 25 inflate : length 258 inflate : distance 33 ....
I ’ve attempted to show the first few stages of the genesis of the uncompressed stream in the picture below .
The way the stream recursively inflates itself is quite beautiful .
put 00 put ff go back 1 ( to ff ) , put 3 put 00 go back 1 ( to 00 ) , put 3 go back 8 ( to 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ) put 24
Two elements later , and the repeat length has grown to 258 .
In fact , the entire chessboard is generated from just 3 literal and 43 pointer elements .
( Not all graphics have such a regular pattern , of course , so we ca n’t always achieve such dramatic compression . )
Deflated HTML
Web servers can and do save on band - width by transferring gzip compressed HTML to gzip capable clients .
( Gzip is a simple wrapper around DEFLATE . )
Any PNG images transferred will also have their pixels DEFLATE compressed .

The Word Aligned front page contains about 75Kb of HTML , which gzips to just 16Kb — a decent saving .
Relevant lines from the lighttpd configuration file read :
lighttpd mod_compress server.modules = ( .... " mod_compress " ) compress.cache -dir = basedir + " lighttpd/cache/compress / " compress.
filetype = ( " text / plain " , " text / html " , " text/css " )
I uphold Gzip ( built on zlib , which implements DEFLATE ) as a hero of the web .
As we ’ve seen , it implements a powerful and elegant algorithm , but perhaps the best thing about it is that it ’s free to use , a freedom worth fighting for .

I had been cross-eyed as a baby , but three childhood surgeries made my eyes look straight .
Because my eyes looked normal , I assumed I saw normally too .
But , in fact , I was stereoblind -- unable to see in three dimensions .
That means I could not see the volumes of space between objects .
Instead , things in depth appeared piled one on top of another , making me feel nervous and confused in cluttered environments .
As a child , I did n’t understand why my friends were so entertained when they looked through a View - Master .
I did n’t see Disney characters or Superman popping out at me .
All I saw was a flat image .
When I got older , my gaze -- particularly at a distance -- was jittery , making it difficult to read signs while driving .
I was always disoriented and easily lost .
The biggest effect of my vision was on my performance in school .
I had trouble learning to read and did poorly on standardized tests .
These problems were blamed not on my vision but on a lack of intelligence , and I was put in a class with other problem children .

That was in the early 1960s , but the situation has n’t greatly improved today .
Children are still not routinely tested for binocular vision deficits because the standard school vision exam ( reading the eye chart with one eye at a time ) does n’t screen for defects in eye coordination or stereovision .
As a result , many children with vision problems may be labeled learning disabled , or if they misbehave in frustration , diagnosed with attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
Despite my visual shortcomings , when my husband and I took our children to Disney World 16 years ago , I insisted that we see the 3 - D movies .
As my kids watched gigantic insects fly off the screen toward us , they screamed and retreated to the safety of my lap .
They were thrilled , and so was I .
Although the bugs did not pop off the screen at me , I knew that my children ’s view of the world was much more stable and depth - filled than mine , and that they were less likely to encounter the problems that I had faced in school .
Then , at age 48 , I consulted a developmental optometrist who prescribed a program of optometric vision therapy , which taught me how to coordinate my eyes and see in stereo .
With my new stereovision , I learned to play tennis and could drive with confidence and without fatigue .
Most surprisingly , my view of the world changed in ways I could n’t have imagined .
Ordinary objects looked extraordinary .
Sink faucets popped out at me ; light fixtures appeared to float in midair .
Tree limbs reached out toward me or grew upward , enclosing palpable volumes of space .
Snowflakes no longer appeared to be falling in one plane slightly in front of me but were falling at different depths all around me in a beautiful , three - dimensional dance .
I felt myself immersed in a three - dimensional world .

So it was with great anticipation that I recently attended a showing of “ Up , ” the new 3 - D Disney / Pixar film .
When I put on the Polaroid glasses at the theater last week , the film scenery bloomed into three dimensions .
Balloons floated off the screen , and clouds receded far into the distance .
Even the characters ’ noses seemed solid and palpable .
Combined with feelings of joy at my new view of 3 - D movies were feelings of anger .
Why had n’t anyone told me when I was a child that I lacked stereovision ?
Why had all my problems in school been blamed on my supposed lack of intelligence and not on my vision ?
Why had n’t my parents been told about optometric vision therapy ?
Why do these issues persist today ?
Perhaps 3 - D movies have more to offer than pure entertainment .
With the growing number of 3 - D films for children , more parents may spot visual deficits in their kids .
Detecting these problems early and then seeking proper treatment can improve a child ’s vision and transform a child ’s life .
HERE WE GO AGAIN .
I 've received yet another right - wing propaganda email .
This one is written by a Lou Pritchett , and begins with a sort of advertisement for him , including photo and logo , as " one of corporate America 's true living legends " .
It 's titled " AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA "
Like many other conservative emails , it 's an education in how to do propaganda :
Dear President Obama :
You are the thirteenth President under whom I have lived and unlike any of the others , you truly scare me .
You scare me because after months of exposure , I know nothing about you .
Notice how he subtly buries an absurd assumption — that after all these months , he really knows nothing about Obama .
Obama has given so many press conferences , speeches , and interviews since he has been elected that there are actually people questioning the wisdom of so much exposure and transparency .
And when he gives a conference or interview , his answers are detailed and comprehensive , some would say too comprehensive .
About the only things Obama can be accused of concealing are the sins of the Bush administration .
The fact is that if Mr. Pritchett knows nothing about Obama , it 's because he has n't been listening .
But he does n't defend this statement , he merely gives it as the reason Obama scares him , thus slipping in an assumption without any proof .
Do you think that the reason he does this has anything to do with his convictions for bribery in 1997 ?
There .
You see ?
I did the same thing .
Except I 'm telling you right now that I made up the whole bribery conviction thing .
But did n't it sound convincing , when I gave it as a reason for something else ?
He continues with the same trick throughout the letter :
You scare me because I do not know how you paid for your expensive Ivy League education and your upscale lifestyle and housing with no visible signs of support .
This one is even better .
Notice how he weaves together multiple snide suggestions :
He implies that Obama got money from some questionable source .
He implies that Obama 's education is elitist — unlike , say , George Bush 's education at Yale .
He implies that Obama is wealthy , and thus out of touch with us common folk .
That 's a lot of bang for the buck .
I wonder what Lou Pritchett , " one of corporate America 's true living legends " , makes in a year ?
It 's all very nasty , and again , completely unfounded .
Obama 's education was paid for , like most graduate students , with a combination of scholarships and student loans .
His two best - selling books and some hard work as a successful lawyer helped him pay off the student loans , and account for his " upscale lifestyle " .
If you do n't believe me , check it out at Fox News .
You scare me because you did not spend the formative years of youth growing up in America and culturally you are not an American .
I wo n't bother to point out the fact that he 's once again given his real attack as a reason for his fear , in order to make us less critical of it .
See how it 's done ?
( I did point it out , did n't I ? )
The sleazy implication , of course , is an intentional play on racist fears .
We 're supposed to think that Obama grew up in Africa , and consequently is n't a " real American " .
The truth about that one next time ...
Patterns in Haskell
I ’ve been trying to make music with Haskell for a little while now .
One thing about Haskell is that its strict typing forces you to think a lot about how you represent things .
I wanted to support two things in my musical pattern representation , firstly polyphony ( more than one sound being triggered at the same time ) and secondly recursive structure .
In the west we often think of rhythm in quite `flat ’ terms – a 2d pattern like this :
Of course that ’s a pretty useful techno interface , allows for polyphony , and could be represented in haskell using a straightforward list of lists .
However this 2D structure is only really suitable for making music with fixed timed signatures , most notably 4/4 .
Enter Bernard Bel ( pictured right ) .
His BP2 software represents music in a manner inspired by Indian classical music .
His 2001 paper Rationalising musical time has all the details and is a great read , formalising a quite beautiful way of thinking about time .
As part of that it defines an elegant pattern syntax that allows patterns to be embedded inside patterns of differing time signatures .
Here ’s my first attempt at representing analogous structures in Haskell .
Straightforwardly , a musical event is either a sound ( represented by some string ) or some silence :
data Event = Sound String | Silence
A musical structure is either an event , a cycle of structures , or a polymetry of structures :
data Structure = Atom Event | Cycle [ Structure ] | Polymetry [ Structure ]
A cycle allows us to sequence structures one after another , and a polymetry allows us to represent several structures occuring over the same period of time .
If the structures within a Polymetry have different durations , then they are ‘ stretched ’ until they are the same length ( equal to the lowest common multiple of their lengths ) .
I ’ve written something in parsec that parses Bel ’s notation into the Structure datatype .
The problem with the above representation is that it gets unwieldy with complex rhythmic structures .
The whole point of generative music is being able to make very long patterns out of much shorter rulesets .
However with this representation , to find the 10,000th event you ’d have to calculate the 9,999 events preceeding it .
This becomes a particular problem when modifying these structures as part of a live coded musical improvisation .
So I instead came up with this representation :
data Pattern a = Pattern {at :: Int -> [ a ] , period :: Int} type SoundPattern = Pattern String
Instead of explicitly representing a recursive structure , I ’m now hiding everything inside a function mapping from integers to a list .
You pass the function the current position in the pattern ( e.g. the current ‘ beat ’ , and get back the list of events at that position .
For certain operations you still need to know the period ( length ) of the repeating pattern , so that ’s in the datatype constructor too .
What kind of operations can I do to these patterns ?
Here ’s one that simply shifts events backwards in time :
(<~ ) :: Pattern a -> Int -> Pattern a ( < ~ ) p steps = Pattern (
-> at p ( n + steps ) ) ( period p )
And in the other direction :
( ~> ) :: Pattern a -> Int -> Pattern a ( ~ > ) p n = ( < ~ ) p ( - n )
Here ’s a higher order one that applies an operation conditional on the time value ( while preserving the period of the original ) :
when :: ( Int -> Bool ) -> ( Pattern a -> Pattern a ) -> Pattern a ->
Pattern a when pred f p = Pattern l ( period p ) where l n = at ( if ( pred n ) then ( f p ) else p ) n
Making this possible …
when (
-> n `mod` 8 > 3 ) ( <~ 2 ) p
… which shifts the pattern back in time two steps , but only affects every other group of 4 steps .
This is probably fairly humdrum stuff , but quite fascinating to me as someone relatively new to both haskell and functional programming .
Being able to pile functions on top of functions in this way lets me compose complex patterns out of simple parts , and I only ever have to deal with the simple parts in memory , not the complex patterns .
Great !
Thanks to the parameterisation of the Pattern datatype , I can also use patterns for different aspects of a rhythm , my recent screencasts [ 1,2 ] showing concurrent patterning of samples , vowel formant filtering , sample playback speed and a comb filter .
I ’ve also been looking at making the Pattern a Monad ( my first ever monad instance , woo ! ) :
instance Monad Pattern where return x = loop $ [ x ]
( Pattern l len ) >>= f = Pattern l' ( lcm len len ' ) where l' n = at ( combine $ map f ( l n ) ) n ( Pattern _ len ' ) = f undefined
Where ‘ combine ’ is another function not shown that which merges patterns together .
The problem I ’m having with this is that functions of type a ->
Pattern a for use with >>= ca n’t do that much , not being able to consider any pattern context , and not being able to return a different period depending on the input ( otherwise that ‘ undefined ’ value would bite ) .
This is about the most useful thing I can come up with , which ‘ masks ’ events every other time measure :
mask :: ( a -> Pattern a ) mask x = Pattern (
-> if n `mod` 2 == 0 then [ x ] else [ ] ) 2
Maybe I should be thinking of what I could do with more general functions of type ( a -> Pattern b ) instead .
I guess I ’m just getting a better handle on what monads are really for …
Monads aside I guess my Pattern representation would really become unstuck with patterns that have a lot of interdependencies .
For example if every event depended on the event preceding it then you ’d have to recalculate the whole pattern all the time .
Hmm .
Well that was quite an extended haskell wibble .
If by some strange chance you ’ve read this far I ’d love to hear your thoughts and especially advice !

The first time that I was ever " published " was centered around an event when my son was injured and needed surgery at the age of two .
I 've been through a lot in my life , but nothing ever like that terrible night in 2003 .
We were at Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago - a phenomenal organization .
I remember asking our amazing nurse if she went home and drank herself numb every night because I could n't understand how someone could be that strong and not need a crutch .
My wife , at one point , thought we should set her up with one of my friends .
I thought about it , and then said , " None of them are good enough for her . "
( Sorry guys )
I wrote a letter about my experience feeling helpless as father and asked for support for Children 's Memorial Hospital .
It was published by a major Chicago paper on Father 's Day .
And my son was fine a few days after our visit .
I remember thinking about all of the parents at the hospital who 's sons and daughters had bigger problems than we faced .
Parents will be strong because they have to be strong .
But exactly how strong can one dad be ?
So , this brings us to the world 's strongest dad - a father among fathers .
Ron sends this story from Sports Illustrated 's Rick Reilly about Dick and Rick Hoyt ( Dick is a retired Air National Guard Lieutenant Colonel ) .
It 's a great story about a father and son who saved each other .
It 's been making the email rounds and I thought it would be a great story to read before the weekend :
Strongest Dad in the World
Rick Reilly
Sports Illustrated Issue date : June 20 , 2005 , p. 88
I try to be a good father .
Give my kids mulligans .
Work nights to pay for their text messaging .
Take them to swimsuit shoots .
But compared with Dick Hoyt , I 'm suck .
Eighty - five times he 's pushed his disabled son , Rick , 26.2 miles in marathons .
Eight times he 's not only pushed him 26.2 miles in a wheelchair but also towed him 2.4 miles in a dinghy while swimming and pedaled him 112 miles in a seat on the handlebars -- all in the same day .
Dick 's also pulled him cross-country skiing , taken him on his back mountain climbing and once hauled him across the U.S. on a bike .
Makes taking your son bowling look a little lame , right ?
And what has Rick done for his father ?
Not much -- except save his life .
This love story began in Winchester , Mass. , 43 years ago , when Rick was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth , leaving him brain - damaged and unable to control his limbs .
" He 'll be a vegetable the rest of his life , " Dick says doctors told him and his wife , Judy , when Rick was nine months old .
" Put him in an institution . "
But the Hoyts were n't buying it .
They noticed the way Rick 's eyes followed them around the room .
When Rick was 11 they took him to the engineering department at Tufts University and asked if there was anything to help the boy communicate .
" No way , " Dick says he was told .
" There 's nothing going on in his brain . "
" Tell him a joke , " Dick countered .
They did .
Rick laughed .
Turns out a lot was going on in his brain .
Rigged up with a computer that allowed him to control the cursor by touching a switch with the side of his head , Rick was finally able to communicate .
First words ?
" Go Bruins ! "
And after a high school classmate was paralyzed in an accident and the school organized a charity run for him , Rick pecked out , " Dad , I want to do that . "
Yeah , right .
How was Dick , a self - described " porker " who never ran more than a mile at a time , going to push his son five miles ?
Still , he tried .
" Then it was me who was handicapped , " Dick says .
" I was sore for two weeks . "
That day changed Rick 's life .
" Dad , " he typed , " when we were running , it felt like I was n't disabled anymore ! "
And that sentence changed Dick 's life .
He became obsessed with giving Rick that feeling as often as he could .
He got into such hard - belly shape that he and Rick were ready to try the 1979 Boston Marathon .
" No way , " Dick was told by a race official .
The Hoyts were n't quite a single runner , and they were n't quite a wheelchair competitor .
For a few years Dick and Rick just joined the massive field and ran anyway , then they found a way to get into the race officially :
In 1983 they ran another marathon so fast they made the qualifying time for Boston the following year .
Then somebody said , " Hey , Dick , why not a triathlon ? "
How 's a guy who never learned to swim and had n't ridden a bike since he was six going to haul his 110 - pound kid through a triathlon ?
Still , Dick tried .
Now they 've done 212 triathlons , including four grueling 15 - hour Ironmans in Hawaii .
It must be a buzzkill to be a 25 - year - old stud getting passed by an old guy towing a grown man in a dinghy , do n't you think ?
Hey , Dick , why not see how you 'd do on your own ?
" No way , " he says .
Dick does it purely for " the awesome feeling " he gets seeing Rick with a cantaloupe smile as they run , swim and ride together .
This year , at ages 65 and 43 , Dick and Rick finished their 24th Boston Marathon , in 5,083rd place out of more than 20,000 starters .
Their best time ?
Two hours , 40 minutes in 1992 -- only 35 minutes off the world record , which , in case you do n't keep track of these things , happens to be held by a guy who was not pushing another man in a wheelchair at the time .
" No question about it , " Rick types .
" My dad is the Father of the Century . "
And Dick got something else out of all this too .
Two years ago he had a mild heart attack during a race .
Doctors found that one of his arteries was 95 % clogged .
" If you had n't been in such great shape , " one doctor told him , " you probably would 've died 15 years ago . "
So , in a way , Dick and Rick saved each other 's life .
Rick , who has his own apartment ( he gets home care ) and works in Boston , and Dick , retired from the military and living in Holland , Mass . , always find ways to be together .
They give speeches around the country and compete in some backbreaking race every weekend , including this Father 's Day .
That night , Rick will buy his dad dinner , but the thing he really wants to give him is a gift he can never buy .
" The thing I 'd most like , " Rick types , " is that my dad sit in the chair and I push him once . "
Blue whales – thought to be the largest animals ever to have inhabited the Earth – have returned to the seas off Canada and Alaska for the first time since hunting them ceased more than four decades ago .
New research suggests that they appear to have rediscovered an old migration route that they abandoned at the height of the slaughter .
The research , by US and government scientists and a private research institute focussing on marine mammals , comes as whales face their greatest ever danger in over 20 years , as key governments threaten to breach the international moratorium on commercial whaling .
It has so far spotted 15 of the blue whales , which can weigh up to 200 tons , in the Gulf of Alaska and off British Columbia , and identified four of them as having been previously seen off southern California .
Long ago , before commercial whaling began , they used to migrate between the two areas , heading north in summer in search of food – they can each consume four tons of tiny crustacean krill a day .
But they were hunted close to extinction , with their numbers reduced from some 200,000 world wide to between 5,000 and 12,000 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When their slaughter was banned in 1965 , the seas off southern California were one of their last remaining strongholds , and there are now some 2,000 there , forming the largest population in the world .
Environmentalists hope that the more northerly sightings suggest they are recovering so well that they are able to spread into new areas .
However , some scientists fear that it could just as easily be a bad sign : global warming , they say , could be causing their prey to shift northwards in search of cooler waters , forcing the whales to follow .
Others suggest that so many of them may have been killed during the decades of slaughter that they simply lost the collective memory of the feeding grounds off Alaska and Canada .
Key nations are preparing a deal with Japan , the main whaling nation , which could open the way to resuming commercial whaling since a moratorium on all species of the leviathans was introduced in 1986 .
Japan has continued the hunt off Antarctica by exploiting a loophole that allows whales to be killed for " scientific research " .
The deal – which , as first reported in The Independent on Sunday has been thrashed out at unpublicised meetings behind closed doors – is expected to be unveiled at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Portugal next month .
It would allow Japan to hunt minke whales near its coasts and South Korea has already intimated that , if it goes ahead , it will require similar treatment and conservationist fear that the floodgates will open .
Mark Simmons , of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says the threat of new whaling is " dreadful and terrifying " and " fulfils our worst expectations " .

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , which sued the Bush White House over millions of missing White House emails , has released a treasure trove of documents relating to the loss of the emails .
We ’re just beginning to go through them , but CREW says the headline item is that the documents seem to confirm that emails subpoenaed by Patrick Fitzgerald regarding the leak of Valerie Plame ’s CIA identiy were among those missing from Dick Cheney ’s office .
Update :
You can find the documents here .
Update 2 : I just spoke to Anne Weisman , CREW ’s chief counsel .
She says these documents , are just the beginning , and CREW both wants and expects to receive more from the Obama White House .
This set of documents was originally provided to Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) by the Bush administration when Waxman began investigating the missing White House emails case , so they just represent what the Bush administration was willing to release ( albeit to a Congressman , not the public ) about its own failings .
Obviously there ’s much more — Weisman says this is only a “ very small percentage ” of the material CREW needs to understand exactly how the White House could lose several million emails .
Weisman says that these new documents do little to allay her concern about the timing of certain gaps in the email archives of the Office of the Vice President ( OVP ) .
“ I find it incredible that then - WH counsel Alberto Gonzales gets a call from DOJ saying they ’re opening this investigation and everything has to be preserved , and then the days immediately following that [ call ] there are OVP emails missing , ” she says .
Maybe Gonzales forgot that he was supposed to make sure everything was preserved ?

Sport hunters are depleting lion and cougar populations as managers respond to demands to control predators that threaten livestock and humans , according to a study published in the June 17 issue of PLoS One .
The study was led by Craig Packer , a University of Minnesota professor and authority on lion behavior , who worked with an international team of conservationists .
The study looked at numbers of lions and cougars killed by hunters over the past 15 to 25 years in Africa and the western United States .
The analysis suggested that management agencies often adjusted quotas to control rather than conserve the big cats in areas where humans or livestock were threatened .
Sport hunting takes a significant toll on these large feline species because replacement males routinely kill their predecessors ' cubs to improve their mating opportunities .
( Killing cubs forces female lions into estrus or " heat . " )
The team of scientists confirmed this effect by comparing the impact of hunting on populations of lions , cougars and leopards with its impact on black bear populations because male black bears do not routinely kill infants of other males .
Lion and cougar populations have suffered the greatest decline in African countries and U.S. states where sport hunting has been most intense over the past 25 years , the researchers found .
Leopards were not as affected as lions and cougars , most likely because they benefited from reduced numbers of lions .
Black bears , by contrast , appear to be thriving despite the thousands of bears killed by hunters .
The study results point to the need for new approaches to protect humans and livestock and to manage sport hunting without endangering these vulnerable species .
One possibility would be to restrict sport hunting to older males whose offspring have matured .
" We need to develop scientifically - based strategies that benefit hunters , livestock owners and conservationists , " Packer says .
" It 's important to educate the public about the risks these large predators pose to rural communities and to help hunters and wildlife managers develop methods to sustain healthy populations . "
" Packer 's colleagues included co-authors Luke Hunter , Executive Director of Panthera and Kristin Nowell from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission ( IUCN / SSC ) Cat Specialist Group , as well as Dave Garshelis , Chair of the IUCN / SSC Bear Specialist Group . "
Almost 50 % of people believe at least half of all MPs are corrupt , a BBC survey commissioned in the wake of the expenses scandal suggests .
It also points to strong support among the British public for taking away Parliament 's power to police itself .
But the Ipsos Mori poll of 1,001 adults also suggested that most people - 80 % - did not just blame MPs but thought the " parliamentary system " was to blame .
Alistair Darling and Geoff Hoon are the latest MPs to repay some money claimed .
Mr Hoon , the transport secretary , is the focus of Tuesday 's Daily Telegraph 's continuing coverage of claims made by MPs over four years - based on leaked receipts .
' Inadvertent ' mistake
He has apologised and repaid £ 384 of bills claimed for a year at his constituency home in Derbyshire , which was only his designated " second home " for part of the year .
It followed Chancellor Alistair Darling 's decision to repay £ 668 of a £ 1,000 six - month service bill he claimed for on a flat he moved out of , two months later .
He apologised for what Prime Minister Gordon Brown called an " inadvertent " mistake .
Scores of MPs have faced questions about their expenses claims , ranging from failures to pay capital gains tax and repeated " flipping " of second home designations to claims for moat clearance and a " duck island " .
The BBC - commissioned survey , conducted by telephone from May 29 to 31 , found that 7 % believed all MPs were corrupt , 17 % felt most were corrupt and 24 % felt " about half " were - totalled up it suggests 48 % of people believe at least half of all 646 MPs are corrupt .
Graph showing whose interests people believe MPs represent However despite weeks of damaging revelations about some MPs ' expenses , 47 % believed only " a few " were corrupt - and 3 % believed none were .
Asked whether they trusted MPs to tell the truth , only 20 % said they did and 76 % said they did not - up from 60 % three years ago .
However the figure was much lower , 44 % , when people were asked about their own local MP .

In the wake of the expenses scandal the government has pledged wide ranging reforms of the whole system - including a move to end what Gordon Brown has called the " gentlemen 's club " at Westminster , where MPs vote on their own pay and allowances .
Party leaders have moved to set up their own inquiries into claims made by their MPs and to date 13 MPs have announced their intention to step down , since the Telegraph began running its stories .
The survey suggested strong support for taking away Parliament 's power to police itself - most adults of voting age , 85 % of those surveyed want an independent judicial body to scrutinise MPs ' affairs .
And it found that the majority of people , 80 % , agreed that it was not just MPs but the whole parliamentary system that was to blame .
It would be unwise , perhaps , to underestimate the danger we may be in
Mark Easton But 62 % said they believed MPs put self - interest ahead of the country and their constituents .
Of those surveyed 79 % supported the idea of " recall " - allowing voter petitions to trigger by - elections if they get enough signatures - the best known example of which was Arnold Schwarzenegger 's election in California .
The idea that has been backed by Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg , following criticism that some MPs who have been heavily criticised plan to step down at the next general election , rather than straight away .

I found out something of personal interest to me , though many of you probably wo n't care .
Reading Damn Cool Pics , one of my more favorite non-science / skeptic blogs , I found out that the the Windows XP background of the too - green hill -- the one called Bliss -- is a real place , and it's in Sonoma County , California not far from where I used to live .
I know , big deal , right ?
But the thing is , I used to drive past that hill all the time !
DCP links to the hill on Google Maps , and when I zoomed out I realized I used to drive past it to get to Napa , or to take the back way to Vallejo and Sacramento .
I must have blown past it dozens of times and never once noticed it .
I like to notice things ; it 's part of being an amateur ( and observational ) astronomer .
You never know what you might see ... and I 've seen really weird stuff in my time .
I drive a lot , and I see a lot .
But I 've seen the XP picture about a billion times too , yet never noticed the real thing , less than 100 meters outside my passenger window .
What else have I missed ?
What do we all miss ?
There is considerable debate on the number of Apple specific viruses Security experts have discovered two novel forms of Mac OS X malware .
OSX / Tored - A - an updated version of the Mac OS Tored worm - and a Trojan called OSX / Jahlav - C were both found on popular pornographic websites .
Users logging on to these sites are asked to download a " missing Video ActiveX Object " but are sent a virus payload instead .
While most viruses target PC users , there has been rise in the number of attacks on Mac systems .
Graham Cluley , a security expert with anti-virus firm Sophos , told the BBC that the small number of Mac viruses had made some users complacent .
" There is a lot less malware on Mac than for Windows , so Mac users sometimes feel invincible .
" Apple have marketed their system on the line of ' you wo n't suffer spyware like you would on Windows ' and that has reinforced people 's attitudes .
" And one thing we do know is that you are less likely to be running anti-virus software on a Mac than on a PC , " he said .
Remote access Sophos says that the OSX / Jahlav - C is an update to a previous version of Jahlav ; it runs a script that " uses http to communicate with a remote website and download code supplied by the attacker " .
We will see more creative and new ways of exploiting vulnerabilities on all formats
Christopher Phin
Mac Format Previously , the virus would download fake anti-virus software that would dupe users into buying a product that would not actually do anything and , warned Mr Cluley , would result in hackers obtaining credit card details .
However , that has changed and at present the virus is not downloading any code .
" At the moment the virus is not managing to get that [ fake anti-virus software ] program , but because it is going to a site controlled by hackers , they can change it to download whatever they want , " he said .
That could be keyloggers , data mining or adding the Mac to a future botnet .
Christopher Phin - deputy editor of Mac Format magazine - told the BBC that Mac users needed to be more aware of potential threats .
" The Apple community is guilty of peddling the line that they are removed from security issues . , " he said One of the reasons for this could be that while there are millions of viruses targeting the Windows operating system , it is thought there are less than 70 affecting Apple computers .
" The most useful thing people can do is educate themselves on best practice to avoid getting infected in the first place . "
Mr Phin said that , for now , Mac users did not have the same need for anti-virus software that PC users did , although that could change in the future .
" I suspect we will see more creative and new ways of exploiting vulnerabilities on all formats and the greater Apple profile makes it more susceptible to being targeted , " he said .

TEHRAN , May 12 ( Reuters ) - U.S. - born journalist Roxana Saberi is in good spirits and may leave Iran next week after she was acquitted on charges of spying for the United States , her lawyer said on Tuesday .
Lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi , speaking a day after Saberi ’s eight - year jail sentence was cut to a two - year suspended term , praised the appeal court ’s handling of the case as “ very just ” .
He told Reuters the 32 - year - old freelance reporter in the court ’s hearing on Sunday had “ accepted she had made a mistake and got access to documents she should not have .
But there was no transfer of any classified information ” .
Her release on Monday removed a snag in U.S. President Barack Obama ’s attempts to improve U.S. - Iranian relations after three decades of mutual mistrust .
Obama has welcomed as a “ humanitarian gesture ” Iran ’s move to free Saberi after more than three months in detention .
Khorramshahi said he had talked to Saberi , who has worked for the BBC and U.S. National Public Radio , earlier on Tuesday .
“ She is in good spirits .
She might be leaving the country sometime next week , but it is not certain as she has some business to take care of , ” he said .
“ What is important is that she is not facing any legal restrictions on her departure . ”
“ The change in verdict was the result of a different interpretation of the legal article concerned and not due to political considerations , ” Khorramshahi said .
Another member of the defence team told the ISNA news agency the court had acquitted her of spying but convicted her under a law covering offences including taking pictures or videos in areas where photography is banned .
Saberi , a citizen of both the United States and Iran , was arrested in January for working in the Islamic Republic after her press credentials had expired .
She was later accused of spying , a charge that can carry the death sentence .
The United States had said the spying charges were baseless and demanded her immediate release .
Tehran does not recognise dual nationality and told Washington not to interfere .
The two countries were already locked in an acrimonious dispute over Iran ’s nuclear programme , which the West fears is aimed at making arms .
Iran says it is to generate electricity .
Obama has offered Iran a fresh start in relations , though Iran says Washington must first show real policy change .

CAS Launches Free Online Database
Designed for the public , Common Chemistry offers information about nearly 8,000 chemicals of general interest
View Enlarged Image NEW DATABASE
The entry for creatine in Chemical Abstracts Service 's new Common Chemistry database includes the compound 's CAS Registry Number , its formula and chemical structure , synonyms for its chemical name , and a link to further data on Wikipedia .
Chemical Abstracts Service ( CAS ) , a division of the American Chemical Society , last week officially launched Common Chemistry , a free online database containing information on 7,800 chemicals of widespread and general interest as well as all 118 elements from the periodic table .
CAS had previously introduced a test version of the site during the ACS national meeting in March .
Common Chemistry is primarily intended for the general public , including students , teachers , and the media , says Christine McCue , CAS vice president for marketing .
Apart from some of the elements , the substances in Common Chemistry were selected because they had been cited 1,000 or more times in CAS databases .
Common Chemistry compounds include , to take a few examples , creatine , a controversial muscle - building supplement ; bisphenol A , an endocrine - disrupting monomer used for making food and beverage containers ; benzoyl peroxide , an acne treatment ; and resveratrol , a constituent of grapes and wine that is reputed to have beneficial health effects .
The database can be searched by chemical name or CAS Registry Number .
Entries show a compound 's Registry Number , molecular formula , and chemical structure ; chemical names and synonyms ; and a Wikipedia link if available , McCue says .
The Common Chemistry database will be updated periodically and further Wikipedia links will be added when possible .
The Common Chemistry web site is the result of a collaboration between Wikipedia and CAS that began in 2008 , after representatives of the online encyclopedia asked CAS for assistance in validating CAS Registry Numbers listed on Wikipedia 's Chemistry Portal , McCue notes .
" This collaboration is CAS ' gesture to provide accurate chemical information and CAS Registry Numbers to the public , which is also in line with CAS ' mission as a division of the American Chemical Society , " she says .
The survivalist community is often perceived as a bunch of gloom and doom types sitting on a pile of MREs , ammunition and guns in some far out corner of the North West .
Of course the survivalist is also typecast as expecting TEOTWAWKI ( the end of the world as we know it ) to occur any day now , in fact he is actually hoping for it .
Honestly it is time for this stereotype to die a deserving death .
Modern survivalists are many things but very few are actually concerned about the infamous black helicopters or FEMA Camps .
Most instead are simply realists who understand that sometimes things do go wrong and it is better to be prepared than to expect someone else to solve your problems .
The real key to modern survivalism is the Modern Survival Philosophy which is a group ten key principles that guide the actions of many survivalists .
While all are important it is tenet number one that really sets the stage for separating the doomsday stereotype from the reality .
Survivalists are generally thought of as people who prepare to deal with disasters , shortages and anything that disrupts society .
Modern survivalists do this but they do so in a way that improves their lives even if nothing major ever goes wrong .
For example many survival - minded individuals grow gardens and develop more permanent food - producing crops like fruit trees , berry bushes etc. on their property .
They generally stick to organic production methods , focus on water harvesting and attempt to maximize production per square meter .
This is a classic survival technique designed to remain sustainable if anything hits from simple loss of personal income all the way up to a collapse of US infrastructure .
So yes in the event of economic collapse this makes a tremendous amount of sense as a modern survival tactic .
Now lets examine the other side of the issue .
What if we never have an economic collapse , what if there are no food shortages in the next 30 years and what if the survivalist never even has a layoff to contend with ?
Flat out for the foreseeable future absolutely nothing goes wrong .
If you have your property landscaped with sustainable organic food - producing crops are you not still better off ?
Consider that by setting up sustainable and productive organic agriculture that your property value will be increased if for no other reason than environmentalism is a huge movement right now .
You will spend less money over the years on buying food which can be saved , invested , used to reduce debt , etc .
Further your health will be improved by eating high - quality fresh produce not to mention the exercise you get .
Of course the list of benefits from having a solid sustainable edible landscape on your property is exhaustive and could go on a lot further but hopefully this begins to make the point .
Lets examine more briefly a few more common things that survival minded individuals do and consider what benefit they have to us even if nothing ever goes wrong .
One key to modern survivalism is debt elimination .
In the event of a disaster from personal up to global those in less debt are better suited to handle what comes their way .
Yet even without any type of disaster having low to no debt will result in a much more sustainable and rewarding lifestyle .
Having firearms and the training to use them is useful in anything from a garden - variety home invasion to a true societal breakdown and it can be the difference between life and death .
Yet if nothing goes wrong the armed citizen is still more confident and makes decisions based on reality vs. fear .
Storing extra food is  Survivalism 101 and there are many things that can go wrong from a personal up to a global level where such stored food is potentially life saving .
Yet by following the mantra of store what you eat and eat what you store modern survivalists actually spend less money via a classic method known as capital deferral .
This is accomplished by purchasing what will be used anyway at todays prices to beat inflation , much the way Southwest Airlines does by purchasing fuel contracts while prices are lower .
This concept simply continues though just about every facet of survivalism .
If you put in solar panels and / or wind generators , and you are ready to handle a black out no matter what the cause or how long it lasts .
Yet even if nothing goes wrong , and you pay less for you electric bill and increase your property value .
Learn to live off the land with hunting , fishing and foraging and you will be more likely to survive a disaster but if nothing goes wrong you are enjoying the outdoors , getting exercise , saving money and eating better quality food all at the same time .
This formula is practically bullet - proof as long as you keep the first tenet in mind as you make lifestyle and purchasing decisions ; again that tenet is ,
 Everything You Do Should Improve Your Position in Life Even If Nothing Goes Wrong 
This keeps you from using survivalism as a convenient excuse to blow money and go into debt , which would violate one of the other tenets anyway .
For instance fishing is a great way to add another low cost protein source to the household if done with practical and modestly priced equipment .
Yet if you go out and purchase a 25,000 - dollar bass boat and fancy equipment you will never get an ROI on your production .
Now if you want a nice boat , this is America , there is nothing wrong with that but if you want to be a survivalist , save your money and buy what is adequate with cash .
One version is an expensive hobby , the other is a way to improve your lifestyle .
It is really a simple core guiding principle : each time you are making a decision about where to spend time , money or resources you simply ask the question ,  Will this action improve my ability to live a sustainable lifestyle if we have a disaster or even if we dont . 
When the answer is yes you make it part of your survival planning .
If the answer is no , that doesnt mean you dont do it , it simply means it is a luxury not an investment in an asset that provides for your future and hence you prioritize it accordingly .
There is a fundamental reality that most Americans are living beyond their means in an unsustainable way .
They are one or two paychecks from poverty , consuming food that is unhealthy , working far to hard for far to little and above all many are miserable .
Yes miserable !
They work at a job they hate , drive on a commute they hate even more and give up the best parts of their lives simply to earn enough money to pay the interest on their debts .
They then retire with a social security check that keeps them just to the south side of the poverty line and by the time most 30 40 somethings retire they wont even get that .
The modern survivalist simply realizes that is not good enough , that life is precious and as humans we have a fundamental liberty that many choose to sell for far to low of a price .
The good news is you have a choice , you can choose to walk though life with a credit card at the ready or you can choose to live a life that can be sustained in both good times and bad .
It all starts with asking the simple question , will this choice improve my long term sustainability ,  on a daily basis .
Simply asking that question will put you on the path to becoming a modern survivalist .

One thing we ’ve learned about James von Brunn is that he was apparentely a ‘ birther ’ , one of these folks who claims that Barack Obama is not the legitimate president of the United States because he is not a natural born US citizen ( this is all the ‘ where ’s the birth certificate ’ nonsense ) .
The great majority of the people who ’re into this stuff are just harmless wingers and nutballs .
But this stuff has clearly also permeated the extremist fringe .
We ’ll be putting more up on this soon .
But this is clearly of a piece with rising right - wing extremism and fringe violence that — uncomfortably as it is to say — is rising in tandem in the early months of the Obama presidency .
BEIJING | China ’s communist government , showing concern that mounting protests in Iran could spark another “ color ” revolution in a close economic ally , has called for the disputed election results to be recognized and cautioned the United States and other Western powers not to meddle in Iran ’s affairs .
The messages , relayed through China ’s vast and tightly controlled state media , have glossed over reports of mass demonstrations and the deaths of protesters at the hands of Iranian security forces .
Such news and images , coming only weeks after the 20th anniversary of China ’s violent crackdown on students in Tiananmen Square , could reopen delicate questions about political developments here and undermine Chinese relations with a key oil supplier and customer for Chinese goods .
News reports from the Xinhua News Agency , China Central Television and other state outlets have instead focused on accusations from Irans conservative leaders that the Western media are “ stirring up unrest ” in the wake of the June 12 presidential election .
The reports also have echoed Iranian government assertions that the protesters are sore losers .
Global Times , a recently launched English - language newspaper run by the staunchly nationalistic Peoples Daily , published an editorial Monday condemning the Western media for being too quick to proclaim the election rigged .
“ Even in democracies in the West , the losing side sometimes claims an election was unfair .
This has even happened in the U.S , ” the editorial said .
Last Thursday , an editorial in the state - owned English - language China Daily called on the international community “ to leave Irans internal problems to the Iranian people and accept their verdict .
“ Attempts to push the so - called color revolution toward chaos will prove very dangerous , ” the editorial continued .
Opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi “ refuses to accept defeat .
Win and loss are two sides of an election coin .
Some candidates are less inclined to accept defeat . ”
China Daily pointed to a pre-election poll that showed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ahead by a 2 to 1 margin .
The editorial urged President Obama to keep the pledge he made earlier this month in Cairo not to repeat Cold War-era mistakes in Iran , an apparent reference to Mr. Obama ’s acknowledgment in his speech to the Muslim world that the CIA helped overthrow an elected Iranian prime minister in 1953 .
The coup reinstalled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who was in turn toppled by the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
The Chinese media have reported on the bloody protests — the most violent in Iran in 30 years — but often as an afterthought .
Qiao Mu , director of the Center for International Communications Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University , said the coverage reflected a longstanding government allergy to popular protests that are seen as inherently destabilizing .
“ In China the government is afraid of any kind of protest , ” he said .
“ They are afraid of instability . …
So the media has focused on the election results , not the protests . ”
Mr. Qiao said China ’s ruling Communist Party is concerned that the U.S. and other Western countries might intervene in Iran and cause the government to topple , echoing the “ orange revolution ” in Ukraine , the “ rose revolution ” in Georgia and other Western - backed examples of people power .
“ In recent years , the Chinese government has been very worried about the so - called color revolution .
I think they are watching the developing situation [ in Iran ] closely , ” Mr. Qiao said .
Chinese officials have said little about the crisis in Iran , other than to say the results should stand .
“ China respects the choice of the Iranian people and hopes Iran can maintain stability and solidarity , ” Qin Gang , a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry , told reporters as anti-government demonstrations reached a peak last week .

An international plan to build a nuclear fusion reactor is being threatened by rising costs , delays and technical challenges .
Emails leaked to the BBC indicate that construction costs for the experimental fusion project called Iter have more than doubled .
Some scientists also believe that the technical hurdles to fusion have become more difficult to overcome and that the development of fusion as a commercial power source is still at least 100 years away .
At a meeting in Japan on Wednesday , members of the governing Iter council reviewed the plans and may agree to scale back the project .
' Size of a battleship '
On a windy construction site in the south of France , the lofty scientific goal of developing nuclear fusion as a power source is starting to take on a more substantial form .
Covering an area of more than 400,000 square metres , workers have built a one - kilometre - long earthen platform on which the experimental reactor will sit .
" This is going to be the world 's biggest science experiment , " says Neil Calder , Iter 's head of communications .
" This is a vast global project to show the scientific feasibility of fusion as a limitless source of energy .
" On top of this platform we are going to build 130 buildings .
The main building will contain the Iter machine itself .
" It will be huge - the size of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris - and it'll weigh about the same as a battleship - 36,000 tonnes of metal and instrumentation . "
Controlling fusion
Iter was formally launched in 2006 as collaboration between the European Union , the United States , Russia , Japan , China , India and South Korea .
The plan was to build the world 's most advanced fusion experiment within 10 years for a budget of $ 6bn ( £ 3.6bn ) .
Plasma in a tokamak - a fusion reactor device - can reach millions of degrees
But the grand scheme has been dogged by soaring costs caused by more expensive raw materials and increases in staff numbers .
Emails seen by the BBC indicate that the total price of constructing the experiment is now expected to be in excess of $ 16bn ( £ 10 bn ) .
Professor Sebastien Balibar is research director for the French national research laboratory in Paris .
He says that if the rising price of Iter is met by cutting back other research programmes that would be a disaster for science .
" If Iter is built on money having to do with energy or oil , that is perfectly good , I hope it works and in one hundred years I hope we know how to control a fusion reaction .
But if it is taken from the public support of research in physics or biology then I would be very upset , " says Professor Balibar .
' Different road '
Costs are not the only problem ;
Iter is also beset by huge technical challenges .
Fusion takes place when a superheated gas called a plasma reaches a stage called ignition , where hydrogen atoms start to fuse with each other and release large amounts of energy .
Iter aims to achieve this but only for a few minutes at a time .
MIT professor Bruno Coppi has been working on fusion research in Italy and the United States for many decades .
He believes that Iter is the wrong experiment ; it is too costly , will take too long and may not deliver fusion .
He says we should be looking at other options .
" We are pressed for time , the climate situation is worse .
I think we should go with a faster line of experiments .
Iter should admit its limitations and it will give a limited contribution to fusion , but to get to ignition you need to follow a different road , " he says .
Fusion is like trying to put the Sun in a box - but we do n't know how to make the box
Professor Sebastien Balibar
Another huge hurdle is how to contain gases that are 10 times hotter than the Sun .
The materials required simply have n't been invented yet .
Professor Balibar explained : " The most difficult problem is the problem of materials .
Some time ago I declared that fusion is like trying to put the Sun in a box - but we do n't know how to make the box .
" The walls of the box , which need to be leak tight , are bombarded by these neutrons which can make stainless steel boil .
Some people say it is just a question of inventing a stainless steel which is porous to let these particles through ; personally I would have started by inventing this material . "
Failure a possibility
In Provence , the scientists working on Iter say they have faith that the project will deliver the most effective path to fusion .
Dr Norbert Holtkamp is the man tasked with building the machine .
" Iter is a step that will demonstrate whether fusion is viable .
But whether it is easy then depends on the cost of energy at that time on the cost of oil , but certainly Iter has the potential .
Dr Holtkamp recognises that Iter is a scientific experiment - and as such it has the possibility of failure .
" Any project can fail , especially if it's one of a kind or the first of its kind .
It would be irresponsible for any scientist or project manager to say that in a science project it cannot fail . "
Long - term plan
The rising costs of construction and technical challenges are to be reviewed at a meeting of the Iter council in Japan on Wednesday and Thursday .
It is possible that by the end of this year , a new scaled - down version of Iter will be agreed .
The Iter tokamak would be the largest of its kind in the world Dr Holtkamp says the view that the project is to be scaled down is wrong .
" Fusion is not going to be the alternative in the next 20 , 30 or 40 years , that is correct .
But there needs to a long term plan ; 40 years is little more than a generation .
We need to think about the next generation and the many after that . "
Professor Balibar says that the end result of the ballooning costs and increasing technical challenges will be a further slowing of the path to fusion .
" The consequence of all these difficulties is that it 's not going to be tomorrow that one succeeds with fusion .
But the energy problem and the climate problem are urgent , " he says .
" The global warming is now - one needs to find a solution immediately , one cannot wait 100 years .
The solution to the climate and energy problem is not Iter , ( it ) is not fusion . "
While fusion offers a long - term hope of securing energy supplies , the changing climate and the pressing need for greener energy may ensure that renewables get greater political support in the short to medium term .
Ultimately fusion may be a technological dream that is just too hard to turn into reality .
And Iter , in a beautiful setting in the south of France , may become the graveyard of a good but impossible idea .

The Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) has agreed to propose a system of technical partnerships for new teams to assist them in joining the grid in 2010 , following a meeting between the team principals in London yesterday , AUTOSPORT has learned .
As the teams close in on an agreement with the FIA over the future regulations of F1 ahead of tomorrow 's 2010 entry deadline , FOTA hopes this compromise would allow prospective new teams assistance from the established operations to compete credibly in their first seasons without having to fund a significant increase beyond the set budget cap .
FOTA is pushing for a " glidepath " approach to adopting the budget cap regulations , with a two - step reduction in expenditure in 2010 and 2011 .
This would see expenditure limited to € 100 million in 2010 , dropping to € 45 for the following season .
The technical partnerships would give the new teams assistance in terms of parts , particularly non-performance differentiators , as well as some design know - how .
The FOTA proposal is believed to stop short of allowing full - blown customer cars , something that is strongly opposed by several teams , and would be structured to ensure that the newcomers compete under the budget cap in their own right in 2011 .
FOTA also discussed further ways to develop the budget cap concept , with the possibility of some commonality of non-performance differentiators still on the table in a bid to repackage the imposed limit as a programme of cost containment .
Although final agreement has not been reached , it is believed that both the FIA and FOTA are confident that a resolution can be found ahead of the entry deadline .
The much anticipated Palm Pre smartphone is about a week away from being released , and while we ’ve covered pretty much every newsworthy aspect of the device , some interesting pieces of information keep churning out from around the web .
The latest tidbit comes straight from D7 : All Things Digital , were Palm executives have confirmed that the Pre will effortlessly sync with Apple ’s iTunes by tricking it into thinking it ’s an iPod .
Although third - party applications have long been available to allow various MP3 players to sync with iTunes , Palm ’s Media Sync feature is fundamentally different in that it actually uses Apple ’s vendor and product id so that the Pre is recognized as an Apple device .
Older copy - protected songs and , naturally , iPhone apps wo n’t sync with Palm ’s smartphone but otherwise DRM - free songs and even photos from iPhoto will transfer without effort .
It will be interesting to see how Apple reacts to this .
Not surprisingly , many of the Palm Pre engineering and development team are former Apple employees , including Jon Rubinstein , one of the designers of the original iPod .
The move should provide an easier path for iPhone converts , though it ’s also inherently risky , since Apple could just as easily update iTunes to block Palm ’s handset from accessing its software – potentially initiating a cat and mouse game between the two .
Why Twenty - Two ?
Because we said so .
It seems like every year the movies trend more and more to the PG - 13 level .
Even established R - Rated franchises like Die Hard and Terminator have come up with PG - 13 rate fare in recent years .
And while violence is becoming more acceptable in PG - 13 movies , nudity still remains a hard - R . As such , it becomes something of a forbidden fruit .
Yeah , it ’s certainly not hard to find nudity in some form , be it Playboy or some dark corner of the Internet .
But finding the intersection of nudity and mainstream cinema , that ’s something worth noting .
Below are twenty - two of our favorite such scenes .
Granted , this is far from an exhaustive list .
I ’m sure many of your favorite were not included .
It ’s simply too hard , pun intended , to narrow this down to twenty - two without omitting some good ones .
C’est la vie .
Below are what were have considered our favorites , with some photos and video .
While we applaud the nudity in these films , we unfortunately are n’t able to post it on this site , thus making this exercise of a bit of a tease , a fabulous tease though .
Most of them include scenes that titillate more than elicit another type of reaction , but we included a few odds and ends .
And for our purposes , nude can include simply topless .
So on to the rankings :
Who : Keeley Hazell
What : Supermarket Sequence
Based on a short film , Cashback is a surprisingly strong romantic comedy , with one nice twist .
It features a main character who fights insomnia and lets his artistic imagination runs wild by stopping time .
The results of this “ gift ” can be a bit of eye candy , for both the character and the viewer .
Like when he decides to see women naked in a supermarket .
It ’s not just Keeley Hazell you can see , but she ’s definitely the biggest name involved .
Who : Emmanuelle Béart
What : Modeling
Our definition of mainstream includes major foreign films , hence this French work .
It also gives us an excuse to show French woman Béart , who has always looked great , even if American audiences do n’t know much about her outside of Mission Impossible .
In this movie , Béart plays the beautiful girlfriend who becomes the new nude model for “ La Belle Noiseuse . ”
Who : Naomi Watts / Laura Harring
What : Lesbian Sex Scene
Who would n’t jump at a chance to see Naomi Watts nude ?
In David Lynch ’s Mulholland Drive , Watts has a few graphic scenes , one notably with co-star Laura Harring .
Mild controversy arose when Lynch blurred out Harring ’s lower region during the nude scene on the DVD release , a disappointment to Harring fans as its the only film in which she has appeared in her birthday suit .
However , the scene is so dark , you probably did n’t notice unless the brightness on your set was messed up .
Who : Nicole Kidman
What : Opening credits / getting dressed
Eyes Wide
Shut elicited a variety of opinions from audiences and critics alike , but one thing is for certain .
Stanley Kubrick got Nicole Kidmanto undress .
Whatever you think of the film , it does have very memorable moments , including the fact you ’ll probably associate it ( and Kidman ) with Chris Isaak ’s “ Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing . ”
Who : Monica Bellucci
What : Sex Scene
We know Monica Bellucci is beautiful .
After all , she topped our Forty Hottest Actresses over Forty post a while back .
We simply cannot have one of these posts and not include her .
And she ’s Italian , so you know she ’s willing to get naked .
All Italians are .
I once read a three word review of Malèna : Monica .
Bellucci .
Naked .
Though Americans should note that the European home video release has more nude Monica that the Region 1 DVD .
Who : Halle Berry
What : First sex scene
The movie confronts difficult issues of racial prejudice in the south , but some may remember it for Berry ’s nude scenes .
Hot off her gratuitous Swordfish flash , she decided to bare all for a pivotal moment in a serious film that won her an Oscar .
Yeah , Academy Awards and slap - up sex scenes do n’t always go hand in hand , but this time it worked .
Extended Monster ’s Ball nude scenes are available overseas and on the Blu - Ray version .
Who : Barbara Crampton
What : Her and the severed head
The scream - queen Crampton got her start and made her way working in daytime soaps , but she also popped up in a few low - budget flicks .
One such example was 1985 ’s cult classic Re-Animator , where she was cast as Megan Halsey .
The twisted and fun flick was memorable enough to warrant a mention in Best Picture winner American Beauty , and a place in the hearts of anyone who has ever seen the film .
From the things you ca n’t unsee category involves Crampton and one severed head .
Who : Jennifer Connelly
What :
In front of the mirror
The movie is insane , crazy , painful and f-ed up , but absolutely brilliant and heartbreaking .
And if you ’re going to watch it , at least you get to see Jennifer Connelly nude .
Plus , she ’s gives a pretty great performance .
Come for the nudity , stick around for the storytelling !
Who : Natasha Henstridge
What : Hottub Scene
The achingly gorgeous Natasha Henstridge stars as an alien determined to reproduce and start the colonization .
You can imagine how that can led to some truly infamous sex scenes , as she ferociously seduces men and kills them after the “ seed ” is planted .
There are several sex scenes , but it ’s the hot tub scene that burned itself into the psyche of a generation of teenage boys .
Who : Katie Holmes
What : Car Flash
In her pre-Tom Cruise days , Holmes starred in the aptly named The Gift by Sam Raimi , which has an unexpected and most pleasant surprise for viewers .
It also led to this exchange from Harold and Kumar go to White Castle :
Goldstein : Sorry , kids .
We ai n’t goin ’ nowhere .
We ’re watching ‘ The Gift ’ .
Supposedly Katie Holmes shows her titties in this movie .
Harold :
Is that all you Jews ever think about ?
Tits ?
Rosenberg : Katie Holmes is a nice , respectable , wholesome girl … and I ’m gonna see her boobs .
Goldstein :
The things I would eat out of her ass !
You have no idea !
Rosenberg : Ugh !
That is a completely vulgar statement .
Goldstein :
So is , “ I wanna bang Britney Spears on the bathroom floor , ” but it ’s true .
Rosenberg : Touché .
Who : Jason Segel
What : Naked Break - up
Yeah , we crossed you up a bit here with some male nudity .
Not the most common in mainstream cinema .
Do n’t worry , we ’re not going to do it again .
We certainly are n’t going to post screenshots of Eastern Promies .
Just had to make sure you were paying attention .
As for the scene above , Judd Apatow was n’t kidding on his promise to “ shake Americans from their squeamishness about male anatomy in movies . ”
And the scene is pretty humorous with the nudity definitely accentuating the awkwardness .
For better or worse , it is quite memorable .
Who : Joyce Heyser
What : Tuxedo flash
We all know that one movie that comes on cable and manages to put a stranglehold on your ability to turn the channel .
Just One Of The Guys is such a tale of seduction .
Joyce Heyser plays Terri , a young lass that decides to change her gender in order to be recognized as a writer .
She believes that males are taken more seriously .
The downfall of such plans is that you have to reveal your true identity at some point .
Who : Linnea Quigley
What : Graveyard Dance
Horror movies seem to be good at producing nude scenes , and said scenes often end up as the best part﻿ of the movie .
In The Return of the Living Dead , scream queen Linnea Quigley does a sexy striptease dance at a graveyard , ending up fully nude and showing off her great body as a group of people watch and cheer .
Sounds about right for a zombie flick .
Who : Eva Green
What : Striptease ( well , really the whole movie )
Casino Royale star Eva Green got naked ( a lot ) during her role in Dreamers before her stardom as a James Bond babe .
There ’s nothing wrong with all nude , just tastefully done .
Just ask Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury :
Who : Anne Hathaway
What : Make - out scene
You probably do n’t remember Havoc .
The film was noted during production for having then - Disney princess ( of the Princess Diaries fame ) Anne Hathaway go topless , but despite that hype was basically dumped direct to video .
Probably because it was criticized for feeling like a movie written by a sixteen year old girl who never actually went to East Los Angeles , but heard about it and maybe watched something on the news .
Still , it managed to spawn a sequel of sorts , Havoc 2 : Normal Adolescent Behavior ( which had no real relation to the original ) .
Who : Kelly Preston
What : Bedroom Bush
A 1980s classic , Preston disrobes in a beautiful ( and funny ) nude scene which will make you reach for the remote .
Kelly Preston , Yum !
And on a related note , Preston still looked pretty great ( and topless ) in Jerry Maguire 10 years later .
Who : Marisa Tomei
What : Opening Bedroom
Tomei looked great in 2008 ’s The Wrestler , but arguably looked better in Sidney Lumet ’s Before the Devil Knows You ’re Dead a year earlier .
The movie starts with a great sex scene and her great looks and assets continue throughout .
Who : Alyssa Milano
What : Lesbian seduction
The move is strictly B - level at best , but Milano hopped from child actor on Who ’s The Boss to full - blown woman in 1995 ’s Embrace Of The Vampire .
Showing of her assets in the low - budget horror flick , Milano plays virginal teen Charlotte Wells whose main goal is to fight off the advances of a vampire .
Tony Danza would not approve .
Who : Jennifer Connelly / Debra Cole
What : Sitting on beach
She ’s young , she ’s outside , she ’s soaking wet , and it ’s long .
Easy call .
Jennifer Connelly reappears on this list in her very first nude scene , where she can be seen laying down in the sand along a lake .
Debra Cole has decided to join her , and both are sans tops .
Who : Denise Richards / Neve Campbell
What : Pool Scene
The three way between Richards , Campbell , and Matt Dillon is one hot scene , but if I ’m choosing just one scene from this movie ( and we ’re trying to limit this to one scene per movie ) , it ’s the unrated pool scene .
It goes from cat fight to lesbian make - out in the blink of an eye .
That ’s women at their best !
Who : Shannon Elizabeth
What : Bedroom scene , Nadia and the magazine
Who would n’t want to find a naked Shannon Elizabeth in their bedroom ?
Who : Phoebe Cates
What : pool scene
Does n’t anyone f-ing knock anymore ?
This scene has forever changed the Car ’s song Moving in Stereo … in a good way .
Not that it is the only one from this film .
Like Wild Things , you also have Jennifer Jason Leigh in the poolhouse .
But this is the one scene you ’ll remember as it ’s just one of those great scenes in cinematic history .
I ’m just finishing a paper I ’m writing with Dr Pamala Wiepking , an expert on charitable giving who works at Vrije University , Amsterdam .
Our paper is called ‘ Feeling Poor , Acting Stingy ’ and is a study of how people ’s feelings about money can affect their charitable giving .
We had access to a survey that asked people about both their money beliefs and their giving behaviours and we found that people who have insecurities about their wealth – who feel they do n’t have enough or are worried about losing what they have – make smaller donations than those who are confident about their money .
I think it ’s fascinating that people who have exactly the same amount of wealth can either be relaxed and feel they have enough to spare to give a nice chunk away , or can feel uptight and worried about letting go of any of it .
Of course how much money you think you need depends on a lot of factors , like how many dependants you have or the size of regular outgoings like mortgages .
But an interesting study called ‘ A Bit Rich ’ , written in 2002 by Laura Edwards and published by IPPR , contains quotes from rich Brits who felt totally strapped for cash and with ‘ nothing to spare ’ .
Memorably , one said ,
“ Wealthy ?
It ’s £ 50 million and upwards as far as I ’m concerned .
£ 50 million is the point at which you do n’t have to panic anymore ”
And another claimed ,
“ I think I ’d need to have something like £ 4 million in the bank to feel wealthy ”
( both quotes from p.35 of the report , which is free to download )
Our paper concludes that people ’s own perceptions of their wealth – however objectively curious – need to be taken into account in fundraising activities , because someone being targeted may not agree they have much to spare .
But we also suggest that under - giving by the rich might be due to a lack of empathy , rather than meanness or financial illiteracy .
As Rousseau suggested nearly three centuries ago , the lives of the rich are so far removed from the lives of the poor that they lack any common fount of shared experience :
“ Why are kings without pity for their subjects ?
It is because they count on never being human beings .
Why are the rich so harsh to the poor ?
It is because they do not have fear of becoming poor . ”
If accusations of lack of empathy seem harsh , a more sympathetic approach suggests that genuine money anxieties are evenly distributed across the spectrum of wealth .
A psychological study of motivation by Dr Terri Apter of Cambridge University found it is not uncommon for even very rich donors to feel anxious each time they give .
She writes ,
‘ Typically there ’s the man who has a sinking feeling in his stomach every time he makes a large donation …
It ’s the split between the reality of being rich now – but still having that self - image or those impulses that a not - rich person has .
[ They think ] , “ Maybe tomorrow , given the markets and the exchange rates and property prices , this is going to look very stupid . ” ‘
Given the current economic crisis , perhaps we can sympathise somewhat more convincingly with anxious billionaires , even whilst we use this research to shore up our efforts to encourage them to start , or expand , their philanthropic activities .
“ What 's “ Cutlet Carpathian Style ? ” , your columnist asked innocently in a restaurant in Budapest recently .
“ You 're halfway through eating it when the Ukrainians take it away and say the rest belongs to them , ” came an instant quip in return .
The rest of the world may have forgotten , but Hungarians still remember the time when a large chunk of what is now Ukraine ( and a lot more besides ) was part of their old imperial kingdom .
The encoding of menus is a fascinating byway in gastro - linguistics .
Any mention of “ Hawaiian ” means that chunks of pineapple have been added to the dish .
Similarly , “ Provençale ” signals tomatoes and black olives .
“ Napolitano ” means with basil and mozzarella ; “ Niçoise ” is anchovies and eggs , “ Veneziana ” means onions .
More generally , “ traditional ” usually means indigestible or overcooked .
“ Organic ” means it costs more .

A sprinkle of hope and a dollop of sadness
But rarely if ever do the menu terms have any political meaning .
London 's best restaurant for real English cooking , Wilton's , serves a dessert called “ Guards ' Pudding ” , invented in the trenches of the first world war ( ingredients include breadcrumbs and raspberry jam ) .
The officers who survived the wartime mincing machine apparently longed for the dish in peacetime London .
The French “ Macedoine ” salad could be the big exception : it is a mixed fruit salad that some say was named after the ethnic confusion in Macedonia 100 years ago .
But serious scholars have not endorsed that theory .
So it is tempting to try to create a menu with east European historical overtones .
The starter might be Ottoman salad .
That would be lazily prepared and slovenly served , and crowned with the yellow part of a boiled egg ( the Ottoman yolk ) .
Its unlikely ingredients range from sharp Balkan paprikas to gelatinous Levantine sweetmeats .
It would stay on the table for ages , and some guests would end up picking bits out in order to create their own dishes ( Bulgarian crudités , perhaps ) .
Random offenders would be hauled off to the kitchen to spend a lifetime washing dishes , Janissary style .
The Hapsburger Auflauf ( stew : but Hungarians would call it a goulash ) would be equally varied but rather more successful , with Czech dumplings nestling quite snugly next to wisps of sauerkraut and paprika .
Romanov rissoles would be raw ( and bleeding ) , prepared with extraordinary incompetence and bashed about by a madman .
But they would be delicious compared with “ Steak a la Soviet ” ( often known colloquially as Lenin 's Revenge ) : this would be a revolting mixture of gristle and animal fodder , enough to keep you alive but wishing that you were dead .
Diners would hastily turn to the more appetising part of the menu .
Prague Spring Rolls would be a temptingly modern variation on traditional Czech cuisine , half - baked yet cooked with delightful enthusiasm by a kitchen crew of idealistic youngsters and hard - bitten types who have embraced nouvelle cuisine .
Sadly , a jackbooted waiter stamps them to smithereens before you have begun to enjoy them .
You then spend the next 20 years cleaning the restaurant windows .
Diners are told that Baltic Surprise is off the menu forever on seemingly dubious health grounds .
Old people insist that it used to be delicious , involving herring and fresh herbs , eaten at midsummer with a lot of beer and dancing .
Even trying to order it brings the threat that you will be locked in the cellar for life .
But diners who persist will find it served with a flourish , having been cooked secretly in the kitchen from a recipe bravely preserved in the attic .
Conversely , Kasha Putina ( Putin 's porridge ) is not on the menu either , though something is clearly cooking .
Russians maintain that they love it , but the neighbours find the smell a bit overpowering .
NEW YORK / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. banks that received billions of dollars of taxpayer money to bolster their capital could place bets on the same toxic assets that got them into trouble in the first place -- and with government support .
The trading price of $ 16.03 for Morgan Stanley ( MS ) rolls across the stock ticker on the Morgan Stanley headquarters building in New York 's Time 's Square September 18 , 2008 .

It is unclear whether U.S. regulators will prevent banks receiving government aid from participating as buyers in the $ 1 trillion Public - Private Investment Program ( PPIP ) designed to unclog credit markets and bank balance sheets .
But the program , where the government provides much of the financing and shoulders much of the risk , leaves open the prospect that banks , as well as private investors , could buy the troubled securities and loans .
This means recipients under the government ’s $ 700 billion bank bailout fund , the Troubled Asset Relief Program , might take part .
“ Without very strict regulation you ’re potentially creating big risks by allowing banks to buy toxic assets with house money , ” said Wayne Shaw , a professor at Southern Methodist University ’s Cox School of Business .
“ It ’s a terrible risk . ”
On Monday , Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack told employees his bank may buy toxic assets and package them for sale to individual investors , according to a person who heard him speak , but was not authorized to comment publicly .
Three days earlier , Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said his bank may join the PPIP as an investor .
Each of these banks took $ 10 billion from TARP .
The Financial Times said on Friday that Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co , which together took $ 70 billion of taxpayer money , might also buy toxic assets under the PPIP .
Neither returned calls seeking comment .
Two other large TARP recipients , Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co , had no immediate comment on their plans .
BACKLASH ?
U.S. regulators may be open to letting TARP recipients participate in the new program .
Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , said on a conference call with bankers last month that “ healthy banks will be able to participate on the investment side , not obviously on the assets you ’d be selling , ” a transcript on the FDIC website shows .
Regulators have suggested that letting banks share in the upside as prices of largely illiquid toxic assets rise could provide an incentive for them to sell their own assets at discounted prices .
Banks , for their part , have expressed concern that selling distressed assets at prices below their carrying value could punch a sizable hole in their depleted capital levels .
But a backlash could occur as weariness over using tax dollars to prop up an errant sector grows .
This reached a crescendo last month as Congress flayed American International Group Inc for awarding $ 165 million of bonuses to workers in a unit that brought the insurer to the brink of failure .
“ It ’s not a Democrat or Republican issue , it ’s a right or wrong issue , ” said Dan Alpert , an investment banker at Westwood Capital LLC in New York .
“ There are going to be voices who say this is ridiculous , we ’re giving them money with one hand and then with another hand .
But theoretically there is no reason to keep ( banks ) out of the market .
Their asset management arms have considerable asset aggregation capabilities . ”
Spencer Bachus , the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee , introduced a bill on Thursday to block TARP recipients from “ gaming ” the PPIP .
He said if banks “ are colluding to swap assets at inflated prices using taxpayers ’ dollars , the bailout cycle has sunk to a new level of absurdity . ”
The Alabama congressman is not alone .
“ I ’m worried about the following scenario :
You and I have troubled assets , I buy assets from you , you buy them from me , and at the end of the day it ends up suspiciously like you bought assets from yourself , ” said Lawrence White , a professor at New York University ’s Stern School of Business .
BEST USE OF MONEY
A rule adopted on Thursday by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to give banks greater freedom to value securities as they would in a normal market rather than at distressed or fire - sale prices , could complicate matters .
The problem : it could actually reduce the amount of assets that are sold , while failing to reduce toxic assets overall .
“ It might make some banks less willing to enter transactions if it were shown that the exit values they estimated were higher than they can actually realize , ” said Dennis Beresford , an accounting professor at the University of Georgia in Athens , and a former FASB chairman .
Regardless of how TARP recipients say they are using their bailout money , the perception will likely be that their participation in PPIP comes at the expense of what they should be doing more of in the first place : lending .
“ Do I want Citigroup using the PPIP to buy more toxic assets at a price that some other institution is willing to sell at ? ”
White asked .
“ It sure does n’t feel like the best use of Citi ’s money .
There are plenty of buyers such as hedge funds that can buy the assets and which do n’t necessarily make consumer loans or commercial and industrial loans . ”
If you 're one of the millions who dread the spring allergy season , things are looking up .
A research study appearing in the May 2009 issue of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology ( http://www. jleukbio. org ) shows how a team of American scientists have identified a previously unknown cellular switch that turns allergies and asthma both on and off .
Equally important , this study also suggests that at least for some people with asthma and allergies , their problems might be caused by genes that prevent this switch from working properly .
Taken together , this information is an important first step toward new medications that address the root causes of allergies , asthma and other similar diseases .
" This study uncovers some of the basic mechanisms that control whether or not people have asthma and allergies and the severity of the symptoms , " said John Ryan , Ph.D. , Professor of Biology at Virginia Commonwealth University , and a senior scientist involved in the research .
" This understanding opens new avenues for treating these and other related diseases . "
Ryan and colleagues made this discovery in mouse experiments that examined cells from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood that ultimately help create a type of immune cell ( mast cells ) .
Too many mast cells lead to an over - aggressive immune response , which causes allergies and asthma .
The scientists found that when chemicals ( cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 10 ) used to initiate an immune response ( the " on switch " ) are added to developing mast cells , the developing cells die .
Because bone marrow makes both mast cells and these cytokines , the researchers conclude that just as the cytokines serve as the " on switch " for the immune system , bone marrow cells also use them as the " off switch " to stop mast cells from getting out of hand .
Further supporting their discovery was the finding that strains of mice prone to allergies and asthma had genes which affected the production of this chemical " off switch " in their bone marrow .
" The immune system has an incredible capacity for balance and counterbalance to maintain optimal and properly tuned immune responses , " said John Wherry , Ph.D. , Deputy Editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology , " The studies by Ryan and colleagues are an excellent example of this inherent self - regulation of the immune system and how an imbalance in mast cell regulation could contribute to allergy and disease . "

The project was put out to tender this year and the department intends to roll out the new services , and the mobile app , from next year .
In the interim , a Transport spokeswoman said the department was working with independent application developers to give them easy access to bus , train and ferry timetable information " later this year " .
The powerful venom causes a sudden drop in blood pressure that sends the victim into shock
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Researchers have discovered that the bite of the world 's largest lizard , the Komodo dragon , is venomous .
The carnivorous beasts are unusual because they release their prey after biting them , apparently leaving the animals to bleed to death before eating them .
But many experts have claimed the victims die after being infected with bacteria that cover the lizards ' serrated teeth .
Komodo dragons live on several Indonesian islands and typically grow to 3 m long and weigh around 50kg .
They lie in wait for prey and ambush them by charging forwards with their jaws open .
The lizards can spend hours in one spot , waiting for wild boar , deer , goats and other large mammals to pass by .
Scientists at the University of Melbourne used computer models to investigate the strength of the lizards ' bite and found it was weak compared with other predators , such as the Australian saltwater crocodile .
But magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed complex venom glands in the dragons ' mouths that had never been documented before .
Bryan Fry , who led the team , surgically removed the glands from a terminally ill dragon in a zoo .
Tests showed they contained a similar poison to that found in Gila monsters and snakes , according to a report in Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences .
The powerful venom has a devastating effect on prey , causing a sudden drop in blood pressure that sends them into shock .
At the same time , the venom stops the victim 's blood clotting , so it bleeds to death .
The discovery suggests many more lizards may possess snake - like venom than previously thought .
Until recently , only two poisonous lizards were thought to exist , the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard .
Both live in southern US states and Mexico .
For a long while now ( even before Google Chrome was announced ) , Mozilla has been examining ways to make Firefox better by splitting the work of displaying web pages up among multiple processes .
There are several possible benefits of using multiple processes :
Increased stability : if a plugin or webpage tries to use all the processor , memory , or even crashes , a process can isolate that bad behavior from the rest of the browser .
Performance :
By splitting work up among multiple processes , the browser can make use of multiple processor cores available on modern desktop computers and the next generation of mobile processors .
The user interface can also be more responsive because it does n’t need to block on long - running web page activities .
Security :
If the operating system can run a process with lower privileges , the browser can isolate web pages from the rest of the computer , making it harder for attackers to infect a computer .
Now that we ’re basically done with Firefox 3.5 we ’ve formed a project team .
We ’re calling the project “ Electrolysis ” .
Because we ca n’t do everything at once , we are currently focusing on performance and stability ; using a security sandbox will be implemented after the initial release .
Details of the plan are available on the Mozilla wiki , but the outline is simple :
Sprint as fast as possible to get basic code working , running simple testcase plugins and content tabs in a separate process .
Fix the brokenness introduced in step one : shared networking , document navigation and link targeting , context menus and other UI functions , focus , drag and drop , and probably many other aspects of the code will need modifications .
Many of these tasks can be performed in parallel by multiple people .
Profile for performance , and fix extension compatibility to the extent possible .
Ship !
We ’re currently in the middle of stage one : Ben Turner and Chris Jones have borrowed the IPC message - passing and setup code from Chromium .
We even have some very simple plugins loading across the process boundary !
Most of the team is in Mountain View this week and we ’re sprinting to see if we can implement a very basic tab in a separate process today and tomorrow .
For the moment we ’re focusing on Windows and Linux , because the team is most familiar and comfortable on these environments .
I sat down with Josh Aas on Friday and we discussed some of the unknowns / difficulties faced on mac .
As soon as our initial sprint produces working code we ’d love to have help from interested mac hackers !
If you ’re interested in helping , or just lurking to see what ’s going on , the Electrolysis team is using the #content channel on IRC and the mozilla.dev.tech.dom newsgroup for technical discussions and progress updates .
We ’ll also cross-post important status updates to mozilla.dev.platform .
If you ’ve emailed me volunteering to help and I have n’t gotten back to you , I apologize !
Until we get the stage - one sprint done there are n’t really any self - contained tasks which can be done in parallel .
Back in March I presented at Qcon 2009 in London which is a great conference .
I also was interviewed which is now up on InfoQ .
TBH – it is n’t a bad interview yet at the time it felt awful right from the first moment when after agreeing the opening question before the camera rolled , I got asked something completely different :-)
Then it went pretty broad :-)
You can watch the video on the InfoQ site which includes a transcript .
The questions I was asked were :
Eric , what 's going to be coming up in .NET 4.0 Visual Studio 2010 ?
You ’ve mentioned Visual Basic - there is an impression that I 've personally heard in the software development environment that Visual Basic is not really at the same level as languages with curly braces like C# or Java .
What 's your perspective on that ?
You 've also mentioned F# as being one of the new in the box languages for .
NET 4.0 .
Is that also a part of the co-evolution ?
Is it going to start off with the same feature set ?
What would you like to see in future versions of .NET beyond 4.0 ?
Where do you think the focus should lie ?
You mentioned the Parallel library , which is upcoming in .NET 4.0 .
Can you describe that more detailed ?
One of the other things which you mentioned is Parallel and there is also the existing LINQ .
Is there a way to combine the 2 of those ?
You 've mentioned F# as an upcoming language , the inclusion of VB.
NET and C# .
You 've only had a brief mention of C ++.
Is that losing its focus ?
What exactly is Cloud Computing ?
Can you tell us a little bit more about Azure ?
How does
Azure compare against other Cloud offerings that are in the marketplace , such as the Amazons , for instance ?

Mr Justice Coleridge has been working in family law for 37 years , for the last eight years as a judge .
So it 's safe to say that he has seen a lot of warring families in his time , families in which the adults are so unable to put the needs of their children first that they prefer to drag their problems through the courts , each seeking the mediation of strangers , and – usually – a vindication of their own view accompanied by a satisfying rejection of that of their ghastly , impossible , former partner .
It 's not surprising , therefore , that he has developed a jaundiced view of the state of parenting in Britain , one that he expressed aggressively in a speech at parliament to the Family Holiday Association on Tuesday evening .
The judge wants a change of attitude that would attach a " stigma " to those who " destroy " family life and said that a National Commission should be established to devise solutions for the epidemic of broken homes .
" The reaffirmation of marriage as the gold standard , " he said , " would be a start . "
As if that was not quite clear enough , he added that he was referring to " the endless game of ' musical relationships ' or ' pass the partner ' , in which a significant proportion of the population is engaged .
" Children , " he added , " are caught up in the conflict of their parents ' unresolved relationship issues and it can leave them scarred , sometimes severely scarred , for life . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The judge was careful to say that people who live together as good parents , but are not married , deserve the same support as those who are .
He was careful also to say that he was not suggesting that people should be trapped in relationships that were genuinely unhappy or abusive .
All he was saying , really , was that people are mad to have children with one person , then decide that it would be more thrilling or exciting or self - fulfilling to pursue other romantic or sexual adventures with other people after all .
( Or even live life under the assumption that the having of children should not interfere with an entirely free and unencumbered life in the first place ) .
He 's right , of course .
How did we ever manage to reach a point where such observations are controversial , rather than self - evident ?
And how did we ever – since the Judge 's comments have been routinely reported as anti-Labour and pro-Conservative – reach a point where private moral issues became a means of party political point - scoring ?
Justice Coleridge answered that latter question , in part , himself : " Although , superficially , these are private issues , they become matters of public concern when they are happening on such a huge scale and affect detrimentally such a significant proportion of the population " .
The social problems related to the breakdown of the traditional family are now , and have been for years , just too big to ignore .
It might , to a person looking at the situation without knowledge of its history , seem odd that nanny New Labour , which likes to tell us all what to do , where to go and what to eat , is seen here as the laissez - faire party .
Usually it is the Conservatives who demand the rolling back of the state , but on this issue they call for much more meddling and manipulating .
Arch -Conservatives say that Labour defends " alternative lifestyles " because the breakdown of the family leads to reliance on the state , and Labour always wishes to expand its influence , and therefore its voting base , at the expense of all else .
The feminist left tells a different story , though – in which the old strictures of children - within - marriage meant the subjugation of female sexuality , the shunning of girls or women who were " caught " , and of their offspring , and the assumption that women were not even worth educating because after marriage they dedicated themselves entirely to husband and to children , giving up financial independence to do so .
It 's not marriage per se that the left is wary of .
It 's the imbalance of sacrifice that traditional ideas about marriage and sex also promulgated .
That is not to deny , however , that the wholesale jettisoning of such rigid discrimination has not created its own dreadful problems , problems that look most ugly when relaxed sexual and procreative mores are examined in a setting of poverty and ignorance .
Yet even now , after decades of feminism , the gender pay gap confirms that having children does indeed damage the financial independence and career ambitions of women , whatever their socio-economic status .
The studies illustrating that life is very hard on single mothers and their children , particularly in low - income households , are legion .
The amazing thing is that even though time and social change has amply illustrated how very demanding it is to bring up a child , people more than ever seem to tend to have children without much thought as to what this will mean in the future .
Could Justice Coleridge 's suggestion of a National Commission really result in the devising of a formula that would persuade people to think harder , be more aware of the commitment they ought to be making , and understand better the sacrifices that may be necessary before bringing up children well ?
Or actually , after all , was n't that just what the traditional process of courtship and marriage was , at its most benign , in place to do ?
At their most rarified and courtly – or nowadays among the most religiously observant of families – the rituals of courtship had distinct and stuffily useful stages .
A period of celibacy was expected , so that people could see how they got along when they could not close gaps in conversation with intercourse .
How many relationships break up because " the spark is gone " or " I just do n't fancy him any more " ?
Then there was engagement , a period when sexual compatibility could be tested , carefully , while financial and practical arrangements for married life were made .
Again , pretty sensible , and sensible too to bail out if you got cold feet .
The theory was that all this faffing about gave people time to think about what they were letting themselves in for , and form a picture of what family life might be like .
The reality was that as society became more sophisticated , the imagined family life , for educated women , looked more and more like a straightjacket .
Put simply , the less that women were prepared to give up life outside the home , and put up with any sort of awful behaviour , for marriage , the less appealing the institution became to men as well .
Justice Coleridge 's reading of the situation – whereby men and women are too keen on sexual adventure , and not keen enough on married life – is too simplistic .
Many things are wrong , but a huge part of the problem is that great emphasis has been put on minimising the difficulties mothers may face in obtaining childcare so that the can stay in the labour market , and little emphasis has been placed on the idea that for families to thrive and be happy , parents generally have to expect to spend quite a bit of time at home , looking after each other , as well as the kids .
Post - female liberation , that means that fathers must expect to spend more time at home , in order that women can spend less time at home .
In the absence of such a societal shift , couples are buckling under the strain and the grind of family life .
If marriage is to be the " gold standard ' , then " stigma " must attach to fathers who expect their careers or social lives to remain unchanged by the arrival of a family .
At the moment , such stigma as there is , still attaches to working , partying , globe - trotting or reality - show contesting mothers , and only in the most gross of circumstances to similarly detached dads .

Mather Corgan , president of HotPads , gave a great talk on how HotPads uses AWS to run their real estate search engine .
I loved the presentation for a few reasons :
It gives real costs on on their servers , how many servers they have , what they are used for , and exactly how they use S2 , EBS , CloudFront and other AWS services .
This is great information for anybody trying to architect a system and wondering where to run it .
HotPads is a " real " application .
It 's a small company and at 4.5 million page - views / month it 's large but not super large .
It has custom server side components like indexing engines , image processing , and background database update engines for syncing new real estate data .
And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements .
This a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with their applications .
Their total costs are about $ 11 K / month , which is about what they were paying at their previous provider .
I found this is a little surprising as I thought the cloud would be more expensive , but they only pay for what they need instead of having to over provision for transient uses like testing .
And some servers are n't necessary anymore as EBS handles backups so database slave servers are no longer required .
There are lots more lessons like this that I 've abstracted down below .

Costs
EC2 - $ 7400 / month - run 20 of various size instances at anyone time .
Most work is in the background processing of images , not web serving .
* $ 150 : 2 Small HAProxy Load Balancers - 2 for failover , these have the elastic IPs , round robin DNS point at the elastic IPs .
* $ 1,200 : 3 - 5 Large Tomcat Web Servers - an array of 3 run at night and 5 during the day .
* $ 1,500 : 5 Large Tomcat Job Servers
* $ 900 : 1 X - Large 1 Large Index Server - used to power property search and have several GB of RAM for the JVM
* $ 1,200 : 1 X - Large 2 Large MySQL masters
* $ 1,200 : 1 X - Large 2 Large MySQL slaves
* $ 300 : 1 Large Messaging Server ActiveMQ - will be replaced with SQS
* $ 300 : 1 Large Map tile creation servers Tilecache
* $ 600 : Development / testing / migration / servers
S3 - $ 1500 / month - few hundred million objects for files for maps and real - estate listing photos .
4TB of database backup stored as EBS diffs ( $ 600 / month ) .
Elastic Block Storage - $ 500 / month
CloudFront - $ 460 / month - is used to serve static files and map files throughout the world .
It serves static files , map tiles , and listing photos .
Elastic IP Addresses - $ 8 / month
RightScale - $ 500 / month - used for management and deployment .
Lessons Learned
Major reason for choosing EC2 was the cloud API which allows adding servers at any time .
In their previous hosting service they had to prepay for a month at a time so they would order the minimum necessary to get by that month .
That does n't leave room for servers for development , test , preview servers for customers or making live database servers upgrades ( which requires 2 x servers ) ?
Overall cost is about the same as with previous hosting site but the overall speed of development and ease of management is night and day different .
Getting more servers and lots more flexibility .
HotPads is a small company and does n't think added trouble of colocation is n't worth it for them yet .
Advantage of Amazon over something like Google App Engine is that Amazon allows you to innovate by building your own services on your own machines .
S3 is better for larger objects because for small files that are not viewed often the cost of puts outweighs everything .
Not a cache to use for short lived objects because the put costs start to dominate .
* For a 67 KB object ( 600 px image ) which is where the cost of putting an image into S3 equals the cost of storing it there and about equal the cost of storing it once .
* For a 6.7 KB object ( 15 px thumb nail ) the put ( small fee for putting an object into S3 ) cost is 10 x the storage transfer costs .
Costs have to figured into the algorithms you use .
* In April 330 GB of images downloaded at $ .15 / GB cost $ 49 .
55 mm GETs at $ 1 / mm cost $ 55 .
42 mm PUTs at $ 1/1 k cost $ 420 !
* $ 100 download and GETs of maptiles .
* So S3 very cheap for larger files , watch out for lots of short lived small files .
CloudFront is 10 times faster than S3 but is more expensive for infrequently viewed files .
* Makes frequently viewed listings faster .
* For infrequently viewed listings the CloudFront has to go to S3 to get the file the first time which means you have to pay twice for a file that will be viewed only once .
EBS
* Used on database servers because it 's faster than local storage ( especially for random writes ) , blocks of data redundant , and supports easy backups and versioning via cloning .
* Only 10 % cost overhead .
* Allowed them to get rid of second set of slaves because the backups were so CPU intensive they had to have slaves to do the backups .
EBS allows snapshots of running drives so the extra slaves are unnecessary .
* Databases are I/O bound and the CPU is vastly underutilized so there 's extra capacity when you need it .
SimpleDB - not using , pretty proprietary .
May be of value because you only pay for what you use given how under utilized your own database servers can be .
Reserved Instances
* 1 year for the cost of 6 months and guaranteed ( denied one time ) to get an instance .
* Con is tied to an instance type and they want more flexibility to choose instance types as their software changes and take advantage of new instance types as they are released .
Despite the hardships of creating a new studio after being fired from his old one , Tomonobu Itagaki has apparently bounced back and is more than ready to talk smack about his fellow developers .
And one person in particular , Hideki Kamiya , is under Itagaki ’s scrutiny .
“ If I made a similar game as a game I made in the company I quit , people would say , ‘ What an idiot , ca n ’t he make anything else ? ’
Well , that is more or less the opinion I have for , uh , that Bayo - something game . ”
Kamiya is the world - renowned creator of Devil May Cry and upcoming action title Bayonetta .
And Bayonetta ’s character design did n’t go over too kindly with Itagaki either during his E3 interview with 1UP .
“ Covered in hair , is she ?
I dunno , Mr. Kamiya must have a lot going through his head .
Well , in any case , I would first recommend laser eye surgery .
I ’m sure he ’s not that strapped for cash , right ? ”

Of all the recent celebrity deaths , the only one I ’ve really cared about is Billy Mays .
As the comic states , I was in sales for 10 years and I did fancy myself an inventor when I was younger .
I have notebooks full of “ inventions ” that I hoped would one day be sold on TV or in stores .
Both of these aspects of my past made me instantly respect Billy Mays .
From a sales - guy perspective I recognize that he busted his ass traveling with trade shows to make a living for his family and eventually , through perseverance and perfecting his craft , he made it big .
I appreciate the “ self made man ” entrepreneurial spirit that he epitomized .
From a wannabe - inventor stand point , I have to praise him for giving average workshop and garage tinkerers like me the opportunity to bring their products to market and make their fortunes .
These sentiments might seem odd coming from me if you only know me as a webcomic artist , but you ca n’t do a job for 10 years without learning to love it ( or aspects of it ) just a bit .
That ’s a side of me people do n’t often see , but it ’s there .
I guess I feel like Billy and I were kindred spirits in that respect .
Plus I tend to “ project ” when I talk , which he made into an art form .
I ’ve really been enjoying his show “ Pitchmen ” on Discovery .
I would assume the show ’s future is uncertain at this point , but I encourage you to watch the first season to see what a kind and talented man Billy was .
If you have any warm thoughts to share about Billy Mays , I also encourage you to share them with his son , Billy Mays III on twitter at @youngbillymays .
He ’s obviously having one of the worst weeks of his life , but he ’s been saying that the kind tweets from Billy ’s fans are cheering him up .
Godspeed , Billy .
HALIFAX–Almost 30,000 right whales cruised the coasts of New Zealand while sharks were so plentiful they darkened waters off England 200 years ago , according to an ambitious project that has traced the history and worrisome decline of several marine species .
For the first time , scientists from around the world have developed a picture of what oceans looked like centuries ago , showing how most species started to decline in abundance as fisheries took hold .
The research , which took 10 years and is part of the Census of Marine Life 's animal population project , gives a distressing look at how fish stocks began dropping off when fishing pressures intensified as early as 1000 AD and moved offshore .
Where 27,000 southern right whales plied New Zealand waters before whaling began in the early 1800s , only 25 females were left in 1925 .
" Whenever we look at the large fish – the whales – we get a picture that 300 years ago they would have been 10 times as abundant as they are today , " Poul Holm , a marine scientist at Dublin 's Trinity College , said in an interview .
" In some regions they 've been totally fished out , so we 're heading down a really blind alley if we continue that way . "
Using an eclectic mix of data sources , including fisheries logbooks , tax accounts , mounted trophies and even restaurant menus , researchers chronicled different species ' location , size and abundance .
They found that as fish stocks thinned out closer to shore in the 11th century , fishermen looked further out to sea , developing new boats and equipment in the 1500s that allowed them to move to deeper waters .
Things changed dramatically a century later when pairs of boats began dragging a net behind them to scoop up as much as possible .
By the middle ages , Europeans were eating deep - sea species caught with a hook and line .
" The impact of fisheries were felt much earlier than anyone had thought previously , " said Holm , whose findings are being presented this week at a convention in Vancouver .
" This was before the onset of modern technology . "
The scientists claim they found Greek and Latin verse from the second century AD that suggests Romans began trawling with nets , while they can date fishing to the Middle Stone Age – 10 times earlier than once thought .
They also traced periwinkle snails and rockweed in ballast on ships headed from England to Nova Scotia in the mid-1800s , making it one of the first invasive species in North America .
And trophy reef fish caught in Key West , Fla. , shrank dramatically over 50 years because of intense fishing pressure , going from 20 kilograms in 1956 to 2.3 kilograms in 2007 .
Marine biologists are particularly concerned about fishing 's relentless reach as boats move further offshore in search of fish , leaving only one per cent of the world 's oceans virtually untouched .
" We 've run out of geography , " Ron O'Dor , of the Census of Marine Life , said in Halifax .
" We 've really exploited every place of the world and we can't really go out anywhere else . "
" We just have to figure out how to manage the resources effectively . "
Most fishing activity used to take place in the northern hemisphere , but has extended to the southern region as stocks are depleted and recovery is slow , if at all .
Using what Holm called a " gold mining " approach to fishing where you clean out one area and move on to the next , he says nine - tenths of the top marine food web has been fished out . "
But the research also found signs of recovery , with some species of seals and otters restoring their populations to healthy levels after protective measures have been introduced .
In California , hunting restrictions have helped bring the population up to 2,000 sea otters after it was reduced to 54 .
Heike Lotze , a researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax , said bans on harvesting and restrictions on fishing areas have helped bring some back from the brink of extinction .
" It just needs a really concerted effort and often legal action , and you really need to reduce exploitation and protect habitats , " she said .
Effective health - care reform must meet two objectives : 1 ) It must secure coverage for all Americans , and 2 ) it must dramatically lower the cost of health care .
Health - care spending has outpaced the rise in all other consumer spending by nearly a factor of three since 1980 , increasing to 18 % of GDP in 2009 from 9 % of GDP .
This disturbing trend will not change regardless of who pays these costs -- government or the private sector -- unless we can find a way to improve the health of our citizens .
Failure to do so will make American companies less competitive in the global marketplace , increase taxes , and undermine our economy .

WASHINGTON , June 6 ( UPI ) -- Pakistan diverted U.S. aid meant for fighting Taliban terrorists to bolster its conventional warfare capabilities against India , documents indicate .
U.S. Defense Department documents accessed by the Press Trust of India reveal Islamabad secretly diverted a substantial portion of nearly $ 7 billion in foreign military financing and arms sales from the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush to beef up its armed forces along the Indian border instead of fighting terrorists .

PTI quoted the Pentagon documents as saying that a major portion of post - Sept. 11 , 2001 , U.S. military aid meant to counter advances made by the Taliban and al - Qaida in Pakistan 's northwest was instead used to buy and refurbish eight P - 3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft , worth $ 474 million .
Islamabad also placed orders for 5,250 TOW anti-armor missiles worth $ 186 million with the aid , the news agency said , adding that 2,007 of missiles have already been delivered and the rest are on the way .
The Pope , who also celebrated mass in Manger Square in front of the ancient Church of the Nativity , believed to mark the birthplace of Jesus , sent a message of solidarity with moderate Palestinians such as Mahmoud Abbas , the Fatah leader and president of the Palestinian national authority , when he gave his support to proposals for a " two - state solution " .
We want to introduce to you one of our Team Tachyon XC Riders , Rich Derousse out of Germany .
Rich has raced everything from 125 cc GP racers to full blown 1000 cc unlimited machines .
He ’s also had the opportunity to race this variety of machinery in multiple countries to include the US , Japan , and the European Union !
Rich ’s goal is to eventually become a “ true ” international rider by obtaining an FIM International A license .
He was very close to achieving this goal in Japan , but work forced him to leave before he was able to collect the necessary standings in the MFJ .
What inspires you to compete ?
By nature I am a pretty passive guy .
My day job is programming computers so not much excitement there .
In order to make up for the lack of excitement in my job , I race .
So that and the fact that I like to let others talk major smack in the pits and away from the track … just to make it all the more sweeter when I tuck it inside them going into a corner or just blasting past them on the exits . ; )
Describe your style …
I ’d have to say my style is much like the Japanese martial arts or kata .
Makes sense , I suppose , since I spent 5yrs training with Japan ’s fastest riders while I lived there .
They like to look at things like the martial arts .
Every part of your body is connected to another .
If one part moves , it moves or affects the other parts .
They think the same thing applies when riding a motorcycle .
The motorcycle becomes an extension of your body and all movements must flow and work together in a balanced fashion ; which most often results in smooth and controlled riding styles .
The only draw back is I never look as cool as those guys “ backing it in ” or getting “ loose ” in the corners .
How ’s Life Treating You ?
I ’d have to say that life is treating me VERY well .
Aside from those world - class riders , I do n’t think there are many others who can say they ’ve had the opportunity to race at most of the world ’s most famous circuits .

The mass unrest in the garment industry continued on Monday ( 29 June ) for a third day ...
On the outskirts of Dhaka , the capital city , in the industrial zone ; workers ' rioting and demonstrations yesterday escalated to new heights .
As thousands of workers gathered in the morning , at 10 am a group set off towards the nearby Dhaka Export Processing Zone where many garment factories are located .
Police blocked their way and fierce fighting began - in the pitched battle police teargas and rubber bullets left 100 workers injured .
Other workers soon joined the protesters and informed them that work was continuing as normal at the Hamim Group factory complex .
Twenty thousand workers began to march towards the complex .
As the numbers of protesters in the area swelled to 50,000 the security forces were simply overwhelmed ; the Dhaka District Superintendent of Police said ; " An additional 400 policemen stood guard in front of the major factories .
We tried our best to disperse the crowd , but they were too many and too fierce . ”
There are reports that some workers at the Hamim complex tried to defend the factory and clashed with the demonstrators as they approached ( presumably reluctant to sacrifice their workplace to the greater cause - though whether these workers were garment workers or factory security and / or management personnel is unknown ) .
The approaching protesters were said to be angry that these workers had failed to join the weekend protests over the killing of two garment workers shot by cops - and that the factory owners had , unlike other bosses , continued operating since the shootings .
The workers split into smaller groups and stormed the complex at around 10.15 am .
They sprinkled the buildings with petrol ; a sweater factory , three garment factories , two washing factories , two fabric storehouses ... over 8,000 machines , a huge quantity of readymade garments , fabrics , three buses , two pickup vans , two microbuses and one motorbike were all reduced to ashes .
The crowd was thinking strategically .
Once the buildings were ablaze some workers returned to the highway and blockaded the road ; consequently , the fire services were unable to reach the blaze for several hours until 3.30 pm - by which time the buildings were burnt to the ground .
Meanwhile , groups drawn from some of the other 50,000 workers and participants ( undoubtably other sympathetic non-garment workers and slum dwellers would have been drawn in ) roamed the area and attacked and vandalised another 50 factories and 20 vehicles .
Thick black smoke could be seen across the city .
Though in public statements the garment bosses have been attempting to maintain international confidence by playing up the continued economic health of the industry it seems that some companies are beginning to feel the pinch of the economic crisis .
One report suggests that
The current global meltdown had a background part to play in the whole thing as scores of factories turned sick due to reduced orders .
Low and delayed wage payments following the recession also helped trigger the unrest ...
Many factory owners had truncated their workforce to be more competitive against their international competitors , industry insiders said .
( Daily Star - 30 June 09 )
The factory in Ashulia 's S. Suhi Industrial Park , where the dispute that sparked this unrest began ( 1 ) , laid off most of its workers and sold to a new owner in February due to a decline in orders from international buyers .
Laid off workers had apparently been regularly agitating for re-employment at the unused factory at a higher wage rate ;
The closure of the units of S Suhi Industrial Park Ltd was mainly responsible for the latest labour unrest in garment factories in Ashulia and Savar areas , a number of garment workers claimed .
Pretty Group in March started production only with the sweater - manufacturing unit and kept the five other units of the former S Suhi Industrial Park closed .
Around 1,000 out - of - work workers of the five units were mounting pressure on the new management to restart those units soon , said garment workers .
The workers of the closed units along with other ill - paid workers of some nearby factories , which are not doing so well , started a movement to reopen the units and raise salary of workers , they said .
Failing to get their jobs back , they started to unite and threaten to halt production in other factories unless the former S Suhi units are reopened , a worker of Ha -Meem Group said requesting anonymity .
( Daily Star - 30 June 09 )
But the new owners denied this , none too convincingly ;
Manjur Rahman , manager and company secretary of Pretty Group , claimed that this labour unrest had neither anything to do with his factory nor was it triggered from his factory .
In fact , the truth is probably a little more subtle - the Pretty Group dispute was the spark that set off an explosion waiting to happen .
The global economic crisis increases already pressured working conditions , decline in real wages / purchasing power due to inflation and actual or threatened unemployment ; in Bangladesh a decline in income is a short step away from hunger and starvation ; many garment workers are already permanently malnourished ( as described here ; http://libcom.org/news/bangladesh-militarized-factory-visions-devouring-...).
Where this workers ' movement goes from here is anybody 's guess .
But the ruling class is worried it may spread to the south - eastern port city of Chittagong , another smaller center of the garment industry , with 700 factories .
Security has been beefed up with special surveillance over the Chittagong city ’s apparel sectors as tension brewed here against the backdrop of violence in the garment factories in Dhaka , police officials and garments association leaders said on Monday .
Nothing is resolved .
Watch this space ...

Over the past ten years the preservation of mid-century architecture has become a cultural fixation .
If a house by R.M. Schindler went on the market today , a five - alarm rescue operation would follow .
If anything , architects like Richard Neutra and Paul Rudolph carry more cache today than when they practiced .
Their contemporaries in landscape architecture ?
Not so much .
How many of us have even heard of masters like Dan Kiley who designed the Miller Garden in Columbus , Indiana ( photo above ) ?
Of the more than 80,000 properties on the National Register of Historic Places , fewer than 1,900 have an element of landscape .
The irony is that mid-century architecture tended to emphasize the indoor - outdoor aspect , but preservationists largely ignore the outdoor portion of the sites .
Why do Americans value buildings , but not landscapes ?
For whatever reason , we tend to see open space as a blank spot waiting for development .
For too many of us , designed landscapes means dog runs , cafés , and skateboard ramps .
It ’s hard to make the case for saving Modernist landscapes like the NationsBank Plaza in Tampa ( above ) because they depart from the convention of the pretty , pastoral scene fixed in our minds by Frederick Law Olmsted .

Blog , September 30 , 2020
Fall 2020 is here , and the latest release of Phonexia speech and voice recognition technologies is out .
Let ’s explore the exciting enhancements that our R&D team spent the whole summer working on !
Dear Cecil :
My buddies and I have been considering ( while drinking ) the idea of becoming " airship pilots . "
I put this in quotation marks because we cannot find any information on how this ( possibly fictitious ) profession could be pursued .
We have looked into both purchasing an airship and gaining the credentials to pilot one .
We cannot find any information beyond stuff about owning amateur hot air balloons .
We are frustrated ( and possibly drunk ) and desperately need to know a few things only you can answer .
First , how do you obtain pilot status for an airship ?
And second , how can we buy our own airship , zeppelin , or dirigible ?
The three " airship captains "
Cecil replies :
Fictitious ?
What makes you think airship piloting is fictitious ?
You think those are monkeys flying the Goodyear blimp ?
In fact an entire federal department , the Federal Aviation Administration , is charged with making sure airships and other airborne craft are operated by qualified personnel , as opposed to , no offense , a bunch of drunks .
If you still want to do this once you sober up , here ’s how .
For technical consultation I turned to a longtime Straight Dope reader and private pilot who calls herself Broomstick .
She pointed out that according to federal regulations you do n’t need a pilot ’s license to build or fly an aircraft that ( a ) is made for one occupant , ( b ) carries no more than five gallons of fuel , ( c ) ca n’t go faster than 55 knots in level flight , and ( d ) has an empty weight of 254 pounds or less .
There are a few other restrictions : day operation only , no flights over congested areas or crowds , etc .
You do n’t even need flying lessons , although I ’d advise against going aloft with no clue at all .
Without too much prep work , therefore , you could maybe get away with flying a Larry Walters - style lawn - chair - and - weather - balloons rig out in the middle of nowhere .
( Southern Los Angeles , in case you ’re thinking about re-creating Larry ’s flight path , does n’t qualify as the middle of nowhere . )
But that ’s probably dinkier than what you had in mind .
So we escalate .
To pilot a real airship you ’re going to need some certification , such as a sport pilot license with a “ lighter - than - air category rating with an airship class rating . ”
In addition to basic pilot training ( i.e. , in flying a plane ) , this requires about 20 hours of airship flight training , with 3 hours as pilot in command .
It ’s technically possible to get a sport pilot license for airships only , but good luck finding an airship instructor willing to take on someone with no pilot certification and most likely no flight experience .
However you swing it , the license lets you fly during the day with one passenger aboard .
Alternatively you could get a private pilot license for airships , which is similar to the sport pilot license but requires more training and skills .
You ’d need to fulfill the same basic requirements as pilots of fixed - wing aircraft , which include medical certification .
But maybe you wo n’t be happy with anything short of flying the 192 - foot Goodyear blimp .
Now you need a commercial pilot certificate , and that ’s going to be a project .
I wo n’t list all the necessary qualifications , but you ’re looking at 200 hours of total flight time , including 30 as pilot in command , 40 of instrument flight time , and 5 of night visual flight time .
Again , it ’s possible to start with no flying experience and work your way up to hovering over football stadiums strictly by flying airships , but it ’s unlikely .
For one thing , there are n’t a lot of schools that teach commercial airship flying , and those outfits that do are free to set high standards for applicants .
Goodyear , which runs its own program , says it ’s only interested in licensed fixed - wing pilots with commercial instrument and multi-engine ratings .
I ’ll wager this is n’t what you wanted to hear , but Broomstick thinks the easiest route to airship captaincy is getting a fixed - wing pilot ’s license , then adding airship certification later .
Now : getting hold of an airship to fly .
We tried calling Goodyear about blimp rental , but they repeatedly blew us off — too many yo - yos drunk - dialing at 2 AM , probably .
However , we found a place called Airship Ventures near San Francisco that will rent you an honest - to - Jesus 246 - foot - long Zeppelin NT for $ 5,750 per hour including crew .
If you want to do a little piloting , they offer a day - long program that includes ground school and some stick time starting at $ 3,500 — but you need your private pilot ’s license first .
Full - on pilot certification for the NT ( includes extensive training plus trips to Germany for simulator work and such ) will cost about $ 100,000 in fees and expenses .
Finally , to buy your own Zeppelin - brand zeppelin and associated ground systems , figure you ’ll be out about € 12 million , or roughly $ 15 million .
OK , maybe you could get one for a tad less in this economy , but face it , kids — with that money you could buy a lot of beer .

Enlarge By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY Diana Kim , of Fairfax , Va. , is sure not to smile as she gets her driver 's license photo taken .
Virginia uses face - recognition software that wo n't allow for smiles on IDs .
Stopping driver 's license fraud is no laughing matter :
Four states are ordering people to wipe the grins off their faces in their license photos .
" Neutral facial expressions " are required at departments of motor vehicles ( DMVs ) in Arkansas , Indiana , Nevada and Virginia .
That means you can't smile , or smile very much .
Other states may follow .
LICENSE FRAUD : States take steps to cut down fake IDs
The serious poses are urged by DMVs that have installed high - tech software that compares a new license photo with others that have already been shot .
When a new photo seems to match an existing one , the software sends alarms that someone may be trying to assume another driver 's identity .
But there 's a wrinkle in the technology : a person 's grin .
Face - recognition software can fail to match two photos of the same person if facial expressions differ in each photo , says Carnegie Mellon University robotics professor Takeo Kanade .
Dull expressions " make the comparison process more accurate , " says Karen Chappell , deputy commissioner of the Virginia DMV , whose no -smile policy took effect in March .
Elaine Mullen of Great Falls , Va. , bristled at the policy while renewing her license until she heard the reasoning .
" It 's probably safer from a national - security point of view , " she says .
Arkansas , Indiana and Nevada allow slight smiles .
" You just ca n't grin really large , " Arkansas driver services chief Tonie Shields says .
A total of 31 states do computerized matching of driver 's license photos and three others are considering it , says the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators .
Most say their software matches faces regardless of expressions .
" People can smile here in Pennsylvania , " state Transportation Department spokesman Craig Yetter says .
In Illinois , photo matching has stopped 6,000 people from getting fraudulent licenses since the technology was launched in 1999 , says Beth Langen , the state head of Drivers Services .

It is probable that the time may come when you want a babysitter to look after your kids while you spend some quality time with your significant other .
Or you may just need a break so that you can go relax on your own .
A good first choice may be a relative ; grandma or grandpa — or even aunts or uncles — may be willing to help out .
However , a relative may not be an option .
In that case , you will have to look outside your family , and choosing a babysitter for your kids can be a daunting task .
You want someone you can trust , and that means that it is a good idea to take some time to find a competent babysitter that gets along with your kids , and has some experience with children — as well as knowledge of how to handle simple emergencies .
Looking for a babysitter
One of the best ways to get an idea of who would make a good babysitter is to ask friends and family .
Get recommendations from people you know .
You can also check at your church , community center and local schools .
Many community education programs now offer babysitting courses and certifications .
These courses often teach babysitters First Aid and CPR , how to handle emergencies and basic care of children .
Choosing a babysitter that has been through such courses can help provide you with peace of mind .
Check references from babysitters , and find out how many kids the sitter can handle at one time ( and compare that to how many children you have ) .
Also get rates .
Babysitting rates vary according to area , the training and certifications the sitter has , as well as how many children you have , the kinds of things you expect of the babysitter and the time of day s/he will be caring for your children .
Compare different rates from different sitters .
You should also consider recommendations and training ; sometimes it is worth it to pay a little more to know that your child is in good hands .
Choosing a babysitter
Interview prospective babysitters .
Invite the sitter over to meet your children and interact with them for 20 to 30 minutes .
Observe how the sitter plays with your children , and ask questions about what the sitter would do in an emergency situation .
If you are looking for a sitter than will be able to drive your children to occasional activities , or pick them up , load everyone up and take a short drive to assess your sitter ’s abilities .
It is vital that you and your sitter get along , and that the babysitter gets along with your children .
You also want to make sure that your sitter is open to your parenting techniques , and can handle your children .
After you have chosen a sitter
When you decide on a sitter , you will need to work out the terms of his or her employment .
This is especially important if you expect to have your sitter come regularly .
Discuss rates and times that you expect the sitter .
Agree upon a regular schedule ( if needed ) .
If you do not plan to have regular need of a sitter , it is a good idea to have two or three sitters in mind so that if your preferred sitter is unavailable , you have a fall back plan .
You can even ask your sitter for recommendations in such cases .
It is a good idea to call a sitter at least two days ahead of time so that s/he has ample warning that services are needed .
( And you can call someone else if your first choice is unavailable . )
The first time a sitter comes to care for your children , plan for him or her to arrive early .
This will allow you time to go over the house rules with the sitter , and to let your caregiver know how to contact you should the need arise .
Having the sitter come early can also be beneficial in that it allows him or her to start playing with your children , occupying them before you leave .
This can help you avoid painful departure scenes .
It is not a bad idea to call partway through the evening the first time that your sitter watches your children .
When you return home , get a debriefing from the sitter about how things went .
Make sure that , if there were problems , you talk to your children later about proper behavior while with the sitter .
Here are some basic considerations when choosing a babysitter for your kids :
Does the sitter show reasonable maturity and a sense of responsibility ?
Does the sitter demonstrate good judgment and common sense ?
Does the sitter have a friendly personality ?
Does s/he get along with you and your kids ?
Is the sitter organized and neat ?
Does the sitter have some sort of certification or training in CPR / First Aid or some sort of babysitting course ?
Do you trust the sitter with your children ?
In the end , you have to take a babysitter on faith to a certain extent .
But as s/he proves competent , you will begin to feel safer about leaving your children with him or her .

I just hope this is n’t a sign of things to come , like having a black President who was a professional wrestler or being forced to drink Brawndo because it has electrolytes .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is expected to combine a call for calm tomorrow with a warning of severe consequences if protests continue over last week 's " stolen " presidential election .
Khamenei 's address , to be made during Friday prayers at Tehran University , will be carefully scrutinised for clues as to how the Islamic regime plans to proceed a week after the disputed poll triggered the worst unrest since the 1979 revolution .
It follows another day of massive protests in the streets of the capital , with tens of thousands of supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he won the election , marching silently to mourn those killed since the shock announcement last Saturday that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won a second four - year term .
Protesters wearing black , carrying candles and chanting " Allahu Akbar " ( God is greatest ) gathered in Imam Khomeini Square in the town centre as Mousavi addressed crowds through a loudspeaker .
Security forces did not intervene .
Some Tehranis distributed bottles of water to protesters , thirsty in the 34C heat .
Many wore black in respect for those killed earlier in the week .
Some carried white flowers or photographs of the dead .
Mousavi appeared at 6 pm local time and encouraged demonstrators to persist with their silent protests .
Supporters shouted " Ya Hossein , Mir Hossein , " as police helicopters whirred overhead ; some in the crowd showed them the victory sign .
Some shops in the city closed or placed black cloth over their doors as a symbol of condolence .
Bazaar workers in Tehran and the city of Tabriz were reported to be on strike in protest at the election result .
As in previous days , the march was met with light police presence as authorities rely increasingly on the Basij militia .
" Basij are feared by Iranians – nobody really understands how they operate .
They do what they like , " said a female protester .
The Basij have responded violently to what they see as a foreign - backed attempt to unseat the Islamic Republic .
Late at night , they roar through the streets on motorcycles searching for protesters returning home from daytime demonstrations .
Basij checkpoints are common at night , where bearded men search cars and beat suspects .
Late on Wednesday night , Basij allegedly stormed Tehran University 's dormitories , wielding knives and stabbing four students , according to students on the scene .
" The government does n't want to be blamed for the violence , so they use the Basij instead , " said the female protester .
Mousavi has sent a letter of protest to Iran 's state national security council complaining of plain - clothes agents using sticks , metal rods and firearms to " attack the lines of peaceful participants before the arrival of the security forces " .
He condemned the arrests of his allies .
The crackdown by the authorities continued today with the arrest of more reformist leaders , who were reportedly taken to secret locations in the city .
According to AUTNews , a student website , the entire chemistry department at Tehran 's Sharif university – one of the country 's most prestigious institutions – resigned en masse in protest against " the recent crimes and attacks " .
The move came after the earlier resignation of some 120 lecturers at Tehran university and academic staff at Amirkabir university .
Analysts and diplomats say tomorrow 's appearance by Khamenei could be a crucial moment for the regime after it has seemed confused , offering concessions on the one hand and repression on the other .
Mousavi's response to the supreme leader 's address will be crucial .
It remains unclear whether he and his supporters will be satisfied with the " recount " being conducted by Iran 's main electoral authority , the guardian council , which plays a key supervisory role .
The council said it had begun " careful examination " of 646 complaints .
Objections include a shortage of ballot papers , pressure on voters and the barring of candidates ' representatives from polling stations .
Ahmadinejad was declared winner with 63 % of the vote against 34 % for Mousavi , who wants the vote annulled .
The council has said it is ready only to recount disputed ballot boxes but Mousavi and fellow candidates Mehdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezaei have been told they can raise objections at a special council meeting on Saturday .
It was reported , meanwhile , that two children of the conservative former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who openly backs Mousavi , had been barred from leaving Iran .
Rafsanjani 's daughter Faezeh addressed Mousavi supporters on Tuesday .
Hardline students called for her and her brother , Mehdi , to be arrested .
Diplomats said they see worrying signs that Iran is looking to falsely implicate western governments and Israel in the unrest .
Iran 's Intelligence Ministry said it uncovered a foreign - linked terrorist plot to plant bombs in mosques and crowded places in Tehran on election day .
The exiled former Iranian president , Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , predicted that the trouble would go on .
" It is going to continue in one way or another , " he said in Paris .
" The conscience of this people has condemned the regime .
That 's quite certain and anyone can see it . "
Pro-Mousavi protests have also been reported in the cities of Isfahan , Rasht , Orumiyeh , Zanjan and Zahedan .
First organic food -- free of pesticides -- had the spotlight .
Then consumers learned about buying cosmetics without parabens .
Just last month Minnesota banned the chemical Bisphenol - A ( BPA ) from baby bottles and sippy cups .
The mounting health cautions might seem tedious -- does every little thing cause cancer ? -- but a common thread weaves through the concerns .
Numerous everyday products are made with chemicals that may disrupt people 's endocrine system , which is also known as the hormone system .
A quick primer :
The endocrine system is responsible for brain and nervous system development , reproduction , metabolism and blood sugar .
Hormones , including estrogen and testosterone , are like messengers moving through the body , telling receptors on cells what to do .
The problem is that many chemicals -- called endocrine disruptors -- mimic hormones .
They attach to receptors and cause cell division , altered gene expression and other harmful changes .
Chemicals enter the body and environment in many ways .
Ingredients in lotion and lipstick seep into the skin and bloodstream .
Pesticides , food additives and chemicals in packaging make their way in when people eat .
Weedkillers and fertilizer sprayed on lawns end up in waterways .
Endocrine disruptors have been blamed for playing a role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , autism , cancer , diabetes , earlier puberty , immune problems , obesity and infertility .
" I think everyone is a little stunned that we have all these chemicals in the environment that have the potential to cause harm , " said Deborah Swackhamer , an environmental health professor at the University of Minnesota .
" Hormones at very small doses regulate just about everything , and if you 've got chemicals that can mimic that , they can mess with growth , behavior and development . "
Swackhamer pointed to research near the state - of - the - art St. Paul wastewater treatment plant .
Although it 's impressive that the plant removes up to 90 percent of environmental estrogens ( one type of endocrine disruptor ) , male fish swimming in outgoing treated waters have taken on female characteristics .
Environmental estrogens are one of the most common endocrine disruptors .
Birth control pills , BPA and metals that leak from old cell phones and batteries are all considered environmental estrogens .
Suzanne Snedeker , associate director of Cornell University 's Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors , said that although exposure levels can be very low in many consumer products , cumulative and combined effects may increase breast cancer risk .
Estrogen exposure signals cells to divide and aids breast tumor growth , she said .
Researchers at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) , a part of the National Institutes of Health , found that when mice were exposed to the chemical DES , their grandchildren were more likely to develop tumors .
" A growing body of evidence suggests that numerous chemicals , both natural and manmade , may interfere with the endocrine system and produce adverse effects in humans , wildlife , fish or birds , " states an NIEHS document .
DDT , DES , PCBs , dioxin and some pesticides are undisputed human endocrine disruptors .
But when it comes to many other chemicals , proving effects on human is slow or difficult .
There are questions about how to translate wildlife and animal research to humans , what exposure level is acceptable and who should pay for reducing these chemicals .
Time for reform
The complexity may partly explain why agencies like the FDA and EPA , which regulate food , food packaging , water and air , have n't done more .
Also , the EPA said the Toxic Substances Control Act ( TSCA ) of 1976 created " high legal and procedural hurdles " that make it " difficult [...] to limit or ban chemicals found to cause unreasonable risks to human health or the environment . "
The EPA added that their new administrator , Lisa Jackson , indicated chemical management is one of her top five priorities and that there 's " a growing consensus that the time has come for TSCA reform . "
According to the FDA , there has n't been sufficient data to show that more restrictions are needed .
Although some agencies and government scientists are pushing forward , " there is sort of a lag , " said Renee Sharp , director of the Environmental Working Group 's California office .
Sharp said government regulators can get so caught up in scientific footnotes that they miss the larger picture and fail to move forward .
For example , when studies on BPA came out nearly a decade ago , Japan swiftly removed it from food and soda can lining , and the European Union and Canada have also restricted its use .
Higher BPA concentration in urine was linked to greater risk for cardiovascular problems and diabetes , according to a study published last fall in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
But the FDA still has n't restricted use of the chemical .
Theo Colborn , an environmental health analyst and founder of the nonprofit Endocrine Disruption Exchange , blames that partly on recent decisionmakers at the FDA and EPA , who she said were more interested in protecting industries .
" [ Regulation ] threatens the bottom line at many corporations , " she said .
Sharp said industries attempt to " manufacture doubt " about the severity of endocrine disruption .
" It 's industry doing their typical strategy , reminiscent of tobacco and global warming . "
Calls to the American Chemistry Council , which represents many of the companies that manufacture or sell products with suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals , were not returned .
Consumers will drive change
Many people say protections are coming .
" I think we can expect to see that chemicals will be evaluated differently moving forward , " said Linda Birnbaum , director of the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program .
" There are many chemicals we have n't yet asked the question [ of whether they might disrupt the endocrine system ] . "
And consumers today are more deliberate with purchases , Swackhamer said .
" I 'm very impressed with people 's awareness and knowledge and concern , " she said .
Very good interesting piece .
I am no way shape or form of an electronics junkie , but i am more like a jack of all trades and a master of none type .
I have a dual power TS - 100 hand held calculator where the second digit was pixelated I would say .
I googled how to repair it and seen your story .
I took my calculator apart and the back side is where that glue strip is at .
I could not find my heat gun , thanks to having to move it for the Christmas tree setup .
I used my Kitchen Propane stove front burner and waived it over it a few times .
It took a few tries but I finally was able to get the dead pixel back .
One good thing is the calculator was on so in between heat ups and eraser rubbings I could see my progress and man your fix really worked .
Thanks fro the story .
My favorite pocket calculator is fixed once again .
I wish I would have taken before and after photos , but was too giddy to try your repair idea .
The finalization of the licensing agreement for the Advanced Access Content System DRM scheme used for Blu-ray discs comes with an analog sunset , and also means the long - promised " managed copy " feature will ( hopefully ) be coming as early as next year .
The managed copy feature is designed to allow an owner to make at least one full - resolution backup copy of AACS - protected content .
It has been a mandatory part of the Blu-ray specification since 2005 , and we were told that support was coming by the end of 2007 .
Of course , that was contingent on the finalized AACS licensing agreement , which was just published earlier this month .
AACS licensees have until the end of this year to sign the agreement , and due to a number of factors support wo n't likely be available until sometime early next year .
Among those issues is the fact that current Blu-ray hardware does n't support managed copy , and most likely can't be enabled by a firmware upgrade , so it will mean at a minimum a hardware upgrade for users to take advantage of the feature .
Also , capable Blu-ray devices will have to be able to connect to an authorization server to track whether a managed copy has been made , or if the number of copies made has reached the allowable limit .
Those servers are n't expected to be online until sometime in the first quarter of 2010 .
And finally , content providers have to encode a URL to the necessary authorization server when mastering the disc .
" We think that consumers really do want the ability to use their content flexibly , " AACS - LA chair Michael Ayers told Video Business .
It 's almost an insult to obviousness to say that Ayers is stating the obvious .
DVD ripping software , home theater PCs , and place - shifting devices like the Slingbox are all ample evidence of that .
But managed copy comes with its own nest of problems for consumers .
While AACS licensees are required to enable managed copy capabilities into all newly produced discs , there is no way to enable it for discs consumers already own .
And there is actually no requirement for new hardware to support the feature , though Andy Parsons , US chairman of the Blu-ray Disc Association Promotions Committee and senior vice president of product planning at Pioneer Home Entertainment thinks consumer demand will compel device manufacturers to include the feature .
Furthermore , content providers are only required to allow a user to make one copy .
Studios can , at their discretion , enable more copies , but they can also charge for each copy , even the one required allowable backup copy .
Any backup copies made are required to have DRM on them .
And the only formats currently allowable are an AACS - encrypted Blu-ray disc , a CSS - encrypted DVD , and / or a WindowsMedia DRM - encrypted digital file .
One thing that the managed copy system does not seem to address is what happens if the original disc becomes damaged , and your backup is your only copy ?
It does n't appear that a user will be able to back up the backup .
In the case of a physical disc copy , it leaves the user right back at square one : she hopes the original never deteriorates or gets damaged ( we 've all got enough experience with optical discs to know how that goes ) or she 'll have to go right back to using disc - ripping software .
As far as users of non-WindowsMedia devices are concerned , Ayers seems to hope that Apple will file an application to join in the AACS licensing fun and make FairPlay - protected , iTunes - compatible files available as an option , but we 're not holding our breath on that one .
As a result , the millions of iPod , iPhone , iTunes , and even AppleTV users will be tempted to use ripping software or peer - to - peer networks to get digital copies to use the way they want to .
You can count on the small yet significant minority of Linux users doing the same as well .
So , managed copy is finally coming , if just a few years late , and , as is always the case with DRM , it will also end up being a few notches short of consumer expectations .
The 2009 Corvette ZR1 is one of the best bang for the buck cars in existence today .
At an MSRP of just $ 106,620 , this American muscle car is actually an affordable “ supercar ” that can hold its own against exotics like the Lamborghini Gallardo and Ferrari F430 — rides that cost two and three times as much .
So , if you are the bully on the block with lots of raw power and aggression and not a lot of refinement , who ’s your competition really ?
MotorTrend editor Arthur St. Antoine decided that the Corvette ZR1 needed to pick on someone in a different class entirely , an F / A - 18 Hornet fighter jet from the famous stunt team , the Blue Devils .
This is a great matchup .
In one corner you have the Corvette ZR1 capable of 638 hp and a 0 - 60 mph time of just 3.3 seconds and in the other a fighter plane with 32,000 pounds of forward thrust with a top speed of Mach 1.8 .
Vette vs Jet. Blue Devil vs Blue Angel .
Who will come out on top ?

NASA 's Shuttle Program Hands Over Launch Pad to Constellation
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . --
The May 31 transfer of Launch Pad 39B at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida from the Space Shuttle Program to the Constellation Program is the next step in preparing the first flight test of the agency 's next - generation spacecraft and launch system .
The Constellation Program is developing new spacecraft -- including the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles , the Orion crew capsule , and the Altair lunar lander -- to carry humans to the International Space Station , the moon and beyond .
Since the late 1960s , pad B has been instrumental in human spaceflight programs , such as Apollo , Skylab and the space shuttle .
The pad originally was built for the Saturn V rockets to launch the Apollo capsules to the moon .
In July 1975 , the pad was modified to support space shuttle operations .
The first space shuttle to lift off from pad B was Challenger in January 1986 .
The handover took place Sunday after space shuttle Endeavour was moved to Launch Pad 39A .
The ground operations team will finish modifying pad B for the Ares I - X rocket launch .
Modifications will include removing the orbiter access arm and a section of the gaseous oxygen vent arm and installing access platforms and a vehicle stabilization system .
The Ares I - X flight test is targeted for no earlier than Aug. 30 .

When Daley administration officials announced in December that they were leasing out the city 's parking meters for nearly $ 1.16 billion over 75 years to a consortium of investors headed by Morgan Stanley , they assured the media and anyone else who asked that this was a great deal for taxpayers in economic hard times .
Yet not three months later administration officials inadvertently revealed to an alderman that the potential revenue from the meters was as much as four times more than what the city got for them .
By then the city had already given the Morgan Stanley consortium , known as Chicago Parking Meters LLC , the authority to raise rates and extend hours .
Though the city technically retained final say over meter placement and pricing , any changes to their lease agreement , such as reducing the number of meters or even their hours of operation , would cost taxpayers big money in penalties — potentially more in just the next few years than the city had been paid .
How the value of the meter system shot up in a matter of weeks — or , to consider the more logical alternative , why the city agreed to lease it for far less than it was worth — is a question the administration still can't or wo n't answer , five months after the City Council consummated the deal .
In fairness , even critics of the deal concede that trying to project the value of 36,000 parking meters is hardly a straightforward task .
There are n't really any models , since no municipality has ever forged a deal quite like this .
Because the agreement is supposed to last so long , the financial projections are complicated and by necessity somewhat speculative .
But the city has made things murkier by resisting the release of information showing how it determined what would be a fair price .
And the little it 's released so far suggests the deal was structured to benefit Morgan Stanley and the current occupants of City Hall rather than Chicago 's taxpayers .
For much of the past decade the meters have brought in about $ 20 million a year , costing $ 3 million to $ 4 million a year to maintain .
But as the economy began to cool in fall 2007 , the administration proposed a series of fee and tax hikes for the next year 's budget .
Among them was a doubling of parking meter rates : in documents released publicly in October 2007 , city officials predicted the hike would boost meter revenues from about $ 22 million in 2007 to $ 56 million in 2008 .
Aldermen protested that the increase would be bad for business .
The administration eventually pulled it off the table , but it was n't the victory for the common man that it might have seemed at the time .
The proposal now looks a lot like a maneuver by the city to boost the value of the meters while persuading aldermen it would be better to let a private company raise the rates and take the heat .
On October 17 , 2007 , Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed reported that a source had told her that " a super secret deal is afoot at City Hall .
. . .
Sneed is told Mayor Daley 's fiscal advisers are working on a deal to privatize the city 's parking meters , which could potentially reap 1 BILLION bucks for the cash - strapped city . "
Sneed went on : " The sweetener to the deal is already on the books : a provision to raise the parking meter rates , which is clearly a carrot for whomever buys the meters . "
Her source also told her the city had already hired legal and financial advisers to help work out a deal .
On February 8 , 2008 , the city announced that it was looking for qualified firms interested in leasing the meters .
In words that would come back to haunt him , Paul Volpe , Daley 's chief financial officer at the time , said a private company would do a better job of running the meter system .
He said the lease would probably last 50 years .
DePaul professor H. Woods Bowman , an expert in public finance who in the early 90s served as chief financial officer of Cook County , says the idea did n't make much sense to him .
" The argument in favor of selling public assets is that a lot of the assets are n't tied to the core functions of the government , or that there are cost inefficiencies associated with them , " he says .
" Parking [ policy ] ought to be a core function of the city , and there are no appreciable operating efficiencies to be gained here .
It only costs the city a couple of million dollars a year to run the system . "
But the Daley administration , interested in the cash it could get up front , quietly pushed ahead with the bidding process , which yielded just two offers .
Along the way neither Daley nor his staffers commented publicly on the pending lease .
There were no hearings on the value of the meters as a revenue producer or as a tool to shape traffic or parking policy .
When budget time came around again last fall , the city was in an even tougher spot than it had been a year earlier , with a deficit approaching half a billion dollars .
Administration officials proposed setting off $ 150 million of it with proceeds from the proposed meter lease but offered few specifics .
In one closed - door budget meeting , Volpe was asked for more details , and " he threw out $ 2 billion " as a rough estimate of what the city might get in the deal , says Scott Waguespack , alderman of the 32nd Ward .
But Volpe , he says , emphasized that the bidding process was n't complete .
The administration made no other pronouncements on the subject until the December 2 press conference where they announced the deal .
Two days after that the council met to consider the agreement .
" The most important thing is that we have these funds when we need them most , " Volpe told aldermen .
The aldermen did n't discuss whether $ 1.16 billion was a fair price or what the administration had done to analyze the meters ' value .
But several indicated that they wanted to make sure they 'd still have a say in deciding where meters went in their wards and what hours they 're in operation .
Volpe said they would , though there was a caveat : " If we remove too many the payout to the city will be reduced . "
By their own admission , most of the aldermen at the meeting had not seen the proposed contract , but it probably would n't have clarified matters — the formula it offers for determining what the city would lose in these circumstances is based on a complicated set of calculations involving " the then current Metered Parking Fee , Period of Operation , Period of Stay , Rate to Fine Multiple Factor and Expected Utilization Rate . "
Even without this information , the city council voted 40 - 5 to approve the deal , and within weeks Chicago Parking Meters as much as quadrupled hourly rates at meters all over town , igniting outrage among motorists .
Waguespack , one of the five nay votes , says he dinged the deal for a number of reasons , including a not - baseless hunch that the city had given up too much for too little .
Two of his staffers had used their training in finance to calculate a range of projections for what Chicago Parking Meters would collect over the next 75 years .
They concluded that under most scenarios the meters were worth between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion .
Administration officials told Waguespack that his numbers were way off , but they did n't show him any of their own — until he attempted to change parking policies in his own ward in early February , days before the new rates went into effect .
For a couple years the rookie alderman had been working with Bucktown residents on a congestion and parking plan for stretches of Milwaukee , North , and Damen .
When Chicago Parking Meters took control of the system , the company announced that the hours for all of the meters in the area would be extended — going from 9 AM - 6 PM Monday through Saturday to 8 AM - 9 PM seven days a week .
Waguespack decided it was in the best interest of businesses and residents to stick with the old schedule for 270 of those meters .
After all , he had been told this was his prerogative as alderman .
When he notified the Department of Revenue , though , deputies to commissioner Bea Reyna - Hickey told him the city would have to return money to Chicago Parking Meters to account for the loss of revenue : $ 162,334 in the first year , $ 202,918 in the second , and $ 243,501 in the third , or $ 608,753 total .
Waguespack , who considers himself a budget watchdog , felt he had to back down .
But the information was revealing .
It confirmed that Chicago Parking Meters assumed its revenues would go up each year .
If the middle number can then be seen as a conservative base , it means the company puts a value of $ 202,918 on 519,480 hours of meter use ( 37 hours a week per meter x 270 meters x 52 weeks a year ) , or about 39 cents an hour .
For 36,000 meters that works out to more than $ 66 million a year — and nearly $ 5 billion over the life of the agreement .
Some meters elsewhere in the city may not generate as much money , but others , such as those in the Loop , could be expected to yield more .
Plus , it 's likely that more parking spaces will be added to the system as the company switches from meters to pay boxes .
Even if investment costs and inflation knocked the total value down by an astronomical amount — say 50 percent — that would still suggest the city got less than half what the system was worth .
" When it comes to finding a figure for the citizens of Chicago , they say the meters are worth $ 1.16 billion , " says Waguespack .
" But when it comes to finding a figure to cover Morgan Stanley , they say they 're worth , what , $ 5 billion ?
Who are they looking out for , the residents or Morgan Stanley ? "
On February 25 , we submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city seeking " copies of all materials and correspondence submitted by bidders or potential bidders " and " copies of all analysis , correspondence , memoranda , or other documentation related to the city 's evaluation and concession - awarding process . "
On April 3 , after weeks of back and forth , budget department spokesman Pete Scales let us know our materials were ready .
But what he gave us did n't include any financial analysis , which meant that either budget officials had n't done any or they had n't fully complied with our request .
The state FOIA law requires that " each public body or head of a public body denying a request for public records shall notify by letter the person making the request of the decision to deny such , the reasons for the denial , and the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial . "
On April 14 we sent another request asking specifically for " records showing how the city analyzed the financial costs and benefits of entering into a lease agreement . "
Two weeks later Scales e-mailed to tell us he had some more materials for us .
We asked why they had n't been included the first time around .
He said he would check with other officials and get back to us ; a week later he had n't yet .
The new documents offered only minimal evidence of financial analysis by the city .
Among them were a series of meeting agendas that suggested city officials had met separately with representatives of eight interested firms and , after greetings and " refreshments , " had asked them to review their qualifications , explain why they " would be a good partner for the City of Chicago , " and lay out " what concession terms will be most important in maximizing the value of the concession . "
No record of the firms ' responses is provided .
Other records show that the city hired Chicago - based investment firm William Blair & Company as a consultant on the leasing process .
On April 22 , 2008 , William Blair representatives presented city officials with a " Summary of Preliminary Valuation " — a sketch of what the meters might be worth on the market .
The analysis , which is labeled confidential on every page , notes that at that point in time each meter collected 47 cents an hour , on average — a figure higher than the one used to calculate penalties in the 32nd Ward .
It also discusses plans to raise rates by as much as 700 percent ( from 25 cents an hour to $ 2 ) by 2013 .
But because any private investor would have to borrow big sums of money to finance a long - term deal , pay corporate taxes , and make capital investments , Blair concluded that the " estimated value of the Chicago On - Street Parking System is approximately $ 1 billion . "
It would n't be free money .
" Value is linked to control , " Blair advised .
" Maximizing prepaid rent depends on the City 's willingness to concede its interest in future revenues derived from its System . "
In other words , the more money the city wanted up front , the less control it would have over the next 75 years .
That 's the kind of mind - set that galls Bowman .
" Blair is doing this from the point of view of the investor , " he said when we showed him the analysis , noting that the firm factored in costs like taxes that the city would n't be responsible for .
" They should have done this from the city 's point of view too .
I mean , if you 're going to put this on the market , you want to know what it 's worth .
But to see what the city 's leaving on the table you need to check the differences .
I guarantee you the value would be higher for the city . "
Only two of those eight firms followed through with bids .
On November 21 , 2008 , according to a two - page meeting agenda obtained from the city , Volpe , Reyna - Hickey , former Daley chief of staff Lori Healey ( now president of Chicago 's Olympic bid committee ) , and other administration officials gathered to review the bids in a 29th - floor conference room in the Adams Street offices of William Blair & Company .
The process started with Jim McDonald , a lawyer for the city , taking a look at the bid packages .
Then . . . we do n't know .
On our copy of the agenda almost a full page of bullet points is blacked out .
We later learned that both bidders — Morgan Stanley and a partnership led by Macquarie Capital Group , one of the investors that leased the Skyway in 2005 — offered about $ 1 billion , right around what Blair had pegged as the " estimated value " of the meters .
Scales , the budget department spokesman , says the bids were so close together that the city asked both firms to go through a second round : " Per the bidding rules , when two bids came in within 10 percent of each other , the City acted on its right to ask for a best and final bid from each .
This is a common practice in these transactions , and it ensures the city receives the highest possible value for the asset . "
About two weeks later , records show , the same city officials met in the same conference room to go over the final bids .
McDonald was again charged with reviewing the bids , and again we do n't know what else the process consisted of , since the second half of the agenda we received is also blacked out .
That afternoon Morgan Stanley was declared the winner with an offer of $ 1,156,500,000 , topping the Macquarie group 's $ 1,019,022,803 .
Bowman says his " back of the envelope " calculations suggest the city might have been able to get as much as $ 3 billion for the meters , though he admits there are so many variables that projections are basically a " crapshoot . "
And he says that just proves his point that the city should n't have privatized this asset at all .
" What the investors are interested in is the ability to set fees .
The city has traditionally had trouble doing it , " because it 's politically unpopular to raise meter rates .
But that 's hardly a reason to sell the whole system off .
" There 's nothing that the lessor is going to do to raise money that the city could n't do itself without a little moxie , " says Bowman .
Worse , he adds , is that the Daley administration appears to have given very little thought to the long - term consequences of the deal .
City officials have promised to set aside enough money to replenish the $ 20 million per year that the meters have generated over the past few years — but that 's a fraction of what Chicago Parking Meters will reap starting this year and not half what the city estimated , in its withdrawn proposal from 2007 , that it could collect by raising rates on its own .
By privatizing the meters , the city has created at least a $ 30 million gap in its annual budget that it will have to fill with other taxes , fee hikes , or service cuts .
So as taxpayers spend more to park on city streets , they 'll likely get worse city services in return .
" For the next 75 years we have to live on the money we 're getting now , " Bowman notes .
" There is no growth built into the money stream .
Down the road it 's going to put increasing pressure on city budgets . "
Meanwhile , officials with the city and Chicago Parking Meters want you to know there 's good news for people who use the meters .
LAZ Parking , the firm hired by Chicago Parking Meters to oversee day - to - day operations of the system , has been aggressively replacing old , poorly functioning meters with new parking boxes , so that by the end of the summer drivers around the city will be able to pay the soaring meter rates with their credit cards .
" CPM , through its operational partner LAZ Parking , " Scales announced in a press release , " has successfully addressed the majority of the issues associated with the transition of the metered parking system . "
Not everyone 's convinced .
At a hearing on Monday , five and a half months after the council approved the deal , angry aldermen fired questions at officials from Chicago Parking Meters , LAZ , and Morgan Stanley .
A couple even demanded that city lawyers determine whether the contract can be terminated .
They vowed to take the matter up again soon , once they have more information — including copies of the contract itself , which , incredibly , none of the aldermen present had seen yet .
Testimony at the hearing confirmed that the City Council had voted before receiving a substantive analysis of what the meters were worth and what leasing them out for 75 years might cost .
At one point alderman Helen Shiller asked Fred Pollock , an executive with Morgan Stanley , to explain how much more money they expected to collect this year through rate hikes and the switch to pay boxes .
" I would like to know what assumptions you made when you were looking at this deal , " she said .
" Some of the assumptions you 've asked for are proprietary , " Pollock told her .
" We do n't want to share those pieces of information — it 's valuable to us as a business in terms of other transactions we may pursue . "
Shiller impatiently cut him short a few times .
" Some of us , at least , were under the impression that we would have flexibility and we would be able to make changes and make it work based on the needs of our community , " she said .
" We then discover , any time we raise any questions about making changes , that oh no , we 're either going to lose money or we can't because it 's not in this agreement . "
Pollock said he understood her need for information and would find a way to tell her what the costs would be of changes to the meters in her ward .

What happened this time is that the anger at the regime had reached such a level  because of near - 20 percent unemployment and a rising youth population tired of seeing their life ’s options limited by theocrats  that given a choice between a dark black regime candidate and a light black regime candidate , millions of Iranians turned out for light black : Mr. Moussavi .
The Iranian people turned the regime man into their own candidate , and he seems to have been transformed by them .
That is why the regime panicked and stole the election .
The playwright Tom Stoppard once observed that democracy is not the voting , “ it ’s the counting . ”
Iran ’s mullahs were always ready to allow voting , as long as the counting did n’t matter , because a regime man was always going to win .
But what happened this time was that in the little crack of space that the regime had to allow for even a faux election , some kind of counter - revolution was born .
Yes , its leader , Mr. Moussavi , surely is less liberal than most of his followers .
But just his lighter shade of black attracted and unleashed so much pent - up frustration and hope for change among many Iranians that he became an independent candidate and , thus , his votes simply could not be counted  because they were not just a vote for him , but were a referendum against the entire regime .
But now , having voted with their ballots , Iranians who want a change will have to vote again with their bodies .
A regime like Iran ’s can only be brought down or changed if enough Iranians vote as they did in 1979  in the street .
That is what the regime fears most , because then it either has to shoot its own people or cede power .
That is why it was no accident that the “ supreme leader , ” Ayatollah Khamenei , warned protestors in his Friday speech that “ street challenge is not acceptable . ”
That ’s a man who knows how he got his job .
And so the gauntlet is now thrown down .
If the reformers want change , they are going to have to form a leadership , lay out their vision for Iran and keep voting in the streets  over and over and over .
Only if they keep showing up with their bodies , and by so doing saying to their regime “ we can not be bought and we will not be cowed , ” will their ballots be made to count .
I am rooting for them and fearing for them .
Any real moderation of Iran ’s leadership would have a hugely positive effect on the Middle East .
But we and the reformers must have no illusions about the bullets and barrels they are up against .
Writers have always been the victims of a cruel stereotype .
In movies , and in books , they have been portrayed as luckless , lost souls who live in poverty and never win the love of the women they desire .
This pitiful image of writers may be true of some but not all , however a film would never hold the viewers attention for very long if it was about a normal man living a normal life .
With a plethora of films about writers , our fascination with these creative beings seems unending .
Here are some of the best films ever made about writers .
1. Wonder Boys
One of the most unforgettable dramas , Wonder Boys is a great story about a writer facing a myriad of problems .
The unfortunate and somewhat depressing character Professor Grady Tripp is played by Michael Douglas .
His wife leaves him , he has yet to finish his next book which is already over 2,000 pages long and his mistress , the chancellor of the college , falls pregnant with his child .
In addition to this he becomes involved in a crime when his student James Leer , played by Tobey Maguire , kills the chancellor ’s dog and steals her husband ’s most prized possession - a jacket worn by Marilyn Monroe on her wedding day .
Based on a novel by Michael Chabon , Wonder Boys is highly entertaining with its twists and more importantly its intriguing characters .
Starring : Michael Douglas , Tobey Maguire , Robert Downey Jr. , Katie Holmes
Released : 2000
2. Shakespeare in Love
This critically acclaimed romantic comedy won several Academy Awards in 1999 and is deservedly one of the best films about a writer .
It makes no pretences of being historically accurate , even though several of the characters did indeed exist .
Shakespeare , played by Joseph Fiennes , is suffering from writer ’s block that is until he finds his muse in Viola de Lesseps , played by Gwyneth Paltrow .
As with any good love story , the plot is filled with dramas preventing the two lovebirds from being together .
It is witty and is slightly facetious with its references to the Bards works .
Light - hearted and almost believable , the script is brilliantly written and the actors superb in their performances .
Starring : Joseph Fiennes , Gwyneth Paltrow , Judi Dench , Tom Wilkinson
Released : 1998
3. Kafka
This movie is inspired by the works of Franz Kafka , the renowned fiction writer of books such as The Metamorphosis and The Trial , however it is not an actual portrayal of the man ’s life .
Played by Jeremy Irons , Kafka is an insurance clerk during the day , while writing his stories in his spare time .
Fate finds him becoming involved an underground organisation when he investigates a conspiracy after a colleague mysteriously disappears .
There is a foreboding atmosphere throughout as the story exposes a web of deceit and crime .
The cinematography is brilliant , while the story is strong , mixing excerpts from Kafka ’s works as well as true events .
It is not your standard crime story but certainly one to watch .
Starring : Jeremy Irons
Released : 1991
4. Shadowlands
Based on the true life romance between British writer C.S. Lewis , played by Anthony Hopkins , and divorced American poet Joy Gresham , played by Debra Winger .
The movie begins with Lewis , the author of such classics as The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , who has a comfortable life but also a loveless one .
He meets and marries Gresham , however this was a marriage of convenience enabling her to remain in England .
Slowly they fall in love and when they learn of her cancer , Lewis ’s world shatters .
Shadowlands is powerful and emotional as it explores and reveals their love and personal growth as they cope with her terminal cancer and inevitable death .
Starring : Anthony Hopkins , Debra Winger
Released : 1994
5. Adaptation
One of the most completely original screenplays written , Adaptation is humorous and thought - provoking at times .
Charlie Kaufmann is a screenwriter hired to adapt a book called ‘ The Orchid Thief ’ , by Susan Orlean , based on exotic plant collector John Laroche .
As Charlie struggles with the adaptation , he enlists the help his twin brother Donald who is an ambitious screenwriter .
The story becomes more and more entertaining through a series of mishaps and discoveries and it is totally unpredictable .
Nicolas Cage is completely brilliant in the role of both Charlie and Donald ; while Meryl Streep , who plays Susan Orlean , shows her true talent as a comedic actress .
Starring : Nicolas Cage , Meryl Streep
Released : 2002
6. Barton Fink
Set in 1941 , John Turturro plays Barton Fink , a young playwright from New York who is hired to write scripts for a movie studio in Hollywood .
His life is turned upside down as he finds himself living in a fleabag hotel and is struck with writer ’s block .
The situation is worsened by continual interruptions by his next door neighbour , an insurance salesman played by John Goodman .
The film ’s plot takes on a new direction when Fink discovers the corpse of Audrey Taylor next to him the morning after they have made love .
Barton
Fink is utterly brilliant as it contains elements of comedy , film noir and horror but like most Coen films it does not fit into any distinct film genre .
Starring : John Turturro , John Goodman
Released : 1991
7. Wilde
The movie is based on the biography of Oscar Wilde by Richard Ellman .
The film explores the life and troubles of the famous poet and playwright who wrestles with his homosexual desires during his marriage to Constance Lloyd .
He eventually has a very public affair with a vain young man called Lord Alfred Douglas which results in his imprisonment .
With superb performances by Stephen Fry who plays Wilde , and Jude Law who plays Douglas , the film is a compelling watch as you follow the tragic life of this genius from his rise to fame to his imprisonment and unjust demise .
Starring : Stephen Fry , Jude Law , Vanessa Redgrave , Michael Sheen
Released : 1997
8. Capote
This biographical film follows the events that took place during Truman Capote ’s investigation and writing of the book , In Cold Blood .

Initially the police are uncooperative in assisting Capote in his investigation and in his desire to interview the murderers ; however he befriends the lead investigator , Alvin Dewey and gains access to the murderers .
Capote both recounts the dramatic events through the trial and eventual hanging of the convicted and it reveals the personal dramas and conflicts with Capote .
It is riveting film and Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered an outstanding performance , well deserving of his Academy Award for this role .
Starring : Philip Seymour Hoffman
Released : 2005
9. Quills
Geoffrey Rush plays the Marquis de Sade in this disturbing fictional tale .
Although there was a Marquis de Sade , this film is not a historical retelling and is purely fictional .
Incarcerated in the asylum at Charenton and forbidden to write his sadist and what is perceived to be evil books , the Marquis refuses to stop publishing and uses any means possible to write his manuscripts .
This incendiary literature is smuggled out of the asylum by laundress Madeleine LeClerc ( Kate Winslet ) and subsequently published .
When his latest work , Justine , achieves great success on the black market , the authorities do all they can to destroy all the copies of the book and to silence the Marquis .
Starring : Geoffrey Rush , Kate Winslet , Joaquin Phoenix , Michael Caine
Released : 2000
10 . Finding Neverland
This beautiful and compelling story is based on the play , The Man Who Was Peter Pan , by Allen Knee .
It is semi-biographical and tells of the events in James Matthew Barrie ’s life which inspired him to write the children ’s classic , Peter Pan .
Following the poor reception of his latest play , Barrie ( Johnny Depp ) meets the Sylvia Llewelyn Davies ( Kate Winslet ) and her children in a park and befriends them .
He finds inspiration for his new play , Peter Pan , by playing the Llewelyn Davies children but unfortunately his attachment to the family is met with condemnation by Sylvia ’s mother and his own marriage ends in divorce .
This film is a perfect blend of fantasy and reality .
Starring : Johnny Depp , Kate Winslet
Released : 2004

Not only is Kellermann 's methodology flawed , but using the same approach for violent deaths in the home not involving a firearm , the risk factor more than doubles from 43 to 1 , to 99 to 1 .
Let 's see why this 43 to 1 ratio is a meaningless indicator of gun ownership risk .
Although this study was published in 1986 its findings continue to be uncritically cited in medical journals , government publications , and non-technical periodicals such as health newsletters , general interest magazines , op - ed pieces , letters - to - the editor , etc .
The oft cited Kellermann paper found a homeowner 's gun was 43 times more likely to kill a family member , friend , or acquaintence , than it was used to kill someone in self - defense .
Kellermann stated , " for every case of self - protection homicide involving a firearm kept in the home , there were 1.3 accidental deaths , 4.6 criminal homicides , and 37 suicides involving firearms . "
Florida State University professor Gary Kleck appropriately terms these ratios " nonsensical . "
( Targeting Guns : Firearms and Their Control , pp. 177-179 , 1997 )
Some papers in the medical literature have written a homeowner 's gun is more likely to kill its owner or family member than kill a criminal , and therefore " the advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned . "
The most notable ( or notorious ) , and quoted in the previous sentence , is written by doctors Arthur Kellermann and Don Reay , and is titled , " Protection or peril ?
An analysis of firearms related deaths in the home . "
( New Engl J Med 1986 .
314 : 1557-60 . )
First we need to understand how the ratio was derived .
Kellermann tabulated gunshot deaths occurring in King County , Washington , from 1978 to 1983 .
Table 1 below is taken from Kellermann 's paper ( Table 3 on p. 1559 ) .
Table 1 . Classification of 398 Gunshot Deaths involving a Firearm Kept in the Home
Type of Death No. Unintentional deaths 12 Criminal homicide 41 Suicide 333 Unknown 3 Total 389 Self - protection homicide 9
As we see from Table 1 , a ratio of 389 violent deaths to 9 justifiable homicides gives us the famous 43 to 1 ratio .
Let 's apply the same methodology to non -gun deaths and non -gun self - protection homicides in the home , for King County , Washington .
Table 2 . Estimation of Violent Deaths in the Home Not Involving a Firearm
Type of Death No. Unintentional deaths 0 Criminal homicide1 50 Suicide2 347 Unknown 0 Total 397 Self - protection homicide3 4
This ratio of 397 non - gun violent deaths to 4 justifiable homicides reduces to 99 to 1 .
So having applied Kellermann 's methodology to non-firearm violent death , the risk factor more than doubles from 43 to 1 , to 99 to 1 .
Please note , the purpose of this exercise is not to show that using a gun in the home is better than not using one .
This exercise does no such thing .
It is merely to show how deeply flawed Kellermann 's study really is .
Further , a number of tremendously important factors are left unaccounted .
For example , another way of looking at it is , more martial artists are probably murdered by non -gun methods than they kill in self - defense .
Would we conclude that it is best to avoid learning a martial art for self - defense based on such a " nonsense ratio ? "
Regardless of how the number crunching had turned - out between gun and non -gun violent deaths in the home , we should be able to see that Kellermann 's approach contributes nothing towards establishing a general or personal risk factor for a gun in the home .
What is truly sad about the nonsense - ratio is how often it is cited and uncritically accepted .
To decide whether or not to own a gun for self - defense based solely on a " kill " ratio is folly .
To estimate the risks and benefits of gun ownership many more factors need to be considered .
An example is defensive gun use , which outnumbers homicides , suicides , and accidents , and is ignored in most of the medical research .
( See How often are guns used in self - defense ? )

Typically , the conversation surrounding smartphones centers on which new device is best positioned to challenge Apple 's growing influence and success in the market .
This point of view presumes that manufacturers will continue to churn out new smartphones that become increasingly feature - equivalent to the iPhone , and that it 's only a matter of time before a device will come around and knock Apple off its feet .
This perspective is somewhat misguided , and if anything , recent data suggests that it 's not Apple who has to worry about losing momentum , but rather RIM who has to worry about the iPhone poaching away BlackBerry users .
This past weekend , Apple blew past analyst estimates and sold over 1 million iPhone 3G S devices , an even more impressive number when you consider the current state of the economy and the fact that we 're already on the third iteration of the iPhone .
Not to be outdone , last week RIM posted solid earnings and reported better than expected sales of 7.8 million BlackBerrys for the quarter .
In typical CEO fashion , RIM CEO Jim Balsillie brushed aside the idea that the Palm Pre or the iPhone would have a noticeable effect on RIM 's business .
Recent data , however , suggests that Balsillie might have a lot more to worry about than he thinks .
First , Apple analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray recently surveyed a number of iPhone 3G S early adopters at Apple retail stores this past weekend and found that 12 % of them were abandoning their BlackBerrys in order to purchase a new iPhone .
In previous iPhone launches , only 6 % of surveyed customers reported leaving their BlackBerrys behind .
To be fair , Munster 's sample size was n't terribly large , and the large number of surveyed consumers leaving RIM for Apple might simply be a testament as to how successful RIM has been in selling its BlackBerry devices in the first place .
Still , the underlying take away from Munster 's survey is that while RIM might have a higher marketshare than Apple for the time being , its devices are n't compelling enough to keep users from jumping ship to the iPhone and its 50,000 strong iTunes App Store .
Second , market research Crowd Science conducted a survey over the past few weeks measuring what percentage of smartphone users would be willing to purchase a device different from the one they currently own .
The survey found that only 14 % of non-BlackBerry users would consider ditching their current smartphone for any of RIM's BlackBerry models .
In contrast , the survey found that over 40 % of non-iPhone users would consider abandoning their current smartphone for an Apple iPhone .
Crowd Science CEO
John Martin opined on the results , " These results reflect the great challenges Blackberry faces in stemming the iPhone stampede .
" And with over 1 million devices sold in just 8 countries this weekend , stampede seems to be an appropriate word .
RIM 's challenge is that it already has the enterprise market locked down .
It 's lineup of BlackBerrys are admittedly great for emailing , and to many corporations , they constitute an integral part of conducting day to day business .
But the iPhone shifted the smartphone playing field away from the enterprise and towards the consumer , and no company is better positioned than Apple to excel in that market .
The advent of the iPhone , and more specifically the iTunes App Store , signaled a shift in how people view their phones .
No longer used solely for making calls , listening to a few songs , and maybe browsing the web , they now have the potential to be full fledged gaming devices , educational tools , and even turn by turn GPS units ,
In a way , the iTunes App Store makes the iPhone a device with an almost endless number of potential uses and features .
How can RIM compete with that ?
There are a lot of people for whom a BlackBerry device was their first smartphone .
Now , it seems that for many , an iPhone will be their second .

O’Reilly first discussed Tiller on Feb. 25 , 2005 and followed it up with 28 more episodes that mentioned the doctor .
In the past four years , O’Reilly described the doctor as “ Tiller the Baby Killer ” and “ a moral equivalent to NAMBLA and al - Qaida . ”
“ This is the kind of stuff happened in Mao ’s China , Hitler ’s Germany , Stalin ’s Soviet Union , ” said O’Reilly on one show .
This is where it gets most troubling .
O’Reilly ’s language describing Tiller , and accusing the state and its elites of complicity in his actions , could become extremely vivid .
On June 12 , 2007 , he said , “ Yes , I think we all know what this is .
And if the state of Kansas does n’t stop this man , then anybody who prevents that from happening has blood on their hands as the governor does right now , Governor Sebelius . ”
Three days later , he added , “ No question Dr. Tiller has blood on his hands .
But now so does Governor Sebelius .
She is not fit to serve .
Nor is any Kansas politician who supports Tiller ’s business of destruction .
I would n’t want to be these people if there is a Judgment Day .
I just — you know … Kansas is a great state , but this is a disgrace upon everyone who lives in Kansas .
Is it not ? “
[ via ThinkProgress ]
Update :
There is also a 2006 segment from Bill O’Reilly ’s radio program where he implicitly states he would like to personally kill Dr. Tiller :

Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) and his wife Cindy ( R ) greets Alaska Governor Sarah Palin ( 3rd R ) and her family after arriving at the airport in Minneapolis , Minnesota September 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican Senator John McCain has a message for late - night comic David Letterman : Enough with the jokes about Sarah Palin and her family .
The host of CBS ’ “ Late Show with David Letterman ” drew the ire of Palin this week by making jokes about her visit to New York last weekend .
Letterman joked that a Palin daughter , presumably Bristol , 18 , had sex with New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez during a baseball game the ex-vice presidential candidate attended .
Bristol gave birth to a child last year fathered by her former fiance .
“ I do n’t understand why Letterman would say that about a young woman , ” McCain said during a telephone interview on Thursday .
“ They ( the Palins ) deserve some kind of protection from being the butt of late - night hosts . ”
Palin , who was visiting New York with her 14 - year - old daughter Willow , charged that Letterman made “ sexually perverted comments , ” prompting a semi-apology from Letterman on his show on Wednesday night .
The Alaska governor was the vice presidential candidate last year on the Republican Party ticket headed by McCain .

Supreme Court strikes down gay sex ban By Joan Biskupic , USA TODAY WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court voted 6 - 3 on Thursday to strike down a Texas law that banned sex between homosexuals , a decision that was an unprecedented show of respect for gay men and lesbians .
Reversing a 1986 ruling that upheld anti-sodomy laws , the court 's majority said the Texas law violated privacy rights .
The decision changes the legal landscape for gays by declaring that the Constitution 's guarantee of liberty forbids government from targeting their sexual practices .
The ruling also could help gay men and lesbians in legal disputes that arise from moral disapproval , whether on the job , in child - custody cases or over inheritance claims .
The anti-sodomy laws in Texas and 12 other states invalidated Thursday rarely were enforced .
But they , and the 1986 ruling , have been cited by courts to deny gay parents custody of their children or to reject bias claims by gay workers .
The men who challenged the Texas law that banned oral and anal sex " are entitled to respect for their private lives , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority .
" The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . "
In a rare reversal of a past ruling , the majority said the court 's support of anti-sodomy laws 17 years ago " was not correct when it was decided , and it is not correct today . "
Kennedy cited " an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives . "
Justice Antonin Scalia gave a fierce dissent from the bench .
He called the ruling " the product of a law - profession culture that has largely signed on to the homosexual agenda . "
Joined in writing by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas , who with Scalia are the court 's most conservative members , Scalia said the ruling could lead to legal gay marriages in the USA .
But the majority said the case involved consenting adults in their own home , not government recognition of gay relationships .
The decision comes as the presence and power of gay men and lesbians is increasing in the USA and beyond .
Last week , a court in Canada lifted a ban on same - sex marriages .
Such a sea change is unlikely here anytime soon .
But the ruling , on the last day of the 2002 - 03 term , was a reminder of how much the nation has changed since 1986 .
Most states , including Georgia , source of the 1986 case , have dropped laws banning oral and anal sex .
Some elected officials are now openly gay .
Gay characters are common on TV and in movies .
Employers routinely offer benefits to same - sex partners of workers .
" The court closed the door on an era of intolerance , " said Ruth Harlow , legal director of Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund , which represented Texas plaintiffs John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner .
They were fined $ 200 each after Harris County sheriff 's officers entered Lawrence 's home in response to a false report about an armed man and found the pair having sex .
Tom Minnery of the evangelical group Focus on the Family said the ruling lifts " the boundaries that prevent sexual chaos in our culture . "

George Brauchler , JD , District Attorney of the 18th Judicial District in Colorado , wrote in a Mar. 1 , 2019 opinion article titled “ Coloradans Should Have the Final Say on the Death Penalty ( and I ’d Hope They Keep It ) , ” available at denverpost.com :
“ There are good reasons to maintain capital punishment in our state …
The paramount goal of sentencing is the imposition of justice .
Sometimes , justice is dismissing a charge , granting a plea bargain , expunging a past conviction , seeking a prison sentence , or — in a very few cases , for the worst of the worst murderers — sometimes , justice is death …
A drug cartel member who murders a rival cartel member faces life in prison without parole .
What if he murders two , three , or 12 people ?
Or the victim is a child or multiple children ?
What if the murder was preceded by torture or rape ?
How about a serial killer ?
Or a terrorist who kills dozens , hundreds or thousands ?
The repeal of the death penalty treats all murders as the same .
Once a person commits a single act of murder , each additional murder is a freebie .
That is not justice . ”
Opel - Rettung : Was wird gerettet ?
Von Ulrich Rippert
29 . Mai 2009
Gegenwärtig wird viel über die " Rettung von Opel " gesprochen und geschrieben .
Doch die wichtigste Frage wird dabei ausgeblendet : Um wessen Rettung geht es ?
Um die der Arbeiter , Arbeitsplätze und Löhne , oder um die der Kapitaleigner und Profite .
Regierung , Management und Gewerkschaften versuchen diese Klassenfrage zu unterdrücken .
Sie wollen den Eindruck erwecken , die " Rettung von Opel " bedeute beides und sei im Interesse " aller Beteiligten " .
Doch die Einzelheiten der Rettungspläne beweisen das Gegenteil .
Egal ob Fiat oder Magna zum Zug kommt , beide Konzepte sehen einen massiven Abbau von Arbeitsplätzen , deutliche Senkung der Löhne , Einschränkung der Pausenzeiten und Verschärfung der Schichtpläne vor .
Beide Konzepte beinhalten Regierungshilfen in Milliardenhöhe .
Diese Steuergelder sollen dazu dienen , den Arbeitsplatzabbau und die damit verbundene Umstrukturierung der Produktion zu finanzieren .
Ziel dieser steuerfinanzierten Maßnahmen ist es , die Rendite der Kapitaleigner zu erhöhen .
Das meint Wirtschaftsminister von Guttenberg ( CSU ) , wenn er ein " tragfähiges Unternehmenskonzept " anmahnt .
Die Regierung ist bereit , staatliche Subventionen bereit zu stellen .
Sie will sich damit vor allem über die Bundestagswahl im September retten .
Diese " Brückenfinanzierung " soll ihr helfe , einen reibungslosen Übergang zu einer neuen Regierung zu schaffen .
Sie will vermeiden , dass mitten im Wahlkampf heftige Konflikte über Arbeitsplätze an einem oder mehreren Opel - Standorten ausbrechen , die dann schnell ähnliche Konflikte bei Karstadt , Schaeffler , Porsche und anderen Betrieben nach sich ziehen können .
Sie arbeitet dabei eng mit der IG Metall und den Opel - Betriebsräten zusammen .
Beide , Regierung und Gewerkschaft , wissen , dass die so genannten " Standortgarantien " , die sie von einem Investor verlangen , mit einem Verfallsdatum unmittelbar nach der Bundestagswahl versehen sind .
Nach der Wahl werden die Karten neu gemischt .
Schon jetzt sind sich alle Beteiligten - einschließlich der Gewerkschaften - einig , dass Produktionskapazitäten in der Autoindustrie abgebaut werden müssen .
Wenn im Herbst die Abwrack - Prämie ausläuft , die gegenwärtig die Nachfrage nach Kleinwagen anreizt , wird ein dramatischer Produktionseinbruch stattfinden .
Am deutlichsten zeit sich die arbeiterfeindliche Stoßrichtung der " Rettung von Opel " an den Standorten außerhalb Deutschlands .
Im belgischen Antwerpen produzieren 2.500 GM - Beschäftigte den Opel - Astra .
Im englischen Ellesmere Port und in Luton montieren 5.000 Vauxhall - Arbeiter das GM - Modell Vivaro .
In Zaragoza ( Spanien ) produzieren 7.000 GM - Beschäftigte den Corsa , und in Polen ( Gliwice ) laufen auch Astra - und Zafira - Modelle vom Band .
Die 3.600 Beschäftigten in Polen arbeiten seit Monaten kurz , eine ganze Schicht wurde eingespart und am Monatsende werden dort erneut 250 Arbeiter entlassen .
Bei den gegenwärtigen Verhandlungen im Kanzleramt ist die Forderung nach Erhalt der deutschen Standorte direkt damit verbunden , die Krise auf die Beschäftigten an den anderen europäischen Standorten abzuwälzen .
Besonders die IG Metall und die Betriebsräte fordern eine " deutsche Lösung " .
Ihre gemeinsamen europäischen Aktionstage waren nur ein Deckmantel für ihre nationalistische Politik .
Klaus Franz , der als Opel - Konzernbetriebsratsvorsitzender auch den GM - Europa - Betriebsrat leitet , wird nicht müde , die Vorzüge der deutschen Standorte zu preisen .
Am Mittwoch wandte sich der belgische Premierminister Herman van Rompuy in einem offenen Brief an Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel ( CDU ) und EU - Kommissionspräsident Barroso .
Eine Lösung , die nur einem Land diene , stehe nicht in Einklang mit dem Geist der Europäischen Union , schreibt er darin .
Auch der flämische Ministerpräsident Kris Peeters betonte :
Es könne nicht angehen , dass Deutschland eine Lösung finde und alle anderen Länder mit GM - Standorten folgen müssten .
Unter der Überschrift " Europa fürchtet deutschen Egoismus " berichtete das Handelsblatt am gestrigen Donnerstag , auch die britische Regierung habe dagegen protestiert , dass die Berliner " Opel - Rettung " zu Lasten des britischen GM - Unternehmens Vauxhall ginge .
Wirtschaftsminister Peter Mendelson habe betont , dass die Kosten bei Vauxhall bereits in den vergangenen Jahren massiv gesenkt worden seien .
Erst im Februar hatten die Gewerkschaften bei Vauxhall einer Verkürzung der Arbeitszeit von 38 auf 30 Wochenstunden mit entsprechenden Lohnkürzungen zugestimmt .
Es sei nicht zu akzeptieren , dass die damit verbundene Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in den britischen Werken nicht berücksichtigt werde , sagte ein Gewerkschaftssprecher .
In dem HB - Artikel heißt es auch : " Die Kritik aus den EU - Staaten lässt die Bundesregierung kalt .
Es sei nun zu spät , um die europäischen Partner noch formell einzubeziehen , hieß es in deutschen Regierungskreisen . "
Der wachsende Wirtschaftsnationalismus nimmt immer schärfere Formen an .
Die britischen Gewerkschaften stehen dabei ihren deutschen Kollegen in nichts nach .
Tony Woodley , der Generalsekretär der Arbeiter - und Verkehrsgewerkschaft in England , attackierte die Londoner Regierung , weil sie nicht schon früher scharf und konsequent gegen die deutschen Pläne vorgegangen sei , und verlangte eine stärkere Vertretung britischer Interessen .
Die " Opel - Rettung " , wie sie gegenwärtig im Kanzleramt vorbereitet wird , hat für alle Arbeiter an allen Standorten verheerende Auswirkungen .
Die Betriebsräte betonen , es gäbe keine realistische Alternative .
Zugeständnisse in Form von Lohnsenkung und Arbeitsplatzabbau seien unvermeidbar .
Wer das ablehne , nehme den sofortigen Bankrott des Unternehmens , die Stilllegung aller Werke und die Vernichtung aller Arbeitsplätze in Kauf .
Um dieser Erpressung entgegenzutreten , ist es notwendig , sich der ganzen kapitalistischen Logik zu widersetzen .
Wenn im Rahmen der bestehenden kapitalistischen Verhältnisse die Arbeitsplätze , Löhne und Sozialleistungen nicht verteidigt werden können , wie die Betriebsräte betonen , dann müssen diese Verhältnisse eben geändert werden .
Mit anderen Worten : Die " Opel - Rettung " wirft grundlegende politische Fragen auf .
Es ist notwendig , sich auf einen politischen Kampf einzustellen .
Im Mittelpunkt eines solchen Kampfes muss ein internationales sozialistisches Programm stehen , das die prinzipielle Verteidigung der Rechte und Interessen aller Arbeiter höher stellt , als das Profitstreben der Kapitaleigner und der herrschenden Finanzaristokratie .
Das Privateigentum an den großen Konzernen und Banken muss abgeschafft und in Gemeineigentum überführt werden .
Die Betriebe müssen demokratisch geleitet und kontrolliert werden , so dass die Entscheidungen im Interesse der Arbeiter und der Mehrheit der Bevölkerung getroffen werden .
Um diese Ziele zu erreichen , muss eine internationale , sozialistische Arbeiterpartei aufgebaut werden , die für die weltweite Vereinigung der Arbeiter im Kampf gegen den Kapitalismus und für die Vereinigten Sozialistischen Staaten von Europa eintritt .
Das ist das Ziel des Internationalen Komitees der Vierten Internationale und seiner deutschen Sektion , der Partei für Soziale Gleichheit .
Eine solche politische Umwälzung der Gesellschaft kann nicht von heute auf morgen erreicht werden .
Das spricht nicht gegen Sofortmaßnahmen zur Verteidigung der Arbeitsplätze .
Im Gegenteil , der Widerstand in den Betrieben wird erst die notwendige Schlagkraft erhalten , wenn er sich von dem engstirnigen Standpunkt der Gewerkschaften löst und sich als Bestandteil eines politischen Kampfs für die sozialistische Umgestaltung der Gesellschaft versteht .
Von diesem Standpunkt aus müssen Fabrikkomitees aufgebaut werden , die an die Tradition der Arbeiterräte anknüpfen .
Sie müssen unabhängig von den Gewerkschaften die Zusammenarbeit mit Arbeitern an den anderen Standorten und in andern Ländern anstreben und den internationalen Widerstand koordinieren .

Man dies after being tasered 28 times
A man has died after being shot up to 28 times by police armed with a Taser stun gun .
An inquiry has been launched after 39 - year - old Antonio Galeano collapsed and died a short time after being stunned by the 50,000 volt Taser gun .
Police in Queensland , Australia said he had been tasered up to 28 times .
Now civil liberties groups are claiming that Tasers are not as harmless as forces around the world believe .
Taser gun :
The 50,000 volt shock can cause injury , heart attacks and lead to fatalities
Tasers use a powerful electric current to incapacitate people , with the charge temporarily disrupting muscle control .
Critics say the weapon can cause injury including severe heart attack in some people , possibly leading to death .
In Canada and the U.S. , tasers have been linked to hundreds of deaths but over more than a million official incidents .
Controversy over their use flared in Britain this week when footage emerged of a man apparently being shot twice by Taser - armed police in Nottingham , leading to calls from human rights groups for an independent investigation .
Australian police said data downloaded from the Taser used last week at at Brandon , south of Townsville , following a confrontation with Galeano showed it had been fired 28 times , but it was still unclear how many times the victim had been hit .
A post mortem was being carried out and Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson ordered an internal investigation , matched by the state 's coroner .
Deputy Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said on Thursday police had no instructions on how often they should use the weapon .
A man is tasered twice on the streets in Nottingham earlier this week
' There is no specific guideline that restricts the number of times the trigger can be pulled , ' he said .
They are being introduced by several Australian states , although Victoria earlier this month shunned any mass roll out .
Academic criminologist Julian Bondy said the Queensland incident proved Tasers were too powerful .
' We do n't issue frontline police with firearms with a thousand bullets , we do n't issue them with capsicum spray the size of fire extinguishers .
' Every other weapon they have is limited ... but this one is out of proportion , ' Bondy said .
Pay .
You know that aviation pays better than commercial , in most cases a lot better , but you are n't sure what the going rate is for a corporate flight attendant .
It might surprise you to learn that pay rates vary widely depending on the type of account , your location , your responsibilities , experience , and more .
Over the years I have discovered that the pay range is not set in stone .
Typically , fractionals pay less than charter operators [ Part 135 ] who pay less than owner accounts [ Part 91 ] .
Are there exceptions to this rule ?
Of course .
Other factors as mentioned above can play a significant role in determining what you will make .
These include :
Location : business flight attendants based closer to major metropolitan areas command the highest salaries .
New York and Los Angeles are the two most trafficked areas for private flying .
Between corporate moguls and Hollywood celebrities , the two metropolitan areas produce some of the most significant amounts of flying in business aviation .
If you are located in Pocatello or Burlington the chances of you finding work in the first place are remote , unless a fractional operator hires you and allows you to airline to reposition for your flight .
Responsibilities : So , what are you ?
Will you be treated as a passenger who serves other passengers or will you be expected to manage the entire cabin from the cockpit door on back ?
Is there a difference in service ?
Yes , but in the perception of the company doing the hiring there may not be .
The written job description may differ from what the job actually requires .
It may take several interviews for you to find out if the company places value on your culinary expertise , your safety training , your related job experience , etc .
Generally , those companies looking for someone with " no experience necessary , will train " will pay less than those who state they want an employee who is up to date with their training and has flown for a number of years .
Other questions to keep in mind :
How often will you be flying ?
Will you be flying between set cities or traveling internationally ?
How may days per month ?
How many soft days v. hard days will you have per month ?
Will you be on call ?
Will you be expected to work in the office on days off ?
Will you be expected to " look after " children a /k / a play the nanny role when not flying ?
Will you be supervising other flight attendants ?
Experience :
The more experience flying corporate , the better .
Companies should reward you based on your business flying background , safety and security training , culinary expertise , world languages if flying internationally , management skills , people skills , etc .
Some companies require that you act as a personal assistant to the CEO .
Extra compensation should be expected for these additional responsibilities .
So , what is the pay range ?
These figures are not absolute , but the U.S. salaries that I have heard for corporate flight attendants falls into three general categories .
These are some generalized salary ranges :
Fractionals : 33 K to 43 K , corporate experience not always required .
These companies will train you to their specifications .
One of the big pluses for fractionals is that you can live mostly anywhere ; at least one company will allow you to airline to meet up with the aircraft [ they also may let you accumulate and keep your airliner miles ] .
Charter : 45 K to 75 K , depending on location of aircraft and your experience .
Much of what I 've heard as the quoted salary is in the low to mid-50s range .
Indeed , the NBAA supports this data with a recent survey showing that the average corporate flight attendant is paid just over 53 K per year .
Owner : 25 K to 100 K +.
Let 's not kid ourselves .
There are companies that will expect you to jump through hoops to fly on their aircraft and for peanuts [ and you know they do n't serve peanuts to their passengers ! ]
On the other hand , if you are a chief flight attendant your salary will probably start at 75 K and can easily exceed 90 K .
The higher salary can be expected when you have a " VP " title and be in charge of several flight attendants .
Oh , by the way , do n't forget that you will be flying in addition to your office duties ... guess who has to cover for sick employees when no one else can be found ?
100 K +?!
Let 's just say that this amount is unusual , but I did confirm 110 K for one flight attendant flying internationally some time back .
Generally , never expect anyone to reveal their salary to you ... why should they ?
What about flying contract ?
Wow ... you had to ask .
If I told you that you can expect an average of $ 300 . - $ 350 .
per day plus per diem would that suit you ?
The amounts being paid for contractors vary just as widely as they do for full time flight attendants .
I have heard of flight attendants flying for $ 0 just to get the experience and hours [ how could a company conscientiously allow that to happen ?
Okay , stupid question !]
I 've also heard of a flight attendant making $ 600 per day flying internationally .
Contract rates vary widely and depend , again , on your location , responsibilities , experience , etc .
Questions to ask yourself :
What am I worth ?
If you think that the job merits 60 K per year , then you need to make a case for earning 60 K per year .
If the company insists on paying 35 K , guess what ?
You wo n't make anything near 60 K , you 'll be crossed off their list and the person settling for 35 K will get the job .
What will I settle for ?
Can I justify the lower salary just to get some work ?
If I have flown for years and are willing to take a 20 - 25 K pay cut , will I be able to live on the lower salary ?
Can I expect to renegotiate my salary once hired [ do n't make me laugh ... ] ?
What benefits can I expect ?
401 ( k ) , medical , dental , vacation , sick / personal days , and the like are some of the expected benefits when working full time .
Other considerations : do they pay for uniforms ?
Is there a uniform allowance ?
What about salary reviews / job performance reviews ?
Is there room for promotion ?
Can I ever transfer to another account ?
Will they pay for my training ?
What is their policy on job termination / severance ?
Is this a family friendly environment ?
The more you know about your needs , wants , and desires before you are interviewed , the better opportunity you will have to be adequately compensated .
Find out what is important to you : i.e. , lower salary v. living where I want ; job security v. higher pay ; public visibility v. anonymity , etc .
Stick with your principles and act upon them while negotiating your next position .
One final question to ask yourself once a job offer has been tendered : can I live with myself if I accept this position ?
Next :
What type of training do I need ?

Tess Sosa , who was aboard Flight 1549 with her husband , 4 - year - old daughter and infant son , said she suffered a mild concussion during the landing , and her husband was treated for a leg injury and hypothermia .
The family , from New York , continues to get hospital bills , she said .
But her top priority was getting the insurer to pay for therapy to reduce the risk of post - traumatic stress disorder for her and her daughter .
Because the plane was full on the day of the accident , she and her baby were seated near the wings , while her husband and daughter were far in the rear .
The plane struck the water tail - first , and water began pouring in where Mr. Sosa and daughter Sophia were sitting .
Ms. Sosa , clambering over seats toward the front of the plane with her son in her arms , looked back and caught a horrifying glimpse of her husband standing in the deepening water , trying to hold their daughter above the surface .
“ I can tell you , he was looking straight at me and he did n’t even see me , ” she said .
Since then she has been haunted by the image , and the feeling that in her escape she abandoned her husband and daughter .
Ms. Sosa said Sophia “ remembers everything .
I just want her to walk away from this knowing that we did everything we could to make it make sense . ”
A.I.G. agents have told her that for therapy she should use her own health insurance , but it has a $ 3,000 deductible for mental health care .
“ Why should we be paying out of pocket ? ” she said .
“ That ’s why they ’re there .
They ’re the insurer . ”
Aviation insurance specialists said that an airline ’s liability insurer is not normally there for medical bills after a plane crash .
Passengers ’ health insurance may indeed pay first  for passengers who have it  or workers ’ compensation for passengers traveling on business .
Later , if liability is established , those insurers circle back and try to get reimbursed from the airline ’s liability insurer .
But that does not help accident survivors who have expenses in the meantime .
A.I.G. has told Ms. Sosa and other passengers that it would pay for therapy , but only for three sessions .
Richard Stallman , founder of the GNU project and a General Public License author , has slammed plans to include Mono in Debian 's default install as a " dangerous " risk for the open - source community .
In a statement published on the Free Software Foundation site , Stallman says the move is being taken " for the sake of Tomboy which is an application written in C# . "
" The danger is that Microsoft is probably planning to force all free C# implementations underground some day using software patents , " Stallman said .
" This is a serious danger , and only fools would ignore it until the day it actually happens .
We need to take precautions now to protect ourselves from future danger . "
The Debian GNU / Linux project has plans to include Tomboy , a note - taking application in its next release .
This would include implementing Mono , the open - source implementation of Microsoft 's .NET backed by Novell .
" The problem is not in the C# implementations , but rather in Tomboy and other applications written in C# , " he continued .
" If we lose the use of C# , we will lose them too .
That does n't make them unethical , but it means that writing them and using them is taking a gratuitous risk . "
Stallman warned that a Microsoft threat should steer the open - source community to discourage people from writing programs in C# and depend on the free C# implementations as little as possible .
Although Stallman frequently speaks about the dangers of software patents on open - source , trust for Microsoft has run particularly thin recently because of the company 's legal attack on TomTom over a FAT patent dispute .
Stallman urged the community to instead distribute and recommend non-C# applications whenever possible to avoid Redmond lawyers from being able to disable major OS functions on a whim . ®

Big Pharma pulled off a first - class PR coup last week with its widely celebrated pledge to support health care reform by offering up a package of discounts they claim will run to $ 80 billion over the next ten years .
The highlight of the package , said to be worth about $ 30 billion , is a 50 percent discount offered to old and disabled people who fall into the “ donut hole , ” the notorious coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit , which leaves some of us paying as much as $ 3,000 out of pocket for our meds .
Announcing the agreement , President Obama hailed the drug - makers for offering “ significant relief ” to a “ continuing injustice that has placed a great burden on many seniors , ” and for helping to reach “ a turning point in America ’s journey toward health care reform . ”
AARP , the mammoth old people ’s lobby , was right there at Obama ’s shoulder , with head man Barry Rand trumpeting that industry ’s progress : “ This is an early win for reform and a major step forward .
It is a signal the process is working and will work . ”
The deal was also seen as a victory for Senate finance committee chair Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , who engineered negotiations in his self - assigned role as champion compromiser in the reform debate .
But the real triumph belongs to the drug companies themselves , since the supposedly magnanimous offer is just what we might expect it to be , considering the source : another wolf in sheep ’s clothing from Big Pharma .
When it comes to securing their interests against even the flimsiest of threats , the drug - makers ’ pockets appear bottomless .
A look at last week ’s Center for Responsive Politics report on the industry offers an awe - inspiring view of the druggies in action :
To begin with , we ’re not talking about a handful of lobbyists twisting the arms of members of Congress .
Pharma had 1,814 flacks at work last year and 1,309 in the first 3 months of this year .
That ’s 12 percent of all the lobbyists in Washington .
Last year alone the drug industry spent $ 234 million on lobbying .
In the first three months of this year , it spent more than $ 66.5 million — $ 1.2 million a day .
And that does n’t include polling , advertising , and research .
Among the top recipients of Pharma funds are several members of the Senate finance committee , including Baucus himself , who have positioned themselves as a “ coalition of the willing ” dedicated to promoting a bipartisan middle ground on health care reform — in other words , minor changes that wo n’t seriously affect private sector profits .
While it continues to spend millions glad - handing elected officials , Big Pharma ’s latest PR pitch is designed to make the industry look beneficent while preserving — or even enhancing — its profits .
As industry analysts quickly recognized , the Medicare discount program is unlikely to hurt the drug - makers ’ bottom line .
Charles A. Butler , a pharmaceutical analyst at the investment bank Barclays Capital , told the New York Times that he did not think the deal would have “ a material adverse impact ” on drug company earnings .
“ Because of the discounts , ” he said , “ Medicare beneficiaries are likely to continue filling prescriptions in the doughnut hole , whereas in the past many stopped taking their medications because the drugs were unaffordable to them . ”
There ’s a further twist as well , in that the agreement only promises cost reductions on brand name drugs , which account for an increasingly smaller percentage of all prescriptions — a trend that the discount program might actually help to reverse .
Reuters business news pointed out that “ concessions will be funneled in an area that could generate additional sales volume . ”
Reuters quoted Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan , who said “ roughly 20 - 25 percent of Medicare D patients reach the doughnut hole , and the majority of them either stop or switch their medications . ”
So Big Pharma ’s scheme stands to not only keep the drugs flowing to oldsters , but also keep them from changing to lower - priced generic alternatives .
It ’s even conceivable that some Medicare recipients , already struggling with the confusing morass of Part D benefits ( which cover various drugs at different rates that can change at any time ) , might well ask their doctors to switch them from generics to brand name prescriptions , thinking it could save them money .
As a long - term strategy , this all makes good business sense for the drug manufacturers .
A study released last year by Wolters Kluwer Health showed “ clear evidence of a growing affinity for generics and a continual slide away from brands ” since the institution of the Medicare prescription drug program .
In 2007 , the study found , generics accounted for 63 percent of the Part D market , up from 50 percent just three years earlier .
“ What ’s most striking , ” said a VP of the information services company , “ is the fact that of those who discontinue their branded drug therapy in the coverage gap , only 6 % return to them after leaving the gap . ”
In other words , seniors keep taking the cheaper generics , even once the government starts picking up the bill again in the new calendar year .
Since most Medicare recipients spend more time outside of the donut hole than in it , the drug - makers could actually see a big payoff from their discount program if it keeps a fair number of elders from switching off of brand name drugs .
This is an especially well - timed ploy for Big Pharma , since the patent clock is ticking down on a number of its biggest cash cow drugs , which are taken primarily by older people :
The patent on Lipitor — the number one drug in retail sales , with annual sales in 2008 of $ 7.8 billion — expires next year , along with the patent on the Alzheimer ’s drug Aricept .
Plavix , which weighs in a number three with $ 4.9 billion , is not far behind , with its patent running out in 2011 .
And the list goes on ( courtesy of a reader on my Unsilent Generation blog ) .
And suddenly , Big Pharma ’s generous “ concession ” starts to look like nothing more or less than a pitch to keep people taking expensive brand name drugs , and keep the government — and the taxpayers — funding them .
All this points to the fact that despite their protestations , the drug companies , like the insurance companies , have no real objection to health care “ reform , ” as long as it happens on their terms .
The Republican - penned Medicare prescription drug bill , for example , was a huge boon to both industries , opening up a mammoth new market for their products , with the government footing the bill .
What the drug - makers want to avoid , then and now , is an end to what Dean Baker calls “ their government - granted monopolies , ” which allow them “ to charge whatever they want .
As a result , we pay nearly twice as much for our prescription drugs as people in countries like Canada and Germany . ”
By making voluntary “ concessions , ” the industry positions itself to combat any real change that might affect its profit margins .
And with drug spending estimated to total $ 3.3 trillion over the next decade , $ 80 billion in discounts is a small price for Big Pharma to pay to preserve its stranglehold on the American health care system .
So is $ 1.2 million a day to preserve its friends in high places in the United States Congress .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Sedatives and sleeping pills prescribed to ease depression , anxiety and sleep problems appear to increase the risk of suicide four - fold among the elderly , Swedish researchers said on Wednesday .

A review of elderly Suicides in the Swedish city of Gothenburg and two nearby counties showed that antidepressants , antipsychotics , sedatives and hypnotics appeared to make it more likely an older person would commit suicide .
While research has linked use of these drugs to suicides among younger people , there had also been evidence the pills may reduce the risk in the elderly , Anders Carlsten and Margda Waern of Gothenburg University reported in the BioMed Centraljournal BMC Geriatrics .
They reviewed the records of 85 men and women older than 65 who had committed suicide and compared them with a group of elderly people from among the general population who did not kill themselves .
After adjusting for psychiatric conditions , the patients who took sedatives and hypnotics for sleeping problems were four times more likely to commit suicide , Carlsten ’s team found .
“ Clinicians need to be aware of this as these drugs are widely prescribed to the elderly , ” they wrote .
According to the World Health Organization , 877,000 people worldwide kill themselves each year .
For every suicide death , anywhere from 10 to 40 attempts are made , the U.N. agency estimates .
Scientists have linked sleep disturbances to increased suicidal risk in people with psychiatric disorders and in adolescents but it is unclear whether the association also exists in the general population .
“ A careful evaluation of the suicide risk should be carried out when an elderly person presents with symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance , ” the researchers wrote .
While they do not know exactly why , Carlsten and Waern suggested that the drugs somehow trigger aggressive or impulsive behavior or provide the means for people to take an overdose .
Disabilities or sleep problems may make people more likely to commit suicide , they added .
“ Persons with these problems might be more likely to seek health care and perhaps more likely to receive prescriptions for psychotropic drugs , ” they wrote .
( CNN ) -- Has Sarah Palin started running for president ?
In the last week alone , the Alaska governor appeared at a Republican fundraiser in Washington D.C. , attended a baseball game in New York and even led a small - town parade on the U.S. east coast , 5,000 kilometers from her small town on the western side of the continent .
Sarah Palin appears at an autism fundraiser in New York earlier this week .
It looks so much like a campaign for the White House , you could almost forget that Barack Obama has just settled into the presidency and will keep it until the end of 2012 at least .
What 's Palin doing ?
Attracting crowds , cameras and lot of buzz .
" I love my time in Alaska , " she told Fox News this week . "
At the same time , though , I crave , if not my voice , but other voices out there , being bold , being strong , letting Americans know that those who are concerned about the growth of government and about national security issues , they 're not alone . "
Less than a year ago , Palin was unknown to most Americans , leading a sparsely populated state that 's physically separated from the rest of the country by a big chunk of Canada in - between .
Then , Republican John McCain chose her as a running mate in his presidential campaign .
McCain lost but in a way , Palin won .
She became a household name with a national following .
Many Americans fell in love with her image as a working mother with a homespun style and very conservative views .
And since then , the landscape of U.S. politics has changed .
Now , the Democrats have a popular president and an ambitious agenda on economics , diplomacy and defense .
The Republicans have no clear leader , no consensus on crucial issues and no plan on how to win back power .
They are losing support in virtually every portion of the population that pollsters can measure , except among frequent church - goers .
CNN 's polling suggests the Republicans do n't agree on who they want as the voice of their party .
So Palin can't claim to speak for America 's Republicans but no one can and given the poor state of the party , it badly need someone to come forward to lead the opposition to Obama .
Palin is coming forward for something .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran said the gunman who killed Neda Agha - Soltan may have mistaken her for the sister of an Iranian " terrorist , " the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday .
In death , Neda Agha -Soltan has emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government .

Iran blamed the death of the woman known to the world simply as Neda squarely on " those groups who want to create division in the nation , " saying they planned the woman 's killing " to accuse the Islamic republic of ruthlessly dealing with the opposition , " according to IRNA , Iran 's state - run news agency .
The report said the investigation into her death is ongoing , " but according to the evidence so far , it could be said that she was killed by mistake .
The marksmen had mistaken her for the sister of one of the Monafeghin who had been executed in the province of Mazandaran some time ago . "
Monafeghin refers to the People 's Mujahedin Organization of Iran , or PMOI , which promotes a secular , Marxist government for Iran , and has waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic regime , including bombings that killed politicians , judges and Cabinet members .
Also known as Mujahedin - e - Khalq , the group initially was formed to oppose the Shah of Iran but fell out of favor with the Islamic Revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979 .
The European Union removed the group from its list of terrorist organizations this year , prompting outrage from Tehran .
The Iranian Foreign Ministry accused the European Union of " making friends and cooperating with terrorists " by removing the group from its list .
Neda , 26 , rose to prominence within hours after a crudely shot video documenting her final moments was uploaded to the Web .
Shortly after she died Saturday from a single gunshot wound to the chest , she emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government .
See images of Neda and the impact of her death »
" It 's heartbreaking , " President Obama said Tuesday , referring to the video of Neda , which means " divine calling " in Farsi .
" And I think anyone who sees it knows there 's something fundamentally unjust about it . "
The Iranian government has sought to minimize the impact of her death .
Watch how Neda 's death has attracted world attention »
IRNA reported Wednesday that the killer , or killers , may have " thought that they were targeting one of the government opposition people and that is why they immediately distributed the video of the aftermath of the killing through the official and unofficial media in order to reach their murderous objectives against the Iranian government and revolution .

Buckingham Palace made £ 7 m from visitors in 2007 2008
The Royal Family cost every person in the UK 69 p last year - an increase of 3p on the previous year , Buckingham Palace accounts show .
The total cost to the public of keeping the monarchy increased by £ 1.5 m to £ 41.5 m in the 2008 / 9 financial year .
Palace accounts also show that the Queen dipped into a reserve fund to boost by £ 6 m her Civil List , which pays for the running of the Royal household .
It is the largest sum ever drawn from the reserve built up in the 1990s .
The Queen 's Civil List , which also covers Royal household staff salaries , cost £ 13.9 m in 2007/ 8 - this comprised £ 7.9 m from government coffers and £ 6 m from the reserve .
If the Queen continues to spend money from the reserve at the rate she is now , it will be used up by the start of her Diamond Jubilee year in 2012 .
Peter Hunt , BBC royal correspondent 69 p is an eye - catching figure .
It 's the sum royal officials proudly say the monarchy costs each person in the country .
However , this headline amount does n't include the large , but never disclosed security bill for protecting the royals around the clock .
It 's clear from these accounts that by next year , the Queen will have to go cap in hand to the government seeking an increased income .
One of her annual pots of money , the Civil List , has been set at £ 7.9 m for 20 years .
In the good times , a surplus built up .
For the past eight years , it 's been raided and is dwindling .
The £ 7.9 m Civil List funds , among other things , £ 11 m of salaries and catering .
In a recession , with cuts on the agenda and an election looming , the royals face difficult financial negotiations in 2010 .
If the total cost of the monarchy is calculated per taxpayer and not per person , the cost works out at about £ 1.33 each .
Of the £ 13.9 m Civil List purse , nearly £ 10 m went on staff salaries .
Housekeeping and furnishings cost £ 700,000 and ceremonial functions cost £ 400,000 .
A further £ 1.1 m was spent on catering and hospitality - within this , garden parties cost £ 600,000 , while the cost of food and the royal kitchens came to £ 500,000 .
Computers and IT systems cost £ 400,000 - double the figure for 2007 due to the launch of a new British monarchy website and new personnel , payroll and online recruitment systems .
The £ 7.9 m figure that is granted by the government was frozen in 2000 , to compensate for 10 years of over - generous payments .
It will be up for re-negotiation at the end of 2010 .
The current deal was agreed by Sir John Major in 1990 .
The shortfall has led to questions about how much Buckingham Palace will be able to ask for from the government during a recession .
Last year Buckingham Palace officials described the cost of the Royal Family to taxpayers as less than the price of two pints of milk or an MP3 player download .
But Graham Smith of the anti-monarchy campaign group , Republic , said the cost of the monarchy to the public was unjustified .
ROYAL PUBLIC FINANCES
Financial summary , year to 31 March 2009 2009 ( £m ) 2008 ( £m ) The Queen 's Civil List 13.9 12.7 Parliamentary annuities 0.4 0.4 Grants - in - aid 22.6 22.0 Expenditure met
by gov depts 4.6 4.9 Total 41.5 40.0
He said : " Once again , the powers that be are continually putting their hands into the public finances .
They are not being totally clear and transparent about how that money is spent .
" This is a hugely expensive institution and we should be looking at massive cuts . "
Mr Smith said it was possible to run a head of state at a much reduced cost , offering as examples the Republic of Ireland and Germany .
He suggested the Queen should be paid a salary of £ 200,000 a year .
Mr Smith also said that dividing the £ 41 m between each person in the UK to arrive at the 69 p figure was really a means to make the cost seem less than it was .
The £ 41 m total does not include security provided by the police and Army or the ceremonial duties performed by the Armed Forces .
The cost of Royal travel , which is also paid by the taxpayer , increased by £ 300,000 from £ 6.2 m to £ 6.5 m .
The most expensive journeys were the long - haul overseas tours of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall .

It ’s been a disturbing 24 hours .
But the White House has just updated its
Web site to indicate that it continues to support the repeal of the Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell policy .
There was some concern that the Obama administration was backing off the President ’s repeated promise to lift the ban after the White House Web site yesterday changed its commitment to “ repeal ” DADT to a promise to only “ change ” the policy in a “ sensible way . ”
This led many observers , including the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , to worry whether the White House was backing off of its repeated commitment to , as President Obama himself promised , “ fully repeal ” the DADT policy .
The White House Web site has now been updated , again , and the “ repeal ” language is back .
And while it ’s couched in the same terms about being done in a “ sensible way , ” I would assume that all administration policy is implemented in a “ sensible way , ” so this should have no bearing on whether President Obama will keep his promise to fully repeal the ban .

Foods rich in sugar and fat are relatively recent arrivals on the food landscape , Dr. Kessler noted .
But today , foods are more than just a combination of ingredients .
They are highly complex creations , loaded up with layer upon layer of stimulating tastes that result in a multisensory experience for the brain .
Food companies “ design food for irresistibility , ” Dr. Kessler noted .
“ It ’s been part of their business plans . ”
But this book is less an exposé about the food industry and more an exploration of us .
“ My real goal is , How do you explain to people what ’s going on with them ? ”
Dr. Kessler said .
“ Nobody has ever explained to people how their brains have been captured . ”
The book , a New York Times best seller , includes Dr. Kessler ’s own candid admission that he struggles with overeating .
“ I would n’t have been as interested in the question of why we ca n’t resist food if I did n’t have it myself , ” he said .
“ I gained and lost my body weight several times over .
I have suits in every size . ”
This is not a diet book , but Dr. Kessler devotes a sizable section to “ food rehab , ” offering practical advice for using the science of overeating to our advantage , so that we begin to think differently about food and take back control of our eating habits .
One of his main messages is that overeating is not due to an absence of willpower , but a biological challenge made more difficult by the overstimulating food environment that surrounds us .
“ Conditioned hypereating ” is a chronic problem that is made worse by dieting and needs to be managed rather than cured , he said .
And while lapses are inevitable , Dr. Kessler outlines several strategies that address the behavioral , cognitive and nutritional factors that fuel overeating .
Planned and structured eating and understanding your personal food triggers are essential .
In addition , educating yourself about food can help alter your perceptions about what types of food are desirable .
Just as many of us now find cigarettes repulsive , Dr. Kessler argues that we can also undergo similar “ perceptual shifts ” about large portion sizes and processed foods .
For instance , he notes that when people who once loved to eat steak become vegetarians , they typically begin to view animal protein as disgusting .
Obama Administration Targets Environmental And Animal Rights Activists As Eco-Terrorists
By Stephen Lendman
06 June , 2009
Countercurrents.org
What began under George Bush continues under Barack Obama - targeting dedicated activists with " one of today 's most serious domestic terrorism threats , " according former FBI Deputy Assistant Director of Counterterrorism John Lewis before a Senate panel in May 2005 .
Called " eco-terrorism , " it grew out of the 2001 USA Patriot Act that created the federal crime of " domestic terrorism " and applied it to US citizens as well as aliens .
In his February 2002 testimony before the House Resources Committee , Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health , the FBI 's Domestic Terrorism Section Chief , Counterterrorism Division , James Jarboe defined eco-terrorism as :
" the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against innocent victims or property by an environmentally - oriented , subnational group for environmental - political reasons , or aimed at an audience beyond the target , often of a symbolic nature . "
As a result , innocent people are targeted , accused , convicted and sentenced to hard time for constitutionally protected non-violent environmental activism or supporting animal rights .
The so - called AETA 4 are four recent ones and face prosecution under U.S.A. v. Buddenberg for conspiracy to commit animal enterprise terrorism .
On February 19 and 20 , the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested Joseph Buddenberg , Maryam Khajavi , Nathan Pope , and Adriana Stumpo and charged them with conduct relating to protesting , chalking the sidewalk , chanting , and leafleting - constitutionally protected rights under the First Amendment , but no matter .
In a February 20 press release , the FBI called the four " animal rights extremists suspected of terrorizing University of California researchers ( and said they ) used force , violence , or threats to interfere with the operation of the ( U of C ) in violation of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act . "
More on that below .
The FBI cited specific " threatening incidents " beginning in October 2007 :
-- on October 21 , 2007 , demonstrating outside a U of C professor 's residence in El Cerrito , CA ; wearing bandanas to hide their faces ; trespassing on his front yard ; chanting slogans ; and accusing him " of being a murderer because of his use of animals in research ; "
-- on January 2008 , demonstrating outside the private residences of several U of C researchers ; dressed in black and wearing bandanas to hide their faces ; marched , chanted , and chalked " defamatory " comments on sidewalks outside their residences ;
-- on February 24 , 2008 , " attempted to forcibly enter the private home of a Santa Cruz U of C researcher ; when her husband opened the door , a struggle ensued and he was hit by an object ; " one of the individuals charged then yelled , " We 're gonna get you ; " and
-- on July 29 , 2008 , " a stack of flyers titled ' Murderers and torturers alive & well in Santa Cruz July 2008 edition ' was found at the Cafe Pergolesi in Santa Cruz ; " they contained names , addresses , and telephone numbers of several U of C researchers and said " animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse ; " the defendants were charged with producing and distributing the fliers after which " two firebomb attacks outside researchers ' Santa Cruz homes ( occurred ) , both of which are still under investigation by the FBI . "
Most often , what the FBI and DOJ charge and what , in fact , is true is highly divergent .
In this case , the AETA 4 did nothing more " criminal " than exercise their First Amendments rights , and , in so doing , neither threatened nor terrorized anyone .
Like many other instances in a post - 9/11 environment , and often earlier , the FBI and criminal justice system targets innocent victims , portrays them as criminals , manipulates evidence against them , prevents defense attorneys from access to any called " classified , " uses dubious paid informants , and scares juries to convict .
As a result , numerous victims of injustice languish behind bars as political prisoners , some serving life sentences despite having committed no crime .
That was true under George Bush and a Republican Congress and is no different under Barack Obama and a Democrat one .
Enough police state laws were enacted to convict the most saintly if authorities wish to do so .
And it 's happening with greater frequency by manufacturing terror threats .
The dominant media trumpet them .
Both parties use them for political advantage and try to silence dissent .
They also make false claims to convince the public that dangerous " terrorists " are being arrested , charged , tried and convicted .
Nearly always , those affected are innocent victims of police state injustice at a time we 're all as vulnerable as the AETA 4 .
Indictment of AETA 4 - United States of America v. Buddenberg et al - Filed March 12 , 2009 in US District Court for the Northern District of California ( San Jose )
Count One - Conspiracy
From about October 2007 - July 2008 , " the defendants conspired to use and caused to be used a facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of damaging and interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise ( and ) did intentionally place a person in reasonable fear of death of , and serious bodily injury to that person , a member of the immediate family of that person , and a spouse and intimate partner of that person by a course of conduct involving threats , acts of vandalism , property damage , criminal trespass , harassment , and intimidation .... "
Count Two - Force , Violence , and Threats Involving Animal Enterprises
.... defendants used and caused to be used a facility of interstate commerce , for the purpose of damaging and interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise , and in connection with that purpose did intentionally " commit the same acts described above .
Status of the Case
On May 22 , 2009 , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) joined with defense counsel from the Civil Liberties Defense Center ( CLDC ) in a motion to dismiss the indictment and asked the Court to strike down the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act ( AETA ) as unconstitutional on grounds of " overbreadth ( and ) vagueness . "
CCR stated :
" These are doctrines that allow individuals to challenge laws that chill speech and advocacy and require people to guess at a statute 's meaning and scope . "
CCR attorney Matthew Strugar said :
" To characterize protest and speech as terrorist activities is ludicrous .
And it is not just animal rights activists who are in danger here .
The AETA is so broad and unclear it could be used to suppress lawful protests and boycotts by any activists across the spectrum , no matter what the issue .
The law must be struck down . "
CCR said the AETA 4 " actions are clearly and traditionally protected by the First Amendment ( yet ) The Department of Justice brazenly calls these young activists ' terrorists .... ' "
The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act ( AETA )
On November 27 , 2006 , AETA became law , replacing the 1992 Animal Enterprise Protection Act .
Using broad and vague language , the new law criminalized First Amendment activities advocating for animal rights like peaceful protests , leafleting , undercover investigations , whisleblowing , and boycotts .
These legal acts are now crimes under AETA .
It equates peaceful protest - related activities with violence and terrorism .
Its proponents include prominent industries that exploit animals for profit .
They argued that animal rights activism was increasing , their facilities were being targeted , and tough laws were needed for protection .
They claimed :
-- existing federal and state laws were inadequate ; and
-- activist " attacks " disrupted " vital services " that millions of Americans require .
AETA expands the 1992 law by imposing far harsher penalties than for comparable offenses under other laws and defines " disruptive " activities to include peaceful protests for consumer boycotts , advocating harmful practice reforms , and whisleblowing that results in " losses and increased losses " exceeding $ 10,000 .
It goes further as well .
It legalizes expanded surveillance of animal rights organizations , including criminal wiretapping .
It also lets courts find probable cause for the vague crime of economic damage or disruption without requiring hard evidence that a person or group planned to commit these acts .
AETA exempts " lawful public , governmental or business reaction to the disclosure of information about an animal enterprise , " but that provision only applies to economic disruption claims , not damage , so it makes it hard to distinguish between the two .
The law also :
-- covers facilities that use or sell animals or animal products ;
-- includes any person , entity , or organization connected to an animal enterprise ;
-- applies to any form of advocacy ;
-- criminalizes claimed threatening conduct and protected speech as well as communication with others who engage in these practices ;
-- potentially includes any form of communication such as emailing , telephoning , or distributing materials across state lines in support of abusive animal activity boycotts ; and
-- protects corporate animal abusers with a vested interest in silencing dissent .
Overall and in deliberately vague language , it equates legal protests and civil disobedience with terrorism even when no violence is involved and no physical harm caused .
It claims First Amendment rights do n't apply in support of animals or when advocating against abusive animal practices .
It places profits above constitutionally protected rights .
The Coalition to Abolish AETA
It calls itself " a national grassroots network of activists , lawyers , independent journalists and concerned citizens .
( They ) work collaboratively to more strategically coordinate grassroots education and outreach , legislative advocacy , media , litigation and public pressure to more effectively reverse the erosion of rights enshrined in the AETA .
( It ) also works to support animal protection advocates and other progressive activists to continue their work despite the chilling effect of the AETA and other repressive legislation . "
The Coalition is a joint project of CLDC and CCR and urges people nationwide to join with them in their effort to " undermine ( destructive ) corporate interests . "
It calls AETA unconstitutional by criminalizing protected activities in support of profits .
It believes it 's part of a larger corporate - government conspiracy to stifle dissent , constrain social activism , and exploit public fear of peaceful acts called " terrorism . "
It strives to build grassroots activism to challenge the law and all other forms of oppression .
It supports open dialogue , mutual trust , patience , transparency , respect , and a determination to achieve justice .
It asks all those who agree to join with them for a common purpose .
CCR calls AETA a " dangerous , Sedition Act like law . "
It says it will be used to criminalize lawful protests and turn petty offenses into major ones .
It believes it 's critically important that the AETA 4 indictment be dropped and AETA repealed to protect our constitutional right to dissent .
On June 8 , the defendants have a status hearing in US District Court for the Northern District of California ( San Jose ) .
If convicted , they face up to 10 years in prison for exercising their First Amendment rights .
Another Criminal Injustice Witch - Hunt Prosecution
On December 1 , 2008 , this writer wrote about the Texas - based Holy Land Foundation Charity ( HLF ) , the largest US Muslim one until the Bush administration declared it a terrorist organization , froze its assets , shut it down , and falsely claimed it was funneling millions of dollars to Hamas .
In fact , HLF provided essential relief to Palestinian refugees in Occupied Palestine , Lebanon and Jordan as well as aid for the needy in various other countries , including Bosnia , Albania , Chechnya , Turkey and America .
Its major activities included :
-- financial aid to needy and impoverished families ;
-- a sponsorship program for orphaned children ;
-- various social services ;
-- educational services ;
-- medical and other emergency work ; and
-- community development , including help to rebuild Palestinian homes - ones Israel willfully and illegally demolished .
Five HLF leaders were arrested , indicted , tried , and on November 24 , 2008 convicted on 108 counts , including supporting a terrorist organization , money laundering , and tax fraud .
It was a retrial after a jury in October remained deadlocked on 197 counts against four defendants and acquitted the fifth on all but one charge .
Sentencing was on May 27 and harsh :
-- for Chairman Ghassan Elashi - 65 years
-- President and CEO Shukri Abu Baker - 65 years
-- volunteer Mufid Abdulqader - 20 years ,
-- New Jersey office director Abdulrahman Odeh - 15 years , and
-- California office director Mohammad El - Mezain - 15 years .
The Court reaffirmed the jury 's $ 12.4 million money judgment against all the defendants , except El Mezain not convicted of money laundering .
From inception , HLF and its principals were unjustly targeted for their charity and prominence as the largest Muslim charity in America .
Nancy Hollander , representing Abu -Baker , said the defendants will appeal on a number of issues , including an anonymous testimony of an expert , that she said was a first .
" Our clients were not even allowed to review their own statements because they were classified - statements that they made over the course of many years that the government ( illegally ) wiretapped .
They were not allowed to go back and review them .
They were statements from alleged co-conspirators that included handwritten notes .
Nobody knew who wrote them ; nobody knew when they were written .
There are a plethora of issues . "
Clearly it 's the wrong time to be Muslim in America as well as an environmental or animal rights activist .
It was true under George Bush and no different under Barack Obama .
