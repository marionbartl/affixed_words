Who Spends More on Social Welfare : the United States or Sweden ?
By Price Fishback
Ask anyone .?
Who spends more on social welfare : ?
the U.S. or Sweden and other Nordic countries ??
Nearly everybody will say Sweden .?
But the answer , at least as of the mid-2000s , might surprise you .?
It depends heavily on how you deal with taxation , unfunded mandates , and whether you discuss spending as a share of the country ’s output or in absolute dollars .??
Social welfare expenditures are defined as spending for the poor , the unemployed , the disabled , the elderly , and on health care .?
?
The material reported comes from a historical study comparing the U.S. and the Nordic countries between 1920 and 2003 .
People ’s perceptions are driven by the standard statistic reported in the news and in the OECD database : gross public social welfare spending as a percentage of GDP .??
In 2003 , Sweden spent 37 percent relative to GDP , Denmark 32 percent , Norway 28 percent , Finland 26 percent , and the U.S. lagged behind at 17 percent .
Yet gross transfers do not take into account the dramatic differences in tax structure in the U.S. and the Nordic countries .??
The Nordic countries collect income taxes on the cash payments made to social welfare recipients at rates that are four to five times the rates paid by American recipients .?
Then when the Nordic recipients go out to make purchases , they pay consumption tax rates on their purchases that are 4 to 5 times the rate paid by the poor in America .?
Furthermore , the U.S. government offers a series of tax breaks to promote social welfare that are not found in the Nordic countries .?
After adjusting for the differences in taxation to get net public social spending relative to GDP , Sweden ’s figure falls by 8 percentage points to 29 percent , Denmark falls to 24 percent , Norway to 23 percent and Finland to 20 percent .
The U.S. figure rises to 19 percent .
The difference between the U.S. and the Nordic countries is closed further when expenditures per total population are considered .?
Such international comparisons are more difficult to measure than shares of GDP due to the issues related to measuring purchasing power across countries .??
If the adjustments for purchasing power are correct , net public social expenditures by government in America in 2003 ranked roughly in the middle of the Nordic countries .?
Per capita net public social welfare spending in 2003 ( in 1990 dollars ) in the U.S. was $ 5,400 , while Sweden ’s was $ 6,300 , Norway ’s $ 5,900 , Denmark ’s $ 5,472 , and Finland ’s $ 4,200 .??
Note that all of these countries are very rich — they were spending more on net public social welfare per person in society than the per capita incomes of countries with most of the population in the world .
The U.S. differs from the Nordic countries in that it is a safety - net society .?
Workers and people with adequate incomes purchase directly , or receive through their employer , private life insurance , health insurance , and pension plans .?
Many make charitable donations for social welfare purposes .?
Public benefits are available for the elderly , for the disabled , and for families whose incomes fall below various poverty lines .?
Meanwhile , the Nordic countries adopt a more universal , government - sponsored approach .
?
If we take into account these differences in style , the appropriate measure is net public and private social welfare expenditures per capita .?
By this metric , the U.S. then leads the way at $ 7,800 , followed by Sweden at $ 6,700 , Norway at $ 6,300 , Denmark at $ 5,800 , and Finland at $ 4,900 .
Some caveats are worth considering .?
The U.S. costs of health treatment and administration are likely higher .?
If we cut all U.S. health care costs by one - third , the U.S. figure falls to $ 6,700 , equal with Sweden .?
The latest figures I used for comparison in the century - long study I did were from 2003 , and there have been adjustments since .?
Norway ’s GDP per person has jumped markedly , and the U.S. recently adopted a health reform designed to cover more people .
The differences in the systems have implications for different parts of the income distribution .?
In all of the countries , taxes and transfer payments lead to a substantial increase in the equality of income after taxes and transfers are incorporated .??
Comparisons of incomes after taxes and transfers show that Americans at the 10th percentile of the American income distribution ( 9 percent have less , 90 percent have more ) fare about the same as Nordic people at the 10th percentile of their distribution .?
Americans have more opportunity to reach higher incomes because Americans in the upper half of the distribution have much higher incomes than Nordic people in the upper half of their income distributions .?
On the other hand , households below the 10th percentile in America fare much worse on average than the lowest group in the Nordic countries .
Despite a large array of poverty programs , people in the U.S. are falling through holes in the safety net .?
We know that a substantial number of people eligible for a wide range of benefits in the U.S. do n’t receive them , either because they do n’t apply or the U.S. delivery of services is not that good .
Is the U.S. safety net a better system than the universal Nordic programs ???
Many Nordic people seem to prefer theirs , and many Americans seem to prefer ours .?
Despite the difference in approaches , the striking feature here is that the amounts spent per person in the population are not that different .?
The U.S. , like most developed and developing countries , has greatly expanded its demand for security , and thus expenditures on social welfare have risen dramatically throughout the past century .
On April 20 , 2010 , a mayday call from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico reporting an explosion aboard signaled the beginning of one of the largest man-made environmental disasters in the United States .
Today , the environmental , economic , and political repercussions of the oil spill are just being felt - but what happened the day the rig went ablaze , before the magnitude of the catastrophe as we know it today was clear ?
National Geographic Channel obtained exclusive never - before - seen footage from the U.S. Coast Guard , NGC production crew and salvage company who responded in the chaotic first 36 hours following the explosion .
From NGC 's documentary Gulf Oil Spill :
This unparalleled documentary of the first 36 hours includes coverage of the rig engulfed in flames , local vessels dousing the burning rig with water to stem the blaze and intense , close - up moments of the burning vessel sinking into the abyss .
Coast Guard members speak emotionally about searching the seas for missing crew , and teams of mariners and engineers discuss trying to fight the fire at sea and save the vessel , ultimately to no avail .
“ I could see the glow of the burning rig at 90 miles away , ” says USCG Lieutenant Lim .
“ I knew this was big … like seeing hell on earth . ”
Added Kurt Peterson , an elite swimming rescue member who worked to save the rig ’s drowning and injured crew , “ I never had to deal with so many people at one time … since Hurricane Katrina . ”
Salvage team masters describe their experience after working desperately to save the vessel and then watching it sink : “ When you lose a vessel , it ’s a somber moment .
You feel the loss , you feel the failure … unfortunately for us , we were fighting a losing battle from the start .
Unless that oil was cut off , there was n’t really too much anybody could have done to prevent the eventual outcome that we witnessed . ”
Finally , NGC interviews 23 - year - old survivor Chris Choy , who says , “ I kept thinking — we ’re all dead … I did n’t know if I was the only person still on the rig or what . ”
He continues , “ It ’s something I ’ll never forget , images just burned into my head .…
We got together in a big group and we figured we were missing 11 guys .…
We just kept praying that someone would find them . ”
Here are some gruesome yet fascinating photos of the explosion that sunk Deepwater Horizon oil rig :

Brian Deer ’s Sunday Times investigation
With revelations spread over more than 14 years , between late 2003 and 2017 Brian Deer pursued a landmark public interest investigation for The Sunday Times of London , the United Kingdom ’s Channel 4 Television network and BMJ , the British Medical Journal , into allegations linking the three - in - one measles , mumps and rubella vaccine ( MMR ) with claims of a terrifying new syndrome of bowel and brain damage in children .
These allegations had led to a decade - long health crisis in the UK , and sparked epidemics of fear , guilt and infectious disease , which would be exported to the United States , Europe , Australia , and other developed countries , spawning every kind of concern over vaccinations .
Almost incredibly , the trigger for what would become a worldwide controversy over vaccine safety was a single scientific research paper published in a medical journal – the Lancet – in February 1998 .
Written by a then - 41 - year - old academic researcher , Andrew Wakefield , and co-authored by a dozen associates , it reported on the cases of 12 anonymous children with apparent brain disorders who had been admitted to a paediatric bowel unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead , north London , between July 1996 and February 1997 .
Backed by an extraordinary video news - release and press conference , the five - page paper ’s claims provoked substantial media interest , and were followed by a sustained onslaught against the vaccine .
This included further publications by Wakefield criticising MMR , and led to an unprecedented collapse in public confidence in the shot , which , since the late 1980s in the UK and the early 1970s in the US , for examples , has been routinely given to children soon after they are one year old , almost eradicating measles and rubella from developed countries .
Get Deer ’s book : The Doctor Who Fooled the World
The prime cause of the alarm was findings in the paper claiming that the parents of two thirds of the 12 children blamed MMR for the sudden onset of what was described as a combination of both an inflammatory bowel disease and what Wakefield called “ regressive autism ” , in which language and basic skills were said to have been lost .
Most disturbingly , the first behavioural symptoms were reported to have appeared within only 14 days of the shot .
Although the research involved only a dozen children , and its results have never been replicated , many medical breakthroughs have begun with small - scale observations , and , if true , Wakefield ’s findings might have been the first snapshot of a hidden epidemic of devastating injuries .
“ It ’s a moral issue for me , ” he announced at the 1998 press conference , where he called for a boycott of the triple MMR in favour of breaking it up into single measles , mumps and rubella shots , to be given at yearly intervals .
“ I ca n’t support the continued use of these three vaccines , given in combination until this issue has been resolved . ”
As the doctor campaigned , UK vaccination rates slumped : below the level needed to keep measles at bay .
Even the prime minister , Tony Blair , became embroiled in the controversy when Wakefield supporters suggested – the Blairs say wrongly – that the family ’s youngest son was not vaccinated with MMR .
Meanwhile in America , a ferocious anti-vaccine movement took off after Wakefield toured US autism conferences and , in November 2000 , appeared on the CBS network ’s 60 Minutes programme linking MMR with what he called an “ epidemic of autism ” .
This was followed by campaigners ’ claims that all vaccines are suspect : either due to their content , or because of the number given to children .
“ In 1983 the shot schedule was ten .
That ’s when autism was one in 10,000 .
Now there ’s 36 , and autism is one in 150 , ” argued American actress Jenny McCarthy , who blamed MMR for her own son ’s autism , and gained the highest profile in the US movement .
“ All arrows point to one direction . ”
Andrew Wakefield unmasked
But as journalists queued to report on parents ’ fears , Brian Deer was assigned to investigate the crisis , and unearthed a scandal of astounding proportions .
He discovered that , far from being based on any findings , the public alarm had no scientific basis whatsoever .
Rather , Wakefield had been secretly payrolled to create evidence against the shot and , while planning extraordinary business schemes meant to profit from the scare , he had concealed , misreported and changed information about the children to rig the results published in the journal .
Before Deer ’s inquiries , Wakefield had appeared to all the world to be an independent , if controversial , researcher .
Tall and square - headed , with hooded eyes and a booming voice , he was the son of doctors ( a neurologist and a family practitioner ) , had grown up in Bath , a prosperous west - of - England spa town , and joined the Royal Free in November 1988 after training in Toronto , Canada .
His demeanour was languid – he was privately educated – and , born in 1956 , he was a lingering example of the presumed honour of the upper middle class .
But Deer ’s investigation – nominated in February 2011 for two British Press Awards – discovered that , while Wakefield held himself out to be a dispassionate scientist , two years before the Lancet paper was published – and before any of the 12 children were even referred to the hospital – he had been hired to attack MMR by a lawyer , Richard Barr : a jobbing solicitor in the small eastern English town of King ’s Lynn , who hoped to raise a speculative class action lawsuit against drug companies which manufactured the triple shot .
Unlike expert witnesses , who give professional advice and opinions , Wakefield had negotiated an unprecedented contract with Barr , then aged 48 , to conduct clinical and scientific research .
The goal was to find evidence of what the two men claimed to be a “ new syndrome ” , intended to be the centrepiece of ( later failed ) litigation on behalf of an eventual 1,600 British families , recruited through media stories .
This publicly undisclosed role for Wakefield created the grossest conflict of interest , and the exposure of it by Deer , in February 2004 , led to public uproar in Britain , the retraction of the Lancet report ’s conclusions section , and , from July 2007 to May 2010 , the longest - ever professional misconduct hearing by the UK ’s General Medical Council ( GMC ) .
Barr [ audio ] paid the doctor with money from the UK legal aid fund : run by the government to give poorer people access to justice .
Wakefield charged at the extraordinary rate of £ 150 an hour – billed through a company of his wife ’s – eventually totalling , for generic work alone , what the UK Legal Services Commission , pressed by Deer under the freedom of information act , said was £ 435,643 ( then about $ 750,000 US ) , plus expenses .
These hourly fees – revealed in The Sunday Times in December 2006 – gave the doctor a direct personal , but undeclared , financial interest in his research claims : totalling more than eight times his reported annual salary and creating an incentive not only for him to launch the alarm , but to keep it going for as long as possible .
In addition to the personal payments , Wakefield was awarded an initial £ 55,000 , which he had applied for in June 1996 , but which , like the hourly fees , he never declared to the Lancet as he should have done , for the express purpose of conducting the research later submitted to the journal .
This start - up funding was part of a staggering £ 26.2 m of taxpayers ’ money ( more than $ 56 m US at 2014 prices ) eventually shared among a small group of doctors and lawyers , working under Barr ’s and Wakefield ’s direction , trying to prove that MMR caused the previously unheard - of “ syndrome ” .
Yet more surprising , Wakefield had asserted the existence of such a syndrome – which allegedly included what he would dub “ autistic enterocolitis ” – before he performed the research which purportedly discovered it .
This Barr - Wakefield deal was the foundation of the vaccine crisis , both in Britain and throughout the world .
“ I have mentioned to you before that the prime objective is to produce unassailable evidence in court so as to convince a court that these vaccines are dangerous , ” the lawyer reminded the doctor in a confidential letter , six months before the Lancet report .
And , if this was not enough to cast doubt on the research ’s objectivity , The Sunday Times investigation unearthed another shocking conflict of interest .
In June 1997 – nearly nine months before the press conference at which Wakefield called for single vaccines – he had filed a patent on products , including his own supposedly “ safer ” single measles vaccine , which only stood any prospect of success if confidence in MMR was damaged .
Although Wakefield denied any such plans , his proposed shot , and a network of companies intended to raise venture capital for purported inventions – including “ a replacement for attenuated viral vaccines ” , commercial testing kits and what he claimed to be a possible “ complete cure ” for autism – were set out in confidential documents .
One Wakefield business was awarded £ 800,000 from the legal aid fund on the strength of ( later discredited ) data which he had co-authored .
And , even as the Lancet paper was being prepared , behind the scenes he was negotiating extraordinary plans to exploit the public alarm with secret schemes that would line his pockets .
“ Disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield plotted to make £ 28 million a year from the MMR jab panic he triggered , ” was how the British tabloid newspaper The Sun , for example , reported in January 2011 on this disclosure from Deer .
Behind the veil
As with the researcher , so too with his subjects .
They also were not what they appeared to be .
In the Lancet , the 12 children ( 11 boys and one girl ) had been held out as merely a routine series of kids with developmental disorders and digestive symptoms , needing care from the London hospital .
That so many of their parents blamed problems on one common vaccine , understandably , caused public concern .
But Deer discovered that nearly all the children ( aged between 2 ½ and 9 ½ ) had been pre-selected through MMR campaign groups , and that , at the time of their admission , most of their parents were clients and contacts of the lawyer , Barr .
None of the 12 lived in London .
Two were brothers .
Two attended the same doctor ’s office , 280 miles from the Royal Free .
Three were patients at another clinic .
One was flown in from the United States .
Get Deer ’s book : The Doctor Who Fooled the World
The investigation revealed , moreover , that the paper ’s incredible purported finding – of a sudden onset of autism within days of vaccination – was a sham : laundering into medical literature , as apparent facts , the unverified , vague – and sometimes altered – memories and assertions of a group of unnamed parents who , unknown to the journal and its readers , were bound to blame MMR when they came to the hospital because that was why they had been brought there .
Wakefield , a former trainee gut surgeon , denied this .
But the true number of families accusing MMR was n’t eight , as the paper said : it was 11 of the 12 ( later all 12 ) and in most cases records noted parents ’ compensation claims before the children were referred .
“ Mum taking her to Dr Wakefield , Royal Free Hospital for CT scans / gut biopsies , ” wrote one family doctor in the north - east of England , for example , before referring the only little girl in the project ( who did not have inflammatory bowel disease ) .
“ ? Crohn ’s — will need ref letter — Dr W to phone me .
Funded through legal aid . ”
In the light of such discoveries , the case was overwhelming to dig deeper into Wakefield ’s findings .
In an exercise never before accomplished by a journalist , Deer was able to exploit the GMC hearing to go behind the face of the 1998 paper , identify the subjects , and access patient data .
Penetrating veils of medical and legal confidentiality , he discovered that the hospital ’s clinicians and pathology service had found nothing to implicate MMR , but that Wakefield had repeatedly changed , misreported and misrepresented diagnoses , histories and descriptions of the children , which made it appear that the syndrome had been discovered .
As first revealed in The Sunday Times in February 2009 , the effect was to give the impression of a link between MMR , bowel disease and the sudden onset of autism when otherwise none was evident .
Standard , but unreported , blood tests for inflammation in the children were normal .
And what the hospital ’s clinicians and pathology service actually found in the children ’s guts was severe constipation , with predominantly normal [ table ] biopsies and benign or normal features .
When taken together with developmental histories and diagnoses , moreover , not one case was free of critical mismatches between the paper which launched the vaccine crisis and the kids ’ contemporaneous records .
Some children were a cause for concern before vaccination .
Some were deemed normal months afterwards .
Some did not have autism at all .
“ If my son really is Patient 11 , then the Lancet article is simply an outright fabrication , ” said the father of the penultimate child in the series – admitted to the Royal Free , at age 5 , from northern California and whose history was falsely reported in the paper .
Protections sidelined
In addition to finding that the study had been rigged , the investigation uncovered a raft of further issues , including irregularities in ethical supervision .
Research on patients is governed by national and international standards – particularly the Helsinki declaration – and no reputable hospital review board would have endorsed the kind of fishing expedition Wakefield embarked on for Barr .
Without that endorsement , moreover , no reputable medical journal would have published any resulting paper .
Against that background , to satisfy the Lancet ’s patient - protection requirements , but without revealing to hospital authorities what was really going on , Wakefield falsely reported that a gruelling five - day battery of invasive and distressing procedures performed on the kids – including anaesthesia , ileocolonoscopies , lumbar punctures , MRI brain scans , EEGs , radioactive drinks and x-rays – proposed for the lawsuit , was approved by the Royal Free ’s ethics committee .
But Deer revealed that , despite the research being executed on the uniquely vulnerable , developmentally challenged children of sometimes distraught parents hoping for money , the ethics committee was not told the truth about the project , and had given no such approval .
Responding to Deer in 2004 , Wakefield and his key associates , paediatricians John Walker - Smith and Simon Murch , denied this explosive discovery and issued a formal statement .
But , after being confronted with the proof at the GMC hearing , they changed their story and – despite clear rules – now argued they needed no approval .
The investigation also probed Wakefield ’s basic science .
The story was much the same .
He had obtained the legal money and planned his business ventures against a theory of his own that the culprit for both inflammatory bowel disease and autism was persistent infection with measles virus , which is found live as a normal part of MMR .
But Deer revealed on Channel 4 that sophisticated , unreported , molecular tests carried out in Wakefield ’s own lab had found no trace of measles in the children ’s guts and blood .
Those tests were among a string which found no evidence of the virus .
The Sunday Times also disclosed critical flaws in one apparently positive study , which involved materials supplied by Wakefield .
This had misled thousands of families affected by autism , both in the UK and the US , ensnared for years in hopeless litigation based almost entirely on his measles theory .
Deer ( who in April 2006 reported the first British measles death in 14 years ) took no view on whether vaccines may or may not cause autism , but never found any scientific material which repeated the Lancet findings .
Although all kinds of children , including those with autism , suffer from digestive issues , he learnt of a mass of authoritative research which rebutted Wakefield ’s claims .
“ Specifically , numerous studies have refuted Andrew Wakefield ’s theory that MMR vaccine is linked to bowel disorders and autism , ” was how the American Academy of Pediatrics summarised the consensus in an August 2009 statement to NBC News for a Dateline programme featuring both Wakefield and Deer .
“ Every aspect of Dr Wakefield ’s theory has been disproven . ”
The impact of the investigation has been felt around the world , with media coverage from New Zealand to Canada .
In the UK , the revelations prompted a 2004 statement by the prime minister , a collapse in the anti-MMR campaign , and a rebound in vaccination levels .
In the US – where the Barr - Wakefield deal was joined by allegations marshalled by American attorneys that a mercury - based vaccine preservative , thimerosal , was also at fault – findings by Deer were presented by the Department of Justice in federal court , followed in February 2009 by scathing judgments .
After hearing a test case of petitions from some 5,000 families , one presiding judge said : “ Therefore , it is a noteworthy point that not only has that ‘ autistic enterocolitis ’ theory not been accepted into gastroenterology textbooks , but that theory , and Dr Wakefield ’s role in its development , have been strongly criticized as constituting defective or fraudulent science . ”
Wakefield denies everything
In response to Deer , Wakefield supporters denied that he took money for research , and , amid a barrage of sometimes paid - for smears and crank abuse of the journalist , lauded the doctor as a “ hero “ .
But the father - of - four ’s deceits had not only triggered the resurgence of sometimes fatal or brain - disabling measles outbreaks , plunged countless parents into the hell of believing it was their own fault for agreeing to vaccination that a son or daughter had developed autism , and misled an ethics committee over child rights and safety , but it was discovered that he had gone as far as to betray a vaccine safety whistleblower whose identity he discovered and had bought blood from children as young as four years old , attending a birthday party , and then joked about them crying , fainting and vomiting .
Get Deer ’s book : The Doctor Who Fooled the World
Meanwhile , Wakefield denied any conflicts of interest and claimed he never even said that MMR caused autism .
But documents – including patents – evidenced his claims , and he published a string of further falsified reports to undermine the vaccine .
Even when he knew that his allegations had been proven baseless , he was found promoting them from a controversial business in Austin , Texas , called Thoughtful House , where – after being fired from the Royal Free in October 2001 , following his refusal to repeat the Lancet study with a larger number of children – he held a $ 280,000 - a - year post , spun from his campaign .
Throughout the investigation , Wakefield refused to co-operate , filed baseless complaints and issued statements denying every aspect .
He also initiated , sought to stall and then abandoned with some £ 1.3 m ( $ 2 m ) costs , a two - year “ gagging ” libel lawsuit , financed by the Medical Protection Society , which defends doctors against their patients .
In reply , Deer and Channel 4 pressed for a speedy trial , publicly accusing Wakefield of being “ unremittingly evasive and dishonest ” .
His conduct in the litigation was also damned by a High Court judge , who said that Wakefield “ wished to extract whatever advantage he could from the existence of the proceedings while not wishing to progress them ” , and that the doctor was using the lawsuit as “ a weapon in his attempts to close down discussion and debate over an important public issue ” .
Wakefield paper retracted
Faced with overwhelming proof of misconduct , Wakefield would concoct a preposterous conspiracy theory to account for his exposure , and denied rigging his results .
“ The notion that any researcher can cook such data in any fashion that can be slipped past the medical community for his personal benefit is patent nonsense , ” he argued in a March 2009 statement .
“ Scientific rigor requires repeatability for verification of any research and Mr Deer ’s implications of fraud against me are claims that a trained physician and researcher of good standing had suddenly decided he was going to fake data for his own enrichment . ”
But on 28 January 2010 – after 197 days of evidence , submissions and deliberations – a panel of three doctors and two lay members hearing the GMC case handed down verdicts which wholly vindicated Deer .
Branding Wakefield “ dishonest ” , “ unethical ” and “ callous ” , they found him guilty ( against a criminal standard of proof ) of some three dozen charges , including four of counts of dishonesty ( including one that Wakefield himself submitted through counsel to be a charge of “ fraud ” ) and 12 involving the abuse of developmentally - challenged children .
His research was found to be dishonest and performed without ethical approval .
Five days later , the Lancet fully retracted the paper from the scientific literature as “ utterly false “ , prompting international media interest and further retractions .
“ What is indisputable is that vaccines protect children from dangerous diseases , ” said The New York Times , in one of a string of editorials in leading newspapers .
“ We hope that The Lancet ’s belated retraction will finally lay this damaging myth about autism and vaccines to rest . ”
Three weeks later , on 17 February 2010 , Wakefield was ousted by the directors of his Texas business , and on 24 May – day 217 of the GMC hearing – he was ordered to be erased from the UK doctors ’ register , ending his career in medicine .
On 21 December 2010 , that erasure was confirmed after he abandoned a court appeal against the verdicts .
Journal calls the fraud
Later , in January 2011 , BMJ , the British Medical Journal , developed the investigation with a three - week package of disclosures and editorials , including three major reports by Deer .
The package ( which involved peer - review and separate editorial checking of key evidence and documents ) also included an introduction by Deer , Piltdown medicine , explaining the fraud and comparing it with Britain ’s most notorious scientific forgery .
In editorials , the BMJ called Wakefield ’s research “ an elaborate fraud ” and accused the Royal Free medical school and the Lancet of “ institutional and editorial misconduct “ .
Among hundreds of media reports worldwide on the BMJ revelations – which were covered by all north American networks and reached almost half of Americans surveyed days later in a Harris poll – The New York Times said in a second editorial on the affair : “ Now the British Medical Journal has taken the extraordinary step of publishing a lengthy report by Brian Deer , the British investigative journalist who first brought the paper ’s flaws to light – and has put its own reputation on the line by endorsing his findings . ”
Three months later , Deer ’s personal journey reached a turning point when in April 2011 he was named specialist journalist of the year in the British newspaper industry ’s annual Pulitzer - style Press Awards .
Judges for the Society of Editors praised what they called his “ outstanding perseverance , stamina and revelation on a story of major importance ” .
They said of his investigation : “ It was a tremendous righting of a wrong ” .

Five or six years ago , I had a number of meetings with some of the big PC manufacturers .
I suggested they take a close look at Danger and the innovative interface used for the company 's Hiptop handset .
At the time , most cell phones had very simple e-mail interfaces .
Very few even attempted to connect to the Internet .
But Danger had a clear vision of what phone could become , creating what I would consider the granddaddy of today 's smartphone interfaces .
By that point , it was becoming clear to some of us analysts that smartphones were actually small computers .
If PC companies were going to stay ahead of the curve , they would have to add a handset to their line soon .
At the time , I was very intrigued by Danger 's interface .
It was so well designed that it could be deployed on a TV , PC , smartphone , or just about any other digital device .
Such a UI could help one of these companies deliver a similar experience across devices .
And people would only have to learn to use the interface once .
Ironically , Microsoft ultimately purchased Danger .
To date , the company has not employed this smart UI on any of its products .
The genius behind Danger was a guy named Andy Rubin .
He left the company before it was acquired by Microsoft , in order to begin working on a secret phone OS that would eventually get Google 's attention .
Google bought Rubin 's small startup .
The mobile OS eventually became Android , which , as you know , has since become the hottest OS in the smartphone space , having been adopted by dozens of handset vendors around the world .
I was reminded of Android 's power while walking the CTIA show floor in Las Vegas .
The show should have been called Android World .
A good number of the handset companies I met with had some version of Android on their smartphones , and a number showed me new product behind the scenes that use the OS .
I also saw at least five tablets ( most behind the scenes ) running Android that are set to come out in the next six months .
The most innovative products I saw at the show were based on Android .
Take the Samsung Galaxy S , which runs the OS and sports a four inch AMOLED screen .
It 's the best screen that I have ever seen on a smartphone .
Images on the phone are crisp and bright and are even clear out in the sunlight .
Samsung wo n't say when it is coming to the US , but it could be one of the more important Android phones to launch this year .
The Motorola i1 is a new rugged and sleek push - to - talk handset that runs Android .
At the press conference , Motorola let people play shuffleboard with the handset to show just how rugged it is .
Kyocera also announced an Android handset the ZIO .
The phone has a beautiful 3.5 inch screen , 3.2 megapixel camera , and stereo Bluetooth .
It will cost $ 250 unlocked .
If CTIA had a Best of Show award , it would have gone to Sprint 's EVO 4G WiMax phone .
The handset has a 4.3 inch screen , 1 GHz SnapDragon processor , 1GB of internal storage , WI - FI , HDMI out , and the ability to act as a WI - FI router for up to eight devices .
It 's a stunning phone that uses a version of Android that looks more like a Pocket PC OS than a cell phone OS .
Dell debuted the Mini - Tablet 5 , the company 's first Android tablet for the US .
It has a five inch screen perfect for Web browsing .
However , even though Dell says that the device will fit in your pocket , it 's really not a smartphone .
You would n't hold it up to year ear to talk .
A Bluetooth headset makes more sense for conversations .
The product is what I call a " tweener . "
It 's not really a smartphone , and it's not really an iPad - like tablet .
I 'm not really sure who the audience will be on this one .
On the other hand , the tablet has a really cool design and its light weight , compact design could be of interest to some users .
Android is steadily becoming the go - to OS for smartphones and tablets .
It 's even showing up on some set - top boxes and smart Blu - Ray players .
But it's in the smartphone and tablet spaces that the mobile OS will have its greatest impact .
Although Nokia and RIM were well represented and Microsoft and Palm each had booths at the show , most other major handset manufacturers like Samsung , HTC , and LG were in the Android camp .
It 's clear why many market research firms believe that Android will be the number one or two smartphone OS in the next two years .
It 's also clear why Android is at the heart of the Apple / Google battle .
Apple should be keeping an eye on Windows Phone 7 , sure , but it 's Android that is likely to be the biggest threat to the iPhone OS in the near future .
When Steve Jobs invited Google CEO Eric Schmidt to join Apple 's board , he likely did n't expect Schmidt to go to school on Apple 's strategy by launching its own iPhone challenger .
No wonder Jobs is upset at Google .
A garda investigation is under way into a number of cyber attacks on computer systems of small businesses and subsequent demands for money .
Criminals have been hacking into business systems , encrypting their data and demanding money for codes to unlock the information .
The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is aware of extortion demands from companies in the midlands and west of the country and is investigating the cases .
The companies say their computer systems were hacked , their data such as order books and customer data had been encrypted and their businesses paralysed .
They told gardaí that there was a note left on their computers demanding money - in one case $ 700 for the code to unlock the information .
The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has consulted specialists from the UCD Cybercrime Centre to help with the investigation .
Detectives say they believe the crime is being committed from outside the country , the amounts demanded are small , and businesses without adequate security systems are being affected .
They are asking companies that have been targeted to contact gardaí .
Planet of the ( Amazingly Funky ) Apes
It 's going to be a busy day here at Topless Robot ,
One of David Cameron 's independent efficiency experts who identified the £ 12bn spending savings an incoming Conservative government could make this year chairs a private healthcare firm that openly admits it will benefit from NHS spending cutbacks .
Sir Peter Gershon chairs General Healthcare Group , the largest private sector health firm in the UK .
The Conservatives have relied on Gershon 's analysis of efficiency savings to enable them to promise scrapping most of the government 's planned national insurance increase – a move that has left Labour flatfooted at the outset of the election campaign .
The disclosure , which will open the Tories to the charge that they have not been transparent about the interests of a key adviser , came after the issue dominated the second day of formal campaigning .
Cameron pummelled Gordon Brown over Labour 's insistence that it had to raise NI contributions ( NICs ) – rather than cut spending immediately – in the last prime minister 's questions before polling day , and the Tories announced that they had secured the support of another 30 business leaders , taking to 68 the number who have backed their plans to scrap the rise .
The Conservatives claim that the £ 12bn savings would enable them to cut spending this year by £ 6bn and channel a further £ 6bn into other areas .
But at a potentially crucial press conference tomorrow – at which Brown and Alistair Darling , the chancellor , will attempt to stem the damage caused by the business assault on the NI rise – Labour will argue that it would be more damaging to take £ 6bn out of the economy this year than to increase Nics next year .
They will also seek to rebut the Tory claim that Labour is not willing to make efficiency savings of its own in the current financial year .
Senior Labour figures privately acknowledge that they are being severely damaged by the NICs issue , although they will draw some encouragement from a Times Populus poll that shows a Tory lead of seven points , short of the lead needed to give the Conservatives a majority .
General Healthcare Group , the company chaired by Gershon , predicts in a strategy paper published on its website that the NHS may face a " very severe contraction in its finance with an £ 8 bn - £ 10 bn cut in real terms likely in the three years from 2011 " .
It continues : " Given this lack of funding growth , there will be an increasing role for the private sector , even if NHS efficiencies can offset some of the budget pressure . "
The company has also just commissioned a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit that calls for " new thinking on funding and a growing role for the private sector " .
In his paper for the Conservative party identifying £ 12bn efficiencies this year , Gershon suggests : " A new government needs to give the best providers real control over the process of delivering a service , holding them to account for the end outcome , not the details of how the service is delivered . "
He lists private firms as one of the future providers of services designed to achieve a radical re-engineering of public services where quality is improved while costs are substantially reduced .
Gershon is a recognised expert in improving government efficiency and there is no suggestion that his report to the Tories was influenced by the fact that his firm stood to benefit from spending cuts .
Labour also supports the use of private firms in the NHS to extend choice .
A Tory source said the charge of lack of transparency was " nonsense " , adding : " Not only did Gordon Brown appoint Sir Peter Gershon as an efficiency adviser twice but , under our plans , the Department of Health is protected – efficiency savings will be invested back into the frontline . "
But David Cameron made no mention of Gershon 's business connections when he presented the efficiencies report from Gershon and Dr Martin Read .
Gershon did not respond to a request for comment tonight .
The Conservatives have built their campaign to rein back NI contributions increases next April largely on the two men's advice that the government can make an additional £ 12bn in efficiency savings this year over and above that planned by Labour .
Labour will release a 15 - page paper attacking the Gershon and Read proposals , and will also point to a prediction from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development today that Britain will experience annualised growth of 2 % during the first three months of 2010 , ahead of Germany , Japan and Italy .
Labour claimed that the OECD 's chief economist , Pier Carlo Padoan , had endorsed the Brown position .
" Although we are seeing some encouraging signs of stronger activity , the fragility of the recovery , a frail labour market and possible headwinds coming from financial markets underscore the need for caution in the removal of policy support , " he said .
Brown found himself on the ropes over NI today at what was possibly his last prime minister 's question time .
" If they know there is waste … why not cut out the waste now to stop putting up the taxes later ? "
Cameron said .
" You should not have to pay more taxes to pay for government waste .
Some people say : where are you going to find this money ?
What we are talking about is saving one pound out of every hundred pounds the government spends .
I do not think saving one pound in every hundred is particularly tough . "
The Tories later accused Brown of being at war with business after the prime minister , in an interview on GMTV , joined the business secretary , Lord Mandelson , in saying leading businessmen were being deceived by Tory propaganda .
He later tried to avoid repeating the charge .
The latest business people to endorse the Tory plan to halt the planned NI contributions rise include the Corus chief executive , Kirby Adams , the Northern Foods chief executive , Stefan Barden , Reed Elsevier 's chairman , Anthony Habgood , and Jewson 's chief executive , Peter Hind .
Read and Gershon each produced two sides of A4 for the Tories last week to claim how the £ 12bn in efficiencies could be made in 2010 - 11 in addition to those already earmarked by the government .
They produced a range of very broad measures including recruitment freezes , a one - year freeze on all new IT projects , renegotiating contracts and selling government property .
Read has held the chairmanship of the remuneration committee at British Airways since 1990 .
During that time , the basic salary of the chief executive , initially Rod Eddington , has risen from £ 486,000 to £ 735,000 in the 2008/2009 financial year ( when Willie Walsh is chief executive ) .
KIGALI , Rwanda —
It ’s a Thursday night in the Rwandan capital and the poolside bar at Hotel des Mille Collines is thumping .
Gathered under a thatched cabana , a mix of travelers , expats and well - to - do locals sip overpriced Mutzig beers , ferried by wait staff clad in bow ties and blue - checked vests .
Piercing the din of multi-lingual chatter , a piano band provides the soundtrack , crooning a mix of local favorites and Western pop , including the obligatory Hotel California .
Eager for a night ’s work , Coke - sipping single ladies — adorned with high heels , glossy lips and conspicuous buttocks — wait patiently to catch the gaze of a lonely white “ mzungu ” traveler .
It ’s a scene that could be set at almost any up - market hotel in Africa .
Yet thanks to its brush with Hollywood , the Mille Collines may be the most famous lodging on the continent .
It was here , as dramatized in the 2004 film “ Hotel Rwanda , ” that more than 1,200 refugees took shelter during the 1994 Rwandan genocide and were saved from murderous army units and Interahamwe gangs thanks to the strategy of the hotel 's cunning assistant manager Paul Rusesabagina .
Nominated for three Academy Awards , the film defines what much of the world has come to know about the genocide — 100 days of methodical killings in which more than 800,000 mainly ethnic
Tutsi lost their lives : shot , beaten or hacked to death with machetes .
Sixteen years later , after extensive renovations , the Mille Collines hotel is thriving .
Though not Kigali ’s swankiest hotel , its new rooms come with air conditioning and plasma - screen TVs , and its Panorama restaurant is one of the city ’s finest .
Belgian - owned during the genocide , the hotel was purchased , after years of decline , in 2005 by Rwandan magnate Miko Rwayitare .
The since deceased Rwayitare , said current assistant manager Paul Ntaganda , provided the vision to revamp the establishment into the “ kind of hotel that is demanded today on the market . ”
In a sense , the Mille Collines ’ rebirth is one that parallels the rise of Rwanda — a country that is now safe , orderly and home to one of the fastest growing economies in Africa .
Yet Rwanda is also a nation where many freedoms deemed sacred in the west are compromised .
The country under President Paul Kagame is a tight - lipped place — an Orwellian - tinged society where ethnic labels are ultimate taboos , except when referring to the “ Genocide against the Tutsi , ” the official refrain that fails to acknowledge any reciprocal killings of ethnic Hutu .
Months away from August ’s presidential election , opposition leader Victoire Ingabire , outspoken about the need to investigate the full story , was recently prevented from leaving the country and is currently being investigated for possible charges of “ revisionism ” and “ double genocide ideology , ” punishable offenses under a strict set of laws protecting the ruling party ’s version of history .
In an April 7 speech , marking the 16th anniversary of the start of the genocide , Kagame dismissed Ingabire and her assistant Joseph Ntawangundi — who last month admitted to his role in the genocide and has since been convicted to 17 years in prison — as “ hooligans . ”
“ For those who bring us a fight , ” he promised , “ we should be able to bring them a fight they ’ll never forget . ”
Kagame ’s words might also apply to Paul Rusesabagina .
A 2005 recipient of the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , the “ Hotel Rwanda ” hero is now a prominent Rwandan dissident , whose foundation works to “ prevent future genocides and raise awareness of the need for a new truth and reconciliation process in Rwanda . ”
Rusesabagina accused Kagame of covering up the killings of Hutu and of escalating a climate of fear and political violence .
Now based in Texas , Rusesabagina is persona non grata on his home turf — decried by critics as a swindler and opportunist , who extorted money from those he ’s credited with saving and who has profited shamefully from his manufactured - in - Hollywood status .
“ Rusesabagina 's ill - gotten fame has opened new avenues for his avarice , ” reads a March 15 editorial in The New Times , Rwanda ’s official daily .
“ While he claims that his foundation is aimed at preventing future genocides , he is hobnobbing with Genocide deniers and defends Genocide criminals in various forums . …
He goes around peddling his lies and hoodwinking unsuspecting westerners that they are actually dealing with a real life hero . ”
Rather than Rusesabagina ’s resourcefulness , critics contend , it was the efforts made by friends of well - connected refugees , along with U.N. peacekeepers guarding the hotel entrance , which saved the 1,200 lives .
When asked about this debate , Mille Collines ’ current assistant manager Ntaganda said he has no strong opinion regarding his hotel ’s controversial past .
Instead , he stressed the tourist - friendly nation Rwanda has become , election - year politics notwithstanding .
“ I wish people would come and see exactly what Rwanda is , ” he told GlobalPost from the Mille Collines ’ new terrace , as children splashed in the pool below .
“ I know there are a lot of people thinking Rwanda is like a jungle or an unfriendly place because they ’ve heard stories about the genocide .
The genocide has happened but we are totally moving away from that . ”

Object - oriented programming , where is it now ?
When I was at college we learnt a little about object methods and techniques and when I left I kept reading about them .
I remember in the 90s I was incensed that an employer was NOT using object methods appropriately .
I EVEN read books about it .
You could say I was an object fan - boy .
But even I have to admit that OOP did n’t exactly deliver how I expected it would .
You may say that this is a crazy talk and that OOP was / is hugely succesful .
Shark - jumping mumbo jumbo .
But I might disagree .
In fact , sometimes I think the object - baggage we ’ve inherited is perhaps as much a hinderance as it is a help .
The wake - up call came a few months ago when I realised that almost every piece of code that I ’m in contact with these days makes only limited use of object - techniques .
Before I talk about all the ways that OOP is dead let me be clear in the ways that it is not .
Because when I say OOP is mostly - dead , I mean it is mostly dead to me .
In some areas OOP has delivered in spades .
For example in modern OO programming languages nearly all come complete with large object libraries .
This much is true .
There ’s objects in them - thar binaries for sure .
But my code ?
Not so much .
Here ’s all the ways I manage NOT to write truly object - oriented software :
The Task is Too Small
Some systems are just too small to develop a complex object class hierarchy for .
It would be a waste of time to do so .
I estimate these ‘ glue ’ applications could take up as much as 5 % of the total LOC of a large enterprise system .
It does n’t matter whether these glue applications are written in Java or Python or Bash because really they ’re just scripts .
Scripts are their own thing .
I would argue that the less scripts you have in your system the better you designed it because you ’re not just duct - taping over the seams .
The Spreadhseets Rule
I would also estimate that some appreciable percentage of your enterprise is run entirely from spreadsheets .
Whether you know about it or not .
Be it phone book , accounts , trading system or stock inventory .
These little beauties contain little or - no object code and are spread far - and - wide .
I ’ve ranted about the pervasiveness of spreadsheets before , no need to go over it again .
However , as far as I know , no - one has implemented the idea of an OO spreadsheet .
For that we can all be thankful .
World Wide Wasteland
Although the web does lend itself beautifully to model - view - controller , on the client side a lot of it is only markup and Javascript .
Neither markup nor JS have particularly strong OO characteristics and both are hugely succesful without those OO characteristics .
Indeed many WWW apps are really CRUD applications .
CRUD
The create - update - delete application is everywhere .
Be it web - or - desktop .
These apps are effectively database front - ends that organise the interactions between user and DB in a more user - centric way .
For example in .NET there ’s not much need nor desire to map your data into real - objects because the data - binding layer is phenomenally powerful at making data - bound apps quickly .
There ’s no support to help you map from data to objects to Infragistics .
Indeed , nor should there be .
Enterprise Business Objects
And this is the bit that makes me a bit sad inside .
This is what OO was really meant for .
I used to have arguments with business - analysts about the right object model to use and whether a method should exist in a base - class or a derived - class .
But now it does n’t seem like anyone , including me , really cares .
It ’s just that somewhere along the line it became a little irrelevant .
Do n’t get me wrong , I work with objects all the time .
But they ’re not really objects that were sold to me .
They ’re just data - holders or as our fathers used to say : data - records .
No Methods ?
No Object
The thing is that to me at least , without methods on your objects there ’s literally no object .
If objects does n’t respond to messages they ’re just data - records transferring data to some other module that can operate on those records .
Usually this other module takes the role of a controller .
This , to me , sounds very similar to the programming that our fathers used to - do before C++ and Java 1.1 .
So much so that it ’s tempting to break open my book on JSP .
I think there are two fundamental areas where objects failed to deliver .
Finance This
Firstly , whilst OO techniques are very flexible in some business domains they are n’t flexible in exactly the right ways for all business domains .
I ’m thinking particularly about my own area of expertise , which is financial trading systems .
The objects in trading systems tend to be difficult to compose into a meaningful hierarchy that is both expressive and not too abstract .
I think ultimately this failing is because financial instruments are actually themselves models of physical events .
This means that it ’s straight - forward enough to construct an object - model of financial instruments .
However as soon as I start innovating with my financial instruments ( i.e. construct new financial models from old ones ) the original object models tend to break - down pretty fast .
The Technology Stack Sandwich
The second reason is that there are too many different technologies involved in many enterprise - sized solution stacks to make consistent application of OO methods viable .
What does that mean ?
Well this is perhaps a post in itself but essentially as soon as you are using two or more programming languages that must share objects you ’re essentially entering an object - desert .
The End ?
Oh no .
Very definitely not .
Objects are the only way to make sense of a deep - and - wide library .
If the domain allows it they are the only way to go .
The surprise is that objects just did n’t deliver in the way that I thought that they might for me .
Which is kind - of interesting because it suggests to me that perhaps me , and a lot of people like me , might benefit from forgetting about objects sometimes and just Programming Like It ’s 1995 .

According to Polynesian legend , the stone monoliths of Easter Island were put into place by a king who invoked divine power to command the statues to walk .
Archaeologists have long preferred the more prosaic theory that they were heaved into position along a network of purpose - built tracks .
But the first British archaeological expedition in nearly a century to the archipelago , whose giant artifacts have long baffled academics and explorers , has arrived at a conclusion which threatens to overturn a 50 - year - old consensus about the role played by the island 's ancient road system .
The team , from London and Manchester , travelled to the island off Chile to examine the toppled minimalist statues which researchers have long believed were abandoned on the roadside during failed attempts to haul them from inland quarries to their final vantage points overlooking the coast .
There are about 1,000 statues , most on platforms on the island 's perimeter , with others inland in an apparently random fashion .
The theory about these inland rock effigies , which are known as moai and weigh up to 86 tons each , was first outlined in 1958 by the Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdhal , who suggested that the ancient Polynesians simply left the broken statues beside the track and they served no spiritual purpose .
But evidence from the researchers , from University College London ( UCL ) and Manchester University , has upset this convention after hi-tech equipment discovered that , far from being the detritus of clumsy construction workers , each of the tumbled statues had a stone platform and would have had pride of place on the road system as part of a religious avenue .
The discovery confirms the findings of the last British archaeologist to work on the island , Katherine Routledge , in 1914 , and suggests that rather than serving solely as a transportation route for coast - bound statues , the system of tracks criss - crossing the archipelago had a more complex role .
Researchers have long assumed that the quarry in an extinct volcano , Rano Raraku , where the statues were carved , was merely a workplace from which the roads fanned out to the coastal sites .
The latest findings show that the volcano was in fact also a sacred site .
Dr Sue Hamilton , of UCL , said : " Ever since Heyerdhal , it has been assumed that the roads were used for transportation and little else .
But what we know now is that the roads very much had a ceremonial function and the quarry was where the islanders would go because it was a sacred centre .
" The statues by the roadside were not abandoned .
They had individual platforms and faced in towards the road .
They ended up on the ground after falling over in the intervening centuries but we think it is beyond doubt that they intended to stand where they were found .
Volcano cones were considered as points of entry to the underworld by the ancient inhabitants of the island .
It seems that the volcano was a holy place .
It was the birthplace of the statues and people would come to it rather like a cathedral . "
The British team say that as the roads approach Rano Raraku , the statues become more frequent , suggesting they form the climax of a processional route to the volcano .
A FEW days after the murder in December 2007 of Benazir Bhutto , a two - time former Pakistani prime minister , the country 's then president , Pervez Musharraf , held a press conference in high spirits .
Cracking jokes about his country 's famed unruliness , the then dictator dismissed concerns about a hapless police effort to secure evidence and investigate the killing .
He suggested Ms Bhutto was partly to blame for having disregarded security warnings .
But on Thursday April 15th a high - powered UN report into Ms Bhutto 's death took a more critical view of these events .
For Mr Musharraf , now living in exile in London , and the Pakistani military establishment he once led , its conclusions should be devastating .
The report finds Mr Musharraf 's government guilty of an “ inexcusable ” failure to provide proper security to Ms Bhutto , who was campaigning for elections at the time of her murder .
“ Ms Bhutto 's assassination , ” it says , “ could have been prevented if adequate security measures had been taken . ”
Worse for Mr Musharraf and the army , the 65 - page report accuses his government and its agents of a “ deliberate ” effort to cover up the circumstances of Ms Bhutto 's murder — including hosing down the crime scene less than two hours after the attack and ensuring no post mortem was carried out on Ms Bhutto 's body .
It also finds that Pakistan 's intelligence agencies , including the main army - controlled Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , “ severely hampered ” investigations into the crime .
The report accuses Saud Aziz , police chief of Rawalpindi , the garrison city where Ms Bhutto was killed , of deliberately preventing investigators from reaching the crime scene for nearly two days .
He also ordered the hosing of the crime scene — after receiving a call , the report says , from Pakistan 's army headquarters .
The report calls an official enquiry into this damning event a “ whitewash ” .
“ Hosing down the crime scene so soon after the blast goes beyond mere incompetence , ” the report says .
“ It is up to the relevant authorities to determine whether this amounts to criminal responsibility . ”
Dispelling a popular Pakistani conspiracy theory , one of the report 's authors , Heraldo Muñoz Valenzuela , a Chilean diplomat , said there was no evidence to suggest Ms Bhutto 's widower , President Asif Zardari , was involved in her killing .
Yet the report offered encouragement to other conspiracy theories : “ While [ Ms Bhutto ] died when a fifteen - and - a - half - year - old suicide bomber detonated his explosives near her vehicle , no one believes that this boy acted alone . ”
The report casts doubt on the official Pakistani conclusion — supported by American and British spies and detectives — that Baitullah Mehsud , then head of Pakistan 's Taliban militants , was behind the killing .
“ It remains the responsibility of the Pakistani authorities to carry out a serious , credible criminal investigation that determines who conceived , ordered and executed this heinous crime of historic proportions . ”
To be fair to Mr Musharraf , some of the bungling described in the report is unremarkable in Pakistan .
For example , it notes that police deployed on rooftops around the site of Ms Bhutto 's last rally were supposed to have binoculars , but did not .
To some extent , the unhelpful role of the country 's intelligence agencies might also be less sinister than it appears .
In a country with a history of army intrigue and interventions , civilian officials are often paralysed by uncertainty over their generals ' wishes .
This might explain some of the shoddy policing — with officials reluctant to investigate Ms Bhutto 's killing in case the ISI had a hand in it .
At best , then , the report highlights the debilitating effect on Pakistan 's institutions of its periodic spells of military rule .
It also suggests the contempt the country 's uniformed leaders display towards their civilian counterparts .
Yet this is clearly not all .
The report , which was kept under wraps for two weeks at the timorous request of Mr Zardari 's government , raises serious questions about the role in the killing played by Mr Musharraf 's regime , which included Pakistan 's current army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , who led the ISI until shortly before Ms Bhutto 's murder .
Whether these mysteries will be solved is another matter — in a country where political murders rarely are .
“ The use of the term terrorism delegitimizes the opponent , ” said Martha Crenshaw , a scholar at Stanford who wrote her first essay wrestling with the definition of terrorism in 1972 .
“ It ’s not just the tactics that are discredited , it ’s the cause , as well . ”
In fact , accused terrorists often throw the label back at their accusers .
In a recording played in court last week , David B. Stone Sr. , leader of the Hutaree group , described the government as a “ terrorist organization . ”
And Doku Umarov , the Chechen guerrilla leader who claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings in the Moscow subway , took the same line in a videotaped message , suggesting that the real terrorist was his nemesis , Vladimir V. Putin , the Russian prime minister .
“ Any politician or journalist or any person who will condemn me for those operations , or who will accuse me of terrorism , I am laughing at those people , ” he said , “ because I have n’t heard that Putin was accused of terrorism for the murder of civilians . ”
The word originated in the context of large - scale violence by the state : the Jacobin Reign of Terror during the French Revolution , when 16,000 to 40,000 people were killed in 13 months .
The Latin root “ terrere ” means “ to cause to tremble , ” and one essential notion in most definitions of terrorism is that it seeks to frighten the enemy , as well as to inspire allies .
Over time , terrorism has come to be applied more commonly to the violent tactics of nonstate groups , often in a campaign of repeated attacks .
The targets are often chosen for symbolic reasons ( the World Trade Center , the Pentagon ) , and the victims usually include civilians .
The acts of terror seek to influence an audience , ostensibly in service of a political goal .
The anarchist movement before and after the turn of the 20th century spoke of the “ Propaganda of the Deed , ” a phrase that captures both the violence and its purported political purpose .
Their deeds included the assassination of numerous politicians and world leaders , including President William McKinley in 1901 , and they were the rare militants who did not shun the terrorism label .
“ They called themselves terrorists and they were proud of it , ” said David C. Rapoport , a historian of terrorism and editor of the journal Terrorism and Political Violence .
Tusayan becomes Arizona 's newest and smallest town
TUSAYAN - This gateway to the Grand Canyon established its first Town Council on Tuesday , the result of a vote a month earlier to incorporate so residents could choose their own leaders , plan how their land is used and control public services .
On Wednesday , a process server crashed its inaugural meeting , handing out subpoenas from a lawsuit filed to overturn the public vote and dissolve the council .
In Tusayan , " fighting city hall " has reached a new degree .
A 20 - year battle between the town 's most prominent landowners has escalated into a challenge to Arizona 's newest town itself .
At stake is control of tourism development and the dollars that come with it .
Nestled in pine forest 1 mile south of Grand Canyon National Park , the tourist stopover covers 144 acres .
It is , as Fire Chief Robert Evans noted , " a wide spot on Highway 64 with a lot of hotels . "
Nothing iconic or memorable here .
Just the relentless throbbing of tourist - filled helicopters and a life - size elk sculpture on the sidewalk bearing a sign that says , " Keep off the elk ! "
About 17,000 visitors pass through daily , but only 500 or so people call Tusayan home .
Tusayan is the tiniest town in Arizona by size and third - smallest by population .
Yet when it comes to political turmoil , this place looms as deep and divided as the Canyon itself .
Put simply , Tusayan is a company town controlled by opposing land barons who have spent millions of dollars planning their own projects and trying to thwart the other's .
On one side is the Thurston family , which for three generations has owned nearly half of Tusayan 's real estate , including a water company and the Red Feather Lodge .
On the other side is the Stilo Group , which also controls nearly half of the property .
The partnership includes Italian investors and a local family headed by Elling Halvorson , who operates a water company , the Squire Inn , Papillon Helicopters and other businesses .
Over the years , those two groups hired some of Arizona 's most aggressive legal guns , persuaded the state Legislature to pass special laws , filed lawsuits , pressed for criminal investigations and used hotshot public - relations firms from Phoenix to assail and insult each other .
The latest skirmish , last month 's vote on incorporation , was the second such election in as many years .
The Thurstons sued in an unsuccessful effort to stop the balloting .
After voters approved the measure , the Thurstons sued again to overturn the results .
Their civil complaint in Coconino County Superior Court says the election was unconstitutional and fraudulent .
A judge is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday .
Roller coaster ' nightmare '
It would take a book to recount the turbulent history of this former potato patch .
By most accounts , trouble began in the early 1990s when investors from Italy proposed an outlet mall in Tusayan .
Later , another Italian group began buying ranch properties near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon .
Their idea was to swap more than 2,000 acres of private land for 270 acres of federal property and build a $ 250 million project known as Canyon Forest Village .
It would include thousands of hotel rooms and visitor attractions .
There was even talk of a roller coaster .
" That was my worst nightmare - roller coasters at the Grand Canyon , " said Clarinda Thurston Vail , who manages the family 's properties and just got named to the Town Council .
In the 1990s , the Thurstons and Halvorsons worked with environmentalists to block Canyon Forest Village and launched a movement to incorporate Tusayan so that residents could stop the development .
At the time , Arizona law required at least 1,500 residents before a town could form .
Special legislation was adopted to exempt Tusayan .
The Italians sued , and the law was ruled unconstitutional .
But in 2000 , Coconino County voters overwhelmingly rejected the project , and it was never built .
But the Italian investors did not give up on their goal for development in Tusayan .
In 2004 , they acquired half interest with Halvorson in an 18 - acre campground , one of the largest undeveloped parcels in the community .
Suddenly , Tusayan 's leading entrepreneur was aligned with the Italian developers , who adopted a new name : the Stilo Group .
Their joint venture began pushing for incorporation , hoping that a small town council would allow development .
The Legislature had revised the incorporation law in 2003 .
Tusayan voters rejected that idea in a 2008 election marred by allegations of bribery and fraud .
The Stilo Group persisted , scheduling another ballot last month .
As the election neared , voter rolls grew 39 percent , with many registrants listing addresses in the campground .
Attorneys for the Thurstons sought a grand - jury investigation of election fraud .
They filed suit to block the election , but the case was dismissed .
PR battleground
With fewer than 200 voters to influence , the campaign grew nasty and expensive as rival PR firms transformed Tusayan into a personal battleground .
One of the companies , Rose & Allyn Public Relations , represents the Thurstons .
The other , Policy Development Group headed by Ron Ober , works for Halvorson and Stilo Group .
Tusayan residents were inundated with campaign fliers , videos and Internet messages .
A mock news broadcast by Ober 's team ridiculed Vail of the Thurston family as " queen ruler of Tusayan " and described PR company President Jason Rose as " leader of the long - haired freaky people . "
Rose answered with ads warning of a Tusayan takeover by " the Italians " and painting Ober as " a former friend and ally of convicted banker Charlie Keating . "
The campaign 's big issue was housing .
There are fewer than a dozen single - family homes in Tusayan .
Employees reside in company - owned dormitories and trailers or commute more than 20 miles to work .
Stilo Group said incorporation would allow the construction of houses for workers as well as hotels or restaurants .
Opponents scoffed , noting that Tusayan land is valued at $ 500,000 per acre , hardly accessible to waitresses earning $ 9 an hour .
Bob Blasi , a Forest Service employee who sought a council seat , said the dispute became so hateful that friendships were severed and Tusayan 's social network shredded .
" There are places I wo n't dare walk into because I probably would n't be served , " Blasi said .
" And , if I was served , I would n't dare eat the food for fear of what might be in it . "
Voters approved incorporation , with more than 60 percent in support .
Coconino County supervisors last week appointed the first Town Council , selecting five names , until a new Town Council can be elected later .
Two of the appointees , Vail and Ann Wren , led the anti-incorporation campaign .
Vail had previously sued to block the election .
The appointment of two people to sit on the Town Council who opposed the establishment of the town itself did n't sit well with some .
" That just does n't pass the smell test , " complained Troy Corder , a public - relations representative for Stilo .
" It tells the people of Tusayan , ' Your opinion does n't matter . ' "
Two other appointees , Greg Bryan and Al Montoya , are employed by the Halvorson family and favored incorporation .
The fifth council member , Pete Shearer , also works for Halvorson but is married to one of the anti-incorporation leaders .
Shearer assumed a poker face when asked which side he's on : " I 'm for the majority of the voters , " he said .
" We need to come together and start the healing process . "
Glaring conflicts likely
There is scant evidence of a cure , however .
The Thurston family is suing to unincorporate Tusayan , using the same arguments and lawyers that Vail employed in her unsuccessful civil complaint .
Vail said she is not out to sabotage the new town , but she refused to take a position on the lawsuit , declaring , " I 'm not involved . "
If Tusayan survives challenges to incorporation , the vested interests of leadership loom as problematic .
All five council appointees are likely to have glaring conflicts when it comes to approving or rejecting land - use plans :
They either own competing properties or are beholden to an owner who pays their salaries .
Tom Belshe , deputy director with the League of Arizona Cities and Towns , told council members during their first meeting that they must submit financial disclosure statements and recuse themselves where there are entanglements .
" Conflicts can be a significant problem in small communities , " Belshe later said .
" There could be some tricky issues . "
Meanwhile , the town 's laborers can only watch and wonder .
Juan Calderon , a housekeeper at one of the hotels , said he'd like to see more housing but fears a tax increase .
Otherwise , he has no real stake in the feud .
" My life is go to work , go to my place , go to sleep , " Calderon said .
" Then I go to work again . "
Will anyone speak up for Arizona and its new immigration law ?
The state abused by Jon Stewart as the “ meth lab ” of democracy has been forced to deal alone with a problem created and then ignored by the national government .
Arizona ’s answer is not perfect , but it is not unreasonable either — and should jerk the national conscience to attention .
Imagine yourself a landowner in southern Arizona .
The border between San Diego and Tijuana is now effectively fenced , so the flow of illegal immigration has been diverted to your front yard .
Every morning you wake up to a hillock of garbage : plastic bottles , food remains , human urine and feces .
If you try to police your land , you put your life at risk : Last month , Arizona rancher Rob Krentz was murdered on his own property , likely by a marijuana - smuggling illegal migrant .
Mexico ’s drug war has reached into Arizona cities .
Federal authorities capture an average of 1.5 tons of marijuana per day in Arizona .
Drug - related kidnappings , tortures , and murders of illegals by illegals have made Phoenix one of the most violent cities in the United States .
Illegals crowd hospital emergency rooms , crash uninsured cars , and transform overbuilt neighborhoods into rooming house slums .
Their children have the right , under a 1982 Supreme Court decision , to attend local schools at local expense , crowding the classrooms of native - born children , whose educations are further undermined when substantial numbers of their classmates cannot speak English .
Yet not only does the law go unenforced , not only has work not even started on the immigration fence that Congress supposedly voted to build two years ago , but the authorities in Washington keep talking up a proposed amnesty ( sorry : “ pathway to citizenship ” ) that only invites more illegals to rush into the U.S. to take advantage of this dazzling opportunity .
And when people complain , when a state legislature like Arizona ’s takes what action it can against a crisis incubated over 20 years by an unspoken federal policy to look the other way — they are vilified as haters and racists .
The most effective section of the new Arizona law grants local police the same powers to deal with illegal migrants that New York City used in the 1990s to deal with illegal guns .
Police cannot stop people on mere suspicion .
They can not stop them for being brown .
But IF police have stopped someone for an offense or infraction — drunk driving , for example — they can then ask for proof of legal residency , just as New York City police will search a car for illegal weapons .
In the past , such a request by Arizona police would have been a waste of time , since police lacked the power to act even if they had apprehended an illegal migrant .
Now that illegal immigration has been made an offense under state law ( in addition to federal law ) , police can detain an illegal .
Obviously Arizona does not have facilities to detain the estimated 600,000 or more illegals in the state .
But it can at least get the drunk drivers off the streets ( a large and deadly problem in the state ) .
It can hold for deportation those with a history of involvement in the drug trade without having to initiate further lengthy legal procedures .
And it can prod a reluctant federal immigration service into action .
The true benefit of Arizona ’s new law however is not deportation , but deterrence .
Amnesty proponents often argue that it would be impossible to round up and expel the estimated 12 million illegals in the U.S.
They are right , of course .
But it would be very possible to enforce immigration law in such a way that illegal immigration becomes a less attractive proposition , by discouraging illegal entry and encouraging those who are here illegally to return home of their own accord .
New York City did not reduce gun violence in the 1990s by arresting everyone who violated a gun possession law .
It took relatively few arrests to persuade potential lawbreakers to alter their behavior and leave their guns at home .
The experience of the past two years has shown that migration responds swiftly to changing incentives .
The Center for Immigration Studies has tracked monthly census data for young Hispanic males with low levels of education — a good proxy for the illegal immigrant population .
Between the summer of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009 , that population actually declined .
Extrapolating from survey figures , CIS estimates that the illegal population in the U.S. dropped by 1.7 million during the recession .
The number of illegals entering the country fell by about one - third while the number returning home doubled .
States and counties that have strengthened enforcement have seen declines in the population of non-English - speaking students in local schools ( another good proxy for the illegal immigrant population ) .
Arizona ’s law seeks a similar effect .
It ’s no substitute for federal enforcement .
But it ’s a big improvement over all the loose talk of amnesty .
If you find the measure excessive , do n’t blame the state .
Blame those in Washington who made state action necessary — as the only alternative to federal inaction .

With the 2010 Bilderberg Group conference fast approaching , consensus seems to indicate that the United Kingdom or Ireland will be the likeliest location for the annual gathering of the global elite .
With the Trilateral Commission set to meet in Dublin Ireland from May 7 - 9 , some think that the occasional pattern of both the Bilderbergs and the Trilaterals holding their conference in the same geographic location will be repeated .
Sleuths on the Bilderberg.org forum have also noted that the International Economic Forum of the Americas , which this year falls on June 7 - 10 usually takes place at least three weeks after the BIlderberg conference if Bilderberg takes place in western Europe , meaning this year ’s Bilderberg confab would likely be around the middle of May .
“ If the pattern above holds , Bilderberg 2010 will be somewhere in Western Europe or the British Isles the weekend of May 14 .
If it occurs in North America , which seems less likely , it would be the weekend of June 4 , ” writes one researcher .
Others have suggested early June as a likely meeting date because the Trilaterals are convening later than usual this year – they normally hold their conference in April .
The fact that Bilderberg has taken place in North America twice out of the last four years suggests Europe will be chosen as this year ’s destination .
Bilderberg was last hosted in the UK in 1998 when the meeting was held in Scotland .
Before that , the UK played host in 1986 and 1977 .
The 12 year gap since the last meeting in the UK suggests it ’s time for the British Isles to play host once again , since there has never been a period of more than 12 years between conferences in the UK since the Bilderberg Group was formed in 1954 .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The United Kingdom has also come up as a possible location because it would coincide with the UK general election , which is due to take place on May 6 .
“ I would assume the meeting will take place prior to that date and that Cameron , who is related to Scottish Aristocracy , would be invited and subsequently selected to power , ” writes another poster .
Bilderberg has a history of acting in a Kingmaker capacity .
President Obama was rumored to have attended the 2008 conference before his election victory later that year .
There are numerous instances where Prime Ministers and Presidents have gone on to become leaders shortly after attending Bilderberg meetings , the most notable examples being Bill Clinton and Tony Blair .
Barack Obama ’s running mate Joe Biden was selected by Bilderberg luminary James A. Johnson , and John Kerry ’s 2004 running mate John Edwards was also anointed by the group after he gave a glowing speech at the conference in 2004 .
Bilderberg attendees even broke house rules to applaud Edwards at the end of a speech he gave to the elitists about American politics .
The choice of Edwards was shocking to media pundits who had fully expected Dick Gephardt to secure the position .
The New York Post even reported that Gephardt had been chosen and “ Kerry - Gephardt ” stickers were being placed on campaign vehicles before being removed when Edwards was announced as Kerry ’s number two .
A 2008 Portuguese newspaper report highlighted the fact that Pedro Santana Lopes and Jose Socrates attended the 2004 meeting in Stresa , Italy before both going on to become Prime Minster of Portugal .
The main factor that goes against the conference being held in the UK is Bilderberg ’s preference for privacy as increasing awareness of their agenda attracts more protesters and press attention .
Though the UK press cannot be relied upon to afford the event the attention it deserves , there will no doubt be hundreds of UK citizens who will descend on wherever the meeting is taking place to demonstrate .
Recent Bilderberg meetings in Canada , Turkey and Greece have attracted significant mainstream media interest as well as numerous protests .
Indeed , it ’s ironic that Bilderberg have come to rely on the American media as the most pliable in that they routinely afford almost no coverage whatsoever to an event which attracts 200 or more of the most influential people on the planet .
The 2008 conference in Chantilly Virginia was accompanied by an almost universal media blackout on behalf of the U.S. press .

About the author
( NewsTarget )
Thanks to mass fluoridation of our municipal water supplies and inclusion of man-made fluoride in toothpastes and other dental and consumer products , most of us regularly consume dangerous amounts of a dangerous form of fluoride .
Despite claims of dental health improvement , such fluoride actually leads to worse dental health as well as a host of other very serious health consequences .
Though it may be next to impossible to avoid fluoride entirely , there are many steps one can take to avoid much of the fluoride we consume as well as to eliminate existing fluoride in our bodies .
Contrary to what we have been told for many decades , man -made fluoride actually leads to fluoridosis , a condition that is marked by stained and weakened hole - filled teeth .
Notably , in Europe and US communities where there is no water fluoridation , cavities are less than in fluoridated US communities .
Even worse , fluoride can result in hyperactivity and / or lethargy , arthritis , lowered thyroid function , lowered IQ , dementia , disrupted immune system , genetic damage , cell death , cancers , deactivated essential enzymes and lower life span .
Fluoride in its natural form is actually considered an essential trace element , but we only need very tiny amounts and the natural form of fluoride is a far cry from the man -made form added to our water and products .
The natural form of mineral fluoride found in your teeth and in nature is called Apatite ( calcium fluoro - chloro - hydroxyl phosphate ) .
The unnatural form of fluoride added to our municipal water supplies is sodium fluoride - a chemical by - product of aluminum , steel , cement , phosphate , and nuclear weapons manufacturing .
Such fluoride has no nutrient value or health benefits whatsoever .
The Nazis used fluoride to dumb down the population and make it more docile and subservient .
Besides being one of the most potent rat poisons , fluoride is also one of the basic ingredients in both Prozac ( FLUoxetene Hydrochloride ) and Sarin nerve gas ( Isopropyl - Methyl - Phosphoryl FLUORIDE ) .
Before the public was sold on the idea of added fluoride , the aluminum and nuclear industries were having an increasing problem disposing of all their highly toxic fluoride waste by - products .
Now , thanks to the big lie sold to an unwitting public , we dispose of toxic fluoride waste , ingesting it and flushing it down the sewage system back into our environment .
Besides solving their toxic waste disposal problem , the manufacturing industries also reap quite the tidy profit by selling their fluoride at a markup of over 20,000 times !
Avoiding products with added fluoride , such as most commercial toothpastes and dental products , fluoridated bottled water , soft drinks and commercial milk helps reduce fluoride consumption .
Of course , living in an area whose water supply is not fluoridated is the best way to avoid most fluoride .
However , since 65 % of our water supplies are fluoridated , other steps may be needed to reduce fluoride intake .
Water filters for the kitchen which contain activated alumina reduce most of the fluoride from drinking water , but that still leaves the water used in showers and baths , swimming pools and hot tubs , and the water for vegetables .
The best solution would be to purchase a whole - house fluoride filtration system , however those range upwards of $ 2500 in price , plus installation .
When it is not feasible to filter your entire water supply , limiting time in the shower or bath and reducing the temperature helps minimize the amount of fluoride absorbed .
Another possibility is to purchase a self - contained shower system such as the ones used in camping and rustic cabins and to use filtered tap water .
Some of the better ones include gas or electric heating elements and , as a bonus , their use decreases overall water use .

Havana , May 1 , 2010 .
May 1 , 2010 -- May Day -- saw millions of people mobilising around globe to oppose attacks on workers ' rights , reverse the degradation of the environment , defend the rights of oppressed peoples and migrants and -- as in Nepal , Venezuela , Cuba and Bolivia -- to make , extend or defend unfolding revolutions .
In Nepal , Jed Brandt reports that between 500,000 and 1 million people flooded the streets on Kathmandu to demand the resignation of the government .
The massive mobilisation -- called by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) and the Young Communist League -- is the prelude to a general strike that begins May 2 .
Hundreds of thousands march in Havana .
Across Cuba , reported Prensa Latina , " millions of men , women and children packed the main squares , marched along central avenues all over the provinces and municipalities of the nation declaring their support to the revolutionary process they have freely chosen " .
In Havana , hundreds of thousands marched .
" Along Paseo Avenue and the Revolution Square ... an almost never - ending march in front of the monument to national hero Jose Marti brought together students , workers , sportspeople , professionals , technicians and even many foreign youngsters studying in Cuba .
A huge bloc of more than 10,000 women ... marched with much happiness , enthusiasm , showing an unequivocal message of their support in the historical moment Cuba is living .
The common slogan in all demonstrations was unity as the only alternative to overcome hardships and to stand up to the dangers coming from abroad , especially political harassment from Washington and some European capitals with the old illusion of finishing with the Cuban revolutionary process . "
Venezuelans marched on May 1 to celebrate International Worker 's Day .
President Hugo Chavez also implemented a 15 % wage increase , and the government broadened social security entitlements .
The main national march was in the capital Caracas , where people chanted , danced , waved placards and banners and played music as they marched towards the presidential palace Miraflores .
While there were no official or police estimates , observers estimate that 100,000 people turned out , celebrating the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution and its promotion of wage increases , better working conditions and better life conditions for the poor majority .
In Bolivia , the government of socialist president Evo Morales nationalised a number of electricity firms .
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported that " a large police contingent took over the plant of Electric Company Corani S.A. , located in the town of Colomi , 52 miles from Cochabamba .
Another group ... intervened [ at ] the facilities of the Empresa de Luz y Fuerza Electrica Cochabamba S.A.... other enterprises , Guaracachi , Valle Hermoso and Transportadora de Electricidad , were also taken over by police as part of the nationalisation process decreed by the government ...
In previous days , the Evo Morales administration advanced its intentions of nationalising three private power enterprises , subsidiaries of French and British firms . "
Morales was quoted in Al Jazeera as saying , " Basic services can not be a private business .
We are recovering the energy , the light , for all Bolivians . "

Across the United States , large rallies have been held , with opposition to attacks on immigrants being a major theme in big cities and small towns .
According the Los Angeles Times , " As many as 60,000 immigrants and their supporters joined a peaceful but boisterous march through downtown to City Hall , waving flags and holding signs blasting the harsh new immigration law in Arizona . "
However , LA police estimated the crowd at 95,000 and organisers said it was 250,000 .
In Tucson , Arizona , 15,000 protested against the racist law .
Dolores Huerta , co-founder of the United Farm Workers , said that Brewer ’s signing of SB1070 had had an unintended effect : “ It has brought el pueblo together , not only in Arizona , but across the nation ! ”
Up to 3000 protested in Washington DC .
From New York City , Billy Wharton reported :
May Day is definitely back in New York City .
The energy was high as around 30,000 people participated in two separate demonstrations .
Many in the crowd were motivated by the recent decision in Arizona to pass harsh anti-immigrant legislation .
For one day at least lower Manhattan was taken away from the yuppies and tourists who dominate it on weekends by the sheer size of the crowds .
An early march in Foley Square was organised by trade unions in New York City and more mainstream immigrant rights groups .
Fifteen thousand answered this call and carried out a march around City Hall to demand real immigration reform .
This demonstration followed up a well - attended rally on Wall Street on April 30 in support of financial regulation .
Participants in both the April 30 and May 1 were greeted by a full lineup of official union and community spokespeople .
Things were a bit more raucous at the Union Square May Day demonstration .
Speakers from several grassroots immigrants ’ rights groups were backed up by hip - hop artists and spoken - word poets .
Arizona was everywhere at this rally .
People wore buttons urging a boycott of the state , signs demanded the repeal of the anti-immigrant law SB1070 and one handmade poster described Arizona Governor Jan Brewer as “ the daughter of Hitler ” ...
Other marchers called for more systemic changes .
“ We are marching today to demand amnesty for all the undocumented ” , said Kristin Schall of the Socialist Party USA , “ If you live here and work here you deserve to have legal status . ”
Most in the march were sympathetic to this position , viewing it as an end goal for the movement .
In Turkey , Press TV reported , more than 200,000 people " gathered for the first time in 33 years in Istanbul 's Taksim Square , where dozens were killed decades ago .
The Taksim Square was declared off - limits after gunmen , during the 1977 May Day rally , killed 34 people in cold blood . "
In Palestine , more than 4000 Palestinians held May Day demonstrations near the Erez crossing with Israel and the Rafah border with Egypt to protest at the lockdown of Gaza .
Two thousand demonstrators waving red and Palestinian flags gathered near the Erez border crossing with Israel in northern Gaza in response to a call from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other left - wing groups .
Two thousand more gathered at Rafah , while hundreds of other demonstrators took part in a sit - in against the blockade -- which causes high unemployment in the impoverished territory -- at Rafah on the border with Egypt .
" We call on the world to stop the siege of Gaza and to come to the defence of Palestinian workers in all Palestinian territories " , said Ramzi Rabah , a protest organiser with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
In Auckland , New Zealand , a huge march of 50,000 turned out to march against the government 's plans to allow mining in the country 's national parks .
While not a formal May Day march , it highlighted the fact that environmental issues , particularly climate change , are a key issue for the left and progressive movement .
Greenpeace ambassador Robyn Malcolm said : " For nearly 50,000 Kiwis to turn out and be prepared to speak with one voice , must tell the government something .
And that something is this : we , the people of NZ get it ; we get the argument , we see what you ’re up to and we wo n’t have it .
Our land will always be more important to our identity than some extra dollars in the pockets of mining companies . "
According to the first capitalist press reports , in Europe hundreds of thousands took part in May 1 protests , including 300,000 in France .

May Day marches began in 1994 and have since become an annual gathering .
The themes , made crisply and vividly obvious through the chants from the protesters -- " GST : Makes Poor Poorer " , " Bantah GST " ( oppose GST ) , " Hidup rakyat " ( long live the people ) , " Hidup pekerja ( long live the workers ) , " Hari Pekerja , hari kami " ( Labour Day is our day ) and " Gaji minima " ( minimum wages ) could be heard as far as a mile away , reverberating along the bustling streets as the protesters headed towards the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall for a rally , reported Klik4Malaysia.com .
Police tried to stop the march and arrested six people , including four PSM members .

MongoDB is an open source document - oriented database system that is designed for speed and scalability in web site data operations , bridging the gap between simple " key / value " structured storage and the heavyweight requirements of relational database systems .
Like other databases in the so - called " NoSQL " vein , MongoDB trades in full ACID compliance for the ability to solve a smaller set of problems easily and quickly .
MongoDB theory
MongoDB 's data sets are called " collections " and are roughly analogous to the tables in a traditional relational database .
Unlike relational database tables , however , they have no predefined structure ( or schema , to use the canonical term ) — each record in the collection is a " document " that can potentially have a different structure than every other document in the collection .
This is not to say that MongoDB documents are unstructured , of course ; they use a key - value pair syntax modeled on the popular JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) format .
MongoDB calls this syntax BSON ( alternately expanded as " Binary JSON " and " Binary Serialized dOcument Notation " ) , and it is designed to be easily traversed , easily coded - to , and lightweight — enough so that it is also MongoDB 's network transfer format .
Document keys are strings , and values can be variety of types including strings , arrays , and even other documents .
For example , a JSON object such as
{ " firstName " : " Nathan " , " lastName " : " Willis " , " Url " : " http://www.freesoftwhere.org "
}
{ " firstName " : " Nathan " , " lastName " : " Willis " , " Url " : " http://www.freesoftwhere.org " , \ " _id " : ObjectId( 497cf6075172cf775cace8fb ) }
would appear quite simply as the document : in a MongoDB collection .
MongoDB 's query language is also based on the BSON syntax , so data can be fetched with simple expressions such as db.users.find({' lastName ' : ' Willis'} ) or sorted with db.users.find({}).sort( {lastName : 1} ) .
All of MongoDB 's queries are dynamic , however , meaning that clients can query the database on any key , without first having to calculate a " view " that indexes the data based on a particular key .
This is different from other document - oriented databases , such as CouchDB , which can perform only static queries .
The conceptual differences between MongoDB 's schema - free documents and a traditional relational database produce some limitations , but also enable some real - world speed optimizations .
Developer Richard Kreuter described MongoDB in a talk at Texas Linux Fest on April 10 .
He said that because documents are schema - free , the database can be designed to store information commonly accessed in a serial fashion within a single document — for example , a blog post 's content and all of the reply comments .
99 percent of the time , he said , they will be retrieved in precisely that order .
By not storing the post , user names , and comments in separate tables , access is substantially sped up .
The only cost is loss of the comparatively - infrequently - needed ability to atomically update the post and the comments simultaneously from different database clients .
The project lists web site content management , real - time analytics , caching , and logging as ideal use cases for MongoDB .
Highly transactional systems , on the other hand , are a poor fit , as the MongoDB server can enforce transactionality only on operations that touch a single document .
In addition to its overall document - centric design , MongoDB also offers several interesting features that database application developers are likely to find convenient .
One example is the " upsert " operation , which updates an object in a database document if the object already exists , and creates it if it does not exist .
Another example is " capped collections , " in which a collection is created with a fixed size , and the oldest entries are automatically removed .
Capped collections allow a collection to automatically retain order , but free the developer from having to manually " age - out " the oldest objects by tracking their timestamps .
MongoDB deployment and administration
MongoDB is developed primarily at 10gen , a company which offers commercial support contracts and training for MongoDB administration and development .
The latest release is version 1.4 , from March 22 , 2010 , and is under the AGPL version 3 .
The project provides packages for 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions of x86 Linux , Solaris , Windows , and Mac OS X , as well as an Apt repository for Debian and Ubuntu .
The main MongoDB server runs as the mongod process .
Packages include a shell interpreter interface called mongo , which uses JavaScript as its command language — most of the documentation and tutorials on he Mongo web site use this interface for their examples .
Language drivers are available for C , C++ , Python , Java , and Perl clients in the official packages , and C# , REST , ColdFusion , Ruby , PHP , JavaScript , and several others in community - supported add - ons .
Mongo supports several replication configurations , including the usual master - slave , as well as " replica sets " that automatically negotiate which database server functions as the master at a given point in time .
Master - master replication is supported only in a limited fashion .
Mongo is designed to be highly horizontally scalable , supporting database cluster functionality like failover , map / reduce , and sharding .
The current release supports auto - sharding , in which a routing process called mongos interacts with the client in order to abstract away the actual cluster of mongod servers .
Because Mongo does not support transactions in the sense that relational databases support them , it does not support transaction logs that enable database repair — the only real protections against data loss are backups and replication .
One other feature worth noting is that the current releases of Mongo only support username - and - password authentication that grants read - write or read - only access to a particular database .
Deployments that need stronger security or more fine - grained access control may not find Mongo a good fit .
Still , there are plenty of large - scale production MongoDB servers in the wild — most notably the web , project , and download pages on SourceForge.net , the GitHub service , and the Disqus blog - discussion - system .
Those examples and the others listed on the Mongo " production deployments " page all seem to fit broadly into the problem space that Mongo is optimized for : " high - volume , low - value data " web sites , which have little need for the transactional requirements that a relational database system like MySQL provides .
If your site also fits the pattern , MongoDB deserves a close look .

I ’m balancing on my head , and I do n’t think I ’ve ever been more relaxed .
I am one of about 30 women who have assumed similarly vertical positions early on a Sunday morning in a yoga studio on New York ’s Upper East Side .
Tibetan chants and dimmed lights block out the city ’s chaos just beyond the door .
Motivational quotes painted on the walls — jealousy works the opposite way you want it to !
— seep into my consciousness .
Seconds after our petite Indian yogi leads us through our final “ ommm , ” piercing lights flicker on .
People roll in tables of merchandise like stagehands between acts of a play , converting our urban ashram into a retail temple .
The women gathered at Lululemon Athletica — the Mecca of yoga lifestyle gear — know the drill .
The free class is over , and they lunge toward the register to retrieve their 15 % off coupons , still catching their breath from their last downward dog .
One woman already has three $ 52 Alluring tank tops in hand .
“ If you want to be successful in this industry , ” says Christine Day , Lululemon ’s CEO , “ it ’s about being authentic . ”
A cult following is the most coveted accessory in retail , and Lululemon ’s is even more lustworthy than its Velocity Gym Bag .
It was n’t built on the work of some Jobs- ian swami , however , but on the sources of Lulu founder and chairman Chip Wilson ’s own spiritual awakening .
Wilson has mixed a heady self - actualizing cocktail from equal parts Landmark Forum ( seminars based on the philosophy of Werner Erhard ) , the books of motivational business guru Brian Tracy , and Oprah - endorsed best seller The Secret , by Rhonda Byrne .
He is now hard at work formalizing them in a Lululemon “ internal constitution . ”
“ It ’s the first time I ’ve heard of anyone almost directly using the techniques of cults and applying them to their business , ” says Douglas Atkin , author of The Culting of Brands .
Drawing on those techniques , and with virtually zero advertising , Lululemon has converted the most popular yoga teachers from Beverly Hills to Boston ( and their students ) into a devoted — and self - propagating — clientele .
In a little more than 10 years , Lululemon has grown from a single storefront on the surf side of Vancouver , British Columbia , to a public company with more than 100 outlets and $ 340 million in annual revenue .
“ I have not been able to find any company that compares with what they do , ” says Suzanne Price , a retail analyst with ThinkEquity , who points to Lululemon stores ringing up $ 1,800 in sales per square foot , compared with only $ 600 for retailers such as J.Crew and Abercrombie & Fitch .
Wilson claims he did n’t start Lululemon merely to sell $ 90 leggings , but also to help his customers limber up for their journey to self - esteem and empowerment .
As he writes in the “ Chip ’s Musings ” section of the company Web site , “ The law of attraction ” — the central tenet of The Secret , that visualizing goals is the key to attaining them — “ is the fundamental law that Lululemon was built on from its 1998 inception . ”
He goes on to explain the company ’s meta-mission : “ Our vision is ‘ to elevate the world from mediocrity to greatness , ’ and we are growing so we can train more people and spread the word of The Secret — which to us at Lululemon is not so secret . ”
In the early days , Wilson learned quickly that a meditative bent can be a liability on the sales floor .
“ When we first started , we hired nothing but yogis , ” he tells me .
“ But it did n’t work because they were too slow .
So we started hiring runners who like yoga .
They ’re more on the ball , more type A. ”
Lululemon now arms its employees , or “ educators , ” with a “ learning library ” that includes Steven Covey ’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Tracy ’s The Phoenix Seminar on the Psychology of Achievement .
To celebrate their first anniversary on staff , educators are rewarded with Landmark Forum seminars .
“ We feel like Landmark is a tool , ” says Day , a 20 - year Starbucks veteran who has attended Landmark training .
“ It ’s created a culture of accountability . ”
On its Web site , Lululemon says the training program has been “ such a success that the Lululemon people have created a life for themselves that most people could only dream of . ”
That would certainly apply to Wilson , whose net worth is reportedly close to $ 370 million .
His inner voice urged him to dump almost 7 million shares when Lululemon held its U.S. IPO in the summer of 2007 , earning him more than $ 100 million [ Editor ’s Note :
He is still the largest shareholder , with 35 % . ]
TOKYO — Feeling her Toyota Mark X station wagon lurch forward at a busy intersection , Masako Sakai slammed on the brakes .
But the pedal “ had gone limp , ” she said .
Downshifting did n’t seem to work either .
“ I tried everything I could think of , ” Mrs. Sakai , 64 , said , as she recently recalled the accident that happened six months ago .
Her car surged forward nearly 3,000 feet before slamming into a Mercedes Benz and a taxi , injuring drivers in both those vehicles and breaking Mrs. Sakai ’s collarbone .
As shaken as she was by the accident , Mrs. Sakai says she was even more surprised by what happened after .
She says that Toyota — from her dealer to headquarters — has not responded to her inquiries , and Japanese authorities have been indifferent to her concerns as a consumer .
Late on a spring afternoon last year , my wife , Cheri , and I went to watch our eight - year - old son , Brody , play in the last baseball game of the season .
Out on the field was the man who had once promised me the brightest future I could imagine and then abandoned me to national disgrace .
He was hiding behind his sunglasses , talking to his son , Jack .
Cheri and I sat alone , ignored , as the other parents chatted .
Jack and his sister , Emma Claire , who used to play with our kids , looked at us with confusion in their eyes , and we overheard one of the mothers in the crowd whisper something about " the Youngs " .
When the game ended , my old friend , boss and mentor walked the long way to his car so he could avoid us .
It was the last time I would see John Edwards .
It 's hard to recall now , in the Obama era , but at one time Edwards was heralded as a potential saviour for the Democrats .
Like many others , I 'd believed he was destined to lead the party and the country .
Back then , he had given me an outlet for the powerful idealism I 'd first felt as a small boy who sat awestruck every Sunday as my father , a university chaplain in the turbulent 70s , had challenged prejudice and small - mindedness .
Having dropped out of university the first time – a shy young man , still coping with the scandal of my father 's adultery in my late teens – I went back to get a law degree and , in 1994 , became part of Democratic governor Jim Hunt 's campaign .
By the time I volunteered to work on Edwards 's campaign , I had become a fully - fledged political junkie .
In 1998 , Edwards had surprised everyone by winning the Democratic party 's nomination for the US Senate .
A superstar lawyer , he had amassed a personal fortune by suing on behalf of those injured by corporations , hospitals or individual defendants .
His most famous case involved a little girl who barely survived after being disembowelled by the suction of a pool pump .
At the end of the trial , Edwards gave a 90 - minute closing speech in which he evoked the recent death of his teenage son , Wade , in a car accident , in 1996 .
His performance won a $ 25 m verdict for his clients .
At 45 , Edwards looked as if he was in his mid-30s and brimmed with confidence .
Having grown up the son of a mill worker in North Carolina , he spoke about healthcare and education with personal authority .
During high school , he had worked cleaning soot off ceilings in the mill .
He 'd been surprised when he got into law school and surprised again when the most worldly , sophisticated and beautiful woman in his class , Elizabeth Anania , agreed to marry him .
She , too , had a successful legal career , but after Wade was killed , she retired and underwent fertility treatment , giving birth , at 48 , to Emma Claire , then later Jack .
Washington seemed to love John Edwards , and I worked overtime for him almost every day .
I quickly became the senator 's " go - to guy " and , as she got to know me as a reliable aide , Mrs Edwards could n't have been friendlier .
If it was late and she was in bed , she told me just to come on into the bedroom and put the suitcases in the closet .
" It 's all right , Andrew , " she would say .
" You 're family . "
Serious talk about Edwards running for national office began in June 2000 and , at a time when Bill Clinton 's extramarital affairs had stirred public outrage , John and Elizabeth presented themselves as a blissfully married couple .
You could see she loved him and respected him – but his candidacy , like his career , was a joint project , and he invited her criticisms .
She edited every statement he issued , no matter how minor .
In 2004 , John Kerry got the Democratic presidential nomination over Edwards , and while Kerry deliberated over who to ask to join his ticket , Edwards invited my family to join his at Disney World , paying for the trip .
In retrospect , I 'd guess we mounted this expedition primarily so the world would know the Edwardses were at the most American vacation spot if the call came for him to be vice - president , but it was a thrill for the kids .
In fact , it was n't until we were back home that Kerry finally phoned Edwards to ask him to be on the ticket .
The senator called me and said , " We 're in , Andrew , and we 're going to win it . "
We did n't win .
And by the time the votes were being counted , Edwards had other concerns on his mind : his wife had been diagnosed with cancer .
This news appeared in the media at the same time as it was filled with analysis of the election and articles predicting the senator 's political future .
Though he was widely regarded as the Democrat most likely to challenge Hillary Clinton for the 2008 presidential nomination , he downplayed his prospects , noting that for the foreseeable future he would be focused on his wife 's health .
Her cancer was aggressive , and the gruelling treatment took six months .
The senator divided his attention between her , their children and his own struggle to set a course for his political future .
During a week when Elizabeth was between treatments and strong enough to be alone , the senator and I went away together , to rest and brainstorm .
While we were away , the senator told me his wife was certain he should mount another campaign , whether or not she was sick .
He complained about her more than usual .
She had been picking fights , often about staffers she did n't trust ( she did n't trust most of his aides ) .
" Sometimes I think she 's crazy , " he said .
But it was clear that , despite the obstacles he might face , he believed he 'd occupy the Oval Office in January 2009 .
And I 'd continue to work for him as a sort of personal assistant .
When we got back , Mrs Edwards began planning the construction of her dream house .
My relationship with the Edwardses had grown so close that they felt comfortable asking me to do anything .
So I became informal project manager , in charge of chasing down the architect and contractors .
I believed I would work for the Edwardses for many years to come , so felt confident taking on the expense of building a new home of our own nearby .
But my wife Cheri worried about how entangled my life ( and hers ) had become with theirs .
I did n't listen when she said that I had come to identify too closely with the Edwardses , at the expense of my own priorities and hopes .
Instead , I trained myself to ignore the senator 's self - centredness and overlooked incidents where he seemed hypocritical .
When I heard about him having extramarital affairs , I refused to believe the stories .
When he arranged for the campaign to pay $ 100,000 to a woman with almost no experience for a video project , this mysterious person , Rielle Hunter – a woman the senator had met in a bar – was put on the payroll .
The senator first met her in early 2006 .
Born Lisa Druck and raised in Florida , she had dropped out of college and moved to New York City in her early 20s , earning a reputation as a sexually liberated party girl .
In 1991 she married attorney Alexander Hunter and changed her name to Rielle Hunter .
She did a little acting , produced a short film and studied new age religion .
By the time she met Edwards , she was 41 , divorced , unemployed and living rent - free with a friend .
According to Rielle , when she first saw him , he gave off an " energy " that told her he could be a powerful force for peace and progress , like Martin Luther King Jr .
She believed their souls had known each other in a previous life , and decided she 'd devote herself to helping him reach this potential .
The senator introduced Rielle to me as a filmmaker who was going to make brief documentaries – " webisodes " – to air on the internet , but I soon had an idea of what was going on between them .
Rielle worried me .
She was flashy and loud , and I was concerned she might do something to make public her relationship with the senator .
After one trip , when the senator stumbled into the house exhausted and flopped into bed , a secret cell phone he had left in his suitcase began to ring .
Mrs Edwards answered .
Without hearing a " Hello " , Rielle launched into a romantic monologue about how much she missed the man who was supposed to answer .
After ending the call , Mrs Edwards went to the senator and demanded to know what was going on .
He confessed to having had a one - night stand and she accepted this explanation , but demanded he return the call and , as she watched , end the relationship .
He did as he was told , but as soon as he was able he telephoned Rielle again to reassure her they were still in a relationship .
The senator told me Mrs Edwards was being overly demanding , obsessive , even " crazy " .
But he also said that he would never seek a divorce .
For one thing , he still loved Elizabeth .
And he believed that his wife was more popular with many voters than he was , and that if he left her , he might as well forget ever becoming president .
I cringed when he said this , but when I thought about how it would look if he divorced a wife of almost 30 years , who had lost a child in a car crash and was living with cancer , I had to agree with him about the political impact .
Elizabeth wrote a book about her battle with cancer and , while she was on her book tour , the senator brought Rielle to his home , where she met Jack and Emma Claire , and even interviewed them briefly on film .
When I arrived , the mood in the house was relaxed and upbeat .
That evening Rielle talked excitedly , saying that John 's future was limitless , punctuating her observations about him with a laugh and the line , " It 's good to be king . "
As the wine flowed and the kids went to bed , the senator and Rielle dropped the pretence that they were n't involved .
At one point , they started musing about how the house seemed like a happy place with Elizabeth and her " negative energy " removed .
Rielle talked about living in the mansion once Mrs Edwards was out of the way .
This worried me , but I was busy with my own problems .
Cheri and I had tried to celebrate our wedding anniversary , but ended up arguing about my 24 - hour - a - day devotion to the Edwards family .
Though I was finally earning a good salary and getting some respect in national politics , Cheri knew I was not guaranteed a long - term position .
We were dependent on the Edwardses for our income and health insurance , and they had n't shown themselves to be paragons of stability , especially since the arrival of Rielle Hunter .
Cheri was right .
I was wrong .
But I was n't going to admit it .
Instead , I said what I always said : " John Edwards is going to be president one day . "
In the heat of the moment , and having had just wine and a little bread at dinner , I drove off .
I was arrested for driving under the influence and lost my licence .
I had to hire an assistant to help me get around for work , but worse was having to tell the Edwardses .
Elizabeth 's response confirmed all the good feelings I had ever felt for her .
" Andrew , you are family , " she said .
" You do n't worry about this …
It 's going to be all right . "
The senator called me about half an hour later .
" We 've all done something like this , Andrew .
I have .
I know you feel like the lowest person on earth right now , but I love you .
You are like a brother to me . "
I felt as if a great weight had lifted .
Words like " love " and " family " make you feel a powerful bond , but this can also be a trap .
With the crisis around my arrest , my loyalty to John Edwards shifted from hope for a better future to dread of being exposed and losing my livelihood .
In the autumn of 2006 , Mr and Mrs Edwards travelled extensively to promote themselves ( she for her book , he for the White House ) , and the senator saw Rielle and spoke to her by phone as often as he could .
Although he had not formally declared , the senator had been operating as a candidate for the 2008 Democratic party nomination ever since the 2004 defeat .
He faced two main opponents in Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Mrs Edwards was watching the senator closely , so Rielle bought a new cell phone we came to call " the Batphone " .
The senator and Rielle made it hard for me to ignore the affair – he let me see them kiss and Rielle recounted their sexual exploits to me – but he always used the lawyer 's trick of speaking in code so he could claim " plausible deniability " if it was ever needed .
Similarly , Mrs Edwards chose to limit the questions she asked to delay a confrontation .
The two women finally met face to face at a campaign event .
Mrs Edwards glanced past Rielle , caught my eye , and quickly realised this must be " the other woman " .
The next day , I picked up the senator at his house and he told me Mrs Edwards had shouted and cried until he told her all about Rielle and promised to fire her .
What I would n't find out for many months was that the senator had told Elizabeth that although he had indulged in a " one- night " fling with Rielle , in recent weeks she had become my mistress .
More than once after that Mrs Edwards called to interrogate me about Rielle .
I felt he should be answering her questions , not me , but this angered her .
" I know you are lying to me , " she said , " and if you do n't tell the truth to me , I 'll have John fire you . "
During one call , I launched into a minor diatribe .
" Mrs Edwards , I love you like a big sister , and I love your husband like a big brother , " I said , " and after 10 years of me working for you , for you to treat me like this is wrong , utterly wrong . "
She was not impressed .
" Andrew , you are not family .
You work for us .
Nothing more .
You get paid for all you do . "
At this time , aside from managing the senator 's personal crises , I dealt with inquiries from colleagues who knew I had Edwards 's ear and understood him better than anyone else .
I also looked after Rielle 's travel arrangements , which required some fancy footwork .
When I knew where the senator was staying , I made reservations in my own name , faxed copies of my credit card and state identification card , and told the hotel staff my " wife " would be checking in on my account .
I used my credit card to book hotel rooms and flights for her , so Mrs Edwards would n't notice the money had gone .
I even gave Edwards cash to give her – a few hundred dollars at a time – when I took him to the airport .
He promised I would be repaid when a wealthy benefactor was recruited or when Mrs Edwards died .
" I 'll take care of you , Andrew , " he said .
" You know I 'm good for it . "
Elizabeth Edwards 's cancer returned , and most people believed she was not long for this world .
A few people criticised the Edwardses for their ambition , but in the main they were honoured for their courage and forthrightness .
Frank Rich of the New York Times would even publish a column titled Elizabeth Edwards For President .
Although I continued to work as a fundraiser , Mrs Edwards had told the people in charge of the day - to - day campaign to take away my responsibilities and to keep me away from her husband and her house .
Because she identified me with his infidelity , she obsessed over what I knew .
She called me over and over , demanding information I would n't give her .
She accused me of lying , cheating and even stealing from her household .
In furious fights , she insisted her husband fire me , which he could n't do because he needed me to take care of Rielle .
I was squarely in the middle .
Meanwhile , Rielle and I were in constant communication .
I had never known a woman who needed more attention , but on the day in May 2007 when I received four calls in an hour , I knew something unusual was going on .
Having deflected her three times , I answered the fourth call feeling irritated .
" Somebody better be dying or pregnant , " I said .
" Nobody 's dying , " sobbed Rielle .
Later that day , cussing and barely under control , the senator told me that since they had an " open " relationship , he thought there was only a " one - in - three chance " he could be the baby 's father .
He asked me to help persuade her to get an abortion .
But Rielle refused , and every once in a while threatened to go to the press and reveal the affair .
She was especially outraged on 30 July when the Edwardses marked their 30th anniversary by renewing their wedding vows .
Rumours were starting to swirl , though , and when National Enquirer photographers turned up outside Rielle 's house , the senator decided the temporary solution would be for her to stay with Cheri and me .
" This is bigger than any of us , " he said , evoking the many causes – peace , healthcare , poverty and so on – that he represented .
When I finally agreed with his plan , the senator said , " Andrew , nobody has ever done something like this for me .
You are the best friend I ever had in the world . "
Cheri had seen so much crazy stuff where the Edwardses were concerned that she was n't exactly surprised .
She was angry and disgusted , but she trusted me enough just to shake her head in a weary way and say OK .
But within days of Rielle 's arrival , there was another tabloid story , and a few months later , when photographers caught Rielle , heavily pregnant , running errands just a few miles from the Edwards mansion , the senator called .
" This is bad , Andrew , " he said .
" You have to get her under control . "
The Iowa caucuses were three weeks away .
Edwards was neck and neck with Obama for the lead in the polls .
Clinton was a distant third .
The next day , the senator called again .
He wanted to find a " way out of this thing " .
He talked about how he and John Kerry had lost by a few hundred thousand votes in Ohio in 2004 and said , " A black or a woman can't win the general election . "
Gradually , he came round to the real purpose of his call : he wanted me to issue a statement saying I was the father of Rielle 's baby , then disappear with her , Cheri and the kids for a luxury vacation until the election was over .
I was dumbfounded .
How , I asked , was I meant to explain to my wife that I should confess to an affair I never had , claim an unborn child that was not mine and then bring her along with our family as we attempted to disappear ?
The senator appealed to my commitment to the cause and our friendship .
When I said he was asking me to ruin my career and my ability to support my family , he said he would make sure I had a job in the future .
" You 're family .
A friend like no friend I 've ever had , " he said , before adding that I would help make Mrs Edwards 's dying days a bit easier .
" I know you 're mad at her , Andrew , but I love her .
I can't let her die knowing this . "
I did n't know whether to laugh or cry .
My wife and children were caught up in this .
My colleagues were shunning me , my professional contacts evaporating .
And the much beloved and respected Elizabeth Edwards was telling mutual friends , donors , politicians and anyone else who would listen that I was the worst kind of scoundrel .
( The senator had obviously long ago told her the lie about my being the baby 's father . )
In short , I was fucked , and at that moment I could n't see any options but to continue playing Edwards 's game .
Exhausted and under intense pressure , Cheri finally agreed that , even if we followed through on the senator 's plan , no one who knew us would believe the story .
I would work with a lawyer to craft a statement to release to the media .
Then we would fly off somewhere no one could find us .
Barack Obama took Iowa , and John Edwards finished with just 1 % more of the vote than Hillary Clinton .
In New Hampshire , Edwards got clobbered , finishing a distant third .
While some Democrats began calling for the senator to drop out , we were still hiding out with a heavily pregnant Rielle .
School was starting , and Cheri and I wanted to go home .
But now the senator was insisting we stay away until his part in the election was over or Mrs Edwards died .
We found a teacher who would home - school the kids , and fell into a routine of taking care of Rielle 's basic needs almost as if she were our child .
The last straw for the campaign came on 26 January , when the senator finished third in the primary in South Carolina , where he was born .
After this defeat , he quit the race , but even then it was impossible to get him to focus on resolving our situation .
As the days passed and the birth of Rielle 's baby drew closer , Cheri and I became less confident about the promises he had made .
On Wednesday 27 February 2008 , Rielle 's baby girl was born .
I called and texted the senator , and he gave me a vague assurance that he would call her .
I asked if he wanted me to send her flowers from him .
" Yeah , that 's a good idea . "
He paused .
" But do n't sign it from me .
Someone might see it . "
At that moment , a switch flicked .
After watching and hearing John Edwards practise a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies , ostensibly in the service of some greater good , I finally recognised that he did n't care about anyone other than himself .
A precious living , breathing human being – his daughter – had come into the world , and he was n't inclined even to call the woman who had given birth to her .
Shortly after , he asked if I could get a nappy to send for a DNA test .
At one point , he even asked if we could get a fabricated DNA test , showing he was not the father .
Cheri and I finally returned , and Rielle 's escape was arranged , but still Edwards would not own up .
In 2009 , Elizabeth published another book .
In it I was no longer the young man she called " family " .
I was some sort of deranged groupie or " obsessed fan " .
I was hurt , but I did n't have time to dwell on it .
The FBI and federal prosecutors had been to my home to talk about an investigation into allegations of corruption in the Edwards campaign .
I began putting together the records they requested for a grand jury that had been convened .
Two weeks before my book was to be published in the US , John Edwards finally acknowledged his fifth child .
This announcement fulfilled the promises he made to me , but came much too late to undo the damage done to me and my family .
My last encounter with Edwards had been in August 2008 .
I had no job prospects and our unfinished house was threatening to bankrupt me , but he was more concerned with his own problems .
I asked him what he was going to do about me now that my reputation was trashed and I had no chance of finding a job .
" What about your promise to take care of things ? " I asked .
" What about you coming clean ? "
" If you apply for a job , I 'll give you a good reference .
Just let me know who to call . "
After a decade of devoted service , untold sacrifice on the part of my wife and children , and an act of extreme loyalty that left my reputation ruined , John Edwards proposed to compensate me with a good reference .
As he drove away , I stole a last glance through the window of the driver 's door .
I saw a man I could n't recognise at all .

The Kids Are All Right
Here ’s a bit from Cory Doctorow ’s piece today against the iPad ( and the overall state of Apple product design ) :
Then there ’s the device itself : clearly there ’s a lot of thoughtfulness and smarts that went into the design .
But there ’s also a palpable contempt for the owner .
I believe — really believe — in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto : if you ca n’t open it , you do n’t own it .
Screws not glue .
The original Apple ] [+ came with schematics for the circuit boards , and birthed a generation of hardware and software hackers who upended the world for the better .
If you wanted your kid to grow up to be a confident , entrepreneurial , and firmly in the camp that believes that you should forever be rearranging the world to make it better , you bought her an Apple ] [+.
Such is the march of progress .
40 years ago you could open the hood of your car and see and touch just about every component in there .
And you had to , because many of those components required frequent maintenance .
To properly own a car required , to some degree , that you understood how a car worked .
Today , you open the hood of your car and you see a big sealed block and a basin for the windshield washer fluid .
You can buy a new car , drive it for years , and never once open the hood yourself .
That ’s the iPad .
Alex Payne wrote about this back in January :
The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this : if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid , I ’d never be a programmer today .
As did Mark Pilgrim :
Once upon a time , Apple made the machines that made me who I am .
I became who I am by tinkering .
Now it seems they ’re doing everything in their power to stop my kids from finding that sense of wonder .
Apple has declared war on the tinkerers of the world .
They have a point .
The iPad ( and all other past and future iPhone OS devices ) are not open in the way that the Apple II was and Macintosh is .
But there have always been closed computing devices .
My first computer ?
An Atari 2600 , which my family got for Christmas when I was around six .
I loved it .
I devoted untold hours to it .
Yes , I also soon learned about personal computers — Apple II ’s and Commodores and the Texas Instruments TI99 and even some from Atari .
And you could type your own programs and they would run .
And so of course my friends and I typed in our own programs and ran them .
Joy !
But it never even occurred to us that in theory , we could also create programs for , say , the Atari 2600 .
We knew it was a “ computer ” , but it was a different type of computer .
One where all of the software was made by faceless unknown professionals using magic beyond our ken .
We had no idea how 2600 games were programmed or made or designed .
And for all practical purposes , we had no chance whatsoever , none , to make our own .
We also had a sense that our programs , the ones we wrote in BASIC , were not “ real ” programs — the ones we bought ( and , uh , sometimes did n’t ) with commercial games and word processors were not written using BASIC .
They were made — and distributed into retail channels — using , again , magic beyond our ken .
The iPad and iPhone are closed compared to personal computers , yes .
But they are remarkably open compared to so many kinds of computing devices .
Here ’s an email I received today from Sam Kaplan :
I am 13 years old and a big fan of your site .
I just made an app called iChalkboard .
This is my second app , but my first iPad app .
It allows you to simply sketch things out .
Check it out :
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ichalkboard/id322491414?mt=8.
If you need any more info or a promo code , feel free to ask .
I hope you like it as much as I do .
He ’s 13 years old and he has created ( with the help of his friend , 14 - year - old designer Louis Harboe ) and is selling an iPad app in the same store where companies like EA , Google , and even Apple itself distribute iPad apps .
His app is ready to go on the first day the product is available .
Not a fake app .
Not a junior app .
A real honest - to - god iPad app .
Imagine a 13 - year - old in 1978 who could produce and sell his own Atari 2600 cartridges .
Somehow I do n’t think young Mr. Kaplan sees the iPad as hurting his sense of wonder or entrepreneurism .
And , App Store aside — which , yes , requires access to a Mac and a $ 99 / year developer account — what about the iPad and iPhone as web clients ?
There are no limits imposed by Apple on web apps targeting iPhone OS devices .
When I learned to program in the 1980s with BASIC , the interface of our programs was monospaced ( and on some machines , all - caps ) text .
Just text .
If we had color it was limited to 16 shades .
If you could go back and show my 10 - year - old self an iPad — millions of colors , video , photographs , gorgeous typography , a touchscreen interface , networking ( wirelessly ! ) — and offered to let me write web apps for it in exchange for my agreeing never to touch an Apple II again , I ’m pretty sure I know what the answer would be .
Something important and valuable is indeed being lost as Apple shifts to this model of computing .
But it ’s a trade - off , because something new that is important and valuable has been gained .
THE idea was never to try to supplant retail , says Fan Bi , the 22 - year - old chief executive of Blank Label .
Sometimes you need a dress shirt right now , and at those times , Mr. Bi says approvingly , “ you can get it right now at Nordstrom . ”
But what about those times when you get a hankering not to wear the same thing that 10,000 other men are wearing ?
Or when you wish you could have the fabric , collar , pockets and lining you ’ve always wanted — not what some fashion buyer has chosen for this season ?
What if you could design that shirt yourself and hang it in your closet for about the same price as a mass - produced button - down ?
“ The value proposition of customization at retail prices was a cornerstone of our company from the very start , ” Mr. Bi tells me by phone from Shanghai , where Blank Label shirts are sewn to customers ’ specifications and delivered anywhere in the world in about four weeks .
But Blank Label , his Web start - up based in Boston , offers something else that off - the - rack does n’t : “ the emotional value proposition : how expressive something is . ”
“ People really like a Blank Label shirt because they can say , ‘ I had a part in creating this . ’ ”
Since last Halloween , when the company ’s dress shirt design application made its debut at www.blank-label.com, Mr. Bi and his three partners — ages 19 , 22 and 30 — have joined a small but growing co-creation movement that uses the Internet to let consumers have a hand in making the products they buy .
Web ventures have already popped up that allow shoppers to customize granola ( MeAndGoji.com ) , jewelry ( gemvara.com ) , chocolate ( CreateMyChocolate.com ) , handbags ( LaudiVidni.com ) and clothing for girls ages 6 to 12 ( FashionPlaytes.com ) .
There are also online competitors selling design - your - own shirts , while Brooks Brothers is one major retailer that offers the service on its Web site .
A New Jersey family still recovering from the accidental death of a daughter four years ago is now grieving for a second daughter who was killed in a crocodile attack last week .
Lauren Failla , 25 , was attacked by a crocodile on April 29 while on vacation with her boyfriend off India ’s Andaman Islands , authorities said .
A graduate of Vanderbilt University who was studying at Sotheby 's Art Institute in London , Failla was snorkeling in the water off Radhanagar Beach when the crocodile attacked .
Her boyfriend , who was videotaping the scene , caught the gruesome attack on camera .
Failla 's body , which was quickly taken away by the waves , was found on a neighboring beach the next day .
The incident has prompted demands for the Andaman administration to have trained lifeguards on duty in tourist destinations like Radhanagar Beach , which is considered one of the top 10 beaches in the world .
Michael Tran , a U.S. State Department spokesman , said roughly 24 crocodile attacks -- four of them fatal -- have been reported in the area over the last 25 years .
Experts have arrived on the island to help catch the killer crocodile .
“ Such an unnecessary death : if there had been proper warnings and statements that there are in fact man-eating crocodiles nearby , I am sure Lauren would not have risked swimming , " Failla 's cousin , Gloria McLean Hiratsuka , wrote to the Daily Record of New Jersey .
" She thought she was safe .
Her father made a point of saying she was not a big risk - taker , always a little reserved , all the more since her sister 's untimely death four years ago . "
Failla ’s older sister , Emily , a 24 - year - old teacher , fell to her death while rock - climbing in Washington state in July of 2006 .
A Family member said the young women 's parents were still mourning their first daughter when Lauren died .
A memorial service was to be held for Lauren on Saturday , with a funeral to be held on May 15 .

Five Reasons Against the iPad = Five Reasons For Competitive Governance
Cory Doctorow thinks you should n’t buy an iPad .
He gives five reasons .
Many serve as good complaints against the lack of a competitive market in governance .
Let ’s make some analogies .
Cory sez :
Incumbents made bad revolutionaries :
“ They ’re apt to take all the stuff that makes their products great and try to use technology to charge you extra for it , or prohibit it altogether . ”
I say : Substitute “ force ” for “ technology ” in that sentence and you have the modern State .
Another way of saying this is to say that current industry leaders expend a lot of effort to maintain the rents they collect on their competitive advantage .
For standard reasons of political economy , this is all too true in governance .
Self - interested and envious status - seekers aim to keep their winning coalition in power .
Sadly , that goal does not coincide with innovating new , socially desirable national rule sets .

Infantalizing hardware : “ There ’s also a palpable contempt for the owner .
I believe — really believe — in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto : if you ca n’t open it , you do n’t own it .
Screws not glue … it seems like Apple ’s model customer is that same stupid stereotype of a technophobic , timid , scatterbrained mother as appears in a billion renditions of ‘ that ’s too complicated for my mom . ' ”
I say :
This is all too true in terms of today ’s soft paternalism .
I hear echoes of de Tocqueville ’s timid flock of sheep .
Take Nancy Pelosi ’s remarks after the passage of the 2074 page Demo -‘ Bamo - Spendo - Rama Health Bill .
She compared it to a refrigerator : ” It ’s like the back of the refrigerator .
You see all these wires and the rest , ” said Pelosi .
“ All you need to know is , you open the door .
The light goes on .
You open this door , you go through a whole different path , in terms of access to quality , affordable healthcare for all Americans . ”

Wal - Martization of the software channel : “ The iStore lock - in does n’t make life better for Apple ’s customers or Apple ’s developers .
As an adult , I want to be able to choose whose stuff I buy and whom I trust to evaluate that stuff .
I do n’t want my universe of apps constrained to the stuff that the Cupertino Politburo decides to allow for its platform . ”
I say : I want to choose what stuff I buy as well , even in the market for government service providers ( GSPs ) .
Like ISPs who favored walled gardens –AOL , Compuserve , and Prodigy , for example –GSPs in this mold are bad too .
I do n’t want my universe of social apps limited to one GSP .

Journalism is looking for a daddy figure : “ everyone in journalism - land is looking for a daddy figure who ’ll promise them that their audience will go back to paying for their stuff . ”
I say : I propose “ Who ’s your Daddy ? ” as the new slogan in public choice economics .
This is the question every special interest group knows the answer to .

Gadgets come and gadgets go : “ The iPad you buy today will be e-waste in a year or two . ”
I say : Unfortunately this last complaint does n’t apply to current government goods and services .
Bad services come in legions and almost never go .
And under current conditions , do n’t expect a competitor to come along and offer a better product at a lower price .

We use standard size 6 inch x 6 inch ( 15 cm x 15 cm ) square origami paper for this site unless stated otherwise .
If you can , use different types of origami paper to change the look of the finished origami and have fun with it !
These are currently our most popular origami :
Origami Elephant
The origami elephant from a dollar bill is sure to amuse and delight your friends , dining partners and waitpersons .
This model is based on the design and instructions of Jim Cranwell .

It should be considered somewhat advanced origami .
If you have trouble making an origami crane , this one might be a bit much .
We 'll make frequent use of the terms valley fold and mountain fold .
If you do not know what these are , then you are in way over your head :)
Actually , you can learn about these folds right here .
Start with a U.S. one dollar bill .
Other currencies or denominations would work , but this one has a special " feature " that will show up later .
For those not in the USA , the dimensions of a USA one dollar bill are height = 66 mm ( 2.6 inch ) and width = 156 mm ( 6.1 inch ) .
Place the bill in front of you , face up but upside down ( again , you 'll see why later ) .
Now make valley folds at the halfway points of the bill , as well as the top corners .
Origami Elephant
Now valley fold the top corners as if you 're making a paper airplane .
Then fold the top pointed corner down , at the white line shown .
With us so far ?
Good !
Now fold the right edge of the bill back behind , until the bill is doubled as shown .
Crease the fold .
Next unfold the bill .
The fold the right edge back again , until it lines up with the crease you made in the previous step .
Make another crease .
Now fold along crease A ... then B and C , as shown in the two photos below .
The following photo shows what the backside should look like .
Now turn the folded bill back over .
You will now make a valley fold approximately where the white line is in the photo below .
This will give the result below .
This stage is shown from the backside in the next photo .
For clarity , we 're showing this stage from the side also .
The idea is to get the distance " x " to be equal to the distance " y " .
Now fold the 4 corners of the center channel as shown below .
Next , squash fold the top and bottom as shown .
It can be a little tricky to get these small pieces folded and creased , you may need help from a rounded tool as shown .
A car key might help .
Now unfold the top pointy part .
Make valley folds on the outside of the center channel .
Also make a mountain fold just in front of the channel , so that this piece overlaps the channel .
Now flip the piece over .
Whew !
This would be as good a time as any to break for drinks :)
Ready again ?
OK , make another valley fold at the front edge of the front legs .
And a mountain fold a short distance in front of that .
The idea is to overlap the front legs by about half their width .
These next two photos show those folds :
Now fold the whole thing in half down the centerline as shown , using a mountain fold .
Next you will make the ears .
Fold the point of the trunk back as shown to make the ear crease line ( ignore the trunk crease for now ) .
Note the ear is angled forward slightly .
Unfold the trunk then use the crease line to make a reverse fold inside the body of the elephant .
If you 're drawing a blank on reverse fold , check out our instructions for the origami flapping bird .
Now unfold the trunk .
Next push the trunk into the body , making two valley folds ( one on either side ) along the trunk crease shown below .
The trunk crease lines will end up in contact with the front edge of the front legs .
It should look something like the photo below .
Next , crease then reverse fold the trunk so that it points down .
Do a couple more reverse folds to get the trunk pointing up , and the trunk tip pointing slightly back .
Now turn the elephant over and open the legs a bit .
Valley fold out a small tail .
Now your elephant is ready to stand on his own four legs !
Note that the floating eye in the pyramid from the backside of the dollar bill lines up quite nicely to be the eye of the elephant .
Neat !
If you 're performing this little stunt at a bar , we hear that these little fellas like peanuts .
From Kitty in QLD Australia
" In the front - origami Elephant made with the Australian $ 5 bill .
Unfortunately our currency is made from a plastic rather than paper like USA currency and I had to use tape to hold it in place : P the folds also would not hold properly and it was very stubborn , but in the end it succumbed to my will ... kind of , there were a few folds it just would not do . "
Great effort Kitty !

The High Court has appointed permanent administrators to Quinn Insurance .
Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns was told that the company was no longer opposing the Financial Regulator 's application to have the provisional administrators appointed at the end of last month made permanent .
The High Court was told there had been considerable progress made between the parties since the matter was last in court on Monday .
Senior Counsel Michael Cush said the company was now consenting to an order appointing permanent administrators to Quinn Insurance .
Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns said that having read the material presented to him , he was satisfied this was an appropriate case in which to make such an order .
He said it did not follow that that meant every assertion made by the regulator was accepted or every assertion made by Quinn Insurance was rejected .
However , he said there was sufficient material before him to make the order .
The judge appointed Paul McCann and Michael McAteer of Grant Thornton as administrators to the company .
He also granted them the power to act separately if necessary .
Mr Justice Kearns said it was important to stress , particularly in view of the concerns of employees that part of the statutory function of the administrators was to carry on the business as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial footing .
Lawyers for the administrators said they wished to deliver their first report in a month .
The case will be mentioned before the court again on the 20 May .
Quinn response
In a statement , Jim Quigley , Chairman of Quinn Insurace Ltd , said : ' This decision has been taken after very careful consideration .
' We have concluded that , given what has happened , it is in the best interests of the Company , our employees and policyholders that , as a matter of urgency , we work closely with the Administrators and the Financial Regulator to get the situation resolved as quickly as possible .
In particular , we would hope that working together we can find a way to re-commence business in the United Kingdom . '
The regulator welcomed the High Court 's decision to confirm the appointment of administrators at Quinn Insurance , saying that the step was in the best interests of policyholders .
The regulator said Quinn Insurance was still able to pay claims and renew policies in the normal way in the Republic of Ireland and continued to settle claims in the UK .
It said it would continue to work with the administrators and the Quinn Insurance board to address issues to resolve the financial position of the firm in the interests of its policyholders .
' Separately , the Financial Regulator continues its own investigations into the circumstances surrounding the creation of the guarantees , ' it said .
Later , a statement from the administrators said : ' As administrators of Quinn Insurance Limited it remains our court appointed duty to place the company on a sound commercial and financial footing .
' We already have a highly skilled team on location in Cavan , Dublin , Navan , Manchester and Enniskillen which will continue assessing the Quinn Insurance business .
' Since our appointment as provisional administrators on the 30 March we have received excellent cooperation from the staff and management in all locations in what have been difficult circumstances .
' We will continue to engage constructively with staff and management at QIL as we endeavour to secure the future of the company .
' Customers of the company continue to be unaffected by our appointment - all valid claims will be met .
Customers with queries should contact Quinn Direct in the usual manner .'
The company has been increasingly concerned about the damage it is suffering as a result of the ban on it doing business in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK .
Financial Regulator
Yesterday , Financial Regulator Matthew Elderfield told an Oireachtas Committee that the motivation of his office was to protect policy holders .
This evening in a statement , the Financial Regulator said : it 'has received proposals from the Administrator with a view to lifting parts of its direction with regard to certain business lines of Quinn Insurance Ltd UK .
' The Administrator is to forward further details regarding these proposals and we will give these prompt consideration .
' We remain encouraged by the nature and quality of our engagement with the administrator in this and other respects . '

BBC News , Gossainbarie , Assam
Production at Gossainbarie tea estate has gone up since it started using organic manure
Visitors making their way along the muddy track leading to the Gossainbarie tea estate in India 's north - eastern Assam state will be greeted by huge mounds of cow dung , rotting water hyacinth , as well as and fish and meat waste .
But this is no cause for alarm - the tea-estate has gone organic and is following the principles of India 's ancient plant medicine Vriksh Ayurveda .
" This is our fertiliser because we do n't use any chemical ones in our gardens , " says Gossainbarie 's owner Binod Saharia .
He has enlisted the help of a hermit - like bearded figure - former management consultant Swami Valmiki Iyengara .
Mr Iyengara says he has studied Vriksh Ayurveda , a system of traditional medicine , and evolved a concept of organic farming that is both sustainable and profitable .
" All pollutants are useful wastes and we can convert most of them into organic manure , " he says .
" The ancient Indian plant medicine details processes for creating organic fertiliser from virtually anything .
" Much as poisons like mercury are used in traditional Indian medicine , pollutants diluted with other materials produce the best fertiliser , " he adds .
Half of India 's tea output comes from Assam Water hyacinth , cow dung and cow urine have long been used as manure .
But Mr Iyengara has also developed organic manure from fish waste , " charasuda " ( butcher house waste ) , " indsafari " ( small fish ) and the " bhasmas " ( made from herbs and metals ) .
" We have enough organic fertilisers for a few planting seasons , " he says .
Mr Iyengara and Mr Saharia say they have almost perfected the practice of organic farming .
They believe this could clean up India 's - and Assam's - rural environment , which has been polluted by high use of insecticides , pest repellent and highly toxic chemical fertilisers .
Environmentalists argue these are penetrating the food chain and threatening the health of millions .
' Ailing estate ' rescued Going organic can also boost the market price of Indian tea and open up new niche markets .
These are factors that can help the country 's tea industry overcome the high production costs caused by rising wages and expensive chemical fertilisers .
When Mr Saharia took over the ailing Gossainbarie tea estate from Assamese planter Mohammed Arfanulla early last year , the 140 - year - old tea estate was waiting for someone to turn it around .
Locally available water hyacinth is also used to make manure
The estate 's annual output had plummeted from its peak 900,000 kg of green leaves to 355,000 kg a year .
One year on and things are looking up - the estate is poised to produce 600,000 kg .
Mr Saharia says he now wants other Indian tea planters to adopt his technology .
" We have no trade secrets .
We want the whole of Indian tea industry to go organic all the way .
" In many estates , lazy managers routinely use chemical fertilisers even after the soil has gone dead .
We want them to be creative . "
' Unique experience ' Inderjit Singh Oberoi , a retired soldier - turned - manager , has worked for estates much bigger than Gossainbarie , but he joined up six months ago to gain experience .
" The concept being tried out here is unique and I want to be part of it , " he says .
" This could save Indian tea and get it niche buyers . "
India 's tea industry is burdened with rising costs of production and falling prices .
Cows are a useful income supplement for the labourers Rampant use of chemical fertilisers and adulteration have denied Indian tea access to health conscious European markets .
India produced 981 m kg of tea in 2009 - almost a quarter of the world 's total tea output .
Nearly 200 m kg were exported .
Half of India 's tea output - nearly 450 m kg - comes from Assam 's 800 - odd tea estates .
Mr Saharia and Mr Iyengara say they encourage labourers at the estate to keep cows and collect waste .
That way , they are never short of raw material for organic fertiliser and also " it is an income supplement for the poor labourers " .
Some Indian tea planters , such as Swaraj Banerji of the famous Makaibari tea estate , in the Darjeeling Hills of West Bengal state , turned organic long ago .
The Makaibari estate pioneered the practice of motivating tea labourer families to keep cows and supply the dung and urine to the estate .
" But we have shown the way for all tea planters to go organic on a sustainable basis because we can develop organic fertilisers from virtually all kinds of locally available material , " Mr Saharia says .
' Reservations '
Mr Iyengara has also used his knowledge of modern management to develop a system by which fewer labourers are needed to apply the organic manure , over a wider area and in less time .
" Labour costs are the biggest overhead in Indian tea production and they make our teas less competitive in global markets , " he says .
" But we have found a way to cut down hugely on labour costs by saving up on manure application time . "
Mr Oberoi says he had " reservations " about the organic tea cultivation until he joined Gossainbarie .
" Now I know that the ancient plant medicine and the modern management concepts can work magic , " he says .

Rating Agencies Are Dead : Long Live The Rating Agencies .
Once upon a time rating agencies were independent research companies advising end - buyers and traders on the fundamental value of securities .
They sold opinions of value , i.e. they did valuations – they gave an opinion on how likely it was that projected cash flows would materialise in the future ; and once you got a fix on that , working out present value is just arithmetic .
The trouble started when regulators decided to hitch a free ride on the backs of the rating agencies ; they mandated that capital adequacy was assessed based on ratings provided by approved agencies .
Fair - enough , , that ’s sounds “ innocent ” , and sensible ; if a bank has a lot of high quality assets then the capital cover that they should be obliged to hold , can reasonably be less than a banks that has a load of low quality assets .
And who better to work out the quality of the assets than rating agencies , who were in that business , in the private sector , making money providing opinions to industry experts ?
So the rating agencies just kept on “ giving opinions ” , except that there was a conflict of interest because their client base switched from being ( mainly ) buyers of securities , to the sellers .
And there is always more money to be made sitting on the seller ’s side of the table than on the buyer ’s side … much more money .
If you get “ X ” percent of a deal that goes through , that is always more than the lump - sum you get paid for advising against a deal , and you never get paid for the deals that do n’t happen .
Imagine sending someone an invoice , “ in respect of the $ 1 billion deal that I persuaded you not to get into , that tanked , here is my fee for 1 % ” .
That ’s just ludicrous .
But turn that around , “ with regard to the $ 1 billion deal that you did thanks to my wonderful explanation of how I reached my opinion about what a good deal it was that all the investors lapped up , here is my fee for 1 % .
Now that ’s fair enough … everyone made money right ?
The huff and puff of the SEC et al , going after the rating agencies is a red-herring .
It was the regulators who depended on the rating agencies , and ultimately it was they , via this sleight of hand , who created the credit crunch .
Forget about President Clinton pushing for home ownership , Bin Laden frightening Alan Greenspan into dropping the base - rate after 9/11 and keeping it down too long , Liar Loans , naked credit default swaps , dodgy collateralised debt obligations or greedy bankers .
Did n’t you know , all bankers are greedy … and mean , its part of the selection - process ; you have to prove that you loved torturing small animals as a child before they let you into the “ association ” and their Patron Saint is Shylock from The Merchant of Venice .
But that ’s not new , what happened is new .
The reason there was a credit crunch was because there was a housing bust .
If there had not been a bust there would not have been a crunch .
If there had not been a bust then all those AAA rated RMBS would be performing perfectly , Hank Paulson would have “ saved the world ” by his “ confidence - building ” pronouncement “ The US Banking System is a Safe and Sound one ” , Lehman would still be alive , ACA would be billionaires and John Paulson would be running a pop-corn concession in Detroit .
The reason there was a housing bust was because there was a bubble .
Logic my dear Watson , if there had n’t been a bubble then there would not have been a bust .
The reason there was a bubble was because too much borrowed ( and easy ) money was chasing too few homes .
And the reason there was too much easy - money - chasing - too - few - homes , was because Moody ’s & Co stamped AAA on residential mortgage backed securities tied to the easy money .
And the reason they did that was because in the SEC handed out TEN concessions to TEN rating agencies .
They wanted a quality control on securities , but they did n’t want to pay .
Can you imagine if BOA presents a list of “ assets ” and the regulator hires Moody ’s to tell them how good they are , and what risk weighting should be applied ; and pays them for doing that job ?
That ’s never going to happen , not in a million years .
Much easier to write Rule 436( g ) .
A good account of how that works was written by Shahein Nasiripour in the Huffington Post .
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/..
In return for the rating agencies doing the regulator ’s job , for free ; they gave them a concession , it was called Rule 436( g ) .
What that meant was that in return for providing ratings that the regulators could rely on ( for free ) , the agencies were awarded a monopoly and immunity from prosecution ( civil and criminal ) , if they made a mistake .
See if you recognise where this came from … from Wikipedia .
Harley ( The Lord Treasurer ) needed to provide a mechanism for funding government debt incurred in the course of that war .
However , he could not establish a bank , because the charter of the Bank of England made it the only joint stock bank .
He therefore established what , on its face , was a trading company , though its main activity was in fact the funding of government debt .
In return for its exclusive trading rights the government saw an opportunity for a profitable trade - off .
The government and the company convinced the holders of around £ 10 million of short - term government debt to exchange it with a new issue of stock in the company .
In exchange , the government granted the company a perpetual annuity from the government paying £ 576,534 annually on the company 's books , or a perpetual loan of £ 10 million paying 6 percent .
This guaranteed the new equity owners a steady stream of earnings to this new venture .
The government thought it was in a win - win situation because it would fund the interest payment by placing a tariff on the goods brought from South America .
Are you starting to get the picture , “ perpetual loans … win - win…monopoly …off - balance sheet … shadow banks ” ?
That was the foundation of the South Sea Bubble .
The initial driver of the “ concession ” that led to the housing bubble was the fact that the State Governments in USA needed financing , but they were not ( and are still not ) allowed to run a budget deficit .
Yet they needed to build sewage treatment plants , and other essentials , and the way to finance that was by issuing securities .
And having the rating agencies “ on board ” was a big help .
And then there was housing .
OK the government did n’t benefit directly , but they did n’t mind if Average Joe and May Lou used their house as an ATM , because that helped the world go round , and that made the politicians look good .
Of course they only allowed that so long as the “ independent ” rating agencies blessed the deals .
So on one hand the regulators mandated that securities should be rated by an approved agency , and on the other hand the approved agencies were simply “ giving opinions ” …. except on behalf of the sellers .
So put them in sacks full of snakes and dump them in the oily waters of Louisiana ?
That ’s an idea , that ’s what was contemplated after the South Sea Bubble burst by the British Parliament , find someone to blame , punish them , and you s=feel better .
Except you ca n’t blame “ The Government ” because yesterday ’s pork is today ’s pig-manure , and past governments have absolute immunity .
So blame the rating agencies , they gave their opinion , they were wrong , except they were not paid ( initially ) by the people who ( eventually ) suffered from their mistakes , and they had no duty of care outside of “ trying harder ” .
Look at the huff and puff of the SEC throwing fluff at the rating agencies .
Moody ’s have admitted filling out some forms wrong … WOW … that may of course be a bureaucrat ’s wet - dream to have discovered the discrepancy , but so what ?
Timothy Geithner filled out a few forms wrong in his time .
Notice how the SEC action against Goldman Sachs on the famous Paulson CDO , did not name the rating agency that stamped AAA on that , and the reason is clear , the rating agency has immunity .
Going Forwards
Regulators need someone to provide quality assurance on securities , without that the system breaks down , particularly when like now , no one believes in the quality assurance stamps .
But quality assurance requires a “ bad- guy ” who is truly independent .
The move to force issuers and holders of securities to use an agency that is determined by the regulator ( whoever pays him ) , is a step in the right direction .
But it wo n’t work , the rating agencies who decide the rating of a bond , needs to be employed by the regulator , AND answerable to him , AND liable for mistakes ( PI insurance would help ) .
That does n’t mean there wo n’t be work for the rating agencies providing “ opinions ” to the sellers and the buyers , but they will be buying just that , opinions , just like in the old days .
There are two jobs , the “ good - guy ” job , and the “ bad guy ” job , what just happened was that “ someone ” tried to kill two birds with one stone .

Was There A Plan to Blow Up The U.S. Economy ?
Many people now believe that the financial crisis was not an accident .
They think that the Bush administration and the Fed knew what Wall Street was up to and provided their support .
This is n't as far fetched as it sounds .
As we will show , it 's clear that Bush , Greenspan and many other high - ranking officials understood the problem with subprime mortgages and knew that a huge asset bubble was emerging that threatened the economy .
But while the housing bubble was more than just an innocent mistake , it does n't rise to the level of " conspiracy " which Webster defines as " a secret agreement between two or more people to perform an unlawful act . "
It 's actually worse than that , because bubblemaking is the dominant policy , and it's used to overcome the structural problems in capitalism itself , mainly stagnation .
The whole idea of a conspiracy diverts attention from what really happened .
It conjures up a comical vision of top - hat business tycoons gathered in a smoke - filled room stealthily mapping out the country 's future .
It ignores the fact , that the main stakeholders do n't need to convene a meeting to know what they want .
They already know what they want ; they want a process that helps them to maintain profitability even while the " real " economy remains stuck in the mud .
Historian Robert Brenner has written extensively on this topic and dispels the mistaken view that the economy is " fundamentally strong " .
( in the words of former Treasury secretary Henry Paulson ) Here 's Brenner :
" The current crisis is more serious than the worst previous recession of the postwar period , between 1979 and 1982 , and could conceivably come to rival the Great Depression , though there is no way of really knowing .
Economic forecasters have underestimated how bad it is because they have over - estimated the strength of the real economy and failed to take into account the extent of its dependence upon a buildup of debt that relied on asset price bubbles .
In the U.S. , during the recent business cycle of the years 2001 - 2007 , GDP growth was by far the slowest of the postwar epoch .
There was no increase in private sector employment .
The increase in plants and equipment was about a third of the previous , a postwar low .
Real wages were basically flat .
There was no increase in median family income for the first time since World War II .
Economic growth was driven entirely by personal consumption and residential investment , made possible by easy credit and rising house prices .
Economic performance was weak , even despite the enormous stimulus from the housing bubble and the Bush administration 's huge federal deficits .
Housing by itself accounted for almost one - third of the growth of GDP and close to half of the increase in employment in the years 2001 - 2005 .
It was , therefore , to be expected that when the housing bubble burst , consumption and residential investment would fall , and the economy would plunge .
" ( " Overproduction not Financial Collapse is the Heart of the Crisis " , Robert P. Brenner speaks with Jeong Seong - jin , Asia Pacific Journal )
What Brenner describes is an economy that 's flat on its back ; an economy that -- despite unfunded tax cuts , massive military spending and gigantic asset bubbles -- can barely produce positive growth .
The pervasive lethargy of mature capitalist economies , poses huge challenges for industry bosses who are judged solely on their ability to boost quarterly profits .
Goldman 's Lloyd Blankfein and JPM's Jamie Dimon could care less about economic theory , what they 're interested in is making money ; how to deploy their capital in a way that maximizes return on investment .
" Profits " , that 's it .
And that 's much more difficult in a world that 's saturated with overcapacity and flagging demand .
The world does n't need more widgets or widget - makers .
The only way to ensure profitability is to invent an alternate system altogether , a new universe of financial exotica ( CDOs , MBSs , CDSs ) that operates independent of the sluggish real economy .
Financialization provides that opportunity .
It allows the main players to pump - up the leverage , minimize capital - outlay , inflate asset prices , and skim off record profits even while the real economy endures severe stagnation .
Financialization provides a path to wealth creation , which is why the sector 's portion of total corporate profits is now nearly 40 percent .
It 's a way to bypass the pervasive inertia of the production - oriented economy .
The Fed 's role in this new paradigm is to create a hospitable environment ( low interest rates ) for bubble - making so the upward transfer of wealth can continue without interruption .
Bubblemaking is policy .
As we 've pointed out in earlier articles , scores of people knew what was going on during the subprime fiasco .
But it 's worth a quick review , because Robert Rubin , Alan Greenspan , Timothy Geithner , and others have been defending themselves saying , " Who could have known ? " .
The FBI knew ( " In September 2004 , the FBI began publicly warning that there was an " epidemic " of mortgage fraud , and it predicted that it would produce an economic crisis , if it were not dealt with . " )
The FDIC knew .
( In testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , FDIC chairman Sheila Bair confirmed that she not only warned the Fed of what was going on in 2001 , but cited particular regulations ( HOEPA ) under which the Fed could stop the " unfair , abusive and deceptive practices " by the banks . )
Also Fitch ratings knew , and even Alan Greenspan 's good friend and former Fed governor Ed Gramlich knew .
( Gramlich personally warned Greenspan of the surge in predatory lending that was apparent as early as 2000 .
Here 's a bit of what Gramlich said in the Wall Street Journal :
" I would have liked the Fed to be a leader " in cracking down on predatory lending , Mr. Gramlich , now a scholar at the Urban Institute , said in an interview this past week .
Knowing it would be controversial with Mr. Greenspan , whose deregulatory philosophy is well known , Mr. Gramlich broached it to him personally rather than take it to the full board .
" He was opposed to it , so I did n't really pursue it , " says Mr. Gramlich .
( Wall Street Journal )
So , Greenspan knew , too .
And , according to Elizabeth MacDonald in an article titled " Housing Red flags Ignored " :
" One of the nation ’s biggest mortgage industry players repeatedly warned the Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and other bank regulators during the housing bubble that the U.S. faced an imminent housing crash ....
But bank regulators not only ignored the group 's warnings , top
Fed officials also went on the airwaves to say the economy was " building on a sturdy foundation " and a housing crash was " unlikely . "
So , the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America [ MICA ] also knew .
And , here 's a clip from the Washington Post by former New York governor Eliot Spitzer who accused Bush of being a ‘ partner in crime ’ in the subprime fiasco .
Spitzer says that the OCC launched “ an unprecedented assault on state legislatures , as well as on state attorneys general just to make sure the looting would continue without interruption .
Here 's an except from Spitzer 's article :
" In 2003 , during the height of the predatory lending crisis .... the OCC promulgated new rules that prevented states from enforcing any of their own consumer protection laws against national banks .
The federal government ’s actions were so egregious and so unprecedented that all 50 state attorneys general , and all 50 state banking superintendents , actively fought the new rules .
( Washington Post )
So , the Fed knew , the Treasury knew , the FBI knew , the OCC knew , the FDIC knew , Bush knew , the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America knew , Fitch ratings knew , all the states Attorneys General knew , and thousands , of traders , lenders , ratings agency executives , bankers , hedge fund managers , private equity bosses , regulators knew .
Everyone knew , except the unlucky people who were victimized in the biggest looting operation of all time .
Once again , looking for conspiracy , just diverts attention from the nature of the crime itself .
Here 's a statement from former regulator and white collar criminologist William K. Black which helps to clarify the point :
" Fraudulent lenders produce exceptional short - term “ profits ” through a four - part strategy : extreme growth ( Ponzi ) , lending to uncreditworthy borrowers , extreme leverage , and minimal loss reserves .
These exceptional “ profits ” defeat regulatory restrictions and turn private market discipline perverse .
The profits also allow the CEO to convert firm assets for personal benefit through seemingly normal compensation mechanisms .
The short - term profits cause stock options to appreciate .
Fraudulent CEOs following this strategy are guaranteed extraordinary income while minimizing risks of detection and prosecution . "
( William K. Black , " Epidemics of ' Control Fraud ' Lead to Recurrent , Intensifying Bubbles and Crises " , University of Missouri at Kansas City - School of Law )
Black 's definition of " control fraud " comes very close to describing what really took place during the subprime mortgage frenzy .
The investment banks and other financial institutions bulked up on garbage loans and complex securities backed by dodgy mortgages so they could increase leverage and rake off large bonuses for themselves .
Clearly , they knew the underlying collateral was junk , just as they knew that eventually the market would crash and millions of people would suffer .
But , while its true that Greenspan and the Wall Street mandarins knew how the bubble - game was played ; they had no intention of blowing up the whole system .
They simply wanted to inflate the bubble , make their profits , and get out before the inevitable crash .
But , then something went wrong .
When Lehman collapsed , the entire financial system suffered a major heart attack .
All of the so - called " experts " models turned out to be wrong .
Here 's what happened : Before to the meltdown , the depository " regulated " banks got their funding through the repo market by exchanging collateral ( mainly mortgage - backed securities ) for short - term loans with the so - called " shadow banks " ( investment banks , hedge funds , insurers )
But after Lehman defaulted , the funding stream was severely impaired because the prices on mortgage - backed securities kept falling .
When the bank - funding system went on the fritz , stocks went into a nosedive sending panicky investors fleeing for the exits .
As unbelievable as it sounds , no one saw this coming .
The reason that no one anticipated a run on the shadow banking system , is because the basic architecture of the financial markets has changed dramatically in the last decade due to deregulation .
The fundamental structure is different and the traditional stopgaps have been removed .
That 's why no one knew what to do during the panic .
The general assumption was that there would be a one - to - one relationship between defaulting subprime mortgages and defaulting mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) .
That turned out to be a grave miscalculation .
The subprimes were only failing at roughly 8 percent rate when the whole secondary market collapsed .
Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill explained it best using a clever analogy .
He said , " It 's like you have 8 bottles of water and just one of them has arsenic in it .
It becomes impossible to sell any of the other bottles because no one knows which one contains the poison . "
And that 's exactly what happened .
The market for structured debt crashed , stocks began to plummet , and the Fed had to step in to save the system .
Unfortunately , that same deeply - flawed system is being rebuilt brick - by - brick without any substantive changes ..
The Fed and Treasury support this effort , because -- as agents of the banks -- they are willing to sacrifice their own credibility to defend the primary profit - generating instruments of the industry leaders .
( Goldman , JPM , etc )
That means that Bernanke and Geithner will go to the mat to oppose any additional regulation on derivatives , securitization and off - balance sheet operations , the same lethal devices that triggered the financial crisis .
So , there was no conspiracy to blow up the financial system , but there is an implicit understanding that the Fed will serve the interests of Wall Street by facilitating asset bubbles through " accommodative " monetary policy and by opposing regulation .
It 's just " business as usual " , but it 's far more damaging than any conspiracy , because it ensures that the economy will continue to stagnate , that inequality will continue to grow , and that the gigantic upward transfer of wealth will continue without pause .

03 May 10 , 19:57 Capitalism vs. what ?
I always wonder , when people are having fun pretending that capitalism somehow " does n't work , " what they think the alternative is .
Certainly this crony capitalism we have now , which is more like siphoning , is n't good .
The problem is if one is going to whine about capitalism , it seems to imply that we have some better alternative waiting in the wings -- but we do n't , of course .
The alternatives are some form of command and control economy or a pathetic hybrid .
Considering that government intervention mutilates the efficiencies of voluntary exchanges of value , and more government and less efficiency is untenable , then what ?

Nothing happens by accident , Mike .
You have begun to come around these last few months , but you are still far too naive if you think the financial annihilation of the Western world has not involved an enormous , well - planned and well - executed conspiracy .
Mike , the takeover of the Bank of England , the very existence of the Federal Reserve , etc. , are nothing but massive conspiracies .
For what purpose ?
Why , to use money manipulation as THE supreme lever , thereby lifting the entire Western world off its foundations -- and ushering in the Money Masters ' " paradise " .
Wake up , mate -- the hour is very late .

Yes or no question ...
The question that serves as the title of this article requires a simple , clear answer .
Mr. Whitney eventually gives us his opinion ( which is at variance with all of the facts ) , but only after offering this bit of misdirection : " The whole idea of a conspiracy diverts attention from what really happened . "
Mike , the " idea of a conspiracy " does no such thing , especially if people ... con -spired !
Yeah !
See , that was not that hard , was it ?
What really happened is we have been brought to our collective knees by very intelligent , powerful people who have worked together in order to pull this off .
Deal with it .
The truth is you seek to divert attention from the patently obvious .
SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico – Students in the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico , Rio Piedras have announced their plans to occupy both faculties on April 12th .
“ Throughout the day we will have performances , music , poetry , art , work - shops and concerts .
We will occupy against funding cuts , decrease of students rights and moratorium on tuition waivers . ”
Ocúp ( arte ) : The Humanities Manifesto
The Humanities faculty is yours , his , hers , and ours .
Let ’s transform it then , into an active and dynamic space filled with participation and collaboration .
Let ’s modify the State and the Administration - fed attitudes of competition and anxiety , and replace them with cooperation , compassion and youthful jubilation .
As existing power structures have already started to crack and shown their anti-humanist agendas ; so let today and tomorrow be filled with love and a call to action .
Our academic spaces are under siege from the powerful , and must be reclaimed as tools for liberation .
As humanists we can imagine and create all sorts of possible worlds .
It is time to realize them .
We are occupying our faculty in order to find ourselves , to cast aside any attempt to separate and alienate us .
Instead of this kind of death , we have decided to un-muzzle our mouths and let the world know that a new world has taken shape from our hearts .
We are a multitude which thinks , reflects , and criticizes ; a generation whose heartbeat is steeled by the shared interaction between the fist and a kiss .
This is not a call to defend the University , but to redefine it into something new : one that is horizontal and non-hierarchic , participatory and democratic .
Our action is a call for diversity , to the plurality that defines our educational space .
It is the whole of all the types of rich knowledge that contributes to new and different worlds , countries , cities , multitudes and spaces .
Such a colorful melody of difference and respect , solidarity and love , echoes along the halls of our faculty .
We are the children of crisis and marginalization , of an economic system that represses and plunders .
We are the descendants of a political system that condemns participation and decides unilaterally , from the top down .
But we are also the heirs of a long tradition of people that blazed a path for those rights that we now enjoy , that paid with sweat and blood for those benefits that face annihilation today .
Therefore , we are retaking the UPR , so that those that follow tomorrow possess what we have endeavored to build : a multiplicity of knowledge , of perspectives that allow us to think freely in the world we live in , and the world we choose to create .
The fiscal fetish shared by the State and the university ’s administration conceives education as a production line of consumer goods .
As it seems that the humanities do not offer this , they are targeted for gradual elimination .
What the humanities do provide , and they choose to ignore , is the opportunity to be critical , to reflect and question , to give shape to worlds of sounds , of color , performances and of the written word , distinct from our own .
Education cannot be seen through capital ’s narrow gaze or the market ’s whims .
Such an education merely reproduces docile subjects and uncritical automatons .
Let us smash the machine !
We propose a liberating and edifying education that generates autonomous and critical minds , in a collaborative bond between professor and student .
We want an education where everyone involved participates as those who teach and those who learn .
Yet let us not confuse these verbs with the assigned roles of teacher and student , for they apply to everyone .
Such an education by definition must include marginalized communities as subjects of study : immigrants , people of the LGBTQ community , women , men , old and young .
In order to achieve this participatory and democratic education , we must build strong ties of solidarity between study and its subjects .
Solidarity is not built vertically , from the top down , but sideways .
Embrace the one next to you and whisper into his or her ear that you affirm their existence , and that you will not abandon him or her .
Let us intertwine our bodies as roots in a fertile soil that will bear the fruit of imagination and change .
Paint our arms with landscapes of dignity and respect .
Do n’t just worry and stand by , occupy !

La Facultad de Humanidades es tuya , es de él , de ella , en fin es nuestra .
Transformémosla en un espacio activo y dinámico de participación y colaboración .
Modifiquemos la competencia y la ansiedad que el Estado y la administración fomentan , por la cooperación , la compasión y la alegría de la juventud .
Las estructuras de poder comienzan a mostrar sus fisuras y sus metas anti-humanísticas ; hoy y mañana serán días intensos de acción y de amor .
Nuestras disciplinas peligran en las manos de los poderosos , re-tomémoslas como herramientas de liberación .
Como humanistas podemos crear e imaginar mundos alternos , paralelos y posibles .
Es tiempo ya de hacerlos realidad .
Ocupamos nuestra facultad para encontrarnos , para hacer a un lado todo intento de distanciarnos , de separarnos .
Hemos decidido no morir sino destapar nuestras bocas para dejar saber que un mundo nuevo nació en nuestros corazones .
Somos una multitud que piensa , reflexiona y critica , una generación cuyo palpitar se arma por la interacción comprometida de un puño y un beso .
Esto no es una defensa de la Universidad , es una resignificación de la universidad : aquella que es horizontal , no jerárquica , participativa y democrática .
Nuestra acción es un canto a la diversidad , a la pluralidad que constituye nuestro espacio educativo .
Es un aria sobre los variados y ricos saberes que contribuyen a un mundo , un país , una ciudad , una multitud y un espacio diferente .
La colorida melodía de la diferencia y el respeto , de la solidaridad y el amor , se hacen eco en los largos pasillos de nuestra facultad .
Somos hijas e hijos de la crisis y la marginalización , de un sistema económico que reprime y saquea .
Somos descendientes de un sistema político que condena la participación y que decide de arriba hacia abajo .
Pero , también somos herederos de una larga tradición de personas que abrieron camino para que los de hoy tengamos los derechos que tenemos , de multitudes que pagaron con sudor y sangre los beneficios que hoy nos quieren arrancar .
Por ello re-tomamos la iupi y nuestra facultad , para que las y los de mañana tengan lo que hoy construimos : una multiplicidad de saberes , de perspectivas que les permitan analizar críticamente el mundo en el que viven y el mundo que pueden crear .
El fetiche numérico del Estado y la administración concibe la educación como una planta de producción de objetos de consumo .
Como las humanidades no ofrecen ésto , buscan eliminarlas poco a poco .
Lo que sí provee y ellos no valoran es la oportunidad de ser críticos , de reflexionar y cuestionar , de concebir mundos sonoros , pintorescos , performativos y letrados distintos al que tenemos .
La educación no puede ser analizada por medio del lente de los vaivenes del mercado y los caprichos de la inversión capital .
Ese tipo de educación solo genera sujetos dóciles e irreflexivos como autómatas mecanizados .
¡ Rompamos la máquina !
Proponemos una educación digna y liberadora que genera mentes reflexivas y autónomas , una educación colaborativa entre profesores y estudiantes .
Queremos una educación en la que participemos todos los sectores envueltos : los que enseñan y los que aprenden .
No confundamos estos verbos con las identidades de profesor y estudiante , estos verbos apuntan a todos los sujetos envueltos porque el profesorado tanto ense ña como aprende y de igual forma sucede con el estudiantado .
Este tipo de educación conlleva la inclusión de subjetividades marginadas en los sujetos de estudio : inmigrantes , personas de la comunidad GLBTT , mujeres , hombres , viejos y jóvenes .
Para lograr este tipo de educación participativa y democratizante construimos lazos de solidaridad entre saberes y entre sujetos .
La solidaridad no se construye de arriba hacia abajo sino hacia los lados .
Abraza a quien tengas a tu lado y dile al oído que sabes que ella o él existe y que no le dejarás sola o solo .
Enredemos nuestros cuerpos como raíces en un rico suelo cuyo fruto es la imaginación y el cambio .
Pintemos nuestros brazos con paisajes de dignidad y respeto .
¡ No te preocupes , ocúpa ( te ) !

I recently moved to Toronto ( for the summer ) .
On the trip up , we borrowed my uncle ’s GPS so we could find our way to the apartment .
GPSs do n’t like it when you do n’t do what they tell you .
A channel in an ancient Martian " riverbed " was n't carved by liquid water but was built by molten lava , according to a new study of surface features on Mars .
Pictures of the red planet have long revealed features such as valleys and alluvial fans reminiscent of those seen around water bodies on Earth .
( Related : " Huge Mars Region Shaped by Water , Rover Mission Finds . " )
Water is a prerequisite for life as we know it , so these formerly wet landscapes have been touted as some of the best places on Mars to look for traces of past life .
But new high - resolution images of a peculiar 168 - mile - long ( 270 - kilometer - long ) channel near the Ascraeus Mons volcano are n't likely to have been made by water after all .
" We started seeing that , instead of this [ liquid ] cutting into an existing surface , it was building a surface — it built a ridge up to 40 meters [ 130 feet ] high " millions of years ago , said study co-author Jacob Bleacher of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
The channel is also roofed over in some areas and lined with vents — features most often associated with lava tubes .
On Earth , lava tubes form during sustained volcanic eruptions , when lava flowing through previously solidified masses leaves behind empty channels in the rock .
( Related : " Mars Has Cave Networks , New Photos Suggest . " )
" You do n't see this on Earth in [ river ] settings , " Bleacher said .
" But you see it all the time in volcanic settings .
So that 's kind of our smoking gun . "
That 's not to say liquid water never flowed on Mars , said Bleacher , who presented his work last week at the 41st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
But the findings do mean that researchers might need to reevaluate when and where they think water might have existed on the red planet .
( Related : " Mars Had Liquid Water in Recent Past , Rover Finds . " )
Solving a Martian Puzzle
The results are also exciting because they add new layers to Mars 's volcanic history , said Laszlo Kestay , a planetary geologist on the NASA team that produced the new images of the channel .
" I think there are some very clearly water - formed features on Mars , but there are other things that are more puzzling .
Jake and colleagues make a very compelling case that at least this one is volcanic , " said Kestay , with the U.S. Geological Survey 's Astrogeology Science Center .
And there 's a good chance other channels in the Ascraeus Mons area will turn out to be lava - made as well , Kestay said .
In general , the latest find is among the myriad new details about Martian lava flows being uncovered by high - resolution imaging of the Martian surface , Kestay said .
The new image data , he said , are " revealing not just these channels but a whole suite of smaller volcanic features and showing that volcanism is more widespread spatially than people thought . "
NASA Grants a " HiWish "
In addition , the new study highlights a pioneering program that allows people anywhere in the world to get behind the lens of the Mars - orbiting camera used in Bleacher 's work : NASA 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment .
HiRISE started sending back color pictures of the Martian surface in 2007 , with the primary goal of finding a suitable landing site for the upcoming Mars rover Curiosity , slated to launch in 2011 .
Now that the options have been narrowed down to four possible landing sites , NASA has launched HiWish , a Web site where the public can suggest new targets for the high - resolution camera .
Bleacher 's research is based on images taken after he had submitted a request to a beta version of HiWish made available to scientists .
In previous pictures of the Ascraeus Mons region of Mars , " the big hindrance has been that you can see [ only ] the big features , " Bleacher said .
" But you really need the details to see how things evolved . "

Quolls became locally extinct in Kakadu National Park when cane toads invaded
Scientists in Australia have designed a cane toad " sausage " that could help protect vulnerable predators from the poisonous toads .
The researchers developed the sausage as a bait that could help train animals to avoid eating the large toads .
They employed " taste aversion learning " - adding a nausea - inducing drug to cane toad meat .
This , the scientists say , caused animals to associate the smell of the toads with feeling sick .
Jonathan Webb from the University of Sydney , the senior member of the research team , explained : " It 's a really powerful form of learning .
" Many people might have experienced it when they get food poisoning and then associate the taste or the smell of whatever food it was that made them ill with feeling sick . "
In the wild , the quolls encountered big toads and ignored them
Dr Jonathan Webb
University of Sydney
His team focused on quolls - small carnivorous marsupials that used to be very abundant in northern Australia .
Their numbers have seriously declined in the last 20 years .
" These animals are a real icon in northern Australia , " said Dr Webb .
" They 're very cute and have lots of personality .
It is not entirely clear why the quolls ' numbers have declined so much , but the arrival of the invasive cane toads seemed rapidly to make their situation even worse .
" When the toads came along , suddenly the quolls became extinct in Kakadu National Park , " said Dr Webb .
" What we were interested in doing was coming up with a practical solution to deal with this population crash when the toads invade . "
The challenge , explained Dr Webb , was that the toads have very large toxin glands in their shoulders , primarily containing chemicals called bufadienolides , which can very quickly induce a cardiac arrest .
" The quolls see the toad as a big frog , " he explained .
" It looks good to eat , so they just pounce on it and get a fatal dose of toxin .
There 's no chance they can learn from the encounter . "
Catch and release During the time when he was puzzling over this , he read a story to his children .
" It was a modern version of Little Red Riding Hood , " Dr Webb recalled .
" And at the end , the grandma , to get her own back , puts a bag of onions in the wolf 's tummy so that he wakes up feeling sick .
" At that point I thought : what if we added a nausea inducing chemical to the toads ? "
This unusual approach seems to work .
Cane toads have large toxin glands in their shoulders Dr Webb 's University of Sydney colleague , Stephanie O'Donnell , trained 30 quolls - feeding them pieces of dead toad that were laced with a nausea - inducing drug .
" After they ate it , they started to get a little bit crook ( ill ) , " he said .
" The animals did n't vomit - just pawed at their faces for a while and then got back to normal .
But the next time they were offered a toad they ignored it . "
Dr Webb and his colleagues then released the quolls into the wild with radio collars so they could monitor them .
" In the wild , they did encounter big toads and they ignored them , " said Dr Webb .
" You could see they were interested in the toads because they were big and they were hopping around .
Some of them followed the toad for a while .
But most of them just sniffed it , and then thought - yuck , you 're no good to eat - and walked away . "
Lizard learning Based on these results , the team is trialling a toad sausage containing minced toad legs with the nausea - inducing chemicals .
" We 've had some promising results , " said Dr Webb .
" We had camera traps and have been able to see that the quolls would eat the sausages .
" What we have n't done yet is see if the quolls that eat the sausages then avoid the real cane toads .
" But it 's such a powerful form of learning that the taste and smell of the prey can really override the other cues [ such as the visual cue of the sight of the toad ] . "
Wildlife managers have previously developed bait sausages designed to control feral cats .
So if the approach works well , it could be easily deployed - by laying the sausages in habitats to train predators before the toads invade .
Dr Webb said : " We 're trialling this with monitor lizards and with bluetongue lizards too - they are also badly affected by the toads . "

Smoke and ash bellow from Eyjafjallajökull volcano as it is seen from Hella , Iceland , in April 2010 .
Iceland 's Eyjafjoell volcano is no longer in activity , a geophysicist said Sunday , raising hopes the eruption which has heavily disrupted European flights for more than a month could be over .
Iceland 's Eyjafjoell volcano is no longer in activity , a geophysicist said Sunday , raising hopes the eruption which has heavily disrupted European flights for more than a month could be over .
" What I can confirm is that the activity of the crater has stopped .
No magma is coming up " Magnus Gudmundsson of Iceland University told AFP .
" The eruption , at least for the time being , has stopped .
Now there is only steam coming out of the crater , " he said , cautioning however that " it is too early to tell whether this is the end of the eruption or just a temporary stop in activity . "
Experts would be monitoring the volcano , which began eruption on April 14 , very closely in the days and weeks to come .
" I would say if there are no new earthquakes and no new outburst , then that would suggest that it is over , " Gudmundsson said , adding that it could take a very long time before it would be possible to say for sure .
" If you call me in one year 's time , I could be pretty certain , " he said , pointing out that the previous eruption at the volcano lasted 13 months , from 1821 - 23 .
" It stopped and started again several times with different intervals , so it 's difficult to say , difficult to give a timeline , " he said .
The latest eruption at Eyjafjoell also began just a day after a more peaceful eruption ended on the Fimmvurduhals flank of the same volcano .
Experts have cautioned that once the current eruption halted , a new blast in another crater or in the neighbouring and much larger and fiercer Katla volcano might follow .
When or if that will happen is also , according to Gudmundsson , " impossible to say . "
In recent days , experts had said the activity at the Eyjafjoell volcano , which peaked for a third time just over a week ago , had slowed significantly .
Gudmundsson however said it was difficult to tell exactly when the activity had stopped .
" The flow of magma was very small yesterday , but it was still erupting at 5:00 to 6:00 pm ( 1700 - 1800 GMT ) .
Ash was falling to the west of the volcano , " he said , adding that " there has not been any eruption since at least this morning . "
During Eyjafjoell 's highest activity peak in the week after it began erupting , it released ash enough to cause the biggest aerial shutdown in Europe since World War II , affecting more than 100,000 flights and eight million passengers .

blackholes and exception handling
Hello , GHC can spot ( some ) non-terminating computations and terminate with blackhole : < < loop > > instead of running indefinitely .
With exception handling one can handle such situations .
The following program ' launches missiles ' : import Control .
Exception main = do handle go_ahead don't_launch_first launch_missiles don't_launch_first = don't_launch_first go_ahead :: SomeException -> IO ( ) go_ahead _ = putStr " go ahead , " launch_missiles = putStr " fire ! "
The output of this program is go ahead , fire !
although , don't_launch_first is a non-terminating computation .
Without black - hole detection this code would never ' launch missiles ' .
Is the above output intended ?
The idea behind black - hole detection is that one bottom is as good as another [ 1 ] .
Consequently , exception handling may not distinguish between non-termination and other errors .
Is the equation _|_ `catch` const a = a supposed to hold in general ( for every kind of bottom ) ?
Or is it a bug in GHC that programmers can handle black - hole errors ?

Producers Stock , Aitken and Waterman Mixing / Production By Richard Buskin
Producers Stock , Aitken and Waterman developed a massively successful formula for making pop records — and the story of Rick Astley 's 1987 smash hit , ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' , is a perfect guide to the SAW assembly line ...
" We make records to entertain people for between three to seven minutes , and if they do n't like them they do n't buy them , ” Pete Waterman told me when I interviewed him , Mike Stock and Matt Aitken at Waterman 's South London PWL Studios ( aka The Hit Factory ) back in 1987 .
" If they do buy them they are doing so not because of art but because they like the records . ”
They certainly did seem to like the records .
During the second half of the 1980s and early part of the 1990s , the songwriting / production team of Stock Aitken Waterman virtually swamped the worldwide singles charts with a non‑stop series of carefully crafted , highly processed and overtly commercial dance music records that , while derided by the vast majority of British music critics , resulted in more than 100 UK Top 40 hits and global sales of about 40 million units .
Bananarama , Mel & Kim , Dead Or Alive , Rick Astley , Kylie Minogue , Donna Summer , Jason Donovan , Divine , Sonia , Samantha Fox , Princess , Hazell Dean — these and many other singers benefited from what was widely perceived as SAW 's production ‑line approach to writing and recording , which made extensive use of synths , sequencers and a Linn 9000 drum machine to create slick ‑sounding ' Eurobeat ' numbers adhering to a formula devised by Pete Waterman .
A former dance music DJ and A&R man , Waterman established PWL ( Pete Waterman Limited ) in 1984 and , in conjunction with keyboardist , writer and arranger Mike Stock and keyboardist , guitarist and composer Matt Aitken , enjoyed initial success by way of Divine 's ' You Think You 're A Man ' , Hazell Dean 's ' Whatever I Do ( Wherever I Go ) ' and Dead Or Alive 's UK chart topper ' You Spin Me Round ( Like A Record ) ' .
None of these hi‑NRG hits were written by SAW .
However , that all changed after they scored a US number one for Bananarama with a cover of Shocking Blue 's ' Venus ' in September 1986 , and then collaborated with the girl trio on the Wow !
album that , written and recorded in 21 days , spawned several more hit singles .
" Pete had noticed that there had been a change in the type of beats that were coming out of Europe , ” Matt Aitken explained during our 1987 interview .
" The styles of rhythm tracks had changed quite a lot .
He 'd been doing a lot of travelling abroad , and he brought some records back for us to have a listen , and we noticed a slowing down of tempo and a difference in the implication on the bass . ”
" It was still four ‑on ‑the ‑floor as far as the bass drum was concerned , ” added Mike Stock , who came up with many of the SAW songs ' core progressions and melodies while Aitken devised the grooves , including guitar riffs and bass lines .
" But what used to be known as ' Eurobeat ' or ' hi ‑NRG ' — which had an octave bass going ' boom‑pah , boom ‑pah , boom ‑pah ' — was now a rock bass doing eighths , like Status Quo .
That really changed the whole implication , and on top of that there was also a swing element , and so when you program some of the instruments you put a little shuffle into it .
There was quite a cool little rhythm going on there , and we took to it instantly .
We got the direction we had been looking for , and the results were records like ' I Heard a Rumour ' .
It 's not luck , we 're looking out all the time for these sorts of things . ”
During the course of which , while keeping abreast of the trends and acting as a sounding board for his two colleagues , Pete Waterman was living the good life .
" It 's great , because I have the roving brief in this team , ” he remarked .
" My job is purely to keep us so far ahead of everybody else that they can't catch us .
Now , to do that I have to do certain things ; I have to be able to go to France , to Italy , to Germany and so on , and lock myself in a room .
I went to Paris , stayed in a hotel over a weekend , turned on the radio and just listened to the top three stations for 24 hours each , because France was the last market that we had never sold records in .
Then I came home with four records that were all Italian — they were n't French — and I said to the guys , ' Here is what it is : Italian melodies with the Euro beat and Motown lyrics . '
You see , the foreign lyrics do n't translate well into English . ”
This was the template , and over the next few years numerous different singers were brought in to add vocals to pre‑recorded backing tracks .
" The way that we work is to constantly jot down interesting ‑sounding song titles on a notepad whenever one or more of us thinks of them , and to then choose from these when we write songs , ” Waterman continued .
" Next , a guide drum pattern is laid down with a Linn 9000 , and a guide keyboard part is recorded to set the harmonic structure .
Lyrics are built around the song title as the song progresses ; bass , percussion and rhythm tracks are recorded , and then we bring in the vocalist .
At least five minutes of material is recorded for a three ‑minute single , and so this leaves the engineer with extra music to play around with for the 12 ‑inch mix . ”
" We do n't know how a song is going to turn out when we start writing , ” Mike Stock added .
" I always have this aim in my mind that the record we 're making is better in some area than the one we were working on before . ”
" That 's very true for me , too , ” stated Waterman .
" However , you can never perfect something , and so you have to let go at some point .
I mean , if possible , Matt and Mike would sit for hours to perfect a little thing — you know , Mike is never happy with the vocals , Matt is never happy with his guitar solo , in fact , Matt 's the bloody worst !
I have to tell him , ' It sounds bloody brilliant to me , ' and come in and beat him up and take the guitar off him !
He 'd spend three days doing a guitar solo if no one stopped him , and we have constant battles about that .
" We record quickly , spending days on singles and a few weeks on albums .
After all , when the pressure 's on , that 's when you do your best work , and there 's no better inspiration than somebody paying you to write a hit song . ”
Such was the case with Rick Astley 's ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' , a worldwide smash that topped the UK charts for five weeks in 1987 and became the best ‑selling single of the year before also hitting number one in the US , Sweden , Norway , Holland , New Zealand and Australia , where it would eventually be listed as the best ‑charting single of the 1980s .
Not bad for a 21 ‑ year ‑old Lancashire lad who , before recording his multi‑platinum debut album , Whenever You Need Somebody , had reportedly helped out as a tea boy at PWL .
" That 's part of the folklore , ” says Mark McGuire , who engineered the record .
" Rick was the nicest artist I worked with there .
He was extremely down ‑to‑earth , but also incredibly shy , and although Pete had spotted him [ playing the UK club circuit with a soul band named FBI ] and wanted him to record , he feared that Rick would be too shy in the studio to get anything done .
So he asked him to work there for a while , get to meet everyone , hang out with them and have a laugh , so that he would n't be intimidated when it was time for him to record .
He was , therefore , employed there as an ' assistant ' , but not really to work as an assistant .
It was merely a way of introducing him to the studio . ”
McGuire 's first music‑related job was during the early ‑ ' 80s , serving as a tape‑op — and , in a few instances , an engineer — on the demo sessions of prospective signings at EMI Records ' now ‑defunct Manchester Square headquarters in London .
Duran Duran , Culture Club , the Angelic Upstarts — all were among the artists that he encountered during his year there , before subsequently working for a couple of years at Abbey Road on sessions by , among others , the Alarm , Meatloaf and Placido Domingo .
Thereafter , a freelance period included an assignment with engineer Phil Harding , and when Harding 's recording and mix of the aforementioned hits by Divine , Hazell Dean and Dead Or Alive led to him being involved with setting up the PWL Studios complex , he introduced McGuire to Pete Waterman .
This resulted in McGuire also landing a job as an in‑house engineer ; in his case , handling the recordings , along with Mike Duffy and Karen Hewitt , while Harding , Pete Hammond and Dave Ford took care of the mixes .
" The attitude there was , if it 's not going to work quickly , it 's not going to work at all , and if you do n't make something with excitement then how can people listen to it with excitement ? ” recalls McGuire .
He was now working within a two‑studio setup : ' The Borough ' upstairs , where he sat alongside Stock and Aitken , and where Pete Hammond did most of his mixes ; and ' The Bunker ' downstairs , which was the main mix room for Phil Harding and utilised 48 ‑ input SSL E Series consoles , Urei main monitors and a solitary Studer A820 tape machine that was constantly being wheeled around .
" The room I worked in was very shallow , and I really liked its close , intimate sound , ” McGuire remarks .
" The Linn 9000 , which most sequences and drums were done on , was run from a [ Friendchip ] SRC synchroniser , and a [ Yamaha ] DX7 was used for virtually all of the bass lines .
There was also a [ Roland ] Juno 106 ; a [ Yamaha ] Rev 5 and Rev 7 ; Dbx 160 compressors ; SDE 3000 delays ; an Emulator ; and the wonderful Publison Infernal Machine 90 , which was the first sampler that could actually pitch ‑change without really affecting the time signature .
You could time ‑stretch things and make them fit reasonably well —
It was a little choppy , but for the time it was phenomenal .
Other than that , there was an AMS delay / harmoniser , which always had a number of kick and snare samples , and that was pretty much it .
" Matt and Mike hardly ever had songs written before the sessions began .
In fact , sometimes the singer would be in the studio to perform his or her part and , still not having completed the song , they'd be passing notes under the desk , trying to write the second verse while we were recording the first .
It was n't that they were flying by the seat of their pants , but , given the phenomenal turnover of artists requiring material , there was sometimes no other way to do it than to tap - dance furiously on the day in order to get through it .
It took incredible talent to be able to do that , as well as a mindset to never be too precious . ”
In the case of Rick Astley , Stock , Aitken and Waterman initially worked on a couple of tracks that they thought would be well suited to his rich baritone voice : a cover of The Temptations ' 1966 hit single ' Ain't Too Proud To Beg ' — which would end up on Astley 's second album , Hold Me In Your Arms — and the SAW original , ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' .
The latter was arguably one of their best songs , boasting a memorable , ' 70 s ‑style disco hook and synthesized backing that would underpin Astley 's smooth , soul‑laced R&B vocal .
" Mike and Matt would use the template that they thought would be ideal for a given artist , and the launchpad for ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' consisted of Steve Arrington and Colonel Abrams , ” says McGuire .
He 's referring , respectively , to the former singer , songwriter and drummer for the funk band Slave and the house / urban ‑contemporary musician who enjoyed a number of late ‑ ' 80s hits that helped make him one of the music industry 's most sampled vocalists , as well as establishing his reputation as the Godfather of House .
" They thought their music would fit well with Rick , so someone brought in the records , one of which was Colonel Abrams ' ' Trapped ' , and after we 'd listened to them and analysed them we started to replicate the sounds , trying to adopt their ethos rather than sample or rip them off in any way .
" These were tracks that were being played in clubs at around that time , and , having been inspired by them , Mike and Matt wanted to capture their feel .
A piano ‑bass line was laid down using the DX7 , some kick and snare drums were sampled up with the Linn 9000 and loaded into the AMS — so that we could tighten up the sample and then trigger it with an audio trigger — and all the time we were A‑B'ing between the records and what we were doing in order to get the sounds similar and replicate the mood .
Then , once the guys were confident they had that , they moved on .
" Initially , a chord structure was put down by Mike , the bass‑and ‑drums groove was put down on top of that , and next came the guitar riff .
All of this took a matter of hours — a couple of hours to replicate the feel of the records , another couple of hours to get a guitar thing going — not days or weeks .
It happened very quickly .
And although the song had n't even been fully written , Mike would also perform some backing vocals , along with session singers like Suzanne Rhatigan , Mae McKenna , Shirley Lewis , Dee Lewis and Miriam Stockley .
The track 's title was often enough to give them a sense of direction , and it was odd how some things were built .
It appeared to be wrong , but it worked . ”
" Sometimes we put a series of different things together and it turns out disastrously , ” Mike Stock admitted in 1987 , to which Pete Waterman added , " They sit and fart around for a few hours , and they fight with each other like crazy because they 're trying to make a recipe without knowing precisely what ingredients to use .
Then I 'll walk in , and they might sing me a melody over what they 've done , and I 'll say , ' To me that sounds exactly like what I 've been listening to on French radio ! '
Technically I wo n't know what these two guys have done or the agony that they 've had to go through , because I 'm like a kid ; I 'm not really interested .
I 'm only interested in whether or not the record is exciting to me . ”
While it did n't earn him a songwriting credit , McGuire claims to have contributed the last line of the chorus : " Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you ” , which rhymed with , and prevented the repetition of , " Never gonna run around and desert you . ”
Indeed , following the song 's success , he testified on Stock Aitken Waterman 's behalf in a court case involving a woman who falsely claimed they had stolen her composition after hearing her sing it on a bus .
" I do n't think they ever took the bus , ” quips McGuire , who subsequently went freelance and engineered records by James , the Soup Dragons , Jamiroquai , Baby Ford , S'Express and M People , before quitting the business in the late '90s .
Still , he was n't the only one to have made an uncredited contribution to some of SAW 's songs .
" They would deliberately leave the middle eight empty and expect the mix engineer to fix this by sampling the lead vocal from somewhere else in the track , ” says Phil Harding who , quite typically for a SAW project , was just one of the mix engineers on Rick Astley 's Whenever You Need Somebody album , and also just one of the mix engineers on several of the songs .
" While Mike Stock may have thought this enabled the mixers to be creative , it became something of a lazy habit and meant that whoever did the first mix of a particular track would have to spend time deciding what part would work in the middle eight and then use a MIDI keyboard running into either the Publison or the AMS .
That 's why , if you listen to Stock Aitken Waterman records , there is rarely an American ‑style middle eight where it moves to different chords ; it 's usually just a repeated chorus or repeated verse with something triggered over it .
And if all else failed , trigger ‑wise , then we might have to use the intro melody line . ”
Best known for his long - time affiliation with keyboardist / programmer Ian Curnow — who played the ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' sampled string lines on a Fairlight housed in PWL 's sub‑basement , and also contributed sounds to the DX7 that was used for the bass —
Phil Harding started out as a 16 ‑ year ‑old tea boy in 1973 at London 's Marquee Studios .
Within four years there he was engineering and building a resumé that included the Clash and Killing Joke , and it was also at Marquee that Harding first met Pete Waterman .
At that time , Waterman and producer Peter Collins were partners in a company named Loose Ends that handled pop acts such as Nik Kershaw , Musical Youth and Tracey Ullman , and soon Harding was collaborating with them , co‑producing Matt Bianco , engineering Toyah and doing 12 ‑inch mixes for Stiff Records .
Then , when Collins and Waterman went their separate ways , Harding engineered Waterman 's Marquee ‑based productions — including those of Divine , Hazell Dean and Dead Or Alive , with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken .
This was prior to the establishment of PWL , where Harding was installed as the Chief Engineer .
( He 'd remain there until 1992 , at which point he and Ian Curnow would move on to the Strongroom . )
As it happens , ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' was not among the songs that Phil Harding mixed on Rick Astley 's debut record , even though , serving as SAW 's B‑Team , he and Curnow actually produced two of the tracks .
Instead , the single 's mix was the sole responsibility of Pete Hammond , who worked on it during his regular late ‑night / early ‑morning shift and , while developing the middle eight , devised the " never gonna give , never gonna give ” sampled refrain ...
" I gave it a sort of '70s sound , which I thought it was leaning towards , and I dumped most of the overdubs and made a 12 ‑inch version , which they subsequently edited down to make the seven‑inch , ” recalls Hammond , whose work as a member of the bands Limmie Funk Limited and New Music first attracted the attention of Peter Collins and Pete Waterman .
( His many mixing , engineering and production credits , in addition to the SAW stable , have included Roger Waters , the Christians , Take That , Squeeze and , most recently , Alphabeat , Sinitta , Lonnie Gordon and Velvet . )
" In fact , what 's on the multitrack bears no relation to what the actual single is .
On the single , there 's a third verse which features just Rick 's vocal and some drums , and that was taken from the 12 ‑inch that I did , because there was no third verse on the multitrack .
" I remember Mike and Matt had a query about some of the vocal echoes not sounding like they were in time with the track , and that was purely because of how Rick sang it .
The echoes were in time with the track , but because Rick sang it slightly off the beat the echoes sounded slightly off the beat .
Still , what I used on the vocal , which is the effect that I use on most of my mixes — and which , despite no one sussing what it was , made it sound so good — was a 200 ‑ millisecond delay , slightly filtered and then fed into a very small room ‑type effect .
That gives you a close ambience that is quite big at the same time ; the same effect was used on the toms and can be heard quite clearly at the intro .
It 's a weird sensation , and the Americans use it a lot .
" Stock , Aitken and Waterman had nothing to do with the mix .
I was there entirely alone — most times , I was alone .
Although Waterman says he was there with me through the night , he never was .
He used to come and listen in the morning , but in this particular case he did n't even do that .
The record was initially put out as part of ' Upcoming Things From PWL ' and sent to Capital Radio in a one ‑minute format , and when Capital started playing it the guys were forced to release it .
They had no image for Rick or any plans to put the song out as a single , but they released it as quick as a flash . ”
' Never Gonna Give You Up ' was the biggest hit single of 1987 in the UK , a US chart ‑topper in early 1988 and a song that , in many ways , has come to define its era .
Certainly , this is true with regard to the slick ‑looking video , which features Astley performing the number and delivering some of his own moves while accompanied by a trio of dancers .
In May 2007 , this became the now ‑widely publicised subject of ' Rickrolling ' , a bait‑and ‑switch Internet prank , whereby clicking on a web link leads the user to the ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' video , despite the fact that the link itself is supposed to relate to an altogether different topic such as ' Whitney Smoking Crack ...
Caught On Tape !!!!'
Within a year , the video had registered more than 13 million views on YouTube , and the man himself actually capitalised on this by making a surprise appearance at the 2008 Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade to perform the song in front of a television audience of tens of millions .
" If this had happened around some kind of rock song , with a lyric that really meant something — a Bruce Springsteen ' God Bless America ' or an anti‑something kind of song — I could kind of understand that , ” Astley told the LA Times .
" I do n't mean to belittle it , because I still think it 's a great pop song , but it 's a pop song ; do you know what I mean ?
It does n't have any kind of weight behind it , as such .
But maybe that 's the irony of it ...
I just think it 's bizarre and funny .
My main consideration is that my daughter does n't get embarrassed about it ! ”
Artist : Rick Astley Track : ' Never Gonna Give You Up' Label : RCA Released : 1987 Producers : Stock Aitken Waterman Engineers : Mark McGuire , Pete Hammond Studio : PWL
Hobson 's Choice ...
All SAW ‑produced artists were recorded with the only microphone available at PWL ; the Calrec Soundfield .
Forget about different colours and characteristics for different vocalists — in Stock , Aitken and Waterman 's hands , just as in those of musical auteurs such as Phil Spector , the artists ' individuality was often engulfed by the trademark sound of the producers .
Or , to put it another way , the producers were the artists , supplemented by guest vocalists .
" As far as the guys were concerned , the Calrec was a good mic that worked and they did n't have the time to go to the trouble of trying out any others , ” explains PWL engineer Mark McGuire .
" I remember someone once asking them why they used the same 707 conga pattern on every song , and basically their answer was because it works .
It did for them what a conga pattern should , and that applied to a lot of things .
" The Calrec really , really suited some people 's voices and absolutely destroyed others .
It had a very flat sound and some people just were n't suited to it .
Some needed a really bad mic to sound good .
In terms of Rick , it worked fantastically well because he had such a great and powerful voice — if you stood beside him when he sang , it sounded exactly like the records — whereas when I subsequently tried it with Holly Johnson it did n't work at all and he desperately wanted to go back to his original mic . ”
“ False Profits ” by Dean Baker
Making a change from the usual run of the genre ( ie , books about the “ financial crisis ” by people who did n’t tell you that there was a bubble while it was going on , but who nevertheless expect you to be interested in what they have to say about it now that it ’s been and gone ) .
A book about the bubble in the US , written by someone who was absolutely right about it , provably , ahead of time and in writing , and who is a lot more angry about the whole mess than those authors who just regard it as a great big game in which some entertaining characters made money at the expense of their dumb counterparties .
Despite the comparatively microscopic size of his promotional budgets , I think Baker might have caught the spirit of the times a bit better than Andrew Ross Sorkin or Michael Lewis [ 1 ] .
( Full disclosure – I got a promotional review copy of “ False Profits ” .
Normally I do n’t count the very occasional review copies I get as constituting a declarable interest because I am short of shelving space and so the gift of a book is only a good thing for me if it is a good book anyway – if it is crap , the publisher has gifted me the chore of lugging the thing to Oxfam .
But I thought False Profits was a good book , and I am probably going to get some help on a different project from the person I am giving my copy to after I ’ve finished this review , so purists might think me compromised ) .
“ False Profits ” has the big advantage that it gets the crisis right and does n’t mess around with all the obfuscation that has been put into the debate by people who were trying to sell the line that “ The Global Financial Crisis ” was a very complicated thing that ordinary voters could n’t possibly understand but nonetheless had to cough up ungodly amounts of money for .
This was n’t a global financial crisis ; it was a crisis of US real estate valuations .
Whatever else went on , whatever shady dealings or irresponsible banking practices or misplaced belief in models or whatever else , it would n’t have had much of an effect on the world if it had n’t all been based on a foundation of overvalued property prices .
True , a lot of the disastrous financial wizardry was aimed at justifying and enabling the property bubble to continue and ( as John points out in a couple of CT posts ) the causal relationship between financial malpractice and the property bubble was two - directional , but it ’s necessary to be clear here – the original sin here was the real estate bubble , a bubble which could and should have been the object of anti-bubble policy , and which was n’t , because of a massive , ghastly policy error on the part of the Federal Reserve .
This is Dean ’s thesis , and he names the guilty men .
My god , by the way , does he ever name the guilty men .
One of the very attractive characteristics of Dean Baker ’s economics writing , shared with the best bits of Paul Krugman and Doug Henwood , is that he is a left - liberal writer about economics who completely lacks the ‘ cultural cringe ’ common to the species .
He does n’t feel the need to call people like Martin Feldstein “ really smart ” and he does n’t waste time giving house room to the normal platitudes of market theism or pretending that his view of the world is really properly considered quite close to orthodoxy .
In general , he does n’t crawl around seeking the approval of the economics profession .
I would surmise that the constant torrent of scorn would get depressing at length ( as I think it sometimes does on his blog ) , just as a boy who kept on shouting out that the emperor was bare - arsed every ten seconds would eventually get on your nerves , but really , we can cross that bridge when the airwaves are full of self - confident liberal economists giving their message as if they expect it to be agreed with and The Economist is a minor newsletter .
But anyway , the explanation of what happened and its consequences is clear and simple – this is economics the way it ought to be done , focusing on simple causal relationships and adding - up constraints .
None of the arguments made by housing bulls during the bubble made a lick of sense , for the simple reason that the ratio of house prices to rents was constantly increasing – any fundamental change in the economics of housing ought to have shown up equally in the rental market as in the market for house purchase , and the “ buy versus rent calculation ” was n’t an anomaly or a quirk – it was a simple and easily comprehensible piece of information showing that prices were in a bubble , which was almost universally ignored .
The model that fits the data is a simple , myopic - expectations one under which people were prepared to invest in housing at ever higher rental multiples ( or alternatively , ever lower rental yields ) because they were making an implicit comparison of the cost of renting a house versus the up - front , teaser - rate cost of buying one on mortgage , with the highest level of gearing that the market would give them .
Such a model works until it does n’t , and then we had the crash .
As I mention in a bit more detail on my own blog , this pretty much gives the lie to any comparisons with the Internet bubble – there really were a lot of new technologies invented between 1997 and 2001 , many of which did in fact change the whole structure of economic life .
But rent is rent and has seen basically no technological progress since the Domesday Book .
Failure to spot the housing bubble was much more unforgivable than failure to spot the dot com bubble , and the case for anti-housing bubble policy is therefore much stronger than for anti-stock - market - bubble policy .
I am not sure that I agree with all of Dean ’s views on the TARP ( not necessary , massive con ) , bank nationalization ( should have happened ) or policy solutions going forward ( rather heavier on IMO meaningless financial technocratic fixes ) , but the facts are that I ’m much more prepared to listen to them because they come from someone who was actually right about this damn thing , and who did indeed sell his house at a profit .
And his key policy prescription , on the subject of the Federal Reserve Board and anyone who served on it in the last ten years ( sack the bastards ! ) , is a good point well made ; there really does have to be some sort of accountability for this sort of thing .
[ 1 ] Capsule review of the Lewis book – definitely do n’t bother with the hardback , it costs 25 quid , and is basically a collection of chortlesome anecdotes .
On the other hand , Liar ’s Poker was also basically a collection of chortlesome anecdotes and that was a very good book ;
Lewis does get the finance right and explains it in very clear terms ( he even gets the analogy right , between a CDO and a housing block – this was the only way I found to explain these structures too ) .
The cast of characters are interesting and well - researched and if it was n’t for the constant rankling of the expense of the book , I think I would have wholeheartedly enjoyed it .
In paperback it will be a very good read and probably cleanses Lewis ’s soul of the accumulated sins of a decade of ghastly magazine articles .
Now he just has to write something to make up for The New New Thing and he can probably go to heaven .
A typical experiment in functional magnetic resonance imaging goes like this : A subject is slid into a claustrophobia - inducing tube , the core of a machine the size of a delivery truck .
The person is told to lie perfectly still and perform some task — look at a screen , say , or make a decision .
Noisy superconducting magnets whir .
The contraption analyzes the magnetic properties of blood to determine the amount of oxygen present , operating on the assumption that more - active brain cells require more - oxygenated blood .
It ca n't tell what you 're thinking , but it can tell where you 're thinking it .
Functional MRI has been used to study all sorts of sexy psychological properties .
You 've probably seen the headlines : " Scientists Discover Love in the Brain ! " and " This Is Your Brain on God ! "
Such claims are often accompanied by a pretty silhouette of a skull , highlighted with splotches of primary color .
It 's like staring at a portrait of the soul .
It 's also false .
In reality , huge swaths of the cortex are involved in every aspect of cognition .
The mind is a knot of interconnections , so interpreting the scan depends on leaving lots of stuff out , sifting through noise for the signal .
We make sense of the data by deleting what we do n't understand .
What 's disappointing here is n't just that these early fMRI studies are overhyped or miss important facts .
It 's that this mistake is all too familiar .
Time and time again , an experimental gadget gets introduced — it does n't matter if it's a supercollider or a gene chip or an fMRI machine — and we 're told it will allow us to glimpse the underlying logic of everything .
But the tool always disappoints , does n't it ?
We soon realize that those pretty pictures are incomplete and that we can't reduce our complex subject to a few colorful spots .
So here 's a pitch : Scientists should learn to expect this cycle — to anticipate that the universe is always more networked and complicated than reductionist approaches can reveal .
Look at genetics :
When the Human Genome Project was launched in the early 1990s , it was sold as a means of finally making sense of our DNA by documenting the slight differences that encode our individuality .
But that did n't happen .
Instead , the project has mostly demonstrated that we are more than a text , and that our base pairs rarely explain anything in isolation .
It has forced researchers to focus on the much broader study of how our genes interact with the environment .
This same story plays out over and over — only the nouns change .
Once upon a time , physicists thought they had the universe mostly solved , thanks to their fancy telescopes and elegant Newtonian equations .
But then came a century of complications , from the theory of relativity to the uncertainty principle ; string theorists , in their attempts to reconcile ever widening theoretical gaps , started talking about 11 dimensions .
Dark matter remains a total mystery .
We used to assume that it was enough to understand atoms — the bits that compose the cosmos — but it's now clear that these particles can't be deciphered in a vacuum .
Not surprisingly , this is exactly what neuroscientists are coming to grips with .
In the mid-'90s , Marcus Raichle started wondering about all the mental activity exhibited by subjects between tasks , when they appeared to be doing nothing at all .
Although Raichle 's colleagues discouraged him from trying to make sense of all this noisy activity —
" They told me I was wasting my time , " he says — his team 's work led to the discovery of what he calls the default network , which has since been linked to a wide range of phenomena , from daydreaming to autism .
However , it can't be accurately described with the kind of distinct spots of a typical fMRI image .
There 's too much to see :
It 's a network of colorful complexity .
Thanks to the work of Raichle and others , neuroscience now has a mandate to forgo the measurement of local spikes in blood flow in favor of teasing apart the vast electrical loom of the cortex .
God and love are nowhere to be found — and most of the time we have no idea what we 're looking at .
But that confusion is a good sign .
The brain is n't simple ; our pictures of the brain should n't be , either .
Karl Popper , the great philosopher of science , once divided the world into two categories : clocks and clouds .
Clocks are neat , orderly systems that can be solved through reduction ; clouds are an epistemic mess , " highly irregular , disorderly , and more or less unpredictable . "
The mistake of modern science is to pretend that everything is a clock , which is why we get seduced again and again by the false promises of brain scanners and gene sequencers .
We want to believe we will understand nature if we find the exact right tool to cut its joints .
But that approach is doomed to failure .
We live in a universe not of clocks but of clouds .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy had to dodge a projectile on Tuesday during a visit to discuss violence and truancy in schools .
Sarkozy was in Beauvais , about 80 kilometres north of Paris , where he hit out against absenteeism , which he ’s described as a “ cancer ” .

The identity of the bottle - thrower remained a mystery Wednesday morning .
One of Sarkozy ’s bodyguards came between the plastic bottle and the president at Charles Fauqueux high school in Beauvais .
It was thrown as pupils gathered around the president , seeking to shake his hand , before he was set to visit an art class in which pupils had drawn pictures on the subject “ express your fears ” .
Sarkozy was in Beauvais to highlight his government ’s plans to freeze benefit payments for families whose children remain absent from school for prolonged periods .
After four and a half days of unjustified absence , the headmaster will propose a “ contract of parental responsibility ” , explained Sarkozy .
“ If it happens again , benefits will be cancelled , ” he said .
The allocation will then be “ retrospectively ” paid when the student returns to school .
The proposals will be examined by the French parliament in mid-June .

Q :
Where in a galaxy would you expect to find Type I and Type II supernovas ?
A :
The two basic types of supernovas are Type Ia and Type II .
Other types , such as Types Ib and Ic , are unusual supernovas that have most of the properties of type II supernovas .
Type Ia supernovas are believed to be triggered by a large transfer of mass from a companion star onto a white dwarf that pushes the white dwarf over the Chandrasekhar limit .
A thermonuclear explosion follows , blowing the entire star apart , and sending material rich in iron and other products of the explosion rushing out into space .
Since a white dwarf is involved , Type Ia supernovas are expected to be found among old star systems , such as globular clusters , the central bulges of galaxies and elliptical galaxies .
Type II supernovas are thought to result from the collapse of a massive star ( ten or more times as massive as the Sun ) that has reached the end of the red giant stage of evolution , and formed an iron core .
The core collapses under the weight of the outer layers of the star .
A neutron star is formed , lots of neutrinos and other radiation is emitted , and everything except the neutron star is blown away .
Since massive stars are involved , Type II supernovas are found in the spiral arms and other star - forming regions of spiral and disk galaxies , which have lots of gas and dust for the formation of new stars .

You do n't even need to be on acid to think deeply about this one
This little C program converts a decimal value — represented as a string — into a double - precision floating - point number :
#include < string .h > int main ( void ) { double intPart = 0 , fracPart = 0 , conversion ; unsigned int i ; char decimal [ ] = " 3.14159 " ; i = 0 ; /*
Left to right */ while ( decimal [ i ] != '.') { intPart = intPart *10 + ( decimal [ i ] - ' 0 ' ) ; i++ ; } i = strlen ( decimal ) - 1 ; /* Right to left */ while ( decimal [ i ] != '.') { fracPart = ( fracPart + ( decimal [ i ] - ' 0 ' ) ) / 10 ; i--; } conversion = intPart + fracPart ; }
The conversion is done using the elegant Horner ’s method , summing each digit according to its decimal place value .
So why do I call it “ quick and dirty ? ”
Because the binary floating - point value it produces is not necessarily the closest approximation to the input decimal value — the so - called correctly rounded result .
( Remember that most real numbers cannot be represented exactly in floating - point . )
Most of the time it will produce the correctly rounded result , but sometimes it wo n’t — the result will be off in its least significant bit(s ) .
There ’s just not enough precision in floating - point to guarantee the result is correct every time .
I will demonstrate this program with different input values , some of which convert correctly , and some of which do n’t .
In the end , you ’ll appreciate one reason why library functions like strtod ( ) exist — to perform efficient , correctly rounded conversion .
Testing the Conversions
How do you test whether a quick and dirty conversion is correct ?
First you need to know what the correctly rounded value is , and then you need to compare it to the quick and dirty value .
Here are two ways to find the correctly rounded value :
Assign the decimal constant to a double and let your compiler compute it for you .
Enter the decimal constant in my arbitrary - precision decimal / binary converter and then round it by hand to 53 significant bits ( the number of significant bits in a double ) .
I did both , because I know that sometimes even compilers do the conversions incorrectly ( see my articles on Visual C++ and gcc / glibc ) .
In any case , I verified that all the compiler conversions in the examples below are correct .
Next we need to compare the quick and dirty value to the correctly rounded value — but how ?
Comparing floating - point values for equality is not reliable .
That means we should display the values and compare them manually .
But we ca n’t depend on printf ( ) , because in many implementations it wo n’t print all the significant digits , either before the decimal point or after the decimal point ( this is true of Visual C++ , the compiler I am using ) .
This leaves several options :
Print the raw IEEE representation of the double , using my functions print_raw_double_hex ( ) or print_raw_double_binary ( ) .
Print the value of the double as a hexadecimal floating - point constant .
Print the value of the double in binary scientific notation , using my function print_double_binsci ( ) .
Print the value of the double in binary , using my function fp2bin ( ) .
I think seeing the binary representation is the most enlightening ; of the three binary display options , I chose fp2bin ( ) .
The Test Code
I modified the code in the introduction of this article to allow for testing , as described ; here it is
#include < string.h > # include < stdio.h > # include " fp2 bin.h " int main ( void ) { char binString [ FP2BIN_STRING_MAX ] ; double intPart = 0 , fracPart = 0 , conversion ; unsigned int i ; char decimal [ ] = " 3.14159 " ; /* Converted manually */ double compiler_conversion = 3.14159 ; /* Converted by compiler */ i = 0 ; /* Left to right */ while ( decimal [ i ] != '.') { intPart = intPart *10 + ( decimal [ i ] - ' 0 ' ) ; i++ ; } i = strlen ( decimal ) - 1 ; /* Right to left */ while ( decimal [ i ] != '.') { fracPart = ( fracPart + ( decimal [ i ] - ' 0 ' ) ) / 10 ; i--; } conversion = intPart + fracPart ; /*
Print the converted values , in binary */ fp2bin( compiler_conversion , binString ) ; printf ( " Correct = %s
" , binString ) ; fp2 bin( conversion , binString ) ; printf ( " Q and D = %s
" , binString ) ; }
When run ( I ran on an Intel Core Duo processor ) , the output shows that the compiler and quick and dirty conversions of 3.14159 are both correct :
Correct = 11.00100100001111110011111000000011011100001100110111 Q and D = 11.00100100001111110011111000000011011100001100110111
Their value in decimal , obtained from my binary / decimal converter , is 3.14158999999999988261834005243144929409027099609375 .
Incorrect Conversions
Incorrect conversions are due to the limitations of floating - point arithmetic ; specifically , these three things affect the conversion calculations :
Large integers require more bits than can fit in a floating - point variable .
Multiplying a binary integer by ten is exact , but once the integer exceeds the largest integer that a double can represent exactly , rounding errors can occur .
. Division by ten in binary arithmetic is inexact .
Each time the fractional value is divided by ten , there is a chance of roundoff error .
. Addition of integers and fractions can incur rounding error .
When an integer and fraction are added , some of the bits of the fraction can be lost .
( Also , values near DBL_MAX can convert incorrectly to “ infinity , ” although I ’m not considering overflow here . )
The example values below — which I discovered by both random testing and trial and error — are all rounded incorrectly by my quick and dirty program .
The Integer 18014398509481993
The number 18,014,398,509,481,993 ( 254 + 9 ) is not converted correctly by the quick and dirty program ; this is its output ( the lines I changed are char decimal [ ] = “ 18014398509481993.0 ” ; and double compiler_conversion = 18014398509481993.0 ; ) :
Correct = 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000.0 Q and D = 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 100 .0
Their values , in decimal , are
Correct = 18014398509481992 = 2 54 + 8
+ Q and D = 18014398509481996 = 254 + 12
These values differ by 4 , which is one unit in the last place ( the last place for a double is the 53rd significant bit ) .
The Fraction 0.9199
The number 0.9199 is not converted correctly by the quick and dirty program ; this is its output ( the lines I changed are char decimal [ ] = “ 0.9199 ” ; and double compiler_conversion = 0.9199 ; ) :
Correct = 0.11101011011111101001000011111111100101110010010001111 Q and D = 0.1110101101111110100100001111111110010111001001000111
Their values , in decimal , are
Correct = 0.91990000000000005098144129078718833625316619873046875 = 8285722594436239/2 53
Q and D = 0.9198999999999999399591388282715342938899993896484375 = 4142861297218119/252 = 8285722594436238/253
These values differ by 2 - 53 , which is one unit in the last place .
The Combined Integer and Fraction 1.89
The number 1.89 is not converted correctly by the quick and dirty program ; this is its output ( the lines I changed are char decimal [ ] = “ 1.89 ” ; and double compiler_conversion = 1.89 ; ) :
Correct = 1.1110001111010111000010100011110101110000101000111101 Q and D = 1.11100011110101110000101000111101011100001010001111 1
Their values , in decimal , are
Correct = 1.8899999999999999023003738329862244427204132080078125 = 1 + 4008203668359741/2 52
Q and D = 1.890000000000000124344978758017532527446746826171875 = 1 + 2004101834179871/251 = 1 + 4008203668359742/252
These values differ by 2 - 52 , which is one unit in the last place .
The interesting thing is that 0.89 by itself converts correctly ; it ’s only when it ’s added to 1 that the final result becomes incorrect .
The Fraction 3.50582559e-71
The number 3.50582559e-71 is not converted correctly by the quick and dirty program ; this is its output ( in the program source , I wrote 3.50582559e-71 as 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000350582559 ) :
Correct = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011110111110001010011001011001000010111111010110010001
Q and D = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111101111100010100110010110010000101111110101100 00011
Their values , in decimal , are
Correct = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003505825590000000127666442084156194149833722363535945086623257683235283315238231093157098293845387261005915287514287812242780435016915881911641225954878731368200574173594143601202788307347191221197135746479034423828125 = 8717642643535249/2 287
Q and D = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003505825589999994497525328603499564935354782628876135671208090707866566080104779573609823758603905804048854042779018384586485878398467052729618730030977116116317972699506139481161193227620742618455551564693450927734375 = 8717642643535235/2287
These values differ by 14/2287 , which is 14 units in the last place .
( This is the largest error I found — in fact , the only example of an error this large — in the over 100 million random conversions I tried ) .
Discussion
In practice , you ’ll depend on your compiler or interpreter or a library call for correctly rounded conversion .
The de facto standard code used by many implementations is David Gay ’s strtod ( ) function in dtoa .c .
Take a look at it to get a sense of how involved correctly rounded conversion is .
( dtoa . c handles scientific notation , and also includes code for correct conversion in the other direction — floating - point to decimal ) .
For a little more detailed discussion of Horner ’s method , see my PHP functions bin2dec_i ( ) and bin2dec_f ( ) .
Those two functions implement the same algorithms as the quick and dirty program , only using decimal arithmetic and powers of two ( there ’s nothing “ dirty ” about them though — they ’re binary to decimal and arbitrary precision ) .
Conversion to Single - Precision
Conversion to floats works similarly , also producing correctly and incorrectly rounded results .
There ’s one thing I observed , which you might find surprising : a given decimal value may convert incorrectly to a double but correctly to a float !
Have you ever been strucked by a completely useless exception message somewhere from the depth of a 3rd party application or library you had to use in your code ?
Have you ever wanted the bloody nameless programmer to have written a truly informative and helpful error message so that you would n’t need to spend hours trying to figure out what was the problem that would have been easily discovered if only more context information available at the moment when the exception occured was included in its error message ?
Have you wondered how only you could inject the necessary logging into the spot ?
Read on to get the answer .
Update 6/2010 : You may also want to read the follow - up blog Implementing build - time bytecode instrumentation with Javassist .
Recently I was testing my extension to Saba , a monstrous J2EE learning management system , and got an exception from a Saba class saying that the expected and actual data types of a custom attribute do n’t match .
The problem was that I had no idea which one of the 10s of custom attributes could be the cause and I even was n’t sure which object ’s attributes I should check .
It would be so much easier if the “ nameless bloody Saba programmer ” ( no offense :-) ) included the attribute ’s name and preferably also its actual & expected data types and the actual and new values .
How could I insert there logging of these properties ?
Needless to say that I had to use Java 1.4 ( no agents … ) and could n’t afford more than modifying this single class file ( i.e. no additional libraries etc. ) because the changes I could do to the development environment where the application ran were limited .
Of course the easiest would have been to decomile the class , add the loging before the exception is thrown , recompile it and replace it on the server .
But not only is decompiling illegal here , it also sometimes simply does n’t work .
Fortunatelly there is another solution – JBoss Javassist is a byte code manipulation library that supports not only runtime manipulation but also post - comilation time manipulation , i.e. you can modify and save the class and use it to replace the original file .
There are quite a few byte code manipulation libraries but Javassist has the great advantage that you do n’t need to know much about bytecode , you can simply pass a String with java statements that should be inserted before / after / … method call or into a new catch statement .
There is a nice tutorial that describes it ( see part 4.1 , Inserting source text at the beginning / end of a method body ) :
addCatch ( ) inserts a code fragment into a method body so that the code fragment is executed when the method body throws an exception and the control returns to the caller .
In the source text representing the inserted code fragment , the exception value is referred to with the special variable $e .
For example , this program : ClassPool pool = ClassPool.getDefault ( ) ; CtClass compiledClass = pool.get ( " mypackage . MyClass " ) ; CtMethod m = compiledClass.getDeclaredMethod(" myExceptionThrowingMethod " ) ; CtClass etype = ClassPool.getDefault ().get ( " java.io.IOException " ) ; m.addCatch ( " { System.out.println ( $e ) ; throw $ e ; } " , etype ) ; translates the method body represented by m into something like this : try { the original method body } catch ( java.io.IOException e ) { System.out.println(e ) ; throw e ; } Note that the inserted code fragment must end with a throw or return statement .
You can use $e to access the exception , $ 0 to access “ this ” , $ 1 to access the 1st parameter of the method etc .
At the end you just call compiledClass.writeFile ( ) ; and use the modified mypackage / MyClass.class to replace the original class in the application .
Lovely , is n’t it ?
A developer that 's trying to highlight the dangers of forgetting about personal privacy has unveiled a new service that shows how easy it is for users to have their phone numbers acquired by Facebook visitors .
The service , called Evil , sifts through Facebook groups to find posts left by users that include their phone numbers .
It then displays the person 's name and all but the last three digits of their phone numbers on the site .
The issue , according to Tom Scott , the tool 's creator , is that there are a slew of Facebook groups that are created each day by folks who lose their phones and need their friends ' numbers back .
Rather than e-mail each person individually , those people create groups where users can simply post their numbers to the group 's wall .
From there , the group owner can take the numbers and put them into their new phone .
It 's a simple , useful process for the group owner .
But what those who are adding their numbers to the wall might not realize is that the majority of those groups are set to " public . "
And , according to Scott , a public group is viewable by anyone anywhere in the world , regardless of whether they 're a Facebook user or not .
Scott 's Evil app aims to highlight that flaw and scare people into thinking twice before sharing content on Facebook .
He also tells them that they should remove their phone numbers from any groups they might have shared them with .
If they do n't , the numbers are readily available with a simple Google search or by sifting through groups .
Evil might not make affected users or Facebook itself very happy , but it effectively highlights a key issue with the social network :
Users are too willing to share information .
And , so far , they do n't appreciate the fact that by sharing sensitive information , it could potentially be viewed by folks across the Web .
Facebook is dealing with privacy and security issues of its own that it needs to address .
But the social network can't be fully secure until users start taking responsibility for their own privacy .
It 's important for users to remember that .

The extra " tenths " is a very old tradition that 's never gone away .
In 1935 , a Reno Nevada newspaper wrote about " selling third grade gasoline at eight and nine - tenths cents a gallon . "
In those times , a penny had considerable value .
To raise the price of gasoline from 8 to 9 cents would be more than a 12 percent hike .
To compete , gas stations raised prices by tenths of a penny .
Around this time , federal and state excise taxes were also introduced in increments of tenths of a cent , so it made sense to keep the decimal value .
Perpetuated for Profit ?
The tradition stuck .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration , ' prime suppliers ' of ' motor gasoline ' reported sales of 372,833.5 thousand barrels sold in February 2007 .
These gas sales collected US $ 141 million in nine - tenths - of - a - cent increments .
With gasoline prices in the US $ 2.00 to US $ 4.00 range , the 9/10 no longer serves a constructive purpose , and occasionally measures have been introduced to abolish it .
From 1980 to 1984 , the state of Iowa experimented with even cents , but eventually returned to the 9/10 pricing .
There 's nothing quite like those moments on Fox when Megyn Kelly and Monica Crowley share the set , because nobody kvetches louder than these two .
Yesterday they had a special segment where they whined about President Obama reportedly referring offhandedly to the Tea Party movement as " teabaggers . "
The whole segment , as usual , was rife with disinformation .
Crowley tries to characterize the DHS bulletin describing right - wing extremists as a potential terrorist threat as an attempt by the administration to demonize ordinary conservatives -- a simply risible ( not to mention deeply irresponsible ) claim .
Kelly tried to claim that this was the supposedly the " second time " Obama had been caught using the term -- even though , in fact , he did n't actually say it to Earl Blumenauer .
Crowley was especially comical :
Crowley :
He ought to really apologize for this vulgar and vile comment referencing the American people , and also try to give some sort of speech -- I know a lot of us have heard enough from the president already -- but he should try to put out some words that are going to make up for this kind of thing .
...
But you know , Megyn , even if he were to go out and say this , I would encourage him to do it , but he 's got a credibility problem now because it seems that every time there is a movement or an individual or an institution or an organization that disagrees with his policies , he personalizes it .
He singles them out , whether it 's Fox News , or Sergeant Crowley of the Cambridge police department , or the entire state of Arizona for supporting this new immigration law , whether it's the Tea Party movement , he has this willingness that 's very unbecoming of the American president , to go out and single out the American people .
Of course , neither of them get around to explaining exactly why the president needs to show deference to a movement explicitly organized around opposing him and any and every policy he might try to enact , a movement embodied by people who call him a Marxist and a fascist and depict him as a witch doctor with a bone in his nose .
But most amusing of all is the notion that calling Tea Partiers " teabaggers " is a horrendous , unforgivable slur .
As Dave Weigel says , it 's clear that Tea Partiers find it offensive now , so that 's probably reason enough not to use it if you 're interested in conversing with them .
That 's a big if , though .
Moreover , as Jay Nordlinger at National Review admits , the term " teabagger " was introduced to the political lexicon by Tea Party movement leaders :
The first big day for this movement was Tax Day , April 15 .
And organizers had a gimmick .
They asked people to send a tea bag to the Oval Office .
One of the exhortations was “ Tea Bag the Fools in D.C. ”
A protester was spotted with a sign saying , “ Tea Bag the Liberal Dems Before They Tea Bag You . ”
So , conservatives started it : started with this terminology .
But others ran with it and ran with it .
Tommy Christopher at Mediaite has it about right :
The origin of the term is relevant in determining the relative size of the Tea Party ’s violin .
What was n’t pointed out to Tapper is the fact that the Tea Partiers not only invented the term , they did so in order to inflict a similar double entendre onto the President , the Democrats , and liberals in general .
Hence , it ’s a violin so small , you need an electron microscope with a zoom lens to see it .
Now , they ’re trying to re-cast the term as a slur , on a par with the “ n - word , ” hurtful to all the Tea Party members who are just ordinary moms , dads , sons , and daughters .
The latter point has some resonance , but the former is ridiculous in the extreme .
In emails , protest signs , t- shirts , and online , early Tea Party literature urged protesters to “ Tea Bag the White House , ” and to “ Tea - bag the liberal Dems before they tea - bag you . ”
The suggestion is that the metaphoric “ tea - bags ” be shoved in the mouths of the President , Democratic members of Congress , and even ordinary citizens who identify as liberal Democrats .
The idea that they just did n’t know the term ’s only ( at that time ) meaning is belied by the fact that they obviously knew it was negative ( and non-consensual ) , since they did n’t want it done to them , and also because it only had one meaning .
It was only after MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow and David Shuster , and CNN ’s Anderson Cooper , turned the tables on the term that Tea Partiers objected .
They were perfectly satisfied to advocate the metaphoric mouth - rape of liberal men , women , and children , but had the nerve to become indignant when the insult boomeranged on them .
Here 's a video of Griff Jenkins urging viewers to " Tea Bag the White House , " plus Charles Krauthammer last November referring offhandedly to the " Tea Bag protests " :
And then there was Neil Cavuto in May :
I understand Tea Partiers want to get people to stop using a word they now find embarrassing .
But can we please stop pretending that it's an unconscionable slur ?
Allie Brosh , who appears to be some sort of genius , brings us definitive arguments in the cake versus pie debate .
Best to read the entire treatise , but here are a few highlights on how clearly pie defeats cake :
Ability of enjoyment to be sustained over time
Could n’t agree more : it always seems like a good idea on the first bite , and then I catch myself .
What am I doing ?
I hate cake .
Another graphic :
Unequal frosting distribution is a problem
I grew up requesting pie for my birthday ( strawberry rhubarb , thank you very much ) instead of cake .
This resonates .
More importantly ( for this site ) , Brosh cites the enormous impact of pie vs. cake for information design and visualization :
Pie is more scientifically versatile :
Again , you really should read the full post , or the rest of her site for that matter .

Using Stakeholder Analysis in Software Project Management
Bas de Baar
Every software professional that has been part of more than one project knows for sure : no two projects are the same .
Differentcircumstances make most software projects unique in several aspects .
And withdifferent situations come different approaches to handle project lifeeffectively : there are multiple ways to " do " a project .
Different circumstances require different approaches .
Although a project is to a large part defined by the required end results and technology used , the main determining factor of what makes aproject different from another is people .
The entire process of softwareproject management is strongly stakeholder - driven .
It is their wishes , fears , dreams �their stakes �that determine the course of the project .
Youhave to handle a project to really grasp the impact of people on your endeavour .
You have to " live " a project to know the force of political games andpower trips .
You have to lead a team to deliver a project under time pressuresto appreciate the constructive power of motivated people or the destructive power of demotivated team members .
In a project , it is the people that are the main cause of problems .
Time schedules , financial projections , and software goals may beabstractions , but it is the flesh - and - blood people whose work determines yourproject�s status .
It �s the programmer that misses a deadline and holds upeveryone else , it�s the financial manager that goes berserk if you can�tproduce some good budgetary indications , and it�s the key user that doesn�tgive a darn but didn�t tell you about his dismal lack of motivation ; these are the folks who can cause serious trouble .
Stakeholders and the Software Project Manager�s Problem
So , as a software project manager , you should really focus on the stakeholders .
You should be guided by their fears and their wishes .
A stakeholdercan be a project team member , an employee of the user organization , or asenior manager .
It can be virtually anyone , as long as that person has something to do with the project .
Here is the central problem the software manager is faced with , appropriately named " the software project manager�s problem , " as explained by Barry W. Boehm and Rony Ross [ 1 ] .
They believe that everyoneaffected by the project , directly or indirectly , has something to say , againdirectly or indirectly , and will do so .
All of them want to get the best fromthis project for themselves personally or for their organization .
It is the jobof the software project manager to see that everyone gets what he or she wants , in one way or another .
He has to " make everyone a winner . "
Of course , this is easier said than done .
You have to act like a psychoanalyst and get in touch with everyone�s deeper feelings .
Mosttechnical project leaders would be running for the door at this moment .
To makeit less fuzzy , we can attach some project management lingo to it :
" The project manager can use stakeholder analysis to determine the stakes and expectations of the stakeholders , and adopt the projectorganization and feedback mechanisms according to the desired outcomes . "
Expectations , Interests and Requirements
Stakeholder analysis is a technique to identify and analyze the stakeholders surrounding a project .
It provides information on stakeholdersand their relationships , interests , and expectations .
A proper analysis of thestakeholders will help you to construct a project approach suited to the situation and will allow you to negotiate better with the stakeholders .
What people ( and therefore your project stakeholders ) really , really , really want is what can be termed their interests or , as I sometimes call them , their stakes ( hence the name " stakeholder " ) .
With fears there is a stake to lose , and with wishes there is something to gain .
In this context , I consider interests as the aspects that drive people .
Before you start drawing your " interest evaluation diagram " or some other tool or technique , be aware that in general these interests are hardly ever communicated .
It is pure mind stuff , all inside the head of the owner .
A four - year - old boy may share his true interests with you , but the fifty - year - old greying accountant will tell you nothing .
If no one will tell you anything , what is the point ?
People will tell you something if you ask them .
They will tell you they want an ice cream cone , a new hyperspeed Internet uplink , or a new financial software package .
In essence , they tell you what they expect .
It is a statement created by themselves about a desired situation : their expectations .
If I emphasize that expectations are a one - sided communication , then there must be something else as well ; enter requirements .
Requirements are a set of statements negotiated among a group of people .
They can be the original expectations , if all agree on the statement itself , but more often than not , requirements consist of some consensus of conflicting expectations .
It sounds simple , but getting the expectations is one thing and discovering their corresponding stakes is another .
Why bother anyway ?
What is it worth ?
A lot .
You can�t effectively change the stakes , but you can alter the set of requirements as long as the new requirements continue to support the stakes .
In this way , there is room to negotiate a set of requirements for the project that poses no conflict , matches the stakes , and thus makes everyone a winner !
Consider this example : a stakeholder formulates an expectation for the software project ; for example , senior management states that " The project should be finished before the end of August . "
The project manager then has to deal with this time frame .
When this deadline is no problem , he can rest assured ; however , it is a software project , so the deadline typically will be a problem .
The way to handle it is to get some information on the stakes that prompted this requirement to be formulated in the first place .
Perhaps it is the old " I don�t want to lose face when my projects get delayed " concern .
That being the case , the project manager can offer alternatives that don�t violate the stake , like keeping the deadline but postponing a subsystem .
Chances are good that alternative requirements that keep supporting the stakes will be accepted �maybe not easily , but project managers should do something to earn their money .
So , it seems to be valuable to dig deeper into the souls of your stakeholders .
It sounds all very misty and cloudy , but keep remembering whyyou must do it :
Expectations are assessable and can be influenced .
However , you should stay true to the interests of people ; they will determine the amount of leverage you have to change the expectations without setting a stakeholder on the warpath .
Requirements have to stay in line with what people are expecting .
If stakeholders find out the requirements don�t fit their expectations , you have a major problem .
Knowledge about the stakeholders and their expectations and interests helps you shape the project organization ( structure , authority , and responsibility ) .
It is a very good risk analysis strategy to see where the potential problems will be .
Stakeholder Analysis
The actual steps for a stakeholder analysis are :
Stakeholder identification
Stakeholder expectations and interests
Stakeholder influence and role in the project
Stakeholder Identification
This first step is concerned with the question " Who are the stakeholders ? "
For this , you basically draw maps of people or groupsand their relationships .
You start with two names on a whiteboard and before you know it , you are drawing on the walls .
Stakeholder Expectations and Interests
The more difficult step is this one ; here we get the socio - psycho stuff .
For expectations it is fairly straightforward : just ask .
Youcan ask in person or via mail or email .
Create some variations on the question , so that it is not too obvious what you are trying to find out .
Stakeholder interests are another thing .
Trying to elicit their interests is always guesswork , deducting them from other information .
Forthis , there are two types of approaches : ( 1 ) using a checklist to assist yourthinking about the stakeholder and ( 2 ) plotting people in small models that help determine the way to approach them .
For the first type , consider a list with questions like : " Is he satisfied with his current job ? " , " Is he covering up hisown incompetence ? " and " Does he want a bigger office ? "
Thinkingabout these questions help you build an image of the person�s interests .
Consider the list at the end of this article as good starting point .
Using small models , the second type , can be easier than it sounds .
For this , you have to plot a stakeholder in a dimension , and by doingthat , you get an idea of how to approach the stakeholder .
Dimensions caninclude : " How much in favour of the project " , " Process or Content - oriented " and " Group or Individual - oriented . "
Stakeholder Influence and Role in the Project
The insights about the stakeholders will assist us also to construct the project organization :
Do we have to include the stakeholders in the organization ?
If so , is it wise to grant stakeholders great influence or should we give them positions where they can do no harm ?
How can we construct stakeholders � job descriptions in such a way that they are as motivated as possible ?

Detroit fans have their storied tradition of throwing an octopus onto the ice at Joe Louis Arena .
Phoenix fans , by comparison , do n't have as much playoff history to fall back on , but there has to be some way to counter the Wings in their first round playoff series , right ?
â† µ
Yes .
Throw the snake , of course .
â† µ
If you 're a hockey fan and you 're on Twitter , you probably saw the hash tag # ThrowTheSnake at least once this morning .
Here 's the story behind it .
Chemmy aka @felixpotvin on Twitter , a writer at SB Nation 's Maple Leafs blog , Pension Plan Puppets , had an idea for SBN's ' Yotes writer at Five For Howling , Travis Hair aka @travishair on Twitter .
â† µ
The start :
â†µ @ TravisHair holler at me when you wake up , I have an idea .
â† µ
â†µâ† µ
The idea :
â†µ RT if you want @ TravisHair to throw a rattlesnake on the ice for game one of Wings - Coyotes .
# ThrowTheSnake â† µ
â†µâ† µ
And from there it took off .
39 - plus re-tweets .
The number one trending topic in Canada .
It took on a life of its own , getting to the point where Travis himself did n't even know what was going on .
Slowly though , it 's actually becoming a serious thought .
Travis ' wife chimed in via an email to him supporting the idea , calling it his " cultural obligation " , " an opportunity to make a tangible impact " in a city with a " weak fan culture . "
â† µ
From there , the planning actually got going , with fans from several teams chiming in about getting rubber snakes shipped to Arizona in bulk .
Could it actually happen ?
Could a little thought , started as a joke , turn into a tradition in the the Desert ?
Show extent of damage in Port - au - Prince Show distribution of displaced people in Port-au - Prince
The sheer scale of Haiti 's quake disaster presented rescuers with a seemingly overwhelming task .
Below are some of the main ongoing logistical challenges .
AIRPORT
Rescue teams from 17 countries , including France , are on the ground Port - au - Prince 's small international airport has struggled to cope with the number of aid flights arriving in response to the earthquake .
Within days , the Haitian government formally put the airport 's operation in US hands and Washington has established a temporary air traffic management system for flights .
The airport has only one runway and standing room for 18 aircraft at a time , so planes arriving with aid have been delayed while those on the ground are unloaded .
However , the UN says some 150 aircraft are landing every day .
The US and Canadian military recently contributed equipment to speed up the unloading process but lack of transport and fuel has made it difficult to move goods to other locations .
The main airport in neighbouring Dominican Republic quickly became congested as it supported an alternative route for aid .
But US Southern Command says aid flights have started landing at airfields in Jacmel , southern Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona airports in the Dominican Republic .
PORT
The port has suffered severe damage
The main port in Port - au - Prince was closed after severe damage to the docks and the one major crane at the facility .
Some initial aid shipments were diverted to Cap Haitien port .
On 16 January , the first ship finally docked at Port - au - Prince , carrying a cargo of bananas and coal , and the port is now considered functional .
US engineers and dive teams are restoring piers , cranes , and buildings , as well as clearing debris at the port .
The UN says the port should be able to receive 350 containers a day as of 25 January , an increase from the present daily capacity of 250 containers .
The port at Jacmel in the south of Haiti is operational for small ships .
Saint Marc and Gonaives ports are reported to be open but their capacity is not yet clear , the UN says .
The US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson has arrived off Haiti carrying 19 helicopters .
It will serve as a " floating airport " for relief operations .
The US has also sent three amphibious assault ships and several Coast Guard cutters .
ROADS
Some roads are impassable - either as a direct result of earthquake damage , or because they are blocked by rubble or smashed vehicles .
Some aid agencies have been unable to get to their warehouses .
Roads to the neighbouring Dominican Republic , though damaged , are open and the best option for the majority of incoming cargo .
The UN peacekeeping mission ( Minustah ) , which has around 3,000 troops and police in and around Port - au - Prince , is working to clear some of the major roads .
Road access between Port - au - Prince and Leogane - two of the worst affected areas - is reported to be good .
But key routes that are open are becoming congested with the movement of people and supplies .

The UN says the security situation is stable with a few reports of scuffles , looting and gunshots .
Some rescue crews said they were forced to stop work at nightfall because of security concerns .
Responsibility for maintaining law and order in the capital now rests with the UN mission 's international troops and police .
Haiti has no army and its police force has all but collapsed in the aftermath of the earthquake .
UN troops are providing military escort for UN agencies delivering aid and international NGOs have been advised to travel with escorts .
The US , which has sent thousands of troops to help the relief effort , is providing additional capacity at the request of the UN .
SHELTER
Between 500,000 and 700,000 people are believed to have been left homeless as a result of the earthquake , according to the UN 's latest estimates .
More than 500 makeshift camps have been identified by the Haitian government , which has requested large tents to set up reception centres for the homeless .
Agencies have assessed 350 sites , which currently accommodate around 472,000 people .
However , only six of these sites have access to water sources .
The Haitian government has identified six sites for camps outside of the city , such as land near Croix des Bouquets , and has suggested that these camps should be for 20,000 people each .
WATER
Even before the earthquake only half of Haitians had access to clean water .
Now most of the remaining water supply been cut off .
Agencies have been working to provide water and sanitation to as many people as possible .
On 20 January , 755,000 litres of water were provided to 151,000 people as well as 7,000 bottles of water to hospitals , orphan centres and a police station .
The ICRC is providing clean water for more than 12,000 homeless people living in three camps .
The UN is particularly concerned about the situation in Cite Soleil , one of the capital 's poorest neighbourhoods , where there is an acute shortage of water .
Some bottled water is being brought from the Dominican Republic but far more supplies or purification kits are needed .
The USS Carl Vinson , docked off Haiti , is fitted with water - purifying equipment that can make 400,000 US gallons ( 1.5 m litres ) of drinking water a day .
Other countries have sent mobile water purification units , which can convert contaminated water from wells and streams into drinking water .
FOOD
The UN has set up a " Food Aid Cluster " to meet the needs of two million hungry people .
The World Food Programme ( WFP ) has four fully operational distribution sites - in Champs de Mars , Petionville Club and two sites in Delmas and the number of sites is expected to increase .
WFP has provided around three million meals to more than 200,000 people since the start of the emergency response - each person getting a five - day ration .
Most were distributed in the Port - au - Prince area , but also in Jacmel , Leogane , Jeremie , Bainet and Gonaives .
The UN says the aim is to distribute 10 million meals over the next week , reaching 100,000 people a day .
One thousand metric tons of ready - to - eat meals will arrive in Port - au - Prince on 27 January .
Seven US military helicopters are being used to support aid distributions in areas around the capital .
BURIAL OF THE DEAD
The leading US general in Haiti has said it is a " reasonable assumption " that up to 200,000 people could have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake .
Lt Gen Ken Keen said the disaster was of " epic proportions " , but it was " too early to know " the full human cost .
The disposal of dead bodies has been a key priority for the relief effort .
The bodies of thousands of victims have been piling up in the streets and outside hospitals .
Many more remain trapped beneath rubble .
More than 80,000 dead people are reported to have been buried , many of them in mass graves .
GOVERNMENT
The presidential palace , the parliament and many government buildings have collapsed , hampering an already weak central government .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says the agency is co-ordinating relief work with Haitian President Rene Preval , and that government agencies , including the police services , are now regrouping .
Mr Preval has increased the number of working groups and is designating official group leaders who will liaise with the UN .
An information hub has also been set up at Judicial Police headquarters in Port - au - Prince .
CO - ORDINATION
The UN mission has set up an operations centre at the airport to co-ordinate the work of around 26 international search and rescue teams .
It says no more urban rescue teams are appropriate at this stage .
Several relief agencies ' offices , including the UN's , are damaged and their staff dead or missing .
Co-ordination efforts are also being hampered by frequent power cuts and communications outages .
MEDICAL AID
The US naval ship Comfort is a fully - equipped " floating hospital " UN health specialists say at least eight hospitals or health centres in the capital collapsed or suffered severe damage .
Most public and private hospitals still standing were stretched to the limit in the immediate aftermath , with not enough staff to handle the hundreds of wounded waiting at their gates , the Red Cross said .
Many of the injuries have been appalling .
International surgeons have been carrying out an average of about 50 amputations a day .
Field hospitals have been set up by teams from Russia , Israel , Colombia , Jordan and Brazil - including some with resources to perform neurological , orthopaedic , maxial - facial and general surgery .
Helicopters have also been ferrying the wounded to hospitals in nearby countries .
The US hospital ship , USNS Comfort , with 500 medical personnel and 250 beds onboard , arrived in Port - au - Prince harbour on 20 January and has treated more than 230 people .

The Republican National Committee ’s grim week continued with a fundraising letter mistakenly directing donors to a phone sex line , the formation of a competing organization to raise money for GOP candidates , and a major conservative leader telling his followers to stop giving to the RNC .
Those developments followed a damaging flap earlier in the week about the RNC 's reimbursement of $ 2,000 in expenses at a Hollywood nightclub featuring topless dancers and bondage outfits .
In response , the RNC fired a staffer who authorized the payment and promised to seek reimbursement from the contractor who had racked up charges at Club Voyeur .
The stream of bad news is likely to make it harder for key party organizations to raise money for the 2010 elections .
“ The greatest damage to Republicans from the controversies surrounding the RNC is the collateral damage to their House and Senate committees and Republican Governors Association , ” says Charlie Cook , editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
Those organizations – and not the RNC – have primary responsibility for coordinating and funding crucial midterm election campaigns for House , Senate , and gubernatorial races .
“ These stories are like a wet blanket , making it harder for the other committees to do their jobs , harder to capitalize on a political climate that is highly favorable ” for Republicans , Mr. Cook says .
Drumbeat of unfavorable news
The drumbeat of unfavorable news has cast RNC chairman Michael Steele ’s managerial skills in an unfavorable light .
But at the moment he seems likely to keep his position .
“ Some are calling for Chairman Steele ’s resignation , but it ’s doubtful that can succeed , ” says Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia ’s Center for Politics .
“ It is hard to remove a party chairman in mid-term . ”
Removing Mr. Steele would require the 168 members of the RNC to hold a special meeting , vote by a two - thirds majority to remove him , and then agree on a replacement .
The process would be especially awkward because Steele is black and his party has a predominately white face in Congress .
Still , it has been an exceptionally painful couple of days for the RNC .
Due to what RNC spokesman Doug Heye said was a typographical error , the organization sent out a fundraising mail piece earlier in March with a phone number that led to a phone sex line offering a $ 2.99 - a - minute conversation with “ a nasty girl who will do anything you want . ”
The story was first reported by Politico .
The RNC said it will not use the vendor who made the mistake “ for the foreseeable future . ”
Competing for GOP donor funds
Meanwhile , The Wall Street Journal reported that a number of former high - ranking party officials said they would launch a new political group , called American Crossroads , to help raise $ 52 million for Republican candidates .
The organization would thus compete with the RNC for donor funds .
It will be run by former RNC chairman Mike Duncan and former party co-chair Joanne Davidson .
Advisers include former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie .
Not only are competing organizations springing up , but donors are being urged not to give to the RNC .
Tony Perkins , president of the conservative Family Research Council , is urging supporters in his e-mail newsletter not to give to the RNC .
Mr. Perkins charged that the RNC is “ tone - deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people from whom they seek financial support . ”
“ I 've hinted at this before , but now I am saying it – do n't give money to the RNC , ” he wrote .
“ If you want to put money into the political process , and I encourage you to do so , give directly to candidates who you know reflect your values . ”
An RNC spokesman did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Perkins ’ statements in time for publication .

Regulators are starting to pay attention to the widespread practice of using unpaid interns as free labor .
It 's about time .
In addition to being illegal , the practice also means that poorer students are shut out of career - track opportunities , leading to a concentration of the privileged and well - off in influential occupations like the media and public policy :
Convinced that many unpaid internships violate minimum wage laws , officials in Oregon , California and other states have begun investigations and fined employers .
Last year , M. Patricia Smith , then New York ’s labor commissioner , ordered investigations into several firms ’ internships .
Now , as the federal Labor Department ’s top law enforcement official , she and the wage and hour division are stepping up enforcement nationwide .
Many regulators say that violations are widespread , but that it is unusually hard to mount a major enforcement effort because interns are often afraid to file complaints .
Many fear they will become known as troublemakers in their chosen field , endangering their chances with a potential future employer .
The Labor Department says it is cracking down on firms that fail to pay interns properly and expanding efforts to educate companies , colleges and students on the law regarding internships .
“ If you ’re a for - profit employer or you want to pursue an internship with a for - profit employer , there are n’t going to be many circumstances where you can have an internship and not be paid and still be in compliance with the law , ” said Nancy J. Leppink , the acting director of the department ’s wage and hour division .
Ms. Leppink said many employers failed to pay even though their internships did not comply with the six federal legal criteria that must be satisfied for internships to be unpaid .
Among those criteria are that the internship should be similar to the training given in a vocational school or academic institution , that the intern does not displace regular paid workers and that the employer “ derives no immediate advantage ” from the intern ’s activities — in other words , it ’s largely a benevolent contribution to the intern .
Alpharetta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A disease that Mackenzie Bearup compares to a bomb going off in her knee prompted the 16 - year - old to seek escape in the comfort of reading .
Now she 's helping thousands of troubled children soothe their own pain -- within the pages of donated books .
" When I read , it 's a real escape , " Bearup says .
" I try to take myself into the book instead of in the real world where I 'm in so much pain . "
Her personal discovery that books could be used to ease discomfort was an idea that Bearup ultimately chose to share with homeless and abused children throughout the country .
Bearup 's journey began six years ago when she was jumping on a bed and dancing to TV's " American Idol . "
Suddenly her knee started " hurting unexplainably , extremely bad , " she recalls .
The next day , the fifth grader 's knee swelled to the size of a grapefruit .
After a week on crutches , it was even worse .
Her knee collapsed when she tried to walk .
After a series of misdiagnoses , doctors later diagnosed Bearup with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy , also called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome .
The disease causes the nerves and blood vessels in the affected area to tell the brain " that the injury is still there , " says Dr. James Yost , Bearup 's pain - management physician .
There is no cure , Yost said .
From 200,000 to 1.2 million people have RSD , ranging from mild to severe , according to the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association Web site .
" The kind of pain I feel is very hard to describe , " Bearup says .
" It will explode at random times [ and ] when something touches it , it 's like I 'm getting stabbed multiple times . "
Medications and treatments failed to alleviate the constant pain in Bearup 's knee .
At some points , the extreme discomfort forced her to remain in bed for months , unable to walk .
The only thing that took her mind off the pain , she says , was reading .
So when her pediatrician told her about kids living in nearby Murphy - Harpst Children 's Center in Cedartown -- a residential treatment center for Georgia 's most severely abused children -- Bearup had an idea .
" I think any child being in horrible , intense pain like this , they need something .
And something that I knew that helped me was books . "
She learned that the center had just built a library , but had no books to fill it with .
" I asked everyone I knew to donate books , and then I asked them to tell their friends , " said Bearup , who spread the word further by stuffing flyers inside mailboxes , placing ads in newspapers , and launching a Web site .
Bearup 's goal was to donate 300 books , but she soon had 3,000 .
Once the library at Murphy - Harpst reached capacity , Bearup turned her attention to other places -- providing reading material to youngsters in homeless and domestic violence shelters , children 's homes and treatment centers .
How to nominate a CNN Hero
" Reading is n't just an escape , you can learn a lot , too , and that 's very important for homeless and abused children , " said Bearup .
" Staying in high school is one of the things that will help you most in life , to be able to get a job and be able to support yourself . "
Since 2007 , Bearup has collected and donated more than 38,000 books for homeless and abused children in six states .
With her mother 's help , the teenager launched her official nonprofit -- Sheltering Books -- in 2009 .
Although donations are readily accepted , Bearup and her mom scour garage sales in the suburban Atlanta area to collect books .
With the help of her brothers -- Alex , 14 , and Benjamin , 11 -- Bearup sorts the books into categories , such as age , gender and interest , and delivers them to shelters .
She 's so far donated books for libraries and reading rooms in 27 different shelters .
" Sometimes a child will tell me how much they liked a book from a library I 've helped to create and it really makes me happy , " says Bearup .
" I try to suggest books that kids will like .
And sometimes , when I meet a 10 - year - old girl , I 'll suggest she check out the books I liked when I was her age . "
To help further encourage reading , Bearup developed a pamphlet that suggests reading programs for groups , such as crafts based on books and family bonding through reading .
While Bearup still lives with constant pain , she says she feels better helping others .
" If one homeless or abused child finds a love of reading through books that I 've given them , then that will help them in school and just turn their life around entirely , " she said .
" I really think that reading can do that for someone . "

A study reported in Science this week attempts to pinpoint the cause of mirror movements , a condition that causes people to involuntarily move both sides of the body when they intended to move only one .
Mirror movements are common in babies but rare in adults , and scientists have found that a particular gene mutation is at the root of mirror movements ' tendency to persist into adulthood .
Mirror movements are not unusual for infants or small children — kicking one leg voluntarily while the other involuntarily does the same , or making a grasping motion at something with one hand as the other follows suit , reaching for nothing .
For the problem to continue into adulthood , though , is very unusual , and scientists have been uncertain about what causes it .
To sort out the adult mirror movement cause , a group of researchers sequenced the DNA of two families , one French Canadian and one Iranian , who seemed to have congenital mirror movement issues .
They looked for genetic similarities between family members with mirror movements , and compared their DNA to other controls of the same ethnicity .
Researchers noticed that the family members who had mirror movements shared a common haplotype on one region of chromosome 18 , 18q21.2 .
The affected area spanned 2.5 million base pairs and contains three genes , one of which controls for the presence of colorectal cancer , called the DCC gene .
When they sequenced this particular gene , they found there was an unusual nucleotide substitution that they did not find in control subjects .
Although it was first associated with colon cancer , the protein encoded by DCC can act as a receptor for a nerve cell guidance signal .
One of its roles seems to be to help nerve cells on one side of the spinal cord stay on that side as they extend processes up and down the developing spine .
The paper 's authors speculate that the mirror movements are the result of a development problem caused by changes in the protein the DCC gene encodes .
Because the protein is malformed , the body develops neural connections that route one - sided connections to both sides , producing the mirrored activity .

7 Types of Car Insurance : Which Ones Do You Really Need ?
The cost of even a small repair makes car insurance nice to have .
When we start adding in the medical expenses that can go with a car accident , insurance becomes downright necessary .
In many states , insurance is even a legal requirement before you can drive your car out on the road .
But a wide variety of options are available when it comes to insurance — there are actually seven different types of car insurance you can choose from — and it can be difficult to decide just what type of auto insurance is the best choice for you , your vehicle and your budget .
Here is a list of the seven types and what you need to know about each one .
1. Liability Insurance
When your state requires that you carry some sort of insurance for your car , they ’re usually looking for liability insurance .
In the event that you are in a car accident and the police decide it is your fault , liability insurance covers the cost of repairing any property damaged in the crash ( such as cars or buildings ) , as well as the medical bills from resulting injuries .
Most states have a minimum requirement for liability insurance coverage that you absolutely must have .
However , it usually makes sense to go beyond that minimum requirement if you can afford the payment .
That ’s because you are personally responsible for any claims that exceed your coverage ’s upper limit .
In the event that you are in an accident , you do n’t want to run the risk of having to pay a significant amount of money out of your own pocket .
How much liability insurance you need depends on whether you have a lot of assets to protect , as it is more important to have higher levels of coverage just in case of a catastrophe .
2. Collision Insurance
The biggest problem with carrying only liability insurance is that if there is an accident , you may wind up without the money to repair your own vehicle .
A collision insurance policy makes it so that someone else — your insurer — will pay for the repairs to your car .
If your car is totaled in an accident , a collision insurance policy will pay out the value of your car .
While the payout wo n’t cover for a brand new vehicle , the sum will equal approximately what the car was worth before the accident .
Collision insurance is n’t a must - have , as far as insurance goes .
If your car is older , it may not be worth paying for insurance , especially if you can work on saving up enough to replace the car if necessary .
If you have a good - sized emergency fund , you may be safe without collision insurance .
If you ’ve chosen a more expensive car or your car is relatively new , however , collision insurance can help you sleep much better at night .
3. Comprehensive Insurance
Liability and collision insurance policies exclusively cover car accidents .
If something else happens to your car — weather damage , theft , an animal collision — you wo n’t be able to get your insurance company to address the problem .
With a comprehensive insurance policy , however , your insurer will handle just about any situation that comes up .
A comprehensive insurance policy is one of those things that are nice to have .
However , coverage can be pricey and may not be worthwhile if your car would be relatively easy for you to replace , if you had to .
Note though that you can bring down the price of this policy if your vehicle has an anti-theft and tracking devices installed .
4. Uninsured Motorist Protection
Just because the law requires everyone to have insurance does n’t actually mean that ’s the way things work out .
Even if a driver has a liability insurance policy , most states have relatively low minimums that may not cover all of the expenses that can go along with an accident .
One of the worst things that can happen is that you get stuck with the bills in an accident that was n’t even your fault .
The decision to get a policy that covers damage by an uninsured motorist is n’t as clear cut as other policies .
In theory , even if a driver does n’t have enough insurance to cover damages during an accident , he will still have an obligation to cover the costs out of pocket .
It ’s only when the person at fault does n’t have any money that there can be problems .
5. Medical / Personal - Injury Protection
The costs associated with treating injuries after a car accident can be astronomical .
In order to cover those costs , medical and personal - injury protection is available .
No matter who is at fault , such protection will cover your medical bills along with those of your passengers .
If you have a good health insurance plan , however , it ’s far less likely that medical and personal - injury protection will be useful to you .
And considering how much more a general health insurance policy covers , it should be your first choice .
6. No -Fault Insurance
So far , no - fault insurance is available in twelve states .
This option covers injuries and property damage , no matter who is ultimately responsible for a given accident .
The decision to choose no - fault insurance really depends on what other insurance options are available to you and at what price .
Some no - fault policies can be expensive , making it more cost - effective to choose other options , especially if your car is inexpensive to replace .
7. Gap Insurance
If you are still making car payments , gap insurance may be a good choice .
It ’s meant for drivers who still owe money on their cars and need to pay off the vehicle if it is totaled in an accident .
It ’s generally a good choice if you owe more on your car than you could easily pay off on short notice .
Gap insurance is especially worthwhile if you owe more on the car than you could get for it if you sold it today , since many insurance policies will only cover the value of the car , rather than the cost to replace it .
Some lenders may require you to have gap insurance or something similar until you pay off the vehicle , so you may already have it whether you know it or not .

A confidential U.S. government document obtained by the London Guardian highlights the ongoing agenda to create a structure of global governance in the name of combating climate change .
“ Titled Strategic communications objectives and dated 11 March 2010 , it outlines the key messages that the Obama administration wants to convey to its critics and to the world media in the run-up to the vital UN climate talks in Cancun , Mexico in November . ”
The Guardian reports .
The newspaper says that the document ( full text below ) was “ accidentally left on a European hotel computer ” before it was passed to their editors .
The number one item on the itinerary is to “ Reinforce the perception that the US is constructively engaged in UN negotiations in an effort to produce a global regime to combat climate change . ” ( my emphasis )
The news comes on the back of revelations that rich countries have threatened to cut vital aid to developing nations if they do not back the deal agreed at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen last year .
Elsewhere , the leaked document pinpoints the need to continue “ driving the climate change story ” in the mainstream media , but also identifies the need to “ disarm ” critics and to bypass traditional media outlets to do so , focusing more on “ new media ” .
The document also highlights a need to “ Create a clear understanding of the CA ’s [ Copenhagen accord ’s ] standing and the importance of operationalising ALL elements . ”
Although the final Copenhagen agreement was largely dismissed as a failure by both the mainstream media and climate skeptics , it established the framework for a global government which will control climate finances via taxes on CO2 emissions .
The latest leaked U.S. document calls for operationalising the elements of that framework .
The final text of the accord ( PDF ) states that funds obtained from climate financing will be controlled by a “ governance structure , ” and that a “ High Level Panel ” will be appointed to decide where the money will come from .
In effect , this means that a UN - controlled structure of global governance will override the sovereignty of nation states in collecting and doling out funds obtained under the justification of climate change .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The agreement also gives the green light for carbon trading markets , which as we have documented are all owned by climate kingpins like Maurice Strong and Al Gore , to be more heavily financed and expanded .
Leaked UN documents uncovered in February also highlighted the need to establish a global governance structure in the name of combating climate change by 2012 .
“ Moving towards a green economy would also provide an opportunity to re-examine national and global governance structures and consider whether such structures allow the international community to respond to current and future environmental and development challenges and to capitalize on emerging opportunities , ” the leaked white paper stated .
The paper outlined that the imposition of such “ global governance structures ” will be achieved with the help of “ vast wealth transfers ” from richer countries ( in the form of carbon taxes levied on citizens ) to poorer nations , amounting to no less than $ 45 trillion dollars .
The UN Secretary General , Ban Ki-moon , has not been shy in proclaiming the unfolding agenda for a global governance structure to override national parliaments on the issue of climate change .
In an October New York Times editorial entitled “ We Can Do It , ” Ki-moon wrote that efforts to impose restrictions on CO2 emissions “ Must include an equitable global governance structure . ”
He re-iterated those sentiments in December following the Copenhagen summit , telling the LA Times “ We will establish a global governance structure to monitor and manage the implementation of this . ”
Last year at a forum in Oxford , England , Al Gore also called for global governance in order to implement global agreements on climate change .
Globalists are persistent and they will continue hammering away until they get what they want , not because the environment is on the verge of collapse , but because their agenda for world government is stalling as more people find out the true agenda behind the global warming scam .
Meanwhile , anyone who suggests global governance is on the agenda is derided as a conspiracy theorist , despite such open announcements of this very intention .
*******************
Text of the leaked document :
Strategic communications objectives
1 ) Reinforce the perception that the US is constructively engaged in UN negotiations in an effort to produce a global regime to combat climate change .
This includes support for a symmetrical and legally binding treaty .
2 ) Manage expectations for Cancun – Without owning the message , advance the narrative that while a symmetrical legally binding treaty in Mexico is unlikely , solid progress can be made on the six or so main elements .
3 ) Create a clear understanding of the CA ’s standing and the importance of operationalising ALL elements .
4 ) Build and maintain outside support for the administration ’s commitment to meeting the climate and clean energy challenge despite an increasingly difficult political environment to pass legislation .
5 ) Deepen support and understanding from the developing world that advanced developing countries must be part of any meaningful solution to climate change including taking responsibilities under a legally binding treaty .
Media outreach • Continue to conduct interviews with print , TV and radio outlets driving the climate change story .
•
Increase use of off - the - record conversations .
• Strengthen presence in international media markets during trips abroad .
Focus efforts on radio and television markets .
•
Take greater advantage of new media opportunities such as podcasts to advance US position in the field bypassing traditional media outlets .
•
Consider a series of policy speeches / public forums during trips abroad to make our case directly to the developing world .
Key outreach efforts • Comprehensive and early outreach to policy makers , key stakeholders and validators is critical to broadening support for our positions in the coming year .
• Prior to the 9 - 11 April meeting in Bonn it would be good for Todd to meet with leading NGOs .
This should come in the form of 1:1s and small group sessions .
• Larger group sessions , similar to the one held at CAP prior to Copenhagen , will be useful down the line , but more intimate meetings in the spring are essential to building the foundation of support .
Or at the very least , disarming some of the harsher critics .

The Diva Cup .
I ’m going there people .
I ’m going where the ocean ebbs and the moon wanes .
I ’m going where the crimson wave has little to do with surfing and where the cotton pony has nothing to do with ranch life .
Yes people , I ’m going there .
I ’ve decided to rag on so called “ feminine hygiene ” products .
I ’ve never been comfortable with the cost or environmental waste associated with tampons , pads , and other menstrual gear listed under the banner of “ feminine hygiene ” .
I ’ve always felt cramped when dishing out big bucks for a wad of cotton on a string and I ’m grumpy with the garbage created .
To me , it ’s just bad financial cents to bleed my bank account and rot the earth when there ’s a much better way .
The Diva Cup
Last month I finally listened to a good friend of mine and tried something called the Diva Cup .
The Diva Cup is a brand name for a menstrual cup , which is a reusable bell - shaped plastic device developed to collect and contain menstrual flow inside the body .
I was honestly skeptical at first .
The initial idea of putting some plastic bell thing “ up there ” was a little off putting .
But I ’m sooo over it .
The Diva Cup is the most amazing , useful , wonderful girly product ever .
Since I want you to “ have a happy period , ” I ’ll get over all silly shyness and share my thoughts with you .
1. Cost : Diva Cup vs tampons or pads .
A menstrual cup like the Diva Cup costs about $ 25 and can be used for a year .
The company behind the Diva Cup , Diva International , suggests cups should be replaced annually , but I ’ve used mine longer — just be sure to keep it clean .
But seriously , $ 25 bucks for a reusable device is not a heck of a lot when you consider the cost of disposables over the year .
Before buying a menstrual cup , be sure to check if the brand carries different models sized by age or based on childbearing .
For example , the Diva Cup Model 1 is for gals under the age of 30 who have not had children and the Diva Cup Model 2 for gals age 30 and over and / or for women who have delivered vaginally or by caesarean section .
Now I ’ve done the math ladies .
The amount of money we spend over our lives on disposable pads and tampons is mind boggling .
If I roughly guesstimate a woman ’s fertile life ranges from age 13 - 48 ( seems like a good average to me ) , that ’s 35 years !
Tampon Pack : $ 5
Pad Pack : $ 5
Monthly Cost : $ 10
Yearly Cost : $ 120
Bottom Line : Lifetime 35 - year cost : $ 4200
This number does not account for inflation or taxes either !
Basically , we ’re making the companies behind Always and Tampax rich .
Especially when you consider about 50 percent of the population needs this stuff .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’d rather save thousands of bucks by buying a couple of Diva Cups or menstrual cups over my lifetime .
That ’s just good financial sense .
Period .
2. Environment .
I cringe to think how many pads are put into landfills each day .
It ’s sad actually .
Most women use about 18 pads and / or tampons per cycle .
By using menstrual cup products like the Diva Cup though , all this landfill waste can easily be avoided .
3. Health .
I ’ve discovered a few health benefits since using the Diva Cup .
Seriously .
No harmful substances .
Pads and tampons can contain bleaches , absorbing chemicals , perfumes , and other irritants or allergens .
The Diva Cup is made of medical grade silicone which cannot be broken down or absorbed into the body .

No Toxic Shock Syndrome ( TSS ) .
Tampons have been shown to have a connection to TSS , a rare but sometimes fatal disease caused by bacterial infection .
No such connection exists with the Diva Cup since cups do not function though absorbency .

“ Down There ” Health .
Upon removal , tampons can scratch and leave tiny thread fragments .
Pads can cause rashes .
The natural balance “ down there ” is not compromised through the Diva Cup .
4. Guys , no more drug store trips !
I have n’t forgotten about the fellows .
I know many of you have made a fateful trip to the drug store looking for the “ exact ” brand and product your female friend needs .
I ’ve seen you in “ that ” aisle carrying an empty package of the stuff your gal has unfortunately run out of .
Matching up and finding the right stuff is daunting , and nearly impossible considering how often pad and tampon companies change their packaging .
But you fellows brave the checkout and bashfully buy the brands .
Fellows , these blushful trips can end .
The day your gal gets a Diva Cup is the day those drug store trips are finished .
Kudos .
5. Diva Cup and Sports .
Participating in sports can be a drag when it ’s that time .
Being in the middle of a game when you need to pull the goalie is not an ideal match .
Skip searching your duffel for a relief player with the Diva Cup since cups can be kept in play for 8 - 12 hours .
When a cup is placed correctly , it does not leak and can not be detected .
Feel free to swim lots of laps , ride a bike , or run a marathon .
It wo n’t win any races for you , but you ’ll make it to the finish line without fail .
6. Sleep .
No more midnight bathroom trips .
No more sleeping on towels .
No more doubling - up .
The Diva Cup can be worn all night long , unlike a tampon .
Sleep soundly for 8 - 12 hours .
I dare you .
7. Freedom .
Stop stuffing your purse full of tampons and pads .
Carrying stashes of girlie stuff is a thing of the past .
With the Diva Cup , your period worries are no longer woes .
Go to school or work and forget about it .
No more bathroom trips till you get home hours later .
You are free .
8. Less cramps ?
I have no scientific proof .
But I seriously think the Diva Cup lessens cramps and quells pain .
Since I have a history of fainting from crippling painful cramps , I am the first to wonder how a cup can contain this condition .
But I think it does .
Again , I have no scientific proof .
9. Comfort .
There ’s a bit of a learning curve getting used to folding and inserting a Diva Cup .
When placed correctly , you do n’t feel a thing .
No mess , no fuss , no problem .
It does n’t matter how heavy or light your flow , one cup covers all stages in a cycle .
Yay .
10 . International .
I ’ve mostly mentioned the Diva Cup brand since it ’s available in North America , and that ’s where I live .
Other menstrual cup brands are available around the world , so I ’ve summarized them below :
DivaCup ( Canada , USA )
Mooncup ( United Kingdom )
Keeper ( USA )
Moon Cup ( USA )
LadyCup ( Czech Republic )
Lunette ( Finland )
Miacup ( South Africa )
Femmecup ( Far East )
I went there people .
I went where cutesy advertising campaigns tell me to “ Have a Happy Period , ” and annoy me .
I went there and provided a real solution to environmental concerns and cost considerations .
I went there .
I went there ’ cause I want you to go there too .
Would you consider it ?
Love ,
Kerry
The writing is on the wall .
While Mozilla and its Firefox browser appear to be a very solid institution in the browser market , it is the weakest link with an extremely attractive portion of the browser user base as well .
Google is getting more serious about the browser market and Microsoft is apparently getting back into the game as well .
Could Mozilla be squeezed out of the market ?
Today , there is very little that could lead you to believe that Mozilla and its Firefox browser area are under competitive pressure .
In the end , is n’t it Firefox that continues to challenge Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer ( IE ) and is responsible that IE dropped from more than 90 % market share closer to about 60 % today , according to Net Applications ?
Mozilla itself recently noted in its Metrics report that its market share hovers “ near 30 % ” .
If we believe this global number , then North America ’s has the lowest share of about 26 % and Europe the highest with about 39 % .
The Numbers
Mozilla calculated the numbers by averaging different estimates from Net Applications , Quantcast , NetApplications and Gemius .
There is only public access to detailed browser usage data at NetApplications , which can provide some insight in browser usage trends , while the actual market share estimate varies enough to make you question the accuracy of any of these reports .
NetApplications for example , believes that the market share of Firefox is in the neighborhood of 24 % , while Gemius puts it closer to 46 % , StatCounter at 32 % , and Quantcast at 36 % .
Interestingly , Mozilla itself says that NetApplications claims a 35 % market share for Firefox , which this is not what NetApplications publicly states ( about 24 % ) .
Obviously , the actual market share is almost impossible to pin down as you can spin the number in any direction you want by using the statistics that suit your purpose best .
What is much more interesting are browser usage trends .
So let ’s look at what has happening with Firefox .
StatCounter indicates that Firefox ’ share climbed from 29.4 % in March 2009 to 31.93 % in April 2010 , a gain of roughly 1.8 points or 6 % .
There is a relatively consistent slight upward trend that seems to be turning into a very stable market share of just above 30 % .
Microsoft ’s IE is losing dramatically , from 62.52 % to 53.12 % over the past 12 months , while Apple ’s Safari is showing slight gains and a market share of about 4 % , Opera being stable and Chrome revealing the strongest gains , from 1.73 % in March 2009 to 8.03 % in April 2010 .
According to StatCounter , Chrome is showing the strongest gains in percentages ( 564 % ) and absolute numbers ( 6.3 points ) .
NetApplications data shows a similar shows trend : IE down , Firefox stable to up , Opera stable , Safari stable to up , Chrome up .
The company estimates IE ’s share at 60.64 % ( down from 68.84 % in March 2009 ) , Firefox at 24.52 % ( up from 23.30 % ) , Chrome at 6.13 % ( up from 1.62 % ) , Safari at 4.66 % ( up from 3.62 % ) and Opera stable at 2.37 % ( 2.12 % ) .
Conceivably , the only dynamic parts in the current market are Internet Explorer and Chrome .
IE lost 8.2 points of market share or 11.9 % in twelve months , while Chrome gained 4.51 points or 478 % .
As far as NetApplications ’ data reveal , Mozilla saw Firefox market share decline in five of the past 12 months , with drops as sharp as 0.32 points in June 2009 .
Chrome , on the other side , had only positive growth with gains of as much as 0.59 points in January 2010 .
In fact , the absolute gains seem to be accelerating lately and Google was able to maintain a percentage growth in the high single digits or even double digits ( in seven of the past 12 months ) .
Even if Chrome ’s market share is growing and common sense suggests that the percentage growth should be slowing , Chrome is getting stronger every month , if we believe NetApplications ’ data set .
It already chewed up Apple ’s Safari , which it surpassed in market share in December 2009 and now has a lead of already 1.47 points .
Upgrades
Clearly , Google got something right and its strategy is working .
One part of the strategy certainly is the availability of plug-ins , but it is more and more apparent that Google ’s consistent performance improvements ( Google 5 Beta is the fastest browser you can get at this time ) and aggressive upgrade cycle attract much more usage share .
Google 5 beta currently has a market share of 0.66 % and is Chrome ’s fifth browser version in the market over the past 12 months .
Since March 2009 , Google has successfully phased out Chrome 1 , 2 and 3 and transitioned to 2 , 3 and 4 .
The forced upgrade in Chrome ensures the most complete version transition we see in the browser market today : Chrome 4 has a market share of 5.26 % , compared to Google ’s entire 6.13 % - and remember , the transition to version 5 has already begun .
Version 3 has only 0.13 % and 2 only 0.05 % .
IE , in comparison , shows a different picture that is causing lots of headaches for Microsoft : IE6 is stuck in corporate standards and still has 19.71 % market share , IE7 has 13.78 % and IE8 27.13 % .
IE8 , as a reminder , was fully launched into the market in March 2009 – which was the first month of significant market share gains for the browser .
The differences to Google ’s approach ca n’t be any more different .
Mozilla is somewhere between Microsoft and Google .
Version 3.6 has become the dominant Firefox version with a share of 11.63 % , followed by 3.5 with 9.39 % , 3.0 with 3.21 % and 2 with 0.64 % .
Both IE and Firefox are much more fragmented than Chrome .
Chrome ’s forced upgrade ensures you always have the latest version on your PC and , whether you like it or not , the strategy seems to be resonating with users .
What about Performance ?
IE ’s downside has been a lack of performance .
IE9 , however , which is currently only available as a rough Platform Preview , shows dramatic speed improvements that are currently just above the Javascript performance of Firefox 3.6 and Microsoft claims that it has n’t even tuned the IE9 engine yet .
Firefox 3.7 shows performance improvements as well , but it is too early to say who will keep the lead – especially since IE9 is at least 6 to 9 months away from a public release .
Chrome 5 , however , crushes any other browser in any popular benchmark available on the web .
On my quad - core test system , In Google V8 , Chrome 5.0.342.8 scored 4456 points , which compares to 3804 of Chrome 4 and 654 of IE9 PP .
In SunSpider , Chrome 5 is the first browser to break the 400ms barrier with 387.8 ms , compared to 783.6 ms of IE9 PP .
In Celtic Kane , Chrome 5 came in at 503 points vs. 263 of IE9 PP .
Firefox 3.6 currently scores 460 in Google V8 , 890ms in SunSpider , and 160 in Celtic Kane .
Conclusion
Individual statistics may be skewed , but the overall trend seems to be obvious .
Firefox just is n’t growing as much anymore as it has in 2007 or 2008 .
It would be foolish to ignore that Microsoft is making IE9 dramatically better ( and it seems Microsoft is dropping proprietary web technologies as well ) and that Google has a serious interest in the browser market .
The investments Google is allocating to Chrome are apparent .
Google ’s do not evil mantra seems out of place here .
Chrome is part of the corporate strategy and if Mozilla is standing in the way , despite an ongoing friendly agreement that Google is funding Mozilla through royalties , then it will be sacrificed .
It is believed that Google ’s royalties account for about 80 - 90 % of Mozilla ’s entire revenues .
The royalty contract will end in 2011 .
At the very best , Mozilla has an ongoing financing problem by being too dependent on Google , which has now an interest in the very market that is Mozilla ’s beating heart .
I ’ll leave it up to you to predict what will happen in this space , but it is clear that Chrome is gaining market share at a fast pace and Microsoft will do everything it can to stop the bleeding as it needs IE9 as a central part for its cloud computing strategy .
At the current pace , Google may catch up with Firefox ’ market share within two to three years – and that is if Microsoft simply stands still .
Add Microsoft to the equation and it becomes clear that you end up with a battle of the giants that leaves Mozilla in the middle of the battlefield , with a share of the market both Google and Microsoft want .
Mozilla needs to draw from the best it has to be able to survive this battle .
And if it can , we should see amazing innovation in the browser field over the next five years .

Maroaune Chamakh turned down Spurs and Liverpool to sign for Arsenal
By Sportsmail Reporter
Maroaune Chamakh has revealed he snubbed Liverpool and Tottenham to join Arsenal on a free transfer .
Arsene Wenger has vowed to strengthen his squad this summer with the Bordeaux hitman expected to be his first acquisition .
Arsenal target :
The Gunners are expected to unveil Chamakh at the end of the season
And speaking to French newspaper L'Equipe , Chamakh , 26 , said : ' There were approaches from Liverpool , Tottenham and offers of madness from Russia which were much greater than those from England .
But , I was focused on playing in the Premier League .
' I have always loved Arsenal 's football .
I know I will have to adapt , but I have experience of playing the short passing game from working with Yoann Gourcuff .
' I count the days , 11 short days .
As time passes , it feels weird .
I feel many emotions . '
Wenger was expected to sign Chamakh last summer but opted against the move due to the hefty price Bordeaux demanded for their player , who had just one year to run on his contract .
Bon voyage : Chamakh has scored 15 goals in 44 appearances this season
Chamakh added that it was a risk to stay with the French club , who progressed to the last eight of the Champions League this season , albeit a risk that was justified .
' I took a risk to stay with one year left on my contract , but I never cheated , I gave myself thoroughly .
' ( Bordeaux ) offered a contract extension that was almost impossible to refuse , financially - figures very close to those of Arsenal '
Here is my prediction .
This is all my thoughts going off of the track record of Microsoft .
Microsoft will release the cost of Natal at their E3 press conference , which I believe is sometime before E3 on June 15th .
They will announce a standalone natal camera for around $ 99 , and with that , a throw in game of some sort .
The standalone bundle will be available in September / October time .
As for the bundles , they plan to bundle the Natal tech with an arcade for $ 249 with a 16GB USB stick .
People say it is a good deal , but it will not come with any controllers .
This new bundle may include a new smaller 360 to commemorate the 360's 5th anniversary .
And hell , it may not red ring or E 74 .
Then , they will say they have an ultimate package for the new gaming era .
It will be the smaller , redesigned 360 ( that will actually allow for standard HDD installation ) the same as in the arcade , but it will be some sort of special branding .
It will come with the following :
1x normal AC video cables
1x Xbox 360 wireless controller
1x Microsoft Natal Camera
1x power cable ( no brick anymore )
1x Redesigned system 120 GB HDD
3 months xbox live
headset
built in wireless
slot loading disc drive
no ir reciever
same specs , 2 memory card holders , 4 usb slots ( 2 in back for natal , 2 in front for controller charging )
waaay more efficient cooling with cheaper components that cut cost of system manufacturing by nearly 40 % .
All of this in the bundle will be around $ 299 - $ 329 at the cheapest .
$ 349 the most .
The new elite 360 will cost $ 249 and the arcade standalone will drop to just $ 149 , the cheapest of any console yet .
Nintendo and Sony follow suit and drop the price of the Wii to $ 149 and the PS3 120 GB to $ 249 respectively .
Sounds pretty awesome , amirite ?
feedback , change of details .
CLATTERING keyboards may seem the white noise of the modern age , but they betray more information than unwary typists realise .
Simply by analysing audio recordings of keyboard clatter , computer scientists can now reconstruct an accurate transcript of what was typed — including passwords .
And in contrast to many types of computer espionage , the process is simple , requiring only a cheap microphone and a desktop computer .
Such snooping is possible because each key produces a characteristic click , shaped by its position on the keyboard , the vigour and hand position of the typist , and the type of keyboard used .
But past attempts to decipher keyboard sounds were only modestly successful , requiring a training session in which the computer matched a known transcript to an audio recording of each key being struck .
Thus schooled , the software could still identify only 80 % of the characters in a different transcript of the same typist on the same machine .
Furthermore , each new typist or keyboard required a fresh transcript and training session , limiting the method 's appeal to would - be hackers .
Now , in a blow to acoustic security , Doug Tygar and his colleagues at the University of California , Berkeley , have published details of an approach that reaches 96 % accuracy , even without a labelled training transcript .
The new approach employs methods developed for speech - recognition software to group together all the similar - sounding keystrokes in a recording , generating an alphabet of clicks .
The software tentatively assigns each click a letter based on its frequency , then tests the message created by this assignment using statistical models of the English language .
For example , certain letters or words are more likely to occur together — if an unknown keystroke follows a “ t ” , it is much more likely to be an “ h ” than an “ x ” .
Similarly , the words “ for example ” make likelier bedfellows than “ fur example ” .
In a final refinement , the researchers employed a method many students would do well to deploy on term papers : automated spellchecking .
By repeatedly revising unlikely or incorrect letter assignments , Dr Tygar 's software extracts sense from sonic chaos .
That said , the method does have one limitation : in order to apply the language model , at least five minutes of the recorded typing had to be in standard English ( though in principle any systematic language or alphabet would work ) .
But once those requirements are met , the program can decode anything from epic prose to randomised , ten- character passwords .
This sort of acoustic analysis might sound like the exclusive province of spies and spooks , but according to Dr Tygar , such attacks are not as esoteric as you might expect .
He says it is quite simple to find the instructions needed to build a parabolic or laser microphone on the web .
You could just point one from outside through an office window to make a recording .
And as he points out , would - be eavesdroppers might not even need their own recording equipment , as laptop computers increasingly come equipped with built - in microphones that could be hijacked .
To protect against these sonic incursions , Dr Tygar suggests a simple remedy : turn up the radio .
His computers were less successful at parsing recordings made in noisy rooms .
Ultimately , though , more sophisticated recording arrays could overcome even background noise , rendering any typed text vulnerable .
Dr Tygar therefore recommends that typed passwords be phased out , to be replaced with biometric checks or multiple types of authorisation that combine a password with some form of silent verification ( clicking on a pre-chosen picture in a selection of images , for example ) .
Loose lips may still sink ships , but for the moment it seems that an indiscreet keystroke can do just as much damage .
According to a University of Iowa study , couples involved in " friends with benefits " situations are more likely to contract STDs , as they 're more likely to have multiple partners :
According to Science Daily , the study , which surveyed the habits of 783 heterosexuals , shows that " being involved with a friend increased the likelihood of non-monogamy by 44 percent for women and 25 percent for men , " and , interestingly enough , " respondents who got along with each other 's parents were less likely to have multiple sex partners .

ACLU Lawsuit Prompts Reform To Rectify Unconstitutional Standards
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
ATLANTA – Governor Sonny Purdue signed into law a bill repealing the unconstitutional Kosher Food Labeling
Act and replacing it with a new law mandating that consumers be fully informed about the standards under which any kosher food product is certified as being kosher .
The bill , signed Thursday , was prompted by an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit and was passed by the Georgia legislature last month .
The previous Kosher Food Labeling
Act required that any food sold as kosher in the state meet " Orthodox Hebrew religious rules and requirements , " delegitimizing alternative interpretations of kosher adhered to in other Jewish communities .
The new law no longer institutionalizes an official definition of kosher and instead requires that all food and food establishments represented as being kosher clearly disclose to consumers the practices and standards by which the food was prepared .
" The state should never be in the position of deciding which religious beliefs are ' legitimate ' and which are not , " said Debbie Seagraves , Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia .
" The state legislature did the right thing by making clear that the power to define what is religiously acceptable should never rest with the government .
These are personal religious decisions . "
The ACLU , ACLU of Georgia and cooperating attorneys from King & Spalding filed a lawsuit last year on behalf of Rabbi Shalom Lewis of Congregation Etz Chaim in Cobb County challenging the constitutionality of the Kosher Food Labeling Act .
" The Georgia legislature is to be commended for creating a law that affirms our nation 's bedrock American principle of respecting everyone 's religious beliefs , " said Rabbi Lewis who , as a Conservative Jew , had been unable to lawfully fulfill his rabbinical duties to supervise food establishments because his theological interpretation of the kosher laws differ from that of Orthodox Judaism .
" It has been very gratifying working with the Orthodox community to achieve this result , which provides protection to consumers by enabling them to make informed choices about the food they buy and fosters enhanced respect and mutuality within the community . "
One of the most vital services that Lewis provides to his congregants is serving as their mashgiach , the Hebrew term for a person who supervises any type of food service establishment – including restaurants , grocery stores and caterers – to ensure that food is acceptably kosher .
But because Lewis cannot certify the preparation of food in accordance with Orthodox Hebrew requirements , he has been prohibited by law from serving as the mashgiach of any kosher food operation – a fact that jeopardized his ability to fulfill his calling as a duly ordained rabbi of the Jewish faith and impeded his religious freedom .
If Lewis had violated the state 's previous kosher laws by supervising food establishments using a different interpretation of kosher than the law had required , the laws could have been enforced against him , damaging his reputation and subjecting him and others to criminal charges and fines .
The ACLU 's lawsuit charged that the Kosher Food Labeling
Act violated the religious liberty guarantees of both the U.S. and Georgia Constitutions by endorsing only " Orthodox Hebrew religious rules and requirements " and criminalizing the practices of the many people across the state who , while seeking kosher products , subscribe to interpretations of kosher that differ from those of Orthodox Jews .
" Previous law in Georgia violated the fundamental pillars of religious liberty by endorsing one particular set of beliefs and impeding the free religious exercise of those who believe differently , " said Daniel Mach , Director of the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief .
" The government should never take sides in theological debates . "
The ACLU of Georgia and the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief were joined by the Atlanta law firm King & Spalding LLP as co-counsel for Rabbi Lewis .

April Fool
Happy April Fool ’s Day
Faadosly Polir , is the older brother of Lofa Polir — you may recall she claimed a great result on factoring last year .
She is still working out the details of her result , but she is also , I hear , working on a variety of other problems from complexity theory .
Today I want to talk about a concept Faadosly as has invented : AFR’s .
I will shortly define them , and present a few examples .
I hope you can help him collect some additional ones .
I understanding he is planning a book , and he would like to have as many examples as possible .
AFR
An AFR is an April Fool Result : a proof of a simple mathematical fact using much harder mathematics than needed .
It is using sledge hammer to break a toothpick , or a blowtorch to light a candle .
Here are three examples :
The first is a proof of irrationality due to W. H. Schultz .
Theorem :
If , then is irrational .
Proof : Suppose for some positive integers and .
Raising to the power yields , , and thus
But , this contradicts Fermat ’s Last Theorem , proved by Andrew Wiles .
The second is a proof there are non-planar graphs of arbitrary size .
Theorem :
For each large enough , there is an vertex non-planar graph .
Proof :
Let be a random graph on vertices with edge probability .
The chromatic number is known with high probability to be ,
by a famous theorem of Béla Bollobás .
However , by the Four Color Theorem all planar graphs can be colored in colors .
Since
as , the theorem follows .
The last is a proof there are an infinite number of primes — based on a standard complexity assumption .
Theorem :
There are an infinite number of primes , if integer factorization requires super - polynomial time .
Proof : Suppose all the primes are
for some finite .
Then , consider the following algorithm for finding a factor of a number .
If , the algorithm stops .
For all check if .
If yes , then is prime , the corresponding ; the algorithm stops .
If not , is composite , proceed to the next step .
For all check if divides .
Since is composite , one of ‘s has to divide .
Output that and stop .
Open Problems
The main open problem is to have a fun April Fool ’s day .
If you have any interesting AFR ’s let me know what they are , and I will pass them on to Faadosly .
Law enforcement authorities seeking to detect bioterrorism attacks , doctors diagnosing diseases and regulatory agencies checking product safety may find a new ally in a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) detection technology .
The advance , known as the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array ( LLMDA ) , could enable law enforcement , medical professionals and others to detect within 24 hours any virus or bacteria that has been sequenced and included among the array 's probes .
Developed between October 2007 and February 2008 , the LLMDA detects viruses and bacteria with the use of 388,000 probes that fit in a checkerboard pattern in the middle of a one - inch wide , three - inch long glass slide .
The current operational version of the LLMDA contains probes that can detect more than 2,000 viruses and about 900 bacteria .
" The ability to detect the major bacterial and viral components of any sample can be used in countless different ways , " said Tom Slezak , LLNL 's associate program leader for Informatics .
" This is important because it fills a cost - performance gap that is relevant to many missions : biodefense , public health and product safety . "
In the area of biodefense , current systems are centered upon the detection of smaller prioritized sets of high - risk pathogens , rather than testing for a much broader spectrum of organisms .
advertisement
" The LLMDA allows us to not only identify the biological pathogens on a priority screening list , but also any other already - sequenced bacteria or virus in a sample that you might not have been expecting to find , including possible novel or emerging pathogens , " Slezak said .
Current plans call for the detection array to be evaluated for operational bioforensic use at the Frederick , Md. - based National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
As the cost of the array is reduced , the LLMDA technology could be used to improve public health diagnostics , Slezak said , adding that dozens of bacteria and viruses can be detected in a single test from the entire spectrum of sequenced organisms .
One advantage of the Livermore array is that it provides researchers with the capability of detecting pathogens over the entire range of known viruses and bacteria .
Current multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) techniques can at most offer detection from among 50 organisms in one test .
In April , in a Journal of Virology article , Livermore researchers working with a scientist from the San Francisco - based Blood Systems Research Institute said they used the LLMDA technology to confirm the presence of an apparently benign pig virus in a vaccine .
advertisement
The pig virus , porcine circovirus - 1 ( PCV - 1 ) , was unexpectedly found in GlaxSmithKline 's Rotarix vaccine , which is used to prevent diarrhea in babies .
" One result of this research is that it demonstrates how modern technologies could change and drastically improve product safety , " Slezak said .
While product safety rules require demonstrating that a list of known contaminants is not present , Slezak said the use of modern advances in DNA sequencing and arrays would allow manufacturers to identify the potential presence of contaminating biological material present in quantities large enough to be of potential concern .
" For each bacteria or virus that has been sequenced anywhere in the world , we have several dozen squares on the checkerboard that will identify sequences from that organism , " Slezak explained .
Currently , Slezak 's team is testing a next - generation LLMDA that boasts 2.1 million probes .
This version contains probes representing about 178,000 viral sequences from some 5,700 viruses , and about 785,000 bacterial sequences from thousands of bacteria .
The latest LLMDA version also encompasses fungi and protozoa -- with probes representing about 237,000 fungal sequences from thousands of fungi and about 202,000 protozoa sequences from 75 protozoa .
As a screening tool , Slezak sees the LLMDA as occupying niche roles between PCR machines and sequencing .
The LLMDA process starts with the purification of DNA or RNA from a sample , such as sputum or blood .
The sample is next labeled with a fluorescent dye and hybridized on the microarray at 42 degrees C or about 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit .
In turn , a fluorescent scanner and analysis software are used to detect the probes that have lit up , identifying the presence of viral or bacterial sequences .
The Livermore team plans to update probes on the array with new sequences of bacteria , viruses and other microorganisms from GenBank and other public databases about once per year , in addition to using sequences obtained from collaborators for their probes .
LLNL 's current collaborators include the University of California , San Francisco ; the Blood Systems Research Institute ; the University of Texas Medical Branch ( Galveston ) ; the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of Bilthoven , the Netherlands ; the Statens Serum Institut of Copenhagen , Denmark ; the University of California , Davis ; Imigene ; the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ; and the Marine Mammal Center of Sausalito , Calif .
A computer scientist and the team 's leader , Slezak came up with the idea for the LLMDA in 2003 .
His team includes biologist Crystal Jaing , who leads the microarray lab work and manages the collaborations ; bioinformaticist Shea Gardner , who designed the array ; biostatistician Kevin McLoughlin , who designed the analysis software ; and James B. Thissen , who performs the microarray experiments .
by Richard Wike , Associate Director , Pew Global Attitudes Project
With parliamentary elections approaching , Hungarians are in a funk .
Nearly unanimously , they say the economy is in bad shape , and a stunning 72 % say most Hungarians are actually worse off now economically than they were under communism .
But Hungary ’s malaise is not all about economics — most are frustrated with politics too .
Overwhelmingly , Hungarians are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working and discontent with political elites , with about three - in - four saying political corruption is a major problem .
A fall 2009 survey by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project highlights the degree to which , even in a region where disillusionment is common , Hungarians stand out .
All of this bodes well for the electoral prospects of Fidesz , the right - of - center opposition party , which is expected to soundly defeat the incumbent social democrats in the upcoming elections .
1
However , these findings do not mean Hungarians are rejecting democratic values .
In fact , as the survey illustrates , they are more likely than other former Eastern bloc publics to say it is very important to live in a country with democratic rights and institutions .
But few believe Hungary currently has these democratic freedoms .
Widespread Economic Discontent
Prior to the revolutions of 1989 , Hungary was an economic pioneer among Eastern bloc countries , practicing “ goulash communism , ” which mixed aspects of the free market with a planned economy .
As a result , Hungarians enjoyed somewhat better living standards than their Iron Curtain neighbors .
Two decades later , however , Hungarians give their economy dismal ratings , and they are generally less enthusiastic about the free market than others in the region .
The global economic crisis had a powerful effect across much of Central and Eastern Europe , and it hit especially hard in Hungary , which was forced to seek a financial bailout from the IMF , World Bank and European Union .
The fall 2009 survey revealed the extent of Hungarian economic gloom : 94 % described the country ’s economy as bad , nosing out Lithuania ( 93 % ) and Ukraine ( 91 % ) for the most negative assessment among the countries included in the poll .
When asked to evaluate their nation ’s switch to capitalism , Hungarians are divided — 46 % said they approve of the move from a state - controlled economy to a market economy , while 42 % disapproved .
In 1991 , when the Times Mirror Center ( the forerunner of the Pew Research Center ) asked this same question , 80 % had approved of the change .
In another sign that support for the free market is relatively weak in Hungary , only 31 % in the 2009 poll agreed with the statement “ Most people are better off in a free market economy , even though some people are rich and some are poor , ” a lower percentage than in any other former Eastern bloc country surveyed .
Remarkably , 72 % said most people in Hungary are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism , while only 8 % said most people are better off and 16 % said things are about the same .
Again , Hungary stands apart from the other post - communist societies surveyed — in no other country did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era .
As in much of the region , many Hungarians had hoped that accession to the European Union would result in major economic benefits and improved living standards .
However , most have been disappointed .
Roughly seven - in - ten ( 71 % ) say their country ’s economy has been weakened by the economic integration of Europe .
Bulgaria ( 63 % ) is the only other post - communist EU member in which a majority held this view .
Disillusionment With Politics Too
But Hungarians are not only disappointed with the economic transition their country has experienced — they are also disappointed with the transition to democratic politics .
The 1991 Times Mirror poll found that 74 % of Hungarians approved of the change from a one - party system to a multiparty system ; by 2009 a slim 56 % - majority expressed this view .
In the 2009 poll , more than three - in - four ( 77 % ) said they were dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in Hungary , the highest percentage on the survey .
In the other former Eastern bloc nations , there were notable generation gaps on this question , with people under age 40 — essentially , the “ post - communist ” generation — more likely to be satisfied than older respondents .
Not so , however , in Hungary , where old and young alike tended to give the current state of democracy a grim assessment .
As in much of Central and Eastern Europe , Hungarians are clearly disenchanted with political elites .
Nearly nine - in - ten ( 89 % ) said politicians have benefited a great deal or a fair amount from the changes since 1989 , but only 17 % believed ordinary people have benefited .
And concerns about corruption are common — 76 % said corrupt political leaders are a very big problem in Hungary .
However , when reviewing these gloomy findings about the state of democracy in Hungary , it is worth remembering that they do not mean Hungarians are abandoning democratic values .
To the contrary , Hungarians continue to want democratic rights and institutions — in fact , they place a higher premium on these things than their post - communist neighbors .
When asked to rate the importance of six key features of democracy , Hungarians stand out for their strong embrace of democratic values .
Among the eight Central and Eastern European publics surveyed , Hungarians are the most likely to say it is very important to live in a country with honest multiparty elections , freedom of religion , free speech , and civilian control of the military ( tied with Czech Republic ) .
Meanwhile , only Bulgarians are more likely to say it is very important to live in a country with a fair judiciary ; and the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are the only countries more likely to rate a free media as very important .
Overall , across the six values tested , a median of 66 % in Hungary rated these features of democracy as very important .
By this measure , Bulgaria is next , with a median of 60 % , followed by the Czech Republic ( 52 % ) , Poland ( 52 % ) and Ukraine ( 50 % ) .
Lithuania ( 43 % ) and Slovakia ( 43 % ) rate somewhat lower , while Russians ( 39 % ) are less likely than others to consider these elements of democracy very important .
The challenge for Hungary is that , while most Hungarians want democratic values and institutions , few think they have them .
For instance , 70 % think it is very important to live in a country with honest multiparty elections , but only 17 % believe this describes Hungary very well .
Taking the median percentage saying these values are very important in each country and comparing it with the median percentage saying these values describe their country very well gives us an overall “ democracy gap ” for each country .
The gap is large throughout Eastern Europe , but is widest in Hungary — evidence that Hungarians , who once pioneered the transition away from communism , are not turning their backs on democracy .
Instead , they are frustrated by the fact that democracy has yet to fully flourish in their country .
The most significant changes to Child Custody laws in the last thirty years .
Substantial changes have been made to the practice of child custody laws in this country by the introduction of the Family Law ( Shared Parental Responsibility ) Act. ( 1st July 2006 )
Some spokespeople in the media have incorrectly referred to these changes as representing “ mandatory shared parenting “ , implying that children would be forced into shared care , no matter the circumstances .
Others have suggested that children would be forced into seeing abusive or violent parents .
In fact nothing could be further from the truth .
These laws have stronger domestic violence and child protection measures than any other previous version of the family law act , and before making any orders for shared care Judges and Federal Magistrates must be convinced that the child will not be exposed to any risk .
As the recent statistics from the Family Court suggest , getting any form of shared care is the least likely outcome for most fathers , denials of which invariably result from some allegation or history of abuse .
However many vested interest groups have seen fit to misrepresent these laws as promoting child abuse and domestic violence , and yet all the available evidence suggests that it has in fact done the exact opposite .
Nevertheless , these changes do herald in a new era whereby the importance of both parents being involved in the day to day lives of their children is recognised , at least in the legislation , and the previous presumption of sole care as the default post separation parental arrangement has been relegated to a less prominent and less certain position , the extent of which only time will tell .
What does this mean :
Whereas in the past the overwhelming majority of child custody disputes ended in a sole custody outcome , shared care outcomes are now growing in prominence , both through court orders and through private arrangements .
See the recent shared care statistics released by the Family Court .
Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
These new amendments introduce into court proceedings a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility .
In simple terms , this creates a starting point whereby both parents are considered to share equally the responsibilities and obligations of important decisions relating to the child / ren .
The equal sharing of parental responsibility essentially creates an obligation on both parents to consult with each other and reach agreement on long term issues to do with the child .
Some of the issues that are considered to comprise the long term welfare of the child include :
Education ( particularly the school a child will attend )
Religious upbringing
The child ’s name
Health decisions
Any change to a child ’s living arrangement , s particularly if this would impact on the child ’s relationship or ability to spend time with either parent .
What does this mean :
As a default , both parents are equally obligated and collectively responsible to participate and determine issues relating to the child ’s long term welfare .
The term “ equal ” was an important addition to this section and added specifically to undermine the notion that one parent had a greater right or responsibility in these matters than the other .
Equal shared parental responsibility can be rebutted ( removed )
However , this presumption DOES NOT apply when there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in :-
Abuse of the child or another child who was a member of the parent ’s family ; or
Family violence ; or
If there is evidence that satisfies the Court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the parents to have equal shared parental responsibility ( Section 61DA )
What does this mean : Equal shared parental responsibility is only the starting position and can be rebutted under certain conditions .
If it is rebutted , the Court is not required to consider shared care , and would be highly unlikely to award unsupervised contact of any duration .
Obligation of the Court to consider shared care
If the above can be satisfied and an order is made for equal shared parental responsibility , then the Court must consider whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable .
If it is , the Court must consider making an order for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents .
If the Court does not make an order for equal time , the Court must consider the child spending “ substantial and significant time ” with each of the parents .
If it does not , it must clearly explain on what basis it did not .
The term “ substantial and significant time ” is not intended to have a concrete definition , but it is taken to include ongoing weekday as well as weekend time .
A good example of what is considered to be “ substantial and significant time ” would be Wednesday evening to Monday morning every alternate week , while every second weekend is considered NOT TO comprise “ substantial and significant time ” .
What does this mean :
As long as equal shared parental responsibility is not rebutted ( removed ) , the Court will need to consider equal shared care or substantial and significant time care as the post separation parenting arrangement .
Best interests factors
The child ’s best interests is still the paramount consideration in making a parenting order .
In determining the child ’s best interests , the Court must now consider the factors set out in s60 CC of the Family Law Act .
The new section develops a two tier approach to determining the child ’s best interests ; “ primary considerations ” and “ additional considerations ” .
The two primary considerations are :
( i ) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents , and ;
( ii ) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm .
The additional considerations are essentially the same as the old s68 ( F ) ( 2 ) factors expect for one extra consideration .
The Court is now required to consider the willingness and ability of the parents to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent .
What does this mean :
( i) There are a number of considerations the Court must consider before determining what time a child can spend with each parent .
( i) Despite the number of considerations involved , the Court is still bound to make decisions that it considers to be in the child ’s overall best interests .
As a result any argument that successfully shows that it is not in the child ’s overall best interests to have shared care will prevail and shared care will be denied .
( iii ) The Court can , at its discretion , make Orders against a parent who has attempted to alienate the children from the other parent , or has otherwise not facilitated the child ’s relationship with the other parent .
In some cases , such as in the recent case of Irish & Michelle [ 2009 ]
FamCA 2009 , custody arrangements can be reversed as a result .
Parenting plans vs parenting orders
Parenting orders are orders made by a court ( including consent orders once filed with the Court ) whereas parenting plans are any agreement on parenting issues , written and signed and dated by the parties .
The changes provide that parenting orders are taken to be subject to any subsequent parenting plan entered into by the parties .
In exceptional circumstances ( including the need to protect a child from harm and the risk that one parent will use duress or coercion to get the other parent to enter into a parenting plan ) , the Court can include in a parenting order a provision that the order can only be varied by a subsequent parenting order and not a parenting plan .
What does this mean :
Even though you have gone to Court and the outcome has been Court orders or Consent orders ( orders made by agreement but signed by the Court ) , these orders can be adjusted or changed at any point in the future by a subsequent parenting plan .
In simple terms , as long as you agree you can alter the parenting terms determined by a Court .
Contraventions and parenting plans
A parenting plan is not legally enforceable as it is not an order of the Court .
Therefore , unlike parenting orders made by the Court , should a party breach a parenting plan it is not possible to initiate legal proceedings against them as a result .
If a party seeks to enforce a parenting order , the Court may consider varying the order during the contravention proceedings .
In considering the variation , the Court must have regard to a parenting plan that was agreed on after the Court order was made , and must consider whether to vary the order to include the provisions in the parenting plan .
You should take care when entering into parenting plans given that they are not enforceable but essentially override earlier Court orders .
When making any agreement in relation to your children you may also need to consider filing an application for consent orders which will , when approved by the Court , take effect as a Court order .
What does this mean :
If you are concerned that the other parent may breach or ultimately ignore the parenting arrangements that you both agree to , then it is advisable to make parenting orders and NOT parenting plans ( even you simply wish to adjust the existing Court orders ) .
The reason for this being that the Court can penalise a parent for contravening ( breaching ) a parenting order , but can do nothing if a parent breaches a parenting plan .
Compulsory mediation
Following the introduction of compulsory mediation ( from 1 July 2007 ) , you will not be able to make a court application for an order about children unless you have a certificate from a family dispute resolution practitioner ( mediator ) or you fall within one of the exceptions set out in the legislation .
These certificates will provide some detail on the attempts that have been made to resolve the dispute .
If you can satisfy one of the exceptions to compulsory mediation , you will not need a certificate .
One exception is where the Court believes on reasonable grounds that there has been abuse or risk of abuse of the child by one of the parties or if there has been family violence or a risk of family violence by one of the parties .
Another exception is if the matter is urgent .
Please note that a certificate may also say that a matter was inappropriate for mediation because of violence or abuse and , in appropriate circumstances , a party may wish to obtain a certificate in these terms as a way of seeking to satisfy the court that they fall within the exceptions to the requirement for compulsory mediation .
Even if the Court is satisfied that an exception applies , parties can still be ordered to attend mediation .
What does this mean : Mediation is compulsory before Court proceedings can be initiated , unless an exception is determined to apply , for instance in the case of child sexual abuse allegations .
Family Relationship Centres
Family Relationship Centres are intended to be “ one stop shops ” for all family issues and will offer relationship counselling and post separation mediation .
The centres will play a big role in the government ’s intended cultural change of keeping people out of the family law court system .

Children ’s Cases Program
The new Act requires that courts deal with parenting orders in a less adversarial , simpler and less formal manner .
The Family Court is implementing these changes through its Division 12A proceedings ( formally known as the Children ’s Cases Program ) .
These proceedings apply to all children ’s cases filed in the Court from 1 July 2006 but will initially apply to cases only when they get to the stage of a final hearing or trial .
Over time it is intended that the Court ’s processes will change so that the less adversarial processes commence at an earlier stage in the proceedings .
In the less adversarial Division 12A proceedings the final hearing is not conducted as a traditional court trial .
It begins with a more informal meeting between the judge , the parties , their legal representatives ( if there are any ) , a family counsellor and an Independent Children ’s Lawyer where applicable .
Everything said from the beginning of this first meeting until the case is finished becomes evidence in the case .
The judge will then narrow down the issues in dispute and will give directions as to what evidence should be provided by the parties .
Several of these court events may take place , with the same judge presiding .
If the matter still needs judicial determination after these meetings , the final hearing will proceed in the more traditional way .
We are not yet aware of how the Federal Magistrates Court and state Magistrates Courts will conduct the less adversarial , less formal child related proceedings .
Change to definition of violence
The definition of family violence now includes a “ reasonableness ” element .
In order to fall within the definition of family violence , conduct must cause a person to be “ reasonably ” fearful or apprehensive about their safety
When the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina receded from New Orleans , some of the city 's dangerously high lead levels washed away , too .
Prior to the Hurricane , 15 neighborhoods had soil lead levels higher than the federal standard .
Tests done in the same places post - Katrina found only 6 neighborhoods exceeding the limit .
Across 29 neighborhoods , lead levels dropped an average of 45 % between 2000 and 2006 — a change attributed to Katrina as the levels had sat , basically unchanged , between 1990 and 2000 .
The effect shows up in kids , as well as the yards they play in .
On average , New Orleans ' children under the age of six experienced a 30 % drop in blood lead levels .

It 's a good thing for Elena Kagan that there 's no non-GMO litmus test for Supreme Court nominees .
She 'd flunk .
As solicitor general , Kagan is supposed to represent the interests of the American people in matters that come before the Supreme Court .
Instead , she has gone to bat for Monsanto .
In a case that the court is currently considering , Monsanto is trying to overturn a 2007 California decision that imposed a nationwide injunction on planting the company 's genetically modified alfalfa .
In March , Kagan 's office interceded on Monsanto 's behalf ( click here for a PDF of its brief ) even though the government was not a defendant in the appeal .
The original suit was brought by Geertson Seed Farms and a collection of environmental groups , who claimed that pollen from Monsanto 's Roundup Ready alfalfa could contaminate neighboring plots of conventional alfalfa , causing irreparable harm to Geertson 's non-GMO business .
The decision that Kagan and Monsanto object to was issued by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer , who ruled that during the Bush administration , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) should not have given its blessing to GM alfalfa without considering possible environmental , financial , and health consequences ( a requirement under the law ) .
Erring on the side of caution , Breyer said that until the USDA conducted the proper environmental assessment , no GM alfalfa could be grown .

India is a land of entrepreneurs .
From tech - savvy businessmen to street barbers , the country is full of people who can identify opportunities and use them to their advantage .
The unorganised " micro-moneylenders " in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh are no exception .
To illustrate the point , let us take the example of a hypothetical village in Andhra .
As with most fertile villages in the region , MFIs ( microfinance institutions ) have a strong presence in the area .
For years now , they have been lending small sums of money to women in the village , purportedly to help them jumpstart micro-businesses .
The MFIs send staff to collect weekly loan instalments , which they do in early morning centre meetings .
In these meetings , 20 - 40 customers gather and repay their instalments together , and if somebody cannot pay , the others cover for her .
Suppose that , in our hypothetical village , one such meeting just ended .
Customers are pleased that they have paid the money they owed this week – it means they are a step closer to receiving a larger loan in the future .
The loan officer is similarly pleased – 100 % collection means that he will get a pat on the back and a boost in his variable income .
Far away in a world - class Indian city , the MFI 's founders are also pleased – high repayment rates mean that more investors will be interested in them .
As of late , however , high repayment rates may speak of something else entirely .
Specifically , they may mean that micro-moneylenders are at work .
These individuals , it seems , come in two flavours .
To date , both have only been seen anecdotally , but both have the ability to subvert the microfinance industry .
The first type looks and acts like a traditional moneylender .
Minutes before centre meetings , they offer money to cash - poor customers – typically 200-400 rupees ( £ 3 - £ 6 ) – and ask them to repay within a week .
They are quick , inconspicuous , and exorbitantly expensive .
The second type is harder to find , since they look and act like MFI customers .
In isolated incidents , it seems enterprising customers have begun " lending " money to their fellow centre members .
Before the meeting begins , they subtly dole out cash to those in need , and in return , charge commission for their generous services .
The presence of micro-moneylenders should hardly come as a surprise to microfinance practitioners .
Many customers in Andhra are running three to four loans simultaneously , meaning they need to continuously be cash - rich to pay instalments .
For customers that run seasonal businesses , such as harvesting rice or weaving winter blankets , this may prove difficult .
Customers also know that the loan officer will not adjourn the centre meeting until every rupee has been paid .
This practice was begun to instil discipline in repayment habits , but over the years , has become a nuisance to women whose livelihoods are time - dependent .
Women who are paid by the number of saris they produce , or by the time they spend picking cotton , want centre meetings to end as quickly as possible – even if it means becoming further indebted in the process .
Unfortunately , it is impossible to determine how widespread micro-moneylenders are .
To date , their existence has been only verified in whispers from branch staff in areas with high microfinance activity .
There are no statistics , academic reports , or roundtable discussions to confirm how active these individuals are .
Regardless , the presence of micro-moneylenders should serve as a warning signal to the industry .
Traditional wisdom has , for years , been telling us that the higher the repayment rate , the more effective the MFI .
Staff incentive schemes and investment decisions have been made using this linear benchmark .
The emergence of micro-moneylenders reminds us that the story may not be so simple , and that high repayment rates may mask other , less appealing , truths .
At its outset , microfinance was created for two primary reasons .
First , it was developed to fight local moneylenders who charged exorbitant rates .
Second , it was designed to help disenfranchised individuals climb rungs of the socioeconomic ladder .
In the future , practitioners should keep both of these guiding principles at the forefront .
Those who do will be the ones to truly benefit the women of our hypothetical village .
NEW YORK -- Drew Brees has another prize to put next to his Super Bowl MVP trophy :
He 's the cover model for this year 's edition of the " Madden NFL " video game .
EA Sports announced Thursday that the New Orleans Saints quarterback would be featured on the front of " Madden NFL 11 , " the latest installment of the best - selling football franchise .
Brees , who led his team to a 31 - 17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in this year 's Super Bowl , said landing the cover of " Madden " was " a great way to cap off an amazing year . "
The " Madden " gig is one of the most coveted honors in sports -- even though it has been connected to a much - discussed curse .
Such superstars as Donovan McNabb , Michael Vick and Shaun Alexander suffered serious injuries during the season each appeared on the cover .
Brees said he is n't worried .
" I believe in fate , and if it 's meant to be , it 's meant to be , " he said .
" But destiny is stronger than any curse , and this team is destined for great things . "
Brees joined the Saints in 2006 , less than a year after New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina .
He has become a highly visible spokesman for the city 's reconstruction , while the resurgent Saints gave its beleaguered residents something to rally around .
Brees said he hopes the presence of the Saints ' fleur - de - lis logo on the " Madden " cover " keeps people focused on what happened to New Orleans , and what the people of this city have overcome . "
The Saints quarterback was chosen by fans who voted online to determine the game 's cover athlete .
The other choices were Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne and Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jared Allen .
Brees told the ( New Orleans ) Times - Picayune that he was honored to be the first player voted to appear on the cover .
" Obviously the fans are the most important part of our game .
We 're representing them , " Brees told the newspaper .
" And that takes on additional meaning with the city of New Orleans . "
While he is New York for the unveiling of a large billboard of the " Madden NFL 11 " cover in Times Square , Brees will also tape appearances on " Live with Regis and Kelly " and the " Late Show " with David Letterman .
" Madden NFL 11 " will be released by EA Sports on Aug. 10 .
Brees told the newspaper that representatives of EA Sports will travel to New Orleans for the launch party , which will take place on Bourbon Street and be called " Madden Gras . "

Why the Gaza boat deaths are a huge deal
While we do n’t yet know all the facts , the apparent killing of at least 10 people aboard a ship bound for Gaza with humanitarian aid already has all the hallmarks of a massive public - relations disaster .
It does sound like there might have been some kind of violent response from the activists on the boat , and the Israeli military is claiming its forces encountered “ live fire and light weaponry including knives and clubs . "
But the international response has been swift .
Turkey has recalled its ambassador and warned of " consequences , " U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has called for an investigation , European governments have expressed shock , and I imagine thousands of outside observers like me are wondering just what possessed the Israeli government to risk such an outcome when it sent naval commandoes to board the vessel .
As Haaretz ‘s Amos Harel puts it , " The damage that Israel has caused itself internationally can hardly be exaggerated . "
Harel warns that the rumored presence of an Israeli Arab activist among the victims could lead to riots and perhaps even " a third intifada . "
Another liberal Haaretz commentator , Bradley Burston , comments , " We are no longer defending Israel .
We are now defending the siege .
The siege itself is becoming Israel ’s Vietnam . "
Israeli officials appear to be circling the wagons ; the question now becomes what the White House will say and do .
So far the Obama administration has said little , but with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu currently in Canada and scheduled to visit Washington Tuesday , it ca n’t stay silent for long .
There is talk in Israel that Netanyahu will cancel his trip , which would probably be the smart thing to do .
There will be heavy international pressure on Obama to condemn the incident , and he will probably make some kind of mild statement .
But a White House visit would quickly make the United States the focal point of world attention in a way that is , as White House officials like to put it , " not helpful . "
It already has the makings of a huge international fracas that will make the Goldstone Report look like small potatoes by comparison .
But to what end ?
Israelis on the right end of the political spectrum — and that is most of them these days — are convinced there is a " propaganda war " against their country , that most if not all of the criticism is unfair , and that the real issue is the radicalism of groups like Hamas and Hezbollah , which openly call for Israel ’s destruction .
That ’s certainly the perspective of hard - line government officials like Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon , who has already called the ships an " armada of hate and violence " and accused the activists of links to al Qaeda .
In other words , there ’s a huge unwillingness on the Israeli right to face reality — that Israel is fast losing friends and allies in the world , and that this government in Jerusalem has only accelerated the shift .
It ’s not hard to imagine boycott campaigns gaining momentum , damaging the Israeli economy and isolating the country diplomatically , especially in Europe .
The one thing that might extrictate Israel from this mess is a violent response from the Palestinian side — which never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
Stay tuned .

Jenny McCarthy , Doing Time
Opinions are like teeth .
Most of us have a mouth full of them , and some are prone to rot .
An opinion is merely an opinion .
Without some underlying fact , even the most reasonable assertions of belief — such as : “ Jet airplanes are powered by Bette Midler songs ! ” — are just so many words and have very little value .
An oft quoted corollary of this — one you usually hear just before losing an argument — is that while you are entitled to your own opinion , you are not entitled to your own facts .
There is some disagreement about who originated the axiom , but whoever it was never took the time to explain things to Jenny McCarthy .
McCarthy is a former model who seems to be famous for her naked buxomity .
More recently , she has become a very loud ( and presumably sincere ) proponent of the opinion that vaccines cause autism .
In fact , Jenny McCarthy is probably the most famous person in the world when it comes to the topic of vaccines and autism .
Jenny McCarthy has the recognition and agreement of more people on this topic than any other single person alive today .
McCarthy was recently featured in Time magazine , and her mantra that vaccines cause autism was writ large , albeit in crayon .
The article is awash in soft and middling arguments that effectively exclude no point of view , and have all the intellectual rigor of a tender - hearted school teacher who does n’t want to hurt your feelings by saying your toddler sucks at math .
To its credit , the article does mention the unequivocal findings of science in the autism and vaccine debate .
It even cites the Autism Science Foundation , which states that there have been 22 studies into the matter with no causal relationship ever being found .
However , in a rare feat of passive - aggressive journalism , the article ends on this vomitous note :
… as I was driving out to the San Fernando Valley to see McCarthy and realized she was right : parents will never stop hoping .
Thus does the article explain why the anti-vaccine movement is so popular .
In a further , drool - inducing act of equivocation , the writer leaves unquestioned McCarthy ’s assertion that she “ recovered ” her own child from autism , and does not need real science because she has her own .
Jenny ’s homegrown version of science is derived from her subjective experience of her son ’s horrible illness and recovery .
While none of us should reduce or belittle this experience , it is a colossal disservice to equate it with science .
Understanding that McCarthy ’s motivation derives from the parental nightmare of a seriously ill child , we are nevertheless responsible for our fidelity to the hard - won facts of very difficult and meticulous research .
In an apparent supplement to the piece in Time , McCarthy penned a column for The Huffington Post , an organ as open - minded as a person recently struck in the forehead with an axe .
In it , McCarthy asserts that vaccines must be toxic and dangerous , or else the federal government of the United States would not have paid out over 1.9 billion dollars in damages as a result of vaccine related illness and death .
She is even so helpful as to provide a link to the site that reports these awful and damning numbers .
She wants you to fear these numbers .
Here ’s some fact checking :
In the last 22 years , the US government has paid out on 2,428 claims at an average cost of about eight hundred thousand dollars per claim , and none of these claims were autism - related .
In the same period , at an average of 4 million per year , 88 million children have been born in the United Sates and about 67 million of these have been vaccinated .
This means that the US federal government has paid out a vaccine claim for less than 0.004 % of all vaccinated children .
That ’s 1 in about 27,950 .
By comparison , about 1 in 2000 people die from complications arising from having their gall bladder removed .
The real problem is that none of these numbers actually matter ; they are like the license plate of an oncoming car .
They ought to matter but they do n’t , and this is why Jenny is both not even wrong and all but unassailable .
Jenny McCarthy does not espouse a position , but rather an identity .
It ’s easy to debunk her facts because they are anything but , but she never really needs to defend them :
She is a suffering parent , and to question her is to question that .
That is Jenny ’s science .
" Why can't there be a separate regiment of eunuch community in our country ? " he wrote in the letter .
" This community would discharge their duties effectively on international borders if enough scope is created for them . "
Recent performance improvements in Parrot to avoid aggressive buffer copying and to avoid unnecessary buffer reallocations demonstrate how bugs , mistakes , and design infelicities at the lowest levels of your program stack can have dramatic negative effects on the whole program .
In the case of Parrot , they also demonstrate a worthwhile experiment currently underway .
What if we forbade modifying strings in place ?
It sounds crazy , but consider the evidence .
Most of the strings in Parrot and Rakudo get read many more times than written .
Yet because strings can change in place , many parts of the system which return strings must return copy - on - write string headers , to avoid those modifications .
For example , the Class PMC in Parrot contains a string which , if present , represents the name of that class .
Given a class object , you can ask for that string .
The Class must make a copy - on - write header for this operation .
If it did n't , any modification performed on the string it returned would change the name of the class in place , even unintentionally .
Almost none of the uses of this introspection interface on classes throughout Parrot and Rakudo ever perform any modifications on that string .
In other words , the interface prevents something rare and catastrophic from happening while penalizing the common behavior .
Certainly creating a new copy - on - write string should be cheap , and most of these strings become collectable garbage very quickly , but there 's no garbage collection mechanism cheaper than not creating garbage at all .
The important change is to forbid all string modification functions from operating on buffers in place .
Instead , they create new string headers return them directly .
The caller has the responsibility of storing the modified string as appropriate .
This pushes the allocation to the point of modification .
( Some might wonder " Why not modify the string in place and copy the old string ? "
That requires you to root around in memory to find all references to the existing string , and you 're not going to do that quickly or safely without changing the way memory works throughout Parrot , or at least building a huge data structure to keep up to date about what 's present where . )
There are two caveats to this system .
First , there are legitimate performance reasons to allow in - place modification .
Within a loop , appending to a single string can be much cheaper if you do allow modification : the rule about not creating and throwing away immediate garbage applies there .
The right solution is some kind of StringBuilder container which allows in - place modification with immutable strings .
( The JVM did , eventually , get this right . )
The second caveat is that high - level languages may support mutable string semantics .
Yet a similar approach works for this as well ; a high - level language should use a PMC as a container for primitive strings .
The contents of that PMC can change , but if everything refers to that PMC , it effectively appears to change in place .
I expect measurable performance improvements from this experiment , somewhere between 5 - 10 % on Rakudo benchmarks .
Not only does this create far fewer garbage headers to collect ( which decreases the amount of time spent in garbage collection ) , but it allows more pervasive sharing of constant strings .
We have another experiment in progress to coalesce all identical strings into one representation , and that has great memory savings as well .
This experiment wo n't make it into Parrot 2.3 , due on 20 April 2010 , but we should have performance numbers by then .
If it 's suitable for merging , it should be available for Parrot 2.4 as well as Rakudo Star .
After Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - AZ ) called for a boycott of his own state should the GOP ’s immigrant crackdown bill become law , an unnamed individual allegedly threatened on Friday to blow up his Tucson office and murder his staff , according to published reports .
In response , Grijalva announced the closure of his offices in Tucson and Yuma later that night .
While they are expected to reopen on Monday and the FBI is looking into the alleged threat , to Democrats across Arizona the message is abundantly clear : do not speak out against the state ’s immigration crackdown , or else .

The congressman had in recent days sparked a political firestorm by calling on businesses and organizations to boycott his state over its recently - passed immigration reforms that , in the name of cracking down on illegal Mexican immigration , empowers authorities to detain and interrogate anyone based solely on the officer ’s judgement of behavior and appearance .
Adam Sarvana , a spokesman for Rep. Grijalva , told The Arizona Daily Star that another man who called twice “ threatened to go down there and blow everyone ’s brains out then go to the border to shoot Mexicans . ”
Though the congressman ’s offices were closed , he still went ahead with an anti-immigration crackdown rally in Tucson .
It reportedly attracted about 250 supporters , according to the Star .
“ White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters that could mean the Justice Department might look into potential ‘ civil rights violations ’ against ‘ legal residents ’ and citizens , ” Politico reported .
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer , a Republican , signed the bill on Friday .
President Obama criticized the move as “ misguided . ”

Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks during a cabinet meeting on Russia 's military - industrial complex in Moscow , March 1 , 2010 .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) -
Once it has completed work on its own fifth - generation fighter , Russia must proceed with designing a brand - new nuclear - capable strategic bomber , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Monday .
“ Certainly , we should not confine ourselves to developing just one new model .
After the fifth - generation fighter jet , we must think and get down to work on a next - generation , long - range aviation complex -- our new strategic missile carrier , ” Putin told a cabinet meeting on Russia ’s military - industrial complex .
After the demise of the Soviet Union , Russia inherited a fleet of the still formidable but fast - aging Tupolev Tu-95 MS turbo - prop strategic bombers and missile platforms codenamed “ Bears ” by NATO .
It also has a much smaller fleet of the more modern , supersonic Tupolev Tu-160 “ Blackjack ” jet bombers , the world ’s biggest warplanes built so far .
Russia test - flew its long - awaited stealth fighter at the end of January , presenting it as Moscow ’s first all - new warplane since the 1991 Soviet collapse and a challenge to the technological supremacy of Cold War foe the United States which rolled out its fifth - generation fighter more than a decade ago .
Putin , then president , ordered in 2007 to resume Soviet - style patrols of Russian bombers around the globe , seeing it as a way of boosting Moscow ’s stature in the world .
Over the past five years or so , I ’ve spoken time and again with the hugely gifted pianist Christopher O’Riley .
He ’s easygoing and smart , and enjoys discussing the popular National Public Radio show that he hosts , “ From the Top . ” A weekly showcase for some of the most talented young classical musicians in the nation , it is broadcast on 250 stations ( including KDFC-FM , 102.1 , 7 p.m. Sundays ) , reaching an audience estimated at more than 700,000 .
O’Riley also loves to talk about his No. 1 obsession of recent years : the band Radiohead , a favorite of many classical musicians .
Trouble is , O’Riley ’s public profile as radio host and Radiohead lover has sometimes obscured the fact that he is also a piano recitalist of the first rank , one who routinely delves into core repertory .
He has devoted most of his career to performing the works of Ravel , Rachmaninoff , Shostakovich , Schumann and others — including Beethoven .
Now , here ’s your chance to witness O’Riley ’s talents as a Beethoven interpreter : Saturday at San Jose State University , he will give an all - Beethoven recital , performing a pair of monumental works , the Diabelli Variations and the late - period Sonata in C minor , Op. 111 .
He is coming at the invitation of the American Beethoven Society , which brings a leading Beethoven interpreter to San Jose State each year .
Richard Goode , Garrick Ohlsson , Anton Kuerti and Angela Hewitt have performed in the past .
Saturday , O’Riley joins the list : “ And Chris ’s Beethoven is like no one else ’s , ” says William Meredith , director of the Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies at San Jose State , the event ’s co-sponsor .
( The concert is a benefit for the center ’s fund for acquiring new manuscripts , first editions and other Beethoveniana . )
“ He carries you away from banal everyday life into a wide - open creative musical space .
“ I say this as a Beethoven scholar , ” Meredith continues .
“ Chris transforms the experience into one in which you feel you ’re listening to Beethoven improvise right in front of you .
That was exactly the impression I had in Detroit last year , when I heard him play the last sonata , Op. 111 .
As the second movement gets more and more improvisatory and goes off into new worlds , Chris , as cliched as it sounds , seemed to be channeling Beethoven into life . ”
Born in 1956 and raised outside Chicago , O’Riley won awards at the Leeds , Van Cliburn and other major competitions early in his career .
His first recording , in 1983 , was devoted to works by Ferruccio Busoni , and it was n’t long before he was on to Gershwin ( “ Rhapsody in Blue ” with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ) and Scriabin .
In recent years , he has performed and recorded his transcriptions of songs by Nick Drake , Elliott Smith , even Nirvana — and , of course , Radiohead .
In a conversation two years ago — before performing a recital of Radiohead and Shostakovich at Stanford — he told me that he had more than 100 Radiohead concerts on his iPod , and he explained the group ’s appeal to so many classical and jazz musicians .
He described Radiohead as “ a very contrapuntal — not a wall - of - undifferentiated - sound — band , and the weave of material that makes each song unique , and bears the stamp of each member of the band integrally , makes their music more interesting to more cultivated musicians . ”
Then he explained some of the backdrop to his 2008 Stanford recital , arguing that “ both Radiohead and Shostakovich had a great commonality in their innovative grasp of irony in music .
Shostakovich , writing within the oppressive Stalinist framework , became the first serious composer to , by necessity , master the art of sub rosa expression — irony in music .
Likewise , Radiohead ’s songs , like ‘ No Surprises , ’ for instance , pit suicidally tinged lyrics against a pretty musical backdrop — again , irony in music . ”
Meredith , for his part , wonders if O’Riley ’s background as a Beethoven interpreter prepared him for Radiohead : “ Maybe playing the world ’s most popular classical composer prepared him for all the Radiohead re-enactments .
Whether it ’s classical or popular music , the same deep connection to the original sources comes through clear as a bell . ”

The BNP would offer non-white British people £ 50,000 to leave " overcrowded " Britain and return to the land of their ancestors , the party 's leader Nick Griffin said today .
Griffin said the voluntary programme would be open to around 180,000 people a year who " could go back and help develop their own countries " .
He said the scheme would be funded from the foreign aid budget and money the government is " wasting at the moment on ridiculous climate change adaptation policies " .
" We 're saying that we 'd give resettlement grants ... this is voluntary ... we 're looking probably at £ 50,000 per person , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
Griffin said that the doors would be closed to everyone because Britain was " the most overcrowded country in Europe " , but he did give exceptions .
He said that Irish people would be allowed in because " as far as we are concerned the Irish are part of Britain and are fully entitled to come here " .
Griffin also gave the example of a Japanese physicist needed to help with a fleet of British - built nuclear power stations to be developed under a BNP government .
He claimed that French people who came to the country were unlikely to be targeting " soft - touch Britain " .
" If you are talking about Polish plumbers or Afghan refugees , the doors are going to be shut because Britain is full , " the BNP leader said .
Griffin , who claimed he would rather be about the economy " like the other leaders " , but was " very pleased " to talk about immigration , continued : " The door is shut to any significant numbers whatsoever , from anywhere .
It 's open where it suits Britain and suits the British people .
That 's fair enough . "
He claimed " British indigenous " people would be in a minority in the country between 2050 and the end of the century .
Griffin said the BNP would be prepared to tear up international treaties in order to achieve its objectives .
Asked what would happen if other countries reciprocated by not allowing British people in , Griffin replied : " The last thing I saw there was n't a queue of Brits trying to go to Albania or Somalia . "

For wildlife like the timber rattlesnsake , trying to cross even light - traffic country roads presents a formidable life - or - death challenge .
As a new study in the journal Conservation Biology shows , these roads can also contribute to the genetic decline of the species .
This can occur when roads cut off the path of movement of individuals leading to isolated groups that are unable to reproduce together .
This in turn causes a reduction in genetic flow across the population .
To examine this issue in the timber rattlesnake , Rulon Clark and fellow researchers conducted genetic sampling of individuals within two types of forested areas in upstate New York - one fragmented by several low - traffic roads and the other road - free .
They found that genetic diversity was lower in the areas with roads - likely because reproduction had been occurring among smaller pools of individuals .
Further , snakes in areas with roads had undergone greater extent of genetic differentiation indicating a reduction in gene flow as isolated groups of snakes went down their own distinct trajectories of genetic change .
These findings bode ill for the snake and other wildlife undergoing a similar phenomenon .
High genetic diversity and flow are important for maintaining healthy populations capable of adapting to environmental stressors .
The study provides evidence that roads are at least partly to blame .
The researchers conducted a landscape genetic analysis to compare where pairings between snakes would occur in the absence of disturbance versus what was actually recorded .
They found that roads acted as major barrier to genetic connectivity .
This makes sense for the timber rattlesnake based on past behavioral studies .
The authors write ,
" In an experimental study , Andrews and Gibbons ( 2005 ) demonstrated that timber rattlesnakes cross roads slowly ( approximately 10 cm/s ) and individuals stop moving and remain immobile for up to a minute or more in response to any traffic noise .
From their behavioral data , they estimated that timber rattlesnakes crossing roads would suffer an 80 % mortality rate on roads with a traffic volume of 3,000 cars / day , a traffic level corresponding to the minor roads in our study . "
This high mortality level , along with plain avoidance of roads , likely plays a key role in the observed genetic decline .
Given the findings , the authors recommend that measures such as the construction of culverts be undertaken to minimize the impacts to the snakes .
They note however that more research is needed to determine whether these measurers will actually have a beneficial effect on restoring genetic connectivity .

I do n’t buy into the many conspiracy theories that continually seem to get resurrected , but I expect that this particular thesis , from Max Keiser , may very well have legs :
“ May 6th was an unequivocal act of domestic financial terrorism in America .
A day that will live in infamy .
To scare the lawmakers , themselves large owners of the very banks and stocks that they are supposed to be regulating , a financial Weapon of Mass Destruction was put to their head and they acquiesced .
As the inventor of the continuous double - auction , market - making technology ( VST tech .
US pat. no. 5950176 ) that is referenced 132 times by program trading and HFT patents since 1996 , I can tell you that Goldman , JP Morgan and the gang simply pulled the ‘ buys ’ from their computer trading programs and manufactured a crash .
And when the coast was clear , and it was clear the politicians were not going to vote for anything that would break up the ‘ too big to fail ’ banks ; all the ’ sells ’ were pulled from the computers and the market roared back .
This is a Manchurian Candidate market where program trading bots start the ball rolling in whatever direction Wall St. wants the market to go – and then hundreds of thousands of day - traders watching Cramer on CNBC jump on the momentum bandwagon and commit the crime for the Wall St. financial terrorists , who then say , ‘ It was n’t us , it was ‘ the market ! ’ ”

Emma Thompson on Hollywood 's obsession with skinny starlets
Militant : When Emma Thompson was at university , she shaved her head , wore dungarees , glasses and looked like John Lennon
What sort of mother lets her ten - year - old daughter wear high heels ?
You might be surprised to discover that Emma Thompson - actress , ardent feminist and about as principled as they come .
The revelation comes as something of a shock .
She 's been chatting away about her relationship with Gaia - conceived via IVF - and it's all lovely , if predictable stuff .
At first she talks a little earnestly about her approach to motherhood , explaining that boundaries are important .
' With Gaia , I make sure that the boundaries are reasonable .
' I only fight the battles I really think have to be fought .
Some of the battles I will lose on purpose , so that she gets a sense of power over her own existence . '
A lovely theory , but in practice it has meant her principles being trampled underfoot , almost literally .
' One of the battles I have let her win is allowing her to have a pair of high heels , ' she confesses , apologetically , well aware that Emma Thompson is the last woman on earth you 'd expect to allow a pre-teen to totter about in heels .
' I thought , you know , I am not going to push this .
I can't walk in high heels , but actually I would like her to be able to walk in heels because they look nice .
And she loves them .
' I loved them when I was little .
If I had been allowed to have high heels I would have been so happy , but no .
So she has a little pair of high heels . '
Where does that one fit into feminist theory , then ?
In her university days , Emma was about as strident as they come .
She says that she ' became quite militant , shaved my head , wore dungarees and glasses and looked like John Lennon ' .
That was then .
Has motherhood , erm , added another dimension to her feminist thinking ?
She laughs , and comes out with a line that only Emma is capable of uttering .
' No , I think motherhood blows your whole inner world out and up and over and inside out .
I think you might as well swallow a hand grenade .
That 's what motherhood is like . '
Even though she is a mother first , Emma also leads a rather glamorous showbiz life - although she somehow manages to make even this seem mundane .
Liberal : Ardent feminist Emma lets her daughter Gaia , 10 , wear high heels
Take the fact that she shares a driver with Kate Moss .
Some people would boast about it .
She points out that the press are forever disappointed because she is snapped in the back of the car and not Moss .
' Because of her , the paparazzi know the driver 's car , and so when he 's driving me around they 'll sometimes follow us and I 'll get out and they 'll go , " Oh " .
It 's just fantastic .
It makes me laugh so much every time .
I say , " No , let me get out , let me get out ! " I just want to see their faces drop . '
That she 's not Kate Moss is something she 's keen to emphasise in another regard too .
Her disdain for the film industry 's obsession with turning every young actress into a size zero is legendary .
Emma for PM :
The actress , who starred in the sequel to Nanny Mcphee this year ,
Two years ago she went ballistic when she heard it had been suggested that a young actress on the set of Brideshead Revisited lose a stone in weight .
Did she really threaten to quit ?
' Absolutely !
I would have broken my contract and taken the story to the press .
I am a bit of a fundamentalist about all that size zero stuff - I would have made a big , fat fuss .
That was no joke .
I would have walked off the set . '
Ask what can be done about such attitudes and she does n't shrug , like most actresses of her calibre would .
' Put on weight and say F *** off , ' she retorts .
' Demand bigger sizes .
Go into places where you can't get a 38D bra and say , " I want a 38D bra and give me one .
If you can't , I am never coming here again . " '
If ever there was a battle to be had , in a bra shop or anywhere else , you would really want to have Emma Thompson by your side .
She has always been a natural leader .
Indeed , her mother , fellow actress Phyllida Law , and sister , Sophie , also an actress , both say that Emma really should be prime minister .
Given that there is a vacancy at the moment , it 's really hard to disagree .
Nicola and Matteo Carati are two brothers of Rome , who live the years from 1966 to 2000 and all the events which have signed this period .
They begin their adventure , helping Giorgia , a young girl confined in an asylum .
Then , after the flood of Florence , Nicola meets Giulia a talented piano player with a dangerous sympathy for the BR .
Matteo , a rebel spirit entered in the police , will find the optimistic photographer Mirella .
These four characters and many others will cross the years of terrorism and Tangentopoli .

La Paz , Bolivia
Cycling the so - called world 's most dangerous road is now one of the most popular activities for backpackers in Bolivia .
Last month , shortly after what is thought to be the 18th biker death on its perilous hairpin bends , interest was undiminished .
So what 's the attraction ?
It 's a bike ride like no other .
No wonder it is known as the world 's most dangerous road , or simply " death road " .
On its upper reaches , the clouds hug the cliff edge , obscuring the abyss .
To the left , there is an unobstructed 600 m drop off a cliff while on the right , a vertical rock - face .
And the surface , which is unpaved , resembles a rough , dirt track more than a road .
Some of the drops are hundreds of metres high
The scenery , if you dare take your eyes off the road , is breathtaking , with the lush rainforest of the Yungas stretching out before you .
But the stone and wooden crosses that line the route are a sombre reminder that not everyone cycles the full 40 miles ( 64 km ) safely to its conclusion .
Hurtling at 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) down its dusty track is now a sought - after thrill for about 25,000 backpackers a year .
It has become an extreme sport like bungee jumping and skydiving .
The difference here is that there is no expert guide controlling your propulsion .
You are on your own .
There are no official figures for the number of deaths but the first tour company to offer the ride , Gravity , says 18 backpackers have been killed since cyclists began tackling its hairpin bends 12 years ago .
Other tour companies estimate the figure is slightly lower or higher than that .
The most recent victim was an Israeli backpacker , who died last month after going over the edge .
No - one knows how the accident happened , but when cycling the route , the perils are obvious .
It is nearly all downhill , dropping 11,800 ft , which means speed increases almost imperceptibly , and your hands are constantly applying the brakes .
Then there is the uneven surface , the loose stones that make the ride even more hazardous .
Badge of honour
Although a new road opened in 2006 , there are still a few lorries and cars vying for space with the hordes of thrill - seeking cyclists , on a road that is sometimes only a single lane wide .
The spots that claimed the lives of motorists and cyclists are marked The highway from La Paz to Coroico was built by Paraguayan prisoners of war in the 1930s when the two countries were at war , and it earned its notoriety in 1995 .
The Inter - American Development Bank was conducting a feasibility study for a new road and it estimated that there were between 200 and 300 deaths a year , so it bestowed on it the title of the " world 's most dangerous road " .
Those four words have now become a dubious badge of honour , a slogan seen on backpacker T - shirts and a phrase overheard amid the bravado of youth hostel bars .
" If you go to London , you have to see London Bridge and if you go to Sydney you have to see the Opera House , " says Andrew Jagoo , 26 , from Melbourne , recovering his breath after the ride .
The number of lives lost used to total more than 200 a year " And if you go to Bolivia , you must do the most dangerous road .
There 's an element of risk but you can say afterwards that you 've done it . "
The man who started the phenomenon in 1998 , 39 - year - old New Zealander Alistair Matthew , says good instruction and sensible behaviour can overcome the dangers .
" It is our belief that the vast majority of the risk can be mitigated by providing people with great bikes and equipment , lots of instruction , and lots of warnings about the potential for accidents .
" However , this also means constantly monitoring groups to provide extra warnings to over - excited people and more coaching to less experienced riders . "
' Bragging rights '
He came up with the idea while trying lots of new rides on his mountain bike in the region near La Paz .
" The first ride down the world 's most dangerous road was spectacular .
I went with a British lad , ex-SAS , both of us on horrible old - school bikes with no suspension and cantilever brakes .
One mistake and you are dead
Backpacker Marte Solberg
" We finished the ride with big grins and ' claw - hands ' from holding on to the brakes . "
His company , Gravity , was the first to offer tourists the chance to cycle the road , initially five people at a time .
It is now one of up to 20 companies promising backpackers the thrilling whiff of danger .
Gravity uses a trained guide to cycle at the front and one at the back , plus sometimes one in the middle .
And a minibus carrying spare bikes and rescue equipment follows behind .
During the rainy season , from December to March , he says Gravity discourages people with little or no experience from taking part .
Although only one rider with Gravity has had a fatal accident - a man in his 50s about two years ago - there are plenty of cuts and bruises .
Roughly every fortnight , someone requires hospital treatment for an injury .
DOs and DON 'Ts Don't try to race others
Do n't do it with a hangover Listen to the instructors
Warn people when you overtake them Stop and dismount to take photos
Only experienced riders should do it in the rainy season Source : Gravity " Simply put , it 's all about ' bragging rights ' , " says Mr Matthew .
" Everyone wants to return from their holidays and travels with good stories to tell their mates at work or at the pub , or to post on Facebook .
" The road is simply unparalleled in that regard and the accidents on the road add to that story . "
The news of the Israeli woman 's death was the talk of the youth hostels in La Paz in the days afterwards , and some backpackers said it had put them off doing it .
One Israeli in his early 20s said you would have to be " crazy " and he said he had promised his parents that under no circumstances would he undertake this cycle ride .
Cyclists are kitted out with helmets , gloves and hi-vis jackets
Even those who took to the saddle a week after the tragedy said the news added to their anxiety .
" I was really scared and I was even crying beforehand , " says Marte Solberg , 22 , from Norway , after completing the ride .
" A lot of people had said it is so much fun , but I was scared of falling over and dying , like the Israeli girl .
I was worried about my own judgement because I have no experience of mountain biking .
One mistake and you are dead .
" I asked myself a thousand times ' Why am I doing this ? '
The answer is that firstly , everyone is doing it .
If you come to Bolivia , you have to cycle down the most dangerous road in the world .
And secondly , it 's a personal challenge . "
The clouds on the higher stretches obscure the drop Catherine Pearson , 28 , from Manchester , on a six - month trip with her boyfriend , believes you could simply be unlucky .
" If a truck comes along and you go over a stone the wrong way , you do n't know what could happen .
Sometimes while I was cycling , I was thinking ' I 'm going too fast , I need to brake ' and then I braked and I thought ' I 'm braking too hard and might tip over . '
" It 's a personal challenge and you are scared but it 's a balance between the two .
You have to beat your fear . "
But the news of what happened a week before did change the tone of the day , says Ms Pearson .
" Hearing about the death had an impact on us .
For a start , it made me pay extra attention .
And you would feel guilty if you started bragging about surviving . "

The Original Usenet Physics FAQ
This list of answers to frequently asked questions in physics was created by Scott Chase in 1992 .
Its purpose was to provide good answers to questions that had been discussed often in the sci.physics and related Internet news groups .
The articles in this FAQ are based on those discussions and on information from good reference sources .
They were later maintained and enlarged by Michael Weiss and Philip Gibbs .
Others who have written for the FAQ are credited at the top of the items they submitted , while many more who have made smaller contributions have been thanked privately .
Most of the entries that you 'll find here were written in the days when the Internet was brand new .
But rather than showing their age , this means that they were written in a time when most contributions to the Internet came from authors who had a lot of knowledge of their subject .
The same is no longer true of the modern - day Internet , where a vast number of authoritative - looking wiki - type pages are written by anyone who wants to , regardless of their knowledge .
So because of their age , the FAQ entries that you 'll find here have a great deal of academic credibility — but they are not always perfect and complete .

Gorilla Coffee , a Park Slope , Brooklyn , favorite , remained closed for a second day Sunday after almost the entire staff resigned .
The owners say it is n’t going to reopen soon .
According to an e-mail message sent by the former staff , the baristas quit because of what they call a “ perpetually malicious , hostile , and demeaning work environment ” under Carol McLaughlin , one of the two owners , and demanded that she withdraw from daily operations at the coffee bar .
When both owners refused , seven baristas quit .
( Another barista resigned , but the owners say that person was n’t an employee . )
“ The issues brought up with the owners of Gorilla Coffee , ” the staff e-mail message said , “ are issues that they have been aware of for some time . ”
The owners say the confrontation was unexpected .
“ It ’s a complete surprise , ” Darleen Scherer , one of the owners , said over the phone .
“ They made an unreasonable request , and then they did n’t have any way to go but out . ”
The owners characterize their workplace as one that is mostly happy if often busy .
When one employee started expressing her dissatisfaction , “ it got out of hand . ”
Ms. Scherer said Ms. McClaughlin is “ passionate and she pushes people .
“ The training to be a barista is rigorous , ” she continued , “ and she ’s like a drill sergeant .
She trains somebody and they become good , and then they become great , and then they become excellent .
I do n’t understand the perceived hostility .
Everybody has a different learning curve and she respects that . ”
Gorilla is such a local institution it appeared on the cover of the New Yorker [ viewable if you have a subscription ] .
As is to be expected , the blogosphere has become a sounding board for both barista partisans and the pro-owner camp , from Sprudge.com , a mock - CNN for the coffee industry ( it started off as a mock - Drudge Report ) , to Gawker , which calls the walkout an “ insurrection . ”
Gorilla Coffee will continue to roast coffee beans for sale elsewhere .
The roaster is in a different location , and has n’t been affected .
Here ’s the staff e-mail :
A prominent Philippine businessman has resigned from a prestigious academic post after he was found to have made a speech plagiarising well - known figures .
Manuel Pangilinan quit after admitting he had borrowed from US President Barack Obama , TV host Oprah Winfrey and children 's author JK Rowling .
He stepped down after it was revealed on the Facebook website that his address to students was not original .
Mr Pangilinan had in the past spoken up for ethics and morality .
He said he decided to step down as chairman of the board of trustees of Ateneo de Manila University in the capital , Manila , to spare the university any criticism .
In a statement published on the university website , Mr Pangilinan said he was embarrassed by the speech he made at the university last month .
He said he had had some help in drafting his remarks , but took full responsibility for them .
" I have been told last night that portions of my graduation remarks - in particular my address to the Schools of Humanities and Social Sciences - had been borrowed from certain other graduation speeches .
" I had taken a look at the side - by - side comparison on Facebook , and must admit to this mistake . "
Mr Pangilinan is also head of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company .
Remember the phrase " Do n’t throw the ‘ fair go ’ out the back window " ?
As Opposition Leader , Rudd repeated it ad nauseum in the run-up to the 2007 federal election .
While Kevin07 was a self - avowed fiscal conservative , he was also a believer in a fairer , more compassionate Australia .
Or so he told us .
Indeed , one of his very first statements as Prime Minister - elect was that he would honour the " spirit and letter " of the UN Convention on Refugees .
That promise has now gone by the board , along with the so - called " seven principles " of immigration policy advanced by Immigration Minister Chris Evans in 2008 .
Some of those principles included : that detention would be for " the shortest practicable time " and used only as a last resort ; that " people in detention will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law " ; and that " detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable " .
But what could be more " arbitrary " than refusing to process refugee applications from two of the most strife - torn nations in the world ?
How " fair " and " reasonable " is that ?
According to the Government ’s media release , " The situations in both Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are evolving . "
If so , no one appears to have told the Australian military , which is still fighting a war in Afghanistan , or the Department of Foreign Affairs , which maintains a strong travel warning for Australians going there and advises people to reconsider travel to Sri Lanka .
For more than two years , Labor has argued that " push " factors like violence and conflict in foreign lands are the cause of refugee flows .
The Opposition has argued that Labor has gone soft on refugees , and that this favourable treatment is " pulling " them to our shores .
With its changes on the weekend , the Government has effectively conceded this argument .
Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison must be delighted .
The boats , of course , will keep coming , and while they do , Abbott and Morrison will be able to keep talking about Labor ’s failed policy .
What is with the Australian hysteria about boats ?
We live on an island continent that has only ever been successfully invaded once — by the British jailers who eventually founded this nation .
But throughout colonial history , and again after Federation in 1901 , Australian politics has retained a deep paranoia about non-white migration , particularly by sea .
How else to explain the sustained but absurd coverage of small numbers of boat arrivals by our national media , particularly the Murdoch tabloid press ?
It ’s worth pointing out ( yet again ) that arrivals by boat represent only a tiny proportion of those arriving on our shores .
Most immigrants , including most asylum seekers , come by plane .
But , for reasons entirely related to deep - seated atavism and xenophobia , it is the boats that grab the headlines .
As the " boat count " this year has spiralled past 100 , the Daily Telegraph and the Herald - Sun have enthusiastically kept score , hungrily feeding on the Coalition ’s talking points about the Rudd Government " losing control " of border security in articles like this one .
Even the quickest glance at the facts reminds us how ridiculous this claim is .
The boats reaching Australia are small Indonesian fishing boats , generally carrying no more than 50 or so asylum seekers at a time .
They generally sail for Christmas Island , Australia ’s territorial outpost in the Timor Sea .
The Australian Government and Navy aggressively patrols the seas around Ashmore Reef and there is a massive detention facility on Christmas Island .
The fact that unarmed boats reach Australian waters does not mean our borders are not secured .
A few thousand refugees in a year is not a problem that ’s " out of control " .
Australia is a wealthy , industrialised nation blessed with vast natural resources and one of the strongest economies in the developed world .
The idea that we ca n’t afford to process refugees is laughable .
The only real reason this is an issue is that refugees are unpopular in certain parts of the electorate .
And , spooked by the climate of fear whipped up by the tabloid press and the Opposition , the Government has buckled .
As I pointed out in March , the Rudd Government has been worried about the number of boats arriving for some time now .
In that article , I predicted the Coalition ’s line of attack on border security would push Labor to the right .
But even I am surprised at how quickly that has happened .
And so , in a cowardly decision , the Rudd Government has decided that claims from Sri Lankan and Afghani asylum seekers " will not be considered " for the next three to six months … in other words , until after the federal election .
This is not compassionate .
It may not even be legal .
But it is expedient .
And in an election year , that is what counts .
This back - flip is nothing less than a broken promise — a policy abandoned for the most cynical reasons of political pressure .
It will be difficult to take any future Labor promises to protect the " inherent dignity of the human person " seriously .
It appears that , for some asylum seekers , Kevin Rudd ’s " fair go " was thrown out the back door on or around the time that the 107th " suspected illegal entry " boat entered Australian waters this year .
Make no mistake , this is about votes in marginal seats .
Labor does n’t need a focus group to tell it that asylum seekers are unpopular .
Nor should we sheet home all the blame to a ruthless Opposition or cynical News Limited press .
There is in fact a genuine fear of immigrants and refugees in many parts of Australian society , and to pretend otherwise simply blinds us to the reality of racism in our public life .
Just ask an Indian cab driver .
As Paul Kelly wrote in The Australian on the weekend , Labor has form when it comes to xenophobic refugee policy .
Historically , the party was a strong supporter of the White Australia policy .
It was the Hawke government that first introduced mandatory detention for refugees and built the Port Hedland detention centre .
Under Kim Beazley , Labor supported many of John Howard ’s most regressive changes to the Migration Act .
Kelly says it well when he writes , " Here is the authentic face of the Labor Party under pressure .
This is the Labor Party that created the detention system in the 1990s for men , women and children .
This is Rudd Labor now extending the detention period . "
For those who hoped for a more humane and compassionate government than John Howard ’s , Kevin Rudd ’s administration is increasingly disappointing .
Rather than wind back the Northern Territory Emergency Response , Rudd and Jenny Macklin have extended it .
Rather than get out of the war in Afghanistan , Rudd has recommitted to it .
And rather than ending the mandatory detention of refugees , his Government continues to arbitrarily jail them .
Seven years ago this week , the Dixie Chicks had the No. 1 country single in the U.S. with Bruce Robison 's lump - raising " Travelin ' Soldier . "
Meanwhile , in Washington , D.C. , the Bush Administration was putting the finishing touches on its Iraqi invasion strategy , which prompted Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines to tell a London audience the evening of March 10 , 2003 , that " we 're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas . "
Oops .
Although lefties flocked to the Chicks ' defense - some even admitting that hey , maybe their music was n't so bad after all - several mainstream country stations , especially in the South , went from spinning " Soldier " once an hour to organizing anti-Chick rallies where DJs encouraged listeners to bring in CDs , posters and other paraphernalia to either be crushed by bulldozers or thrown on
Farenheit 451
- like bonfires .
In the Chicks ' hometown of Dallas , they needed a police escort from the airport to American Airlines Center because someone called in a death threat against Maines .
The Chicks came back in 2006 with
Taking the Long Way
, an album geared both in sound and marketing strategy toward NPR and adult - alternative listeners .
Tickets never even went on sale for the planned Houston stop of the Chicks ' subsequent Accidents & Accusations tour when no radio stations here would sell them advertising time .
( Way to make us proud , assholes . )
Long Way
won the 2007 Grammy for Album of the Year , with Maines ' song about " The Incident " and its near - bloody aftermath , " Not Ready to Make Nice , " taking both Record and Song of the Year .
Ever since , though , the Chicks have been in limbo .
Sorry , " on hiatus . "
Emily Robison and Martie Maguire 's new project , Court Yard Hounds , will release their self - titled debut LP May 4 on Columbia Records and appear at the Americana Music Association 's SXSW showcase at Antone 's March 18 .
According to Columbia 's own press release , " Realizing that the Dixie Chicks ' hiatus would last longer than originally anticipated , the sisters dove head first into recording what is now the debut album from the Court Yard Hounds . "
Rocks
Off decided it was high time we thumbed through the archives and see what other acts of career hari - kiri - or at least near - hari - kiri - we could find .
From what we can tell , favorably comparing your popularity to Our Lord and Savior , being sued by your own record company and marrying your 13 - year - old cousin are all less damaging than speaking your mind against what would turn out to be one of the most unpopular presidencies , and one of the most ill - advised military actions , in U.S. history .
Oh , right - and installing hidden cameras in the women 's restroom of your restaurant so you can watch ladies pee at your leisure .
Some country we live in , ai n't it ?
5. Bob Dylan
When Dylan brought an electric blues band to back him at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1965 , it became one of the defining moments of his career .
Their brief performance touched off howls of protest from the audience , although accounts differ over whether they were upset about the presence of the demon electricity or the brevity of the performance .
To the Band 's Robbie Robertson , it was much ado about nothing : " It seemed kind of a funny statement to me at the time , that somebody 's gone electric , " he told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes in 2001 's Down the Highway : The Life of Bob Dylan .
" It was like , ' Jeez , somebody 's just bought a television . ' "
4. The Beatles
Although he first made it to a London newspaper , when John Lennon 's comment that the Beatles were " more popular than Jesus right now " reached U.S. audiences via the teen magazine DATEbook in July 1966 - shortly before the release of Revolver - it touched off a Dixie - Chicks - like firestorm of righteous anger and a lot of copies of Help ! and " I Wanna Hold Your Hand " 45s going up in smoke .
But the Beatles were still the Beatles , and subsequent albums such as Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , Abbey Road , Let It Be and the many , many compilations and retrospectives released after the group broke up in 1970 have hardly faltered either on the radio or at the cash register .
3. Jerry Lee Lewis
Some might say it 's hardly shocking behavior for someone from the Deep South to marry their 13 - year - old first cousin ( once removed ) like the " Whole Lotta Shakin ' Goin ' On " singer did in 1958 .
But once the news broke , the Killer was blacklisted from American Bandstand and his appearance fee was slashed .
It took a full decade before Lewis became a regular chart presence again , this time with country hits like " What Made Milwaukee Famous , " " Another Place , Another Time " and " She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye . "
2. Chuck Berry
Who knew the man whose only No. 1 hit of his entire career was " My Ding - a - Ling " might have a few bizarre sexual peccadilloes ?
The employees of Berry 's Southern Air restaurant outside St. Louis might have had a clue when they discovered the godfather of Keith Richards , Angus Young and every other rock and roll guitarist worth a lick had set up some hidden cameras in the women 's restroom because , apparently , he got off on watching ladies pee .
( And , according to one of the greatest underground videos in rock history , also peeing on them . )
Berry settled out of court and settled down , and now plays a weekly gig at St. Louis ' Blueberry Hill nightclub .
1. Neil Young
Neil Young was not a particularly happy guy in the ' 80s .
Less than 18 months after signing to Geffen records in 1982 , in a contract that included the elusive " creative freedom " clause , the label filed suit against its artist , calling his work " not commercial " and " musically uncharacteristic of previous recordings . "
Instead of delivering something along the lines of Harvest , which is no doubt what label boss David Geffen had in mind , Young turned in a stylistic hodgepodge of albums .
First came the Kraftwerk - inspired Trans - which , in Young 's defense , also grew out of his attempts to use computers to communicate with his quadriplegic son Ben - and then rockabilly throwaway Everybody 's Rockin ' ( the album that prompted the suit ) and New Wave / arena - rock mess Landing On Water .
All parties eventually made up and Young moved to Reprise Records , where he released the excellent Freedom , Ragged Glory and Harvest Moon - albums that also sound a lot more like the Neil Young everybody knew and loved .
FAA Ends Ban on Depressed Pilots in Cockpits
New guideliness allow depressed pilots to return to the cockpit after a hiatus .
April 2 , 2010  --
Pilots taking medication for mild or moderate depression will soon be allowed in the cockpit under new Federal Aviation Administration guidelines that reverse a nearly 70 - year ban .
Clinically depressed pilots , including those undergoing therapy or prescription treatment , are currently prohibited from flying .
The policy change , which takes effect Monday , was sparked by reduced risk of antidepressant side effects , such as drowsiness , and a need to " change the culture and remove the stigma " associated with the illness , said FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt .
It 's also an attempt to get active pilots who need treatment or are already using antidepressants in violation of FAA rules to come clean , making the skies safer in the process .
" In the interest of safety we would much rather have them in a program that 's monitored and we know what they 're doing , " Babbitt said , comparing the initiative to one that targeted alcohol abuse among pilots several years ago .
But allowing pilots who take antidepressants to legally fly an airplane comes with strings attached .
Under the new rules , pilots will be restricted to one of four FAA - approved antidepressants -- Prozac , Zoloft , Celexa and Lexapro -- and required to see a psychiatrist every six months .
Pilots currently taking psychiatric medication will have a six month grace period to admit use and may be grounded temporarily while doctors assess their condition .
Those who want to start antidepressant use , however , will be grounded for a full year , until stabilization on the drugs is confirmed .
Antidepressants can sometimes cause fatigue , insomnia , blurred vision , dizziness , and agitation , according to the Mayo Clinic .
" A year seemed the right thing , and I 'm trusting that all the medical advice that we 've gotten tells us that 's the right thing to do , " Babbitt said of the decision to keep medicated pilots under observation for 12 months .
Pilots who suffer a heart attack or undergo cardiac surgery must wait 6 months before returning to work .
Some experts say the 12 month hiatus is excessive , costing pilots in terms of wages and valuable experience -- and creating a potentially compelling reason for depressed pilots to stay under the radar .
" Pilots are going to take a huge personal sacrifice to acknowledge being depressed and getting treatment , " said Dr. Charles Raison , a psychiatry professor at Emory University School of Medicine .
" So I think what 's going to happen as a result ... is pilots who become depressed are going to be anxious about coming forward , " he said .
" They 're going to fly when they 're depressed -- and that is something that does worry me . "
Symptoms of major depression , which can be highly debilitating , include increased irritability , insomnia , slowed thinking , decreased concentration , fatigue , trouble making decisions , and suicidal thoughts .
Dr. Gary Miller , an FAA - certified aviation medical examiner , suggested Raison 's concern is not entirely unfounded .
" My sense is that most people are honest about [ disclosing their medical conditions ] , but you might get a slightly different opinion for a pilot with an air carrier who 's invested 20 years in a career there , " he said .
FAA Insists Public Safe on Planes With Depressed , Medicated Pilots
Babbitt told ABC
News he expects pilots will embrace the program , and at least initially pilots groups have been supportive of the change .
" The Air Line Pilots Association supports a change in FAA policy on antidepressant medications , " the group said in a statement .
But " we are currently reviewing the FAA 's new policy proposal and will comment accordingly . "
" Our recommendation was six months [ grounded observation ] , " said Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association spokesman Chris Dancy , " but we 're comfortable with the 12 months because it does lay out a path that can get [ pilots ] back into flying . "
Babbitt believes the new policy will also reassure the general public regarding safety .
" People that are in this program are going to be carefully monitored as they go forward , " he said .
" This is not just a one - stop -- you get this and go on and nobody pays attention . "
Medical experts for the most part agree .
Second - generation antidepressants , including the four drugs approved by the FAA , are widely believed not to pose risks of sedation or impair cognitive ability .
" I have not seen studies showing that the newer generation of antidepressants affect reaction time to the point where it would affect [ a pilot 's ] flying abilities , " said Dr. Murali Doraiswamy , chief of biological psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center .
" Most people that [ have depression ] are very debilitated by their condition … they describe it as a ' black fog , ' an ' anchor ' weighing them down , " said Doraiswamy .
And for many people , " from college professors to airplane pilots to machinery operators and CIA officers , " antidepressants can improve quality of life and job performance .
There were more than 600,000 licensed pilots in the U.S. in 2008 , according to the FAA .
124,000 fly commercial planes .
By law , pilots are annually required to answer questions about their health , including arrests and convictions for alcohol , and can face penalties for perjury , including revocation of their licenses .
Pilots are forbidden from using narcotics , medication for seizures , anxiety conditions and stimulants , according to an FAA spokeswoman .
They 're also barred flying after taking over - the - counter medication that might make them drowsy , such as Benadryl or NyQuil .
Under the new rules , depressed pilots consulting a therapist or psychologist instead of taking medication will remain barred from flying while in treatment .
Australian and Canadian aviation guidelines already allow some pilots to fly while taking antidepressant medication .
More than 10 percent of the U.S. population take antidepressants , according to a 2009 Columbia University study , making the drugs the most commonly prescribed class of medication in the country .
How times have changed .
Most of you are probably crying the eternal blues these days , courtesy of the sagging economy .
Of course there are some of you who could n’t be doing better .
How much better and whom exactly are we talking about ?
Well , let ’s all find out kids …
From Bloomberg :
Liberty Helicopters Inc. is offering to fly weary commuters from New Jersey to Manhattan for about $ 200 a day , saving them 14 hours in traffic a week and signaling that Wall Street may have seen the worst of the recession .
Interesting , Bloomberg is canceling travel vouchers for school students while these guys are more than happy to fork over $ 200 to get to work in a timely matter .
Is there something wrong with this picture or are we just to ignore it and accept it as another sign that money will always save a Wall Street trader ’s day ?
Continues the report :
Liberty has already been approached by 150 potential clients after about a month of advertising , Patrick Day , a pilot and vice president of charter marketing , said in an interview in the cabin of a twin - engine Dauphin at the carrier ’s base in Linden , New Jersey .
The interest may reflect how far Wall Street has bounced back , said Robert Grotell , an independent transportation consultant in Port Jefferson , New York .
Yes , and what a bounce back !
Was n’t it so long ago that these guys were begging for us to bail them out and now that they are in position of power again are they particularly interested in bailing us out ?
With all that excess money floating around , one has to wonder what is really going on and for whom ’s benefit as a society we really go to bat for .
One wonders if you can afford $ 200 to take a helicopter to work you if can afford to give back to society so that perhaps a child can be given the type of chance you were once given .
Of course this is Wall st and you can hardly expect these creatures to reciprocate unless their backs are suddenly pushed back to the wall …
So much for an equitable society …

Yet , even in this neighborhood , Qatar stands out .
According to the International Association for the Study of Obesity , Qatar ranks sixth globally for prevalence of obesity and has the highest rate of obesity among boys in the Middle East and North African region .
A recent article in the Qatari newspaper Al Watan said that local health experts predicted that within five years , 73 percent of Qatari women and 69 percent of the men would qualify as obese .
Obesity is considered the most important factor in the development of diabetes and is a prime contributor to many other ailments , like hypertension .
The International Diabetes Federation ranks Qatar fifth globally in terms of the proportion of people aged 20 to 79 with diabetes .
The March of Dimes Foundation , a United States charity that focuses on trying to wipe out birth defects , listed Qatar as 16th globally for the incidence of birth defects per 1,000 live births .
The chief cause of the problem in Qatar is consanguineous marriages , experts here said .
Saudi Arabia ranked second globally .

For all of these challenges , and for all of its wealth , Qatar has primarily focused on the treatment of diseases rather than on prevention .
Everyone here points to lifestyle and tradition to explain the nation ’s health crises .
While it was once taboo to talk about the problems involved with marrying relatives , they are now talked about openly .
There have been some discussions about premarital genetic screening , or genetic testing done at birth .
But the tradition is so strong , no one has raised the prospect of curbing it .
“ You ca n’t tackle the issue , ” said Moza al - Malki , a family therapist and writer .
“ There are some big families , clans , they do n’t marry outside the family .
They wo n’t allow it . ”
When the Ministry of Defence first came across Wikileaks , staffers were stunned .
" There are thousands of things on here , I literally mean thousands , " one of them wrote in an internal email in November 2008 .
" Everything I clicked on to do with MoD was restricted ... it is huge . "
The website , an online clearing house for documents whose authors would generally prefer them to stay in the private domain , has since been banned from the MoD 's internal computers , but it did no good : eventually , that email ended up on Wikileaks .
And when a US Army counter - intelligence officer recommended that whistleblowers who leaked to the site be fired , that report ended up on Wikileaks too .
The authorities were right to be worried .
If any further proof were needed of the website 's extraordinary record in holding the authorities to account , it came this week , in the release of shocking video footage of a gung - ho US helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 12 people , including two unarmed employees of the Reuters news agency .
The US government had resisted Freedom of Information requests from Reuters for years .
But when an anonymous whistleblower passed the video on to Wikileaks , all that quickly became futile .
An edited version of the tape had received almost 4 million hits on YouTube by last night , and it led news bulletins around the world .
" This might be the story that makes Wikileaks blow up , " said Sree Sreenivasan , a digital media professor at New York 's Columbia Journalism School .
" It 's not some huge document with lots of fine print – you can just watch it and you get what it 's about immediately .
It 's a whole new world of how stories get out . "
And yet despite Wikileaks ' commitment to the freedom of information , there is something curiously shadowy about the organisation itself .
Founded , as the group 's spokesman Daniel Schmitt ( whose surname is a pseudonym ) put it , with the intention of becoming " the intelligence agency of the people " , the site 's operators and volunteers – five full - timers , and another 1,000 on call – are almost all anonymous .
Ironically , the only way the group 's donors are publicly known is through a leak on Wikileaks itself .
The organisation 's most prominent figure is Julian Assange , an Australian hacker and journalist who co-founded the site back in 2006 .
While Assange and his cohorts ' intentions are plainly laudable – to " allow whistleblowers and journalists who have been censored to get material out to the public " , as he told the BBC earlier this year – some ask who watches the watchmen .
" People have to be very careful dealing with this information , " says Professor Sreenivasan .
" It 's part of the culture now , it 's out there , but you still need context , you still need analysis , you still need background . "
Against all of that criticism , Wikileaks can set a record that carries , as Abu Dhabi's The National put it , " more scoops in its short life than The Washington Post has in the past 30 years " .
By earning its place as the natural destination for anyone with sensitive information to leak who does not know and trust a particular journalist – so far , despite numerous court actions , not a single source has been outed – Wikileaks has built up a remarkable record .
Yes , it has published an early draft of the script for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , and Wesley Snipes ' tax returns ; but it has also published the " Climategate " emails , an internal Trafigura report on toxic dumping in Ivory Coast , and the standard operating procedures for Guantanamo Bay .
Whatever the gaps in its procedures , there is little doubt that the website is at the forefront of a new information era in which the powerful , corrupt and murderous will have to feel a little more nervous about their behaviour .
" There are reasons I do it that have to do with wanting to reform civilisation , " Assange said in an interview with salon.com last month .
" Of course , there 's a personal psychology to it , that I enjoy crushing bastards .
I like a good challenge . "
Full disclosure :
What we would n't know without Wikileaks
Trafigura 's super - injunction
When commodities giant Trafigura used a super - injunction to suppress the release of an internal report on toxic dumping in the Ivory Coast in newspapers , it quickly appeared on Wikileaks instead .
Accepting that the release made suppression futile , Trafigura lifted the injunction .
The CRU's ' Climategate ' leak
Emails leaked on the site showed that scientists at the UK's Climate Research Unit , including director Phil Jones , withheld information from sceptics
The BNP membership list
After the site published the BNP 's secret membership list in November 2008 , newspapers found teachers , priests and police officers among them .
Another list was leaked last year .
The police has since barred officers from membership .
Sarah Palin's emails
SCOTT SUMNER quotes Stefan Karlsson :
I have frequently discussed how growth in the Australian economy is driven by rising commodity prices .
There is however another factor driving growth , namely high population growth .
Australia 's population grew by 2.1 % in the year ending September 2009 , a lot higher than in most other advanced economies ( typically population growth is less than 1 % , and even negative in for example Germany and Japan ) .
This has a particularly positive effect on the housing sector , which continues its long boom , despite high prices and interest rates that are higher than in most other countries .
As this article points out , the rapid population growth has contributed to a housing shortage , something which implies that both construction activity and house prices will continue to increase .
A long time ago , I mused on the possibility of a migratory stimulus , in which workers leaving bubble markets for places with better prospects caused housing and labour markets in the destination cities to tighten , supporting new investment and touching off recovery .
Of course , you could also take things in a different direction .
Ed Glaeser has written that because housing is durable , its supply does not adjust with broader economic decline and out - migration .
And so in cities like Detroit , you have a constant housing supply with a falling population , which leads to steady declines in home prices .
These declines lead , in turn , to underinvestment , which continues the cycle of decline .
One way to avoid this problem , then , might be to destroy surplus housing , in order to artificially tighten housing markets ( and reduce the fiscal burden on local governments of maintaining underused infrastructure ) .
Mr Sumner takes yet a different direction , connecting the decline in asset prices in 2007 with reduced expectations for housing demand growth , associated with tighter restrictions on immigration .
And obviously some pundits have argued that America should grant a visa to any would - be immigrant willing to purchase a home in the inland empire .
A broader point would be that population growth seems to be an advantage in getting through and out of deep recessions , particularly where liquidity traps are concerned .
One has only to think of the Japanese example , relative to the experience in Australia ( or America ) to see this in action .
Like many red- blooded American teens coming of age during the 1960s space race , Franklin Chang - Diaz dreamed of chasing cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to the stars .
There was a hitch , of course .
Chang - Diaz was n't American .
He lived outside the United States .
And the Costa Rican did n't even speak English .
No matter .
Chang - Diaz would overcome these obstacles and more to fly a record - tying seven missions aboard the space shuttle .
Along the way the physicist would also develop a plasma rocket that promises a revolutionary approach to spaceflight .
The rocket , potentially , could blast the next generation of astronauts to Mars in just 39 days , about one fifth of the time required by existing rocketry .
At a time when much of Houston 's space community is openly hostile to President Barack Obama 's desire to remake NASA 's human spaceflight program , Chang - Diaz , 60 , is among those welcoming it .
“ Even though this transition is very strong medicine , and it is being applied at a very awkward moment , it is the right thing to do , ” he said .
From his perspective , if humans are ever to venture substantially beyond Earth 's moon , they 'll need advanced propulsion systems to do so .
And the sooner NASA begins reinvesting in them — funding for advanced propulsion dried up in 2005 when money was diverted into the Constellation program to build conventional rockets to send astronauts back to the moon
— the better , says Chang - Diaz , whose Clear Lake rocket company , Ad Astra , could profit from such a change .
On Thursday , in a speech to promote his space policy plans , Obama confirmed that it will take new technologies for NASA to explore deeper into the solar system .
“ We 've got to do it in a smart way , ” he said at Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
“ We can't keep doing the same old things as before . ”
One - way ticket to U.S .
Chang - Diaz 's story begins in a San José bank , where he worked as a teller after graduating from high school to scrabble together enough money to come to the United States .
After nine months Chang - Diaz had saved $ 50 and convinced his dad , a construction foreman , to buy him a one - way ticket to America .
In 1968 he arrived in Hartford , Conn. , to stay with distant relatives .
Not speaking English , he enrolled in a local high school to learn the language and , in time , apply to college .
“ Of course it was a disaster , ” Chang - Diaz recalled .
“ The first marking period I failed everything .
But from being at the bottom I began to improve , and towards the end of the year I was near the top of the class . ”
So promising a student was he that Chang - Diaz earned a partial scholarship to the University of Connecticut .
He sailed through college and , later , graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , studying mechanical engineering and physics , with an interest in plasma , an electrically charged gas that responds to electromagnetic fields .
By 1979 , Chang - Diaz was a citizen , and NASA was seeking scientists for its new space shuttle program .
In 1980 , he became NASA 's first Hispanic astronaut , moved to Houston , and six years later launched aboard Columbia .
“ I flew on all of the space shuttles , ” he said .
“ I flew on Mir . I flew on the International Space Station .
I just got to experience everything .
Having come from a little country in Central America , sometimes it 's amazing for me to even believe . ”
How to get to Mars
Yet even as he flew into orbit , Chang was wondering how to get to Mars .
Between flight training he built a research team to begin work on a plasma rocket , drawing upon NASA engineers and scientists from across the country .
At their essence , rockets are simple : the higher the temperature of the gas shot out the back , the faster the gas and rocket go .
Plasmas get hotter than conventional chemical rocket fuel , allowing plasma rockets to go faster on much less fuel .
Over the past three decades , Change - Diaz 's group worked on a rocket that could convert hydrogen to a plasma , confine it with a magnetic field and then heat it with radio waves .
From 1993 to 2005 he did so as director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center .
Then came Constellation , a program also managed in Houston .
“ NASA decided to cancel all of its advanced propulsion and power programs in order to finance Constellation , which basically was a repeat of the Apollo program , ” Chang - Diaz said .
“ So we were going to do the Constellation Program and go to the moon .
Then what ?
You ca n't go to Mars with the Constellation hardware . ”
Chang - Diaz decided to leave NASA after 25 years , taking with him his Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ( VASIMR ) technology .
He formed the Ad Astra corporation in Webster .
His agreement with NASA allowed him to continue developing his rocket with private funding .
He has raised tens of millions of dollars .
Since he left NASA , Chang - Diaz has quadrupled his VASIMR rocket 's output to 200 kilowatts , a level sufficiently powerful to propel a spacecraft .
Testing by 2014
If the company can overcome the technological challenges , Chang - Diaz has a deal with NASA to fly his rocket on the space station by early 2014 , testing it in space and possibly using its thrust to re-boost the station 's altitude .
“ It 's an exciting technology , ” said Mike Suffredini , manager of NASA 's space station program .
“ Testing this kind of thing is exactly what the space station is up there for . ”
If successful , Chang - Diaz sees a wealth of possibilities for VASIMR , including the refueling , repair and re-boosting of thousands of satellites orbiting Earth .
Mars remains a distant but tangible goal , requiring a more powerful , larger engine .
Perhaps the biggest challenge is the cumulative radiation exposure for astronauts during long travels in deep space .
“ All of a sudden we are at the right place at the right time , ” Chang - Diaz said .
“ The whole premise that created the company in the first place five years ago is playing out .
We 're providing a more mature technology to NASA , and they have n't paid a dime . ”

There 's a saying in politics that goes : " Oppositions do n't win elections , governments lose them , " and it seems particularly apt when applied to the current version of the Liberal party of Canada .
Last weekend , the Liberals hosted a " non-partisan " forum called Canada at 150 : Rising to the challenge , designed to address goals for Canada to meet by its 150th birthday in 2017 .
Unfortunately for them , the most interesting speaker , diplomat Robert Fowler , was hardly very kind to his hosts .
In fact , Fowler was rather harsh – and at times , rightly so .
The special UN envoy to Niger ( who was kidnapped in the summer of 2008 by the Islamic Maghreb , an organisation linked to al - Qaida , and released almost a year later ) took the Liberals to task , stating that the party has not only " lost its way " , but also " lost its soul " .
And as much as some of Fowler 's speech might have been contentious , his attack on the state of the Liberal party could n't have been more cogent .
Fowler itemised his discontent , calling the Liberals out on what he felt was a seemingly rudderless attempt at taking control in Ottawa by being willing to " endorse anything and everything which might return them to power and nothing which wo n't – whatever the merits of either " .
The criticism could n't have come at a more uncomfortable time for the Liberals .
In the week leading up to the Canada at 150 conference , the Liberals tried to smoke out the Conservative government 's stance on abortion , asking it to allow " a full range of reproductive services " for mothers in the developing world within its upcoming maternal health proposal to the G8 .
The motion failed miserably , thanks mostly to the 13 Liberal MPs who did n't show up to vote .
The debacle fell directly on the shoulders of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff , suggesting that he has no clear idea of the makeup of his own party .
But Ignatieff 's endlessly frustrating run as leader of the Liberal party is only part of the overall scrambling feeling that has started to emanate from Canada 's " natural governing party " .
Since they became the official opposition in 2006 , the Liberals have made their way through two party leaders and watched their coveted centrist ground be taken over by a savvy Conservative marketing machine .
Now Ignatieff has managed to grind the party into a point of perpetual stasis , despite presiding over two contentious prorogations by the prime minister , Stephen Harper , a deepening crisis over possible Afghan detainee torture , and a federal environmental policy that has been widely criticised by many in the international community .
The fact that the Conservatives also can't seem to be able to pull away in the polls is arguably equally frustrating to the Liberals , as it suggests that they would stand a chance if there were to be an election .
Though tantalising , that assumption might be incorrect .
If an election were to be called , the Liberals , lacking an equally assertive , finely tuned , practised contrary talking point machine to that of the Tories , would quickly find themselves out of step in a critical first campaign week .
What they can't seem to develop , and what Fowler alluded to is a recognisable character .
For all the Conservative government 's faults , they are a party with a palpable message .
Right now the only message coming from the Liberal camp is disorganisation .
This does n't mean that all is lost for the Liberals .
Their proximity in the polls , and Harper 's minority government are both telling : Canadians are n't entirely sold on the Tories .
In his speech , Fowler suggested that the Liberal party return to its roots , founded on principles of social conscience .
In that , he was absolutely correct .
More importantly , as Ignatieff awkwardly showcased last week , the Liberals will not find success in simple political posturing designed to wrong - foot the government , but on the actual desires of Canadians .
They must focus on regaining the centrist ground that they have allowed the Tories to nominally occupy , lest it disappear forever .
To do that , they need less grand scheming in favour of smaller ideas built around sensible programmes that speak to a party meta- narrative – something they currently lack .
Political policy ideas , great though they may be , are useless without a concrete context or party ideology into which they can fit .
In the end , it 's simple : rather than trying to win , the Liberals must force the Tories to lose .
At least 32 black Republicans are running for Congress this year , a post -Reconstruction record , The New York Times reports , with several well - positioned to become the first black GOP congressmen since Oklahoma's J.C. Watts retired in 2003 .
While some Party leaders and candidates credit Obama for proving that white voters will support black contenders , African - American talk - show host Tavis Smiley notes wryly that the last " Year of the Black Republican " — 2006 — " fizzled out . "
Has Obama 's victory ushered in a renaissance for black Republicans ?
( Watch a Christian Broadcasting Network report about black conservatives )
This is about Obama 's incompetence , not his precedent :
There 's a reason several of these conservative black candidates have " enthusiastic Tea Party support , " says Ed Morrissey in Hot Air .
They 're in sync with the movement on fiscal and national security policy , and in their desire to oust Obama .
This should finally kill the " increasingly desperate " media " fiction " that conservative opposition to Obama is driven by racism .
" NYT discovers record number of black Republicans running for Congress "
Running is n't winning :
Here 's the problem , says Dan Amira at New York Magazine .
Only five of the 32 black candidates have even a shot at getting elected , according to GOP leaders .
Obama built a winning coalition , but black Republicans " ca n't count on the support of black Democrats , or of white Republicans , who , as the Times puts gently , ' sometimes do not welcome ' blacks . "
" Obama inspires black people to run for Congress as Republicans "
Blacks should cheer this development :
For those wondering if this windfall of minority candidates is " straight from the playbook of cynical and condescending politics , " says Michael Arceneaux in AOL News , " fret not . "
Judging from recent remarks by National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Paul Lindsay , " Republican leadership had nothing to do with it . "
Only one of the key black hopefuls is getting national - party financial assistance .
Still , perhaps the GOP will finally realize they need to be " inclusive . "
" GOP 's long road to winning back minorities "
Question : with legal remedies exhausted , will the Cuban Five be forgotten ?
Answer : Never , as long as Gerardo , Ramón , Antonio , Fernando and René are not free .
Had Sacco and Vanzetti gone free , they might have been forgotten .
The state executed them , and because of injustice , they are remembered 82 years later .
Cuban National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon used the title “ Please , Read the Transcripts ” for his most recent condemnation of the injustice done the Cuban Five .
Those were the words of a jurist advocating for Sacco and Vanzetti .
Alarcon says the Cuban Five , innocent of the major charges against them , were arrested and prosecuted because they knew about Miami terrorists ’ plots and deeds against Cuba .
These groups also were “ accustomed to kill and to threaten people also in Miami . ”
Alarcon sees as the root cause of the injustice collusion between the U.S. government and the terrorists .
Washington , intent upon protecting the status quo , had an interest in railroading the Cuban Five .
Alarcon knows this by perusal of court documents .
One shows the US District Attorney offering a pretrial motion that requests the court to exclude certain defense evidence , specifically : “ The fight against terrorism is the motivation of the accused and motivation should not be aired in front of the jury . ”
Later during the trial , prosecutors made another motion before the Judge Joan Lenard : “ The court is strongly advised that witnesses exercise their right to base [ testimony ] on the Fifth Amendment so that terrorist activities against Cuba are not made public . ”
And Judge Lenard agreed , according to the record ; “ The terrorist acts by others cannot excuse the wrongful and illegal conduct of this defendant or any other . ”
One court document cited by Alarcon explicitly confirmed a federal judge ’s concern that local terrorists not be meddled with .
Sentencing one of the Five , Lenard ordered that on release from prison “ the defendant is prohibited from associating with or visiting specific places where individuals or groups such as terrorists are known to be or frequent . ”
Ongoing media frenzy at the time of the trial over the Elian Gonzalez case contributed to injustice by burying facts relating to terrorism and a skewed judicial process .
Media silence , of course , continues , Alarcon as has repeatedly pointed out .
So the injustice lives on , and the Cuban Five are remembered .
And the worldwide solidarity movement on their behalf remains strong .
This month , for example , a multifaceted cultural exhibit unfolded in Las Palmas , Canary Islands , at a gathering of European and North American lawyers and jurists to discuss the Five .
Displayed at a large hotel were signed reproductions of paintings by Cuban supporters of the Five and posters , cartoons , and caricatures about the prisoners .
Cuban films were shown , and Cuban singer Marta Campos gave a concert .
The art came “ from the length and breadth of the planet , from Madrid to Kiev and Stockholm , from the United States itself to Mexico and Argentina , ” according to rebelion.org .
The assembled lawyers heard from colleague Inés Miranda , who represents Aminettou Haidar , emblematic advocate for Western Saharan independence from Morocco .
Speaking of the trial of the Five , Miranda declared , “ There was no just and impartial jury , nor was there due process in this case , in which principles , norms , and international agreements essential for the administration of justice were violated . ”
In January , from the top of Mt Aconcagua in Argentina , the so - called “ roof of America , ” three mountaineers unfurled a banner saying : “ Obama , Liberate the five Cuban heroes now ! ” Multi-national Latin American gatherings , notably the recent founding congress of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States , have echoed that call . .
However , Cuban Five Prisoner Rene Gonzalez , interviewed recently by the BBC , set one big condition for undoing the injustice visited upon him and the others .
“ My generation grew up witnessing years of aggression coming from the US , ” he explained .
“ We ’re talking about terrorism , bombings , shootings – so my generation understands very well that we have the right to defend Cuba . ”
He believes , “ Nobody in Cuba would agree to any re-establishing of normal relations with a country that has five of their sons in jail for defending the country . ”

Background
I am no stranger to the iPhone .
I was working as a Mac Genius In - Training when the original iPhone was released .
I got my first iPhone 6 weeks after they were released .
A year later , I upgraded to the 3G when it was released , and then again to the 3GS last summer .
I ’ve spent more money than I care to think about in third - party apps .
So why did I give it up ?
Well …
Growing Tired
After owning the 3GS for several months , I started to grow tired of the whole experience .
The 3GS is no doubt the best iteration of Apple ’s hardware , but it looks and feels like the models before it .
More importantly , the iPhone OS seems … stagnant .
OS 3 and OS 1 have more in common than they differ from each other .
Even with the addition of push notifications and third - party apps , the iPhone OS has n’t evolved that much .
On a slightly different front , I was also tired of the endless Update / Jailbreak cycle that I — like many others — had fallen into .
Keeping my iPhone the way I wanted to was becoming a hassle .
After almost 3 years , I was ready for a change .
Why the Droid ?
When I purchased it in January , the Motorola Droid was the top dog when it came to Android devices .
The Nexus One had been announced , but just for T - Mobile , which I was n’t thrilled about .
Do n’t get me wrong , the Nexus One is a slick phone , but until it shows up on Verizon , the Droid is their best handset .
My dad has the HTC Hero on Cellular South , and after spending some time with it , I was n’t a big fan of HTC ’s Sense UI .
On an older device like the Hero , it seems to slow down over time , and it holds up updates from being pushed out to customers .
I ’m pretty set against owning a skinned Android device .
When Motorola and Verizon started marketing the Droid , they aimed squarely at geeks .
It worked .
This phone is n’t pretty , light or sexy .
It ’s rough , dark and chunky .
It ’s the phone that Batman would use , without a doubt .
I like the hardware keyboard and the design .
The Nexus One may be hot , but the Droid looks like it could beat up any other phone on the market .
Why not WebOS ?
When I bought my phone , WebOS devices were only on Sprint .
I looked at the Palm Pre and I liked what I saw software - wise .
While they are n’t a ton of apps out there for WebOS , the core apps I needed were .
Palm has a killer mobile OS .
The way it multitasks and integrates multiple cloud services is very slick , and it looks downright beautiful .
Sadly , their hardware is lackluster .
The Pre is far better than the Pixi , but it still feels cheap and rather breakable .
Now that the Pre Plus is on Verizon , it is a harder choice , but I the Droid still wins in my book .
Now , if Palm ever releases a device that is closer to an iPhone , hardware - wise , it would be hard for me to ignore it .
AT&T vs. Verizon
I know that comparing one cellular network to another is a tricky thing to do .
And while the general censuses is that Verizon ’s network is better and more robust that AT&T ’s , I have to agree .
While Verizon ’s 3G does n’t seem as fast as AT&T ’s ( of course , that might be due to differences between the iPhone 3GS and the Droid ) , I get better coverage with Verizon in the places I visit in the course of a normal day .
As AT&T has highlighted in their ads , Verizon ’s network is like AT&T ’s older EDGE network , in that browsing is n’t possible while on the phone .
I had gotten used to being on the phone and looking information up online with my iPhone 3G and 3GS , and I miss it on the Droid .
Verizon ’s plans are usually a little bit more expensive than AT&T’s , but I love the flexibility they offer .
I can go online and add or remove features from my plan , without adding time to my contract .
The Good , the Bad & the Ugly
The flexibility of Android is amazing .
It ’s really what drew me to the platform more than anything .
Do n’t like the software keyboard ?
You can replace it .
Do n’t like the home screen ?
Use another program to arrange your icons .
Every nook and cranny of the OS can be tinkered with .
Of course , when people compare the iPhone to Android , two things are always mentioned : the openness of Android , and the ability to run apps in the background .
Indeed , the ability to run 3rd party apps is great , but comes with a price .
I ’ve found it ’s pretty easy to blow up my Droid while playing with system - level applications .
It ’s the same story when it comes to running applications in the background .
It ’s nice when I want it , but things can get out of hand .
But the ability to run PDANet , listen to music and check email at the same time is pretty slick .
But that ’s the beauty of Android : the developers leave it up the end user .
If I want to burn through my battery in three hours by having 14 apps running at once , I can .
It ’s up to me — and that ’s very appealing .
I do suffer iPhone withdraws from time to time .
Android is rough .
It does some things in weird , awkward ways .
For example , copy and paste simply sucks on the Droid .
Text - correcting is painful without sliding open the keyboard and using the D - Pad .
The apps are n’t as polished , and there are n’t as many apps .
And do n’t even get my started on the awful , awful camera on this thing .
It ’s useless .
Fragmentation is a huge problem with Android .
Right now , the Droid is the # 2 phone in the Android universe , so I do n’t run into issues .
But as my phone ages , I expect to be left out of more and more features .
Hopefully the rumor that all phones will get upgraded to 2.1 will ease these concerns .
The update has been due “ soon ” for the Droid for months now .
In Closing
Despite the issues , I love my Droid .
I like that I do n’t carry the same phone 90 % of people my age carry .
I like exploring the Internet for third - party apps I can install without jailbreaking my phone .
I like that PDANet is available on the App Market — no shady business required .
The notification system is quietly brilliant .
All - in - all , Android is a very capable platform with a bright future .
While time will tell what I do when my current contract ends , for now , I ’m really happy with the Droid .
For anyone who drinks diet soda or knows someone who does , this is news not to miss : Scientists have discovered that we have taste receptors in our stomach and intestines , according to Science News .
In same the way that tastebuds send signals to pump saliva , chew , and swallow , gut taste cells help the body ramp up for digestion .
“ When the gut ’s taste sensors encounter something sweet , they send a ‘ prepare for fuel ’ missive that results in cranked - up insulin levels in the blood , ” the biweekly reports .
Insulin signals the body to draw glucose from the blood and store it in the muscles and liver .
Except when the sweetener is artificial , the body gets all ready and then there ’s no energy to harvest .
This is nascent research and more investigation will certainly come .
But the discovery could shed light on recent studies that demonstrated a seemingly perplexing association between drinking diet beverages and developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes .
As Science News concludes :
So beware those little white lies .
Thousands of years of evolution have yielded a finely tuned digestive machine , one that recognizes incoming energy and knows how to make the most of it .
These intricate chains of events evolved during a time when that sweet zing reliably indicated food rich in valuable calories .
And for thousands of years , the gut reacted appropriately .
Perhaps that adage “ trust your gut ” should be accompanied with another edict : “ Tell it no lies . ”

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 8/4/2010 ( 3828 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
TWO of Winnipeg 's worst car thieves thought they 'd pulled a fast one by cutting off their electronic ankle bracelets and tossing them from the window of a speeding , stolen car .
Turns out the joke was on them -- one of the devices somehow flew into the backseat , without their knowledge , providing police a direct link to their location .
" If you even so much as bend one of these bracelets the wrong way , an alert will send , " Crown attorney Liz Laite told court Thursday of the December 2009 incident .
" In this case , the police knew these two were together , and exactly where they were . "
Members of the stolen auto unit were able to communicate with the monitoring company , based out of Atlanta , and captured the pair after a dangerous , high - speed chase ended with plenty of damage but no injuries in Elmwood .
The 18 - year - old passenger of the stolen Ford Fusion pleaded guilty Thursday to several charges stemming from his role in the incident and was given a two - year prison sentence under a joint - recommendation from Crown and defence lawyers .
The Free Press is not publishing his name in order to include details about his extensive criminal past as a youth , which would otherwise be protected by law .
This incident is his first adult conviction .
" He is a danger to society .
The public has to be protected from him , " said Laite .
" You hope at some point the light will go on for him and he will realize this is ridiculous .
Otherwise he 's going to end up doing a life sentence on the installment plan . "
The young man has numerous car theft convictions as a teen and is a Level 4 offender , which is the most serious designation given by police .
He is a friend of three infamous Winnipeg brothers , who have racked up hundreds of convictions over the years and are deemed among the " worst car thieves in Canada , " said Laite .
In fact , the 17 - year - old brother was allegedly behind the wheel of the Fusion and remains before the courts .
Laite said they will be seeking an adult sentence against him if convicted .
His older brother is now an adult and serving time at Stony Mountain Institution , while his younger brother has become a regular visitor to the Manitoba Youth Centre .
The man , and the alleged driver of the vehicle , began their most recent crime spree by stealing an SUV .
They went to a residential neighbourhood and broke into three empty homes .
During the final break - in , the pair drove away with the victim 's Fusion .
They took the car for a spin and slashed their ankle bracelets while in motion , said Laite .
Police were alerted and tracked the vehicle to Kenaston Boulevard , where a brief chase ensued .
Officers had to call it off when speeds reached 100 km/h , said Laite .
Police tracked the vehicle again in the area of North Kildonan .
The driver was eventually boxed in by several police cars on Chalmers Avenue .

The green economy is growing , but slowly .
That ’s according to a report released by the Economics and Statistics Administration , a division of the Department of Commerce .
Green services and businesses amounted to just 1 to 2 percent of the private business economy in 2007 .
And there were 1.8 million to 2.4 million green jobs in 2007 , less than 2 percent of the total work force .
Still , three years have passed , and there are plenty of reasons to think that these numbers have since risen , said Mark Doms , the chief economist for the department .
“ There is a clear increased customer awareness of all things green , ” he said .
For example , there ’s the money made available recently through the Department of Energy for research in green technology and clean energy .
One report last year found that the Obama ’s administration ’s goal of having renewables provide 25 percent of the nation ’s energy by 2025 would translate into about 297,000 new jobs .
Marc Stoiber , vice president for green innovation at the Chicago - based business consultancy Maddock Douglas , said it was important to remember that jobs that might not fall under a green job classification might have strong green elements , given the drive for energy efficiency .
One of the great things about SEO is the almost scientific way the community approaches the unknown to discover something true that they can apply to their sites .
This applied to desktop SEO more than ever in the early 2000s , prior to SEOMoz ’s first ranking factors study , when pioneers in the field experimented with their web properties to see which changes would drive the most traffic , and eventually conversions .
While this still happens in desktop SEO , I think it happens more now in areas like video , mobile and social SEO , where SEOs are still trying to discover how non-web search behavior and search algorithms change — if they change at all — the practice of building content to drive the most users from search engines .
Knowing this , it ’s understandable that the myth of mobile sites as duplicate content has persisted the way it has , in spite of the evidence to the contrary .
For those unfamiliar with the concept , mobile SEO experts , who are often experts in desktop SEO who apply the same concepts to the mobile web , often say that mobile web sites should be considered duplicate content and should be blocked from being indexed by the desktop bot , while desktop versions of sites should be blocked from being indexed by the mobile bot .
As with duplicate content recommendations in general , the gist is that web site owners need to indicate which site is relevant to which bot to avoid having the wrong content suppressed when someone does a relevant search , or to avoid splitting your link popularity on what is essentially a duplicate version of your canonical page .
Makes sense in theory .
Here ’s where it falls apart .
If you enter the query [ facebook mobile ] on the desktop version of Google , on something other than a mobile device , you get m.facebook.com as the first result .
The same thing happens when you look for the mobile version of the other nine of Nielsen ’s top ten mobile web sites of 2009 .
In every case both the mobile and desktop versions of each web site are indexed in the “ web ” index , and they ’re returned when a user enters relevant queries .
They ’re not in the supplemental results , and they ’re not suppressed as duplicate content .
They ’re mobile sites , and they ’re returned for relevant queries .
This phenomenon has been in play for years , so I think the idea that mobile sites are duplicate content is really more myth than reality .
It ’s also unlikely , in my opinion , to change anytime soon , because the search engines , whose modus operandi is to return relevant content for relevant queries , get desktop and smartphone queries for mobile content .
If you consider some of the top navigational queries for the top ten Nielsen mobile sites of 2009 , you can see this phenomenon in action .
The query [ facebook mobile ] , to use the same example , gets about 368,000 queries per month from users of desktops ( and presumably smartphones ) according to Google keyword data .
If Google were to show the desktop site for this query just because the user was querying the search engine that used the desktop index , Google would not be showing relevant content for the query , and would not last very long as a search engine that people continued to find useful .
This is really a key difference from most types of desktop duplicate content , where a user is unlikely to request the variations of content that Google and other engines classify as duplicates .
Can you imagine someone searching for a specific session id page or a non -www version of a page ?
Let alone 368,000 of them per month ?
If the search engines relegated desktop content to the desktop index and mobile sites to the mobile index , they would not be able to return relevant content for relevant queries .
Knowing that search engines index and return mobile content for relevant queries , and that they have blended mobile ranking algorithms to rank mobile content for mobile queries and desktop content for desktop queries , it ’s clear to me that they do n’t treat mobile sites like traditional desktop duplicate content .
Knowing this , it ’s a wonder that many mobile SEO experts , including some whose opinions I generally respect , would continue to recommend blocking your mobile site from Googlebot and other “ web ” crawlers .
If you want maximum visibility for your mobile content , and to be truly optimized for mobile search , the best practice is to make it clear to the engines that you have a mobile site , optimize it for mobile queries and make it essential to mobile users , and then trust the engines to return it when they think it ’s relevant .
Do n’t block the mobile site from being returned in desktop or smartphone results , as it ’s relevant to more than just the search engine ’s mobile index .
To be fair , the search engines are in part to blame for this oft - recommended worst practice , as they have at one point called a certain type of mobile content duplicate content .
Prior to the iPhone ’s release , back when mobile content was something very different than it can be today , the Google webmaster Central blog called out “ forums that generate both regular and stripped - down mobile - targeted pages ” as duplicate content .
In spite of this , they have never ( to my knowledge ) recommended that you block all mobile content from desktop bots — only that you redirect mobile users properly if you choose to redirect them and that you block carrier - specific mobile content , which they do consider duplicate content .
This last recommendation has since been removed from Google ’s mobile webmaster guidelines , so I ca n’t link out to it , unfortunately .
Maybe someday Google and other engines will explain this in a way that is in accordance with their search results , but for now the way to get most visibility to your mobile content is to let it be returned by both mobile and desktop search .
If you really want to be optimized for mobile search , get out of the mindset that mobile content should even be considered duplicate content .
Granted , most sites are going to have smaller versions of their desktop content on their mobile sites , but if that ’s all you have you ’re not taking advantage of the unique properties of the mobile user experience .
At SMX
West this past March , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer talked about a new class of mobile - specific queries , and Google Analytics guru Avinash Kaushik talked about serving a mobile search experience with the Nexus One that most marketers have n’t even begun to consider .
Chances are , if you ’re only presenting your desktop content in a new format and excluding it from the web search engines , you ’re not considering the mobile user either , and probably are n’t optimized for mobile search .

Police are asking bystanders to come forward after a subway car full of passengers ignored the cries of a 79 - year - old man who was being mugged .
The robbery occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday , when the victim , Yusuf Hizel , was on an eastbound train along the Bloor - Danforth line .
According to Hizel , the confrontation began after a man , who was seated beside him , asked for change .
Hizel refused , but was then approached by another suspect who asked the same question .
When Hizel refused again , he got up to reach for the passenger - assistance alarm — the yellow strip located above the seats on all trains — and was then attacked .
Despite being held down as his wallet was taken , Hizel said none of the onlookers came to his rescue , even as he cried out for help .
“ People did n't have a reaction — they just looked at me , ” Hizel said .
“ I was frustrated . ”
Hizel got off the train and tried to chase down the suspects at Chester station , where a TTC ticket collector called the police .
His wallet was later found outside the station .
Investigators say it is unclear why none of the passengers came to the man 's help , but are appealing for the witnesses to speak to police .
They are also using security camera footage to piece together the identities of the suspects .
TTC spokesman Brad Ross reminded the public that the passenger - assistance alarm is silent when pressed .
It sounds an alarm only in the cabs of the guard and driver .
Transit control is also alerted so it can call police , he said .
“ We do encourage customers , if they see another customer or passenger in distress — whether it's a medical incident or a criminal occurrence — to press the yellow strip , ” said Ross .
TTC records show that nobody hit the alarm during Saturday 's incident .
Transit officials said snatch - and - grabs of iPods , cellphones and other items are common .
However , such a brazen attack on an elderly passenger is “ rare , ” Ross added .
While waiting at the Pape subway station platform Monday , many riders expressed shock that nobody came to Hizel 's rescue .
“ This leaves me speechless , ” said Andrew Hoehne , a regular TTC rider .
“ At six - foot - three , I do not feel nervous riding the subway any time of the day .
But it is disgusting that no one came to the old man 's aid while watching him being attacked . ”
Hizel says he is n't sure why he was targeted , but says he will never travel on the subway alone again .

A Chinese website calling themselves Apple.pro has published photos of what appears to be a partially assembled build of Apple 's next - generation iPhone in white .
The same website was also responsible for posting the front face plates of both the black and white iPhones a few days back .
A front - facing camera is evident in the second photo , but what 's not shown is the back of the device which should also be white if Apple stays true to its design standards .
There is still no confirmation that these devices in the images are the real deal .
Another report coming from the gang over at Boy Genius Report , reveals new iPhone menu screenshots from a " field test " purporting to confirm the use of 3G video conferencing .
All of these wild claims will come to light in a few short weeks when Apple is expected to unveil the 4G ( forth generation ) iPhone at their annual WWDC ( World Wide Developers Conference ) on June 7 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco .
In the immortal words of mister Tom Petty ; " The waiting is the hardest part . "
CALGARY - Calgary Flames president Ken King lavished praise on general manager Darryl Sutter Monday in a post - mortem news conference for the 2009 / 10 National Hockey League regular season .
The Flames missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years .
“ I think one of the reasons we ’ve enjoyed such a renaissance in popularity is due in no small part to the gentleman sitting next to me , ” King said , motioning to Sutter .
“ What he has done is help create a credible and competitive hockey environment , and we ’re grateful for that .
“ I know a lot of people in our city are as well . ”
Judging by letters to the newspaper , some fans are happy but many more are outraged and bewildered over how their hockey team could take such a dive into mediocrity — especially with big - name stars like Jarome Iginla , Jay Bouwmeester and Miikka Kiprusoff .
“ Charged with a responsibility to be accountable .
Darryl and I are going to — as we have every year — embark on a serious review and evaluation of our hockey operations , ” King said .
The review is expected to take two to three weeks .
Sutter said he has n’t been given any guarantee that he ’ll be the man in charge moving forward .
“ I think that ’s really not what ’s important , ” Sutter said .
“ The reason I ’ve been in the game as long as I have — and been as successful as I have — is because I do n’t base it on my own feelings .
There ’s nothing selfish in it , so it ’s really not an issue . ”
As for his body of work over the last seven years ?
“ I think it goes into the evaluations of the next two or three weeks , ” he said .
“ I have an analytical way of sorting that out and separating a lot of different issues . ”
So does he think this team is in good shape ?
“ I ’d rather we ’d be traveling somewhere today to play . ”
King and Sutter did n’t rule out the possibility of adding more management support for Sutter — perhaps even in the form of an assistant general manager .
“ He has a lot of people , ” King said .
“ But frankly if he felt or we felt we needed more , there ’s no impediment . ”
Sutter added : “ We ’ve discussed that at length in the past .
That ’s something I think we will look at . ”
The canning of Infinity Ward founders Jason West and Vince Zampella was not a decision that Activision took lightly , says big boss Bobby Kotick , saying that the pair 's conduct was a disappointing " compromise of our friendship . "

The man at the top of one of the world 's biggest video game publishers laid out Activision 's side of the Infinity Ward drama during an investor call earlier today .
Kotick attempted to calm his investors ' concerns about the turmoil surrounding the employee exodus at the Call of Duty : Modern Warfare developer , saying that Activision is " focused on growing our Call of Duty franchise [ and ] broadening its reach . "
That includes the still remaining talent at Infinity Ward he said , who are " working hard on the next title . "
Activision 's Thomas Tippl later said , vaguely , that IW is " working on a Call of Duty title . "

" We have long term , well thought through plans in place , " Kotick stressed , adding " There 's nothing accidental about the continued success of the Call of Duty brand . "
Here 's Kotick 's statement on the " change and dislocation " at Infinity Ward .
As critics question whether the White House is being tough enough with BP , Obama is reportedly showing his frustration behind closed doors .
The Washington Post reported :
Since the oil rig exploded , the White House has tried to project a posture that is unflappable and in command .
But to those tasked with keeping the president apprised of the disaster , Obama 's clenched jaw is becoming an increasingly familiar sight .
During one of those sessions in the Oval Office the first week after the spill , a president who rarely vents his frustration cut his aides short , according to one who was there .
" Plug the damn hole , " Obama told them .
On February 12 of this year , U.S. forces entered a village in the Paktia Province in Afghanistan and , after surrounding a home where a celebration of a new birth was taking place , shot dead two male civilians ( government officials ) who exited the house in order to inquire why they had been surrounded .
The Pentagon then issued a statement claiming that ( a ) the dead were all " insurgents " or terrorists , ( b ) the bodies of three women had been found bound and gagged inside the home ( including two pregnant women , one a mother of 10 children and the other a mother of six children , and a teenage girl ) , and ( c ) suggested that the women had already been killed by the time the U.S. had arrived , likely the victim of " honor killings " by the Taliban militants killed in the attack .
Although numerous witnesses on the scene as well as local investigators vehemently disputed the Pentagon 's version , and insisted that all of the dead ( including the women ) were civilians and were killed by U.S. forces , the American media largely adopted the Pentagon 's version , often without any questions .
But enough evidence has now emerged disproving those claims such that the Pentagon was forced yesterday to admit that their original version was totally false and that it was U.S. troops who killed the women :
After initially denying involvement or any cover -up in the deaths of three Afghan women during a badly bungled American Special Operations assault in February , the American - led military command in Kabul admitted late on Sunday that its forces had , in fact , killed the women during the nighttime raid .
One NATO official said that there was likely an effort to cover - up what happened by U.S. troops via evidence tampering on the scene ( though other NATO officials deny this claim ) .
The Times of London actually reported yesterday that , at least according to Afghan investigators , " US special forces soldiers dug bullets out of their victims ' bodies in the bloody aftermath of a botched night raid , then washed the wounds with alcohol before lying to their superiors about what happened . "
What is clear -- yet again -- is how completely misinformed and propagandized Americans continue to be by the American media , which constantly " reports " on crucial events in Afghanistan by doing nothing more than mindlessly and unquestioningly passing along U.S. government claims as though they are fact .
Here , for instance , is how the Paktia incident was " reported " by CNN on February 12 :
Note how the headline states as fact that the women were dead as the result of an " honor killing . "
The entire CNN article does nothing but repeat what an " unnamed senior military official said " about the incident , and it even helpfully explained :
An honor killing is a murder carried out by a family or community member against someone thought to have brought dishonor onto them .
The U.S. official said it is n't clear whether the dishonor in this case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperating with NATO forces .
" It has the earmarks of a traditional honor killing , " said the official , who added the Taliban could be responsible .
. .
The operation unfolded when Afghan and international forces went to the compound , which was thought to be a site of militant activity .
A firefight ensued and several insurgents died , several people left the compound , and eight others were detained .
Similarly , The New York Times , while noting that there were " varying accounts of what happened " among U.S. forces and Afghan police , also passed along the Pentagon 's false version of events with no questioning .
Here 's the NYT's February 12 article in its entirety :
Several civilians were killed in Paktia Province on Friday when a joint Afghan - NATO force went to investigate a report of militant activity , but NATO and the Afghan police gave varying accounts of what happened .
A NATO statement said the joint force went to a compound in the village of Khatabeh , in the Gardez district , where insurgents opened fire on them from a residential compound .
Several insurgents were killed and a large number of men , women and children fled and were detained by the NATO force .
Inside the compound , soldiers " found the bodies of three women who had been tied up , gagged and killed , " the NATO statement said .
The Paktia Province police chief , Aziz Ahmad Wardak , confirmed the episode but said the dead in the house were two men and three women , who he said were killed by Taliban militants .
He said the killings took place while the residents were celebrating the birth of a baby .
CNN conveyed its version of events without the slightest contradiction or doubt , and the NYT simply ignored entirely the claims of the residents of the village -- notwithstanding the fact that serious conflicts about what actually took place were known from the very beginning .
Consider , for instance , this February 12 article by Amir Shah of the Associated Press , who actually bothered to pick up a phone to determine if the Pentagon 's claims were true before " reporting " them as fact ; this is what Shah found :
However , relatives of the dead accused American forces of being responsible for the deaths of all five people when contacted by The Associated Press by phone .
A man who identified himself as Hamidullah said he had been in the home as some 20 people gathered to celebrate the birth of a son when a group of men he described as " U.S. special forces " surrounded the compound .
When one man came out into the courtyard to ask why , Hamidullah said he watched U.S. forces gun him down .
" Daoud was coming out of the house to ask what was going on .
And then they shot him , " he said .
Then they killed a second man , Hamidullah said .
The rest of the group were forced out into the yard , made to kneel and had their hands bound behind their back , he said , breaking off crying without giving any further details .
A deputy provincial council member in Gardez , Shahyesta Jan Ahadi , said news of the operation has inflamed the local community that believes the Americans were responsible for the deaths .
" Last night , the Americans conducted an operation in a house and killed five innocent people , including three women .
The people are so angry , " he said .
The Pentagon 's version of events was vehemently disputed from the start .
But there was not a hint of any of that in the CNN or NYT " reporting , " which simply adopted the press release claims of NATO forces .
That Press Release , false from start to finish , claimed that " a combined force of Afghan and international troops last night found the bound and gagged bodies of two women and the bodies of two men during an operation in the province 's Gardez district , " and " members of the combined force found the bodies inside . "
Ironically , the Pentagon Press Release ended this way : " 'ISAF continually works with our Afghan partners to fight criminals and terrorists who do not care about the life of civilians , ' ISAF spokesman Canadian army Brig .
Gen. Eric Tremblay said . "
On March 16 -- more than a month later -- the NYT ran a story detailing the gruesome claims of residents about what really happened ; click that link for the horrific details and to get a sense for how false were the Pentagon and U.S. media 's original claims about what took place .
Contrast the pure propaganda dissemination of the American media with the immediate reporting of the Pajhwok Afghan News , an independent news agency created in Afghanistan to enable war reporting by Afghans .
Here is how they reported the Pakita incident from the beginning , on Febraury 12 ( via NEXIS ) :
US Special Forces have shot dead a district intelligence chief along with four family members in the volatile southeastern province of Paktia , a senior police officer claimed on Friday .
Brig .
Gen. Ghulam Dastagir Rustamyar explained that Daud and his family were celebrating the birth of his son .
But acting on a misleading tip - off , foreign troops raided the intelligence official 's residence .
. . .
He said the dead included Daud , his brother Zahir , an employee of the attorney 's office , and three women .
. . .
But the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) claimed Afghan and international forces found the bound and gagged bodies of three women during the operation in Gardez late Thursday night .
" The joint force went to a compound near the village of Khatabeh , after intelligence confirmed militant activity .
Several insurgents engaged the joint force in a firefight and were killed , " the ISAF press office in Kabul said .
As a result of the raid , the multinational force added , a large number of men , women , and children exited the compound .
They were detained by the joint force .
When the troops entered the compound , according to the press release , they conducted a thorough search and found the bodies of three women who had been tied up , gagged and killed .
" The bodies had been hidden in an adjacent room . "
Note the crucial difference : the Afghan news service shaped its report based on the statements of actual witnesses on the ground and local investigators , while also including the Pentagon 's version of events .
Put another way , anyone reading about what happened from American news outlets would be completely misled and propagandized , while anyone reading the Pajhowk Afghan News would have been informed , because they treated official claims with skepticism rather than uncritical reverence .
* * * * *
All of this is a chronic problem , not an isolated one , with war reporting generally and events in Afghanistan specifically .
Just consider what happened when the U.S. military was forced in 2008 to retract its claims about a brutal air raid in Azizabad .
The Pentagon had vehemently denied the villagers ' claim that close to 100 civilians had been killed and that no Taliban were in the vicinity : until a video emerged proving the villagers ' claims were true and the Pentagon 's false .
Last week , TPM highlighted a recent , entirely overlooked statement from Gen. McChrystal , where he admitted , regarding U.S. killings of Afghans at check points : " to my knowledge , in the nine - plus months I 've been here , not a single case where we have engaged in an escalation of force incident and hurt someone has it turned out that the vehicle had a suicide bomb or weapons in it and , in many cases , had families in it .
. . .
We 've shot an amazing number of people and killed a number and , to my knowledge , none has proven to have been a real threat to the force . "
And as I documented before , the U.S. media constantly repeats false Pentagon claims about American air attacks around the world in order to create the false impression that Key Terrorists were killed while no civilians were .
At the Nieman Watchdog Foundation , Jeremy Starkey , the Afghanistan war reporter for The Times of London , has a crucial , must - read piece on all of this .
Amazingly , his piece was written three weeks ago , and recounted in detail : ( a ) how clearly the U.S. - led forces had lied about what happened in Paktia ; and ( b ) the reasons why the U.S. media continuously spews false government propaganda about the war .
Starkey wrote under this headline :
In this mid-March piece , Starkey explained how he had discovered that NATO 's claims about the Haktia incident were false ( he recounted his evidence in gruesome detail in the Times on March 13 ) , and more importantly , highlighted why the U.S. media so frequently disseminates false NATO claims with no questioning :
The only way I found out NATO had lied -- deliberately or otherwise -- was because I went to the scene of the raid , in Paktia province , and spent three days interviewing the survivors .
In Afghanistan that is quite unusual .
NATO is rarely called to account .
Their version of events , usually originating from the soldiers involved , is rarely seriously challenged .
. . .
It 's not the first time I 've found NATO lying , but this is perhaps the most harrowing instance , and every time I go through the same gamut of emotions .
I am shocked and appalled that brave men in uniform misrepresent events .
Then I feel naïve .
There are a handful of truly fearless reporters in Afghanistan constantly trying to break the military 's monopoly on access to the front .
But far too many of our colleagues accept the spin- laden press releases churned out of the Kabul headquarters .
Suicide bombers are " cowards , " NATO attacks on civilians are " tragic accidents , " intelligence is foolproof and only militants get arrested .
Starkey describes the some of the understandable reasons so many reporters do nothing more than regurgitate officials claims : resource constraints , organizations limits , dangers of traveling around , and the " embed culture . "
But he also recounts how NATO tries to intimidate , censor and punish any reporters like him who report adversely on official claims .
Illustratively , in response to Starkey 's March 13 article detailing what really happened at Paktia and the cover - up that ensued , NATO issued a formal statement naming him and insisting that this article was " categorically false . "
As recently as mid-March , NATO was still claiming -- falsely -- that the women in Paktia were killed prior to the arrival of American troops .
There are some very courageous and intrepid reporters in Afghanistan , including some who work for American media outlets .
It was , for instance , a superb and brave investigative report by the NYT's Carlotta Gall in Afghanistan that uncovered what really happened in that air attack Azizabad and documented the Pentagon 's false claims .
But far more often , Americans are completely misled about events in Afghanistan by the combination of false official claims and mindless stenographic American " journalism . "
And no matter how many times this process is exposed -- from Jessica Lynch 's heroic firefight to Pat Tillman 's death by Al Qeada -- this propaganda process never diminishes at all .
We often note the news that Democratic rank - and - file support for Israel is fading .
Well , the California State Democratic Convention yesterday endorsed Congresswoman Jane Harman for reelection from a district around Los Angeles , but before it did so , Harman and her opponent , Marcy Winograd , both appeared before a progressive caucus at the convention , and argued Israel .
The Fresno Bee calls the fight the " flashpoint " of the convention .
Peggy McCormack , a delegate to the convention , says that the story will be covered today on Pacifica radio , KPFA , 10 am PST .
Meantime , her report :
Jane Harman and Marcy Winograd managed to squeeze in a debate of sorts before a couple hundred Progressive Caucus delegates at the Democratic Convention .
Marcy herself brought up Israel in order to distance herself from Harman .
I never thought I ’d hear a candidate talk about brutal occupation , lack of water , unnecessary continuous deaths and lack of democracy .
Harman in response called Marcy an extremist who wants to get rid of Israel , and Marcy shot back with a democratic state from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River .
This got a standing ovation .
And , Harman stood up and said she did not go to the caucus to debate and strode out .
Unbelievable .
We collected enough signatures to get Marcy ’s signature to the floor of the convention , whereupon the vote was done in a strange but legal way with party workers counting the people holding up cards , and of course Harman won .
When we called for a recorded vote , John Burton , the party chair , snarled something or other about Marcy should organize better .
Clearly Marcy won the standing vote ( we all waved our delegate badges ) but we had not done our homework to jump at the mike and call for a recorded vote .
Does n’t matter , the point will not be lost on the lobby .

Punchcard Copyright
AUSTIN , TX : I decided to grow a beard in solidarity with my fellow Austinites , and now everybody was looking at me with newfound respect .
People in Austin understand the amount of dedication it takes to grow a good , gnarly beard , even if the amount of effort involved in other creative commitments is often an alien quantity .
As a result of my new facial hair , I suddenly became a local mandarin , and now my voice carried much greater weight than it deserved .
" Badass beard , " said my friend Coral with quiet humility .
He was trying to dig up a stump in my front yard .
I had rented a place in town in an attempt to spread some " East Coast Writer " money around in this troubled community and was paying my acquaintances Coral and Sutphin to do some yard work for me , even though I could have done it myself .
After all , I had so much extra testosterone that my face was literally growing hair .
I watched them from my new front porch , sipping a glass of iced tea .
" Thank you , " I said .
" The hardest part was the itching . " " I know what you mean , " said Sutphin , rubbing his own beard .
" Once you get past the itching , it is much easier to keep going . " " But still hard though , " said Coral , shooting him a look .
"
Not as hard as cutting a tree stump out of the ground with nothing but a pair of shovels and foul language , " I said generously .
Both Coral and Sutphin looked at the ground and spat , embarrassed .
I took a sip of iced tea , clinking the ice in my glass and crossing my legs .
" So tell me gentlemen , " I said .
" How do you feel about the copyright problem ? " " The copyright problem ? " said Coral , trying to feign interest .
" Oh sure , " I said .
" It 's a big deal in THE CITY right now . " " You mean New York City ? " said Sutphin .
Coral hit him with his yarnspun beanie .
" Of course he means New York , " hissed Coral .
And then , more sweetly , to me : " We 're not familiar with the copyright problem , Mister Jones .
" I stroked my beard as both Coral and Sutphin leaned forward , entranced by my knowing frown .
My knowing frown was concealed behind a thick wall of curly brown hair .
It was like a framed painting .
" There 's two camps , " I said .
" One group thinks copyright ought to be protected for as long as possible so that creators can have maximum control over their legacy .
This group would n't mind if copyright lasted forever , and they are always pushing to extend the deadline .
" " What 's the deadline ? " asked Sutphin .
" It 's 70 years after the death of the author , " I said .
" Or 120 years after the creation of work - for - hire intellectual property . " " What 's that mean ? " " Like Disney , " I said .
" It will be 120 years before " The Little Mermaid " will be public domain .
Anything made by a corporation is copyrighted for 120 years after it is created .
This applies to most movies and video games , for instance . "
" I love " The Little Mermaid , " said Sutphin .
" So who 's this other camp ? " asked Coral .
" The motherfuckers , " I said .
" People who do n't want there to be any copyright at all .
People who want everything to be free .
" " You steal movies and music all the time , " said Coral .
" I 've seen you . " " Yeah , well , " I said .
" Why do n't we take a break and go get some coffee ?
Ya'll are working too hard .
" I stepped down off the porch , rubbing my beard furiously .
Coral and Sutphin blinked , dropped their shovels , and rolled up their sleeves .
The coffee house was just down the street , but Coral lit the joint that was behind his ear anyway .
We smoked as we walked .
" What does copyright even mean ? " said Coral .
" It 's just whether or not somebody can copy your shit ? "
" It means all sorts of things , " I said .
" Not just copying , but distribution , amendment , and performance .
Also , copyright applies to making derivative works . " " Like " Little Mermaid " t- shirts , " said Sutphin .
" Bingo , " I said .
" I wish I had a " Little Mermaid " t- shirt right now , " said Sutphin .
"
If I had the copyright for that , I 'd print one up for you , my friend .
"
" So how come all these motherfuckers want everything to be free ? " asked Coral .
" They 've got all sorts of good reasons , " I said .
" I 'm just biased because I make things for a living and this feels like giving birth to children .
You want to raise your children the way you want and make sure they parrot your values until you die so that you can influence the future and have some kind of impact on the world .
I realize this is stupid , but it is also one of the big reasons people get into the creative arts , even if it is n't one of the big reasons they stay in the creative arts .
I want the creative arts to always appear to be a powerful , godlike pursuit of Total Meaning , even if this is total crap .
I want bankers to always fear artists . "
" I guess people want things to be free so that poor people can experience them , " said Coral .
" That 's one reason , " I said .
" Also , they do n't like the way corporations inevitably stockpile and dominate creative properties .
" We had arrived at the coffee shop .
We stood in line , waiting to buy drinks .
I looked around .
All the cool people had beards .
My beard was thicker than most , but not as long as some .
There were a few cool - looking people who did n't have beards , but they looked lost and confused .
They were called " girls " I reminded myself .
Coral reached into his wallet and pulled out a stained and beat - up coffee punchcard .
It had once been white , but it was now almost brown .
After ten punches , he got a free drink .
He only had about four punches left .
" How long have you been holding onto that sad old punchcard ? " I asked .
" I do n't know , " said Coral .
" A couple of months . " " All in the hope of scoring one free cup of coffee , " I said .
" All that time .
All that effort .
Keeping track of it .
Not losing it . " " That 's right , " said Coral .
" It does n't expire . " " I bet you 'd hold onto it for years if you had to , " I said .
" Decades . " " My whole damn life , " said Coral .
" I 'd pass it down to my kids .
" My eyes lit up and I snatched it out of his hand .
" I just had a thought , " I said .
" What if copyright was like a coffee punchcard ?
What if every time you made something , you got the rights to do ten different things with it , no more and no less ?
And you basically got to hold onto it forever , until you -- or your heir -- used your copyright ten different times ?
What if there was no expiration ? "
" I do n't get it , " said Coral .
" Give me back my punchcard .
" I waved it in the air .
" Like , say you wrote a novel , " I said .
" You could publish the novel , and that would be a punch .
Every new edition would be a punch .
If you made a movie out of that novel , it would be a punch .
If you made a t - shirt out of the novel it would be a punch .
You would get ten free copyright punches and then your work would go public .
You could sell punches on your card , but you could also sell the card ITSELF .
But there would be a limit .
Not a limit based on duration , but a limit based on uses . " " Huh , " said Coral .
I gave him back his punchcard .
We had finally arrived at the front of the line .
" Badass beard , " said the barista .
" Thank you , " I said .
Another week , another update to LinkedIn .
For most of us , Google Alerts have been very useful for tracking the movements of companies .
Linked
In with its 400 million professional users had to strike back with a follow feature for their most important target group which is job seekers .
Why follow companies on LinkedIn ?
As with all social media , it brings you closer to the action .
Whereas before you had to do your own sleuthing , the new Follow feature allows you to effortlessly stay on top of new developments in your target companies .
Is there new hiring , have they recently promoted internally or have they laid off people ?
These snippets of information will help you measure up the health of a business and you will have a better picture of what is going on inside .
What companies to follow ?
As there are nearly one million companies listed on Linked In , you will be spoilt for choice .
Start with a handful of your favorites ( i.e. your hit list ) and see how that goes .
If you get too many notifications , edit your settings accordingly and filter out irrelevant noise .
How to follow companies ?
Simply click on a company ’s profile page and hit the “ follow ” button .
When you click the settings option you can choose what updates to subscribe to , whether to receive emails or feed items and at what frequency they should be sent .
Bear in mind the privacy
Be aware that you are now more visible than ever on Linked In .
If you look to the top left of a company profile , you will notice that everyone following is listed .
This means you are n’t stalking in secret , anyone can see what you are up to .
If you are a job seeker , that could be a good thing .
If you are a competitor it could be a different story .
Similarly , whenever you are hired , promoted or leave a business for whatever reason , the listed followers will get that update whether they are in your network or not .
Final thoughts
The follow function has the potential of being a massive benefit of LinkedIn .
We can expect most companies to give their Linked In profiles makeovers in order to attract and retain talent .
The Follow function is designed to regain the initiative from other social media , Monster and Google Alerts .
LinkedIn ’s goal is to bring together job seeker and employers without any intermediaries , this takes them one step closer to that goal .

Nouriel Roubini's latest warning to the US concerns our debt , and what he sees as the two possible scenarios : Inflation or default .
This part is standard , though we'd note that many folks would have said the same thing about Japan years ago , and -- surprise , surprise -- they took a third path , deflation .
Regardless , what Roubini is really worried about is actually a Republican takeover of Congress :
What worries me most is the political gridlock in Washington .
While everyone agrees that $ 10 trillion ( Dh36.7 trillion ) deficits ( by the Obama administration 's own estimates ) for the next decade are not sustainable , there is no political will to act .
The two parties are completely divided .
Effectively , the Republicans are against any form of revenue increases .
The Democrats are against spending cuts , especially of entitlements .
If the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in the next election and refuse any revenue increases while the Democrats veto spending cuts , the path of least resistance will be runaway fiscal deficits which will then be monetised by the Federal Reserve , which has already embarked on this path .
In just the last year alone , the Federal Reserve has bought $ 1.8 trillion of Treasury securities and agency debt , a course that will inevitably lead to high inflation if sustained .
It is what is popularly known as printing money .
His stance arguably jibes with the market , which had a temporary freakout after Scott Brown was elected , and everyone predicted political gridlock .

Mark Leader ( L ) and Jody Wheelhouse were dismissed Two Royal Marines have been dismissed for assaulting an Afghan man after he had been detained on suspicion of planting a roadside bomb .
Devon - based Sergeant Mark Leader was found guilty by a court martial panel of assault causing actual bodily harm to Mohammad Ekhlas on 19 March 2009 .
Captain Jody
Wheelhouse , from 45 Commando , Arbroath , Scotland , admitted the same offence at an earlier hearing .
Wheelhouse was sentenced to dismissal with disgrace and Leader was dismissed .
The two men were sentenced at the HMS Nelson court martial centre at Portsmouth Naval Base , Hampshire .
The trial heard that Mr Ekhlas was assaulted by Leader and Wheelhouse , and that Leader - based at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstone , Devon - was seen hitting Mr Ekhlas with a Wellington boot .
He now finds himself absolutely distraught , he 's devastated by what he has done
Bob Williams
Defending Jody Wheelhouse Judge Michael Hunter said : " This was a sustained assault on an injured and unarmed prisoner , a middle - aged Afghan man who was suspected of being part of a group who were attempting to plant an improvised explosive device .
" It is understandable that those who have seen the effects of these devices should feel a degree of hatred or emotion towards those who plant them , especially when in Sergeant Leader 's case they had lost friends .
" But acts such as this against an unarmed man undermine the standards of our armed forces and undermine everything our armed forces are trying to achieve in Afghanistan and puts the lives of our personnel in even greater danger . "
High standards Speaking outside court , Lt Col Nick Jermyn , from navy command headquarters , said : " We will always seek to bring to account those whose actions fall short of our high standards of behaviour , and the actions of these two individuals are not reflective of those of their colleagues in the Royal Marines , the Royal Navy or the wider armed forces . "
Bob Williams , representing
Wheelhouse , described his client as young and inexperienced , with less than two years in service at the time of the offence .
" He now finds himself absolutely distraught , he 's devastated by what he has done .
He has accepted his role in these unpleasant events and he 's thoroughly ashamed of what he has done . "
Wheelhouse admitted striking Mr Ekhlas twice to the body with the boot , but said he had only joined in the assault as he was following the example of Leader , who was his troop sergeant .
Leader , according to his defence Marcus Tregilgas - Davey , disputed that the assault was his idea .
His claim that he had only hit Mr Ekhas because he believed he was trying to escape custody was not believed by the court martial panel .
' Degree of provocation ' Mr Tregilgas - Davey said Leader was set to lose up to £ 400,000 in pension and other benefits through his dismissal from the service .
He said : " There was a degree of provocation in that Mr Ekhlas was caught red - handed planting an IED and Sergeant Leader had lost three of his friends through IEDs . "
The trial heard that Mr Ekhlas was apprehended east of Sangin , Helmand Province , on suspicion of planting a roadside bomb , and was subjected to violence , classed as being legitimate force .
He was transferred to a base where his injuries were photographed before he was taken to a tent , usually used by ill servicemen , the court heard .
A female Royal Military Policewoman , who was guarding him had to leave the tent for a short time , putting the two Royal Marines in charge .
They then assaulted him .
Mr Ekhlas was later handed over to the Afghan authorities , then released and cannot be traced , the court was told .

Posted by John , April 4th , 2010 - under Immigration , Reformism , The Greens .
There is a contradiction at the heart of the Greens in Australia .
They want change , often progressive social change , but they want it in the context of an ageing and putrefying profit system whose capacity to pay for reform is becoming less and less .
For example the Greens have suggested an interim measure – increasing the price of carbon by $ 20 a tonne – to overcome the present stalling of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the Senate .
Unlike the Rudd Government ’s CPRS , the Greens ’ proposal might actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions a little .
And it does n’t compensate the polluters .
It relies on price signals to lower consumer demand for coal fired energy and encourage green alternatives .
In other words it is consumers – overwhelmingly working class people – who will bear the burden of this $ 20 carbon tax , not the polluters who will continue to profit under the Greens ’ proposals .
This ‘ change from within the system ’ approach explains why the Greens are such committed supporters of war criminal Barack Obama even though he has approved more drone killings in one year than George Bush did in 8 years .
Like Obama the Greens give the impression of change but in Australia have not yet had to deliver in Government on it .
The spectre however of the German Greens in power – where they capitulated on almost every one of their principles – must haunt the more intelligent Greens ’ members and supporters or at least give them cause for concern .
This is not peculiar to the Greens .
It is the result of the reformist project , of working within the system and playing the parliamentary game .
For example in Germany right now the Die Linke – the Left Party – is split over these very issues of power versus principle .
And the history of the Labor Party in Australia has been nothing other than ruling for capital at the expense of labour .
It seems to be the fate of reformist parties that they compromise away their principles .
Certainly the Greens in Australia have become more conservative as they have become more popular .
Indeed in Canberra the local Greens support an ACT minority Labor Government which is hellbent on attacking its workforce with wage and job cuts .
Even the same sex compromise these Canberra Greens passed is a rotten sop to the reactionaries in Federal Labor who would have overruled real equal marriage .
Now the Greens have sided with the reactionaries on population growth .
According to the Greens leader Bob Brown ‘ Australia cannot support a population of 35 million by 2050 as discussed by both the Prime Minister and the Opposition . ’
Brown goes on to say that ‘ the major parties population growth plan is outstripping Australia ’s infrastructure and environmental capacity and affecting quality of life . ’
Brown offers no evidence to support any of these assertions .
I would suggest that the infrastructure problems have more to do with Government inaction , inadequate taxation of companies and business inability or unwillingness to invest than any population issue per se .
What links these matters is the primacy of profit as the policy and investment motivator , the very profit system the Greens want to use to create a better world .
The idea that population is the problem is not new .
Perhaps the most well known proponent is the reactionary Malthus whose work created an economics of austerity and scarcity and who promoted inequity to serve the interest of the aristocracy .
Today the neo-Malthusians hide their essentially reactionary doctrines in glib comments about concern for living standards but the intent is the same – the defence of the ruling elite and their exploitative system .
They parrot seeming truisms about finite resources but fail to understand the problems of capitalism are not shortages but over - production .
There is for example more than enough food produced to feed everyone adequately .
Finite resources are a social construct .
Malthusian reaction finds current expression in the Greens ’ claim that Australia cannot support a population of 35 million and their targeting of immigration as the cause of the problem .
According to Bob Brown the solution is simple .
Reduce skilled migration .
In the eyes of the Greens the problem is people , not the profit system .
Brown counterbalances this with a call to increase humanitarian immigration ( a good move ) , but in the context of his statement that we cannot support a population of 35 million must mean a cut in overall immigration .
This will impact most heavily on non-white immigrants .
If only there were less people , the world would be better is their mantra .
This anti-human approach is the cornerstone of reaction , and the bedrock of the Greens .
But there is a problem here even for the Greens .
In the 2009 - 10 year skilled migration is set at 108,100 .
By my estimates it is likely about 85,000 will come from Asia , Africa , Oceania , the Middle East or South America .
They will be the first targeted in any reduction in skilled migration .
And what about education ?
There were approximately 460,000 foreign students living in Australia in 2008 at all levels of education .
On the logic the Greens use should n’t that number too be reduced ?
All of course to save the environment .
That will really help developing countries , the students and cash strapped Universities .
If skilled migration were to be reduced it would have implications for the development of Australian society .
Take for example the Greens ’ proposal for green jobs .
According to Greens ’ Senator Christine Milne :
How exciting would it be to present a plan to rebuild Australia ’s energy infrastructure for zero emissions as fast as possible , creating tens of thousands of jobs , driving investment in Australia ’s regions , cleaning our air and water and tackling the climate crisis ?
Wo n’t we require skilled labour to do this ?
Or are the Greens planning to build some sort of left nationalist autarkic nirvana ?
Actually Christine ’s suggestion of a plan is not a bad idea , but under capitalism planning is undemocratic and anti-human – done by the minority for profit , not to satisfy human need .
Labor ’s reformism had some connection to the working class , especially when that class took action to improve wages and conditions and defend jobs .
The Greens ’ reformism has no class base .
For example the Greens in Tasmania have not ruled out some sort of working arrangement ( including Ministries ) with the Liberals .
Bob Brown wants a coalition of all three parties – i.e. to join the two conservative parties in an unholy alliance of ruling for business .
It is not only that the idea that immigrants are a problem lends itself to racism ; the Greens proposal to spend more on Australia ’s overseas aid budget to go to literacy and reproductive health is clearly aimed at keeping immigrants from poorer countries ( ie those who are not white ) out of Australia .
So a good idea on the surface has a hidden message which undermines its worth .
Spend more to keep them out is the Greens ’ message .
I have an alternative proposal .
Open the borders .
Let labour flow freely around the world as capital does .
Unfortunately the Greens want controlled labour but free capital .
When you play in the sandpit of reaction you can end up with a racist rash all over your party .
There is a heavy responsibility on Greens ’ members to overturn Bob Brown ’s call to cut skilled immigration to save the environment .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Adrenal fatigue is a major cause of tiredness , chronic fatigue and increased incidence of illness which affects millions of people .
Many of those affected are unaware that their problems are due to worn down adrenals .
As noted in part 1 of this series , simple changes in lifestyle and diet can help restore adrenal functions and health .
In this concluding part we will look at some important herbs and other supplements which can also help .
Herbs : Ashwagandha .
Popular in Ayurvedic medicine , Ashwagandha helps normalize adrenal function .
Typical dose is 1 - 2 capsules twice daily on an empty stomach .
Eleuthero root ( Siberian ginseng ) .
Eleuthero has been used traditionally to stimulate and nourish the adrenals and increase mental alertness .
It is considered an " adaptogen " , meaning that it can help the body adapt to stress .
Rhodiola rosea .
This herb enhances mental and physical performance .
The recommended dose is 500 mg twice a day .
Note :
Those with bipolar disorder should not use this product , since it can increase brain levels of serotonin .
Other herbs which may help with adrenal fatigue include : licorice , maca , and Korean ginseng .
Note : Licorice can and , if taken over time , does have a propensity to elevate blood pressure .
It should not be used in persons with a history of hypertension , renal failure , or who currently use digitalis preparations such as digoxin .
Supplements : Cordyceps .
Cordyceps is a Chinese mushroom that supports the adrenal glands .
It also normalizes and supports functions of the immune system , kidneys , lungs , liver , nervous system and cardiovascular system .
DHEA .
DHEA is a basic hormone that the adrenals convert into other hormones .
The average dose ranges between 10 - 25 mg , although if someone is very deficient in DHEA they may initially only be able to tolerate amounts as small as 5 mg .
DHEA also is converted into sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen .
Pregnenolone .
Pregnenolone is a raw material that supports basic adrenal function and is a precursor to many of the hormones produced by the adrenals glands .
The usual dose is 25 mg and it is best taken towards the evening ( but may be taken earlier if it interferes with sleep ) .
Progesterone Cream .
Progesterone is an important building block for many other major hormones such as cortisol , DHEA , testosterone and estrogen .
Adrenal glandular extract ( AGE ) .
AGE contains growth factors that promote cell healing and has nutrients that support gland function and repair .
Take one to two tablets daily without food , reducing the dosage if you become jittery or have trouble sleeping .
Proline .
Proline is helpful in rebuilding connective tissues and weak adrenals are often associated with weak connective tissues .
Typical dose is 500 mg daily .
Vitamin B5 ( pantothenic acid ) .
B5 is especially important for stress - hormone production .
Take up to 500 mg three times a day .
A good multivitamin ( or B - complex ) will supply enough of the other B vitamins needed .
Vitamin C. Vitamin C is important for immune and other health support .
For adrenal fatigue take 1,000 - 2,000 mg twice daily .
If loose stools develop , reduce or further divide the doses .
Other helpful supplements include : vitamin E w / mixed tocopherols , vitamin B complex , niacin , pantothenic acid , magnesium citrate , trace minerals from plant derived sources , free - form amino acids , and ( if depression is present ) SAMe and / or DL - Phenylalanine .
It may take time and effort to lessen the unreasonable demands made on your mind and body and to take and do the things needed to help your adrenals recover .
In time though , the adrenals will be able to recover and when they so , so should your energy and health Source (s ) : Tony Isaacs , is a natural health author , advocate and researcher who hosts
The Best Years in Life website for those who wish to avoid prescription drugs and mainstream managed illness and live longer , healthier and happier lives naturally .
Mr. Isaacs is the author of books and articles about natural health , longevity and beating cancer including " Cancer 's Natural Enemy " and is working on a major book project due to be published later this year .
He is also a contributing author for the worldwide advocacy group " S.A N.E.Vax .
Inc " which endeavors to uncover the truth about HPV vaccine dangers .
Mr. Isaacs is currently residing in scenic East Texas and frequently commutes to the even more scenic Texas hill country near Austin and San Antonio to give lectures and health seminars .
He also hosts the CureZone " Ask Tony Isaacs - featuring Luella May " forum as well as the Yahoo Health Group " Oleander Soup " and he serves as a consultant to the " Utopia Silver Supplement Company " .
Though conservative mayoral candidate Don Marsh will never admit he was behind them , the fliers circulating in Gainesville branding Craig Lowe , a gay man , as a proponent of “ The Gay Agenda ” either did n’t work , or helped propel him into the lead in yesterday ’s run-off election .
Except Lowe did n’t secure more than 50 percent of the votes , which means he faces off against Marsh again on April 13 .
My friend Katherine Myronuk once told me , “ All complex ecosystems have parasites . ”
She was talking about spam and malware ( these days they ’re often the same thing ) and other undesirable critters on the net .
It ’s one of the smartest things anyone ’s ever said to me about the net – and about the world .
If there ’s a niche , a parasite will fill it .
There ’s a reason the cells of the organisms that live in your body outnumber your own by 100 to one .
And every complex system has unfilled niches .
The only way to eliminate unfilled niches is to keep everything simple to the point of insignificance .
But even armed with this intelligence , I ’ve been pretty cavalier about my exposure to net - based security risks .
I run an up - to - date version of a very robust flavor of GNU / Linux called Ubuntu , which has a single , easy - to - use interface for keeping all my apps patched with the latest fixes .
My browser , Firefox , is far less prone to serious security vulnerabilities than dogs like Internet Explorer .
I use good security technology : my hard - drive and backup are encrypted , I surf through Ipredator ( a great and secure anonymizer based in Sweden ) , and I use GRC ’s password generator to create new , strong passwords for every site I visit ( I keep these passwords in a text file that is separately encrypted ) .
And I ’m media - literate : I have a good nose for scams and linkbait , I know that no one ’s planning to give me millions for aiding in a baroque scheme to smuggle cash out of Nigeria , and I can spot a phishing e-mail at a thousand paces .
I know that phishing – using clever fakes to trick the unsuspecting into revealing their passwords – is a real problem , with real victims .
But I just assumed that phishing was someone else ’s problem .
Or so I thought , until I got phished last week .
Here ’s the thing : I thought that phishers set their sights on a certain kind of naive person , someone who had n’t heard all the warnings , had n’t learned to be wary of their attacks .
I thought that the reason that phishers sent out millions of IMs and e-mails and other messages was to find those naifs and ensnare them .
But I ’m not one of those naifs .
I ’d never been tricked , even for a second , by one of those phishing messages .
Here ’s how I got fooled .
On Monday , I unlocked my Nexus One phone , installing a new and more powerful version of the Android operating system that allowed me to do some neat tricks , like using the phone as a wireless modem on my laptop .
In the process of reinstallation , I deleted all my stored passwords from the phone .
I also had a couple of editorials come out that day , and did a couple of interviews , and generally emitted a pretty fair whack of information .
The next day , Tuesday , we were ten minutes late getting out of the house .
My wife and I dropped my daughter off at the daycare , then hurried to our regular coffee shop to get take - outs before parting ways to go to our respective offices .
Because we were a little late arriving , the line was longer than usual .
My wife went off to read the free newspapers , I stood in the line .
Bored , I opened up my phone fired up my freshly reinstalled Twitter client and saw that I had a direct message from an old friend in Seattle , someone I know through fandom .
The message read “ Is this you ???? ” and was followed by one of those ubiquitous shortened URLs that consist of a domain and a short code , like this : http://owl.ly/iuefuew.
I opened the link with my phone and found that I ’d been redirected to the Twitter login page , which was prompting me for my password .
Seeing the page ’s URL ( truncated in the little phone - browser ’s location bar as “ http://twitter …. ” ) and having grown accustomed to re-entering all my passwords since I ’d reinstalled my phone ’s OS the day before , I carefully tapped in my password , clicked the login button , and then felt my stomach do a slow flip - flop as I saw the URL that my browser was contacting with the login info : http://twitter.scamsite.com
( it was n’t really scamsite , it was some other domain that had been hijacked by the phishers ) .
And that ’s when I realized that I ’d been phished .
And it was bad .
Because I ’d signed up for Twitter years ago , when Ev Williams , Twitter ’s co-founder sent me an invite to the initial beta .
I ’d used a password that I used for all kinds of sites , back before I started strictly using long , random strings that I could n’t remember for passwords .
In defense of the old me , I only used that password for unimportant sites , like services that friends wanted me to sample in beta .
But unimportant sites have a way of becoming important .
I ’ve got 40,000 +
Twitter followers , and if my account was hijacked , the hijackers could do great damage to my reputation and career through their identity theft .
What ’s more , Twitter is n’t the only place where I used my “ low - security ” password that has turned into a high - security context , which means that hijackers could conceivably break into lots of interesting places with that information .
So I sat down at a table , kissed my wife goodbye , got my laptop out and started changing passwords all over the net .
It took hours ( but at least I ’ve expunged that old password from my existing accounts , I think ) .
By the time I finished , three more copies of the phishing scam had landed in my Twitter inbox .
If they ’d come a few minutes earlier , the multiple copies would have tripped my radar and I would have seen them for a scam .
The long process gave me lots of time to reconsider my internal model of how phishing works .
Phishing is n’t ( just ) about finding a person who is technically naive .
It ’s about attacking the seemingly impregnable defenses of the technically sophisticated until you find a single , incredibly unlikely , short - lived crack in the wall .
If I had n’t reinstalled my phone ’s OS the day before .
If I had n’t been late to the cafe .
If I had n’t been primed to hear from old friends wondering if some press mention was me , having just published a lot of new work .
If I had n’t been using a browser that did n’t fully expose URLs .
If I had n’t used the same password for Twitter as I use for lots of other services .
If I ’d been ten minutes later to the cafe , late enough to get multiple copies of the scam at once – for the want of a nail , and so on .
But all the stars aligned for that one moment , and in that exact and precise moment of vulnerability , I was attacked by a phisher .
This is eerily biological , this idea of parasites trying every conceivable variation , at all times , on every front , seeking a way to colonize a host organism .
The net ’s complex ecosystem is so crowded with parasites now that it is a sure bet that there will be a parasite lurking in the next vulnerable moment I experience , and the next .
And I will have vulnerable moments .
We all do .
I do n’t have a solution , but at least I have a better understanding of the problem .
Falling victim to a scam is n’t just a matter of not being wise to the ways of the world : it ’s a matter of being caught out in a moment of distraction and of unlikely circumstance .
This may be the best rationale I ’ve seen the MSM use when mentioning the Volcker rule :
“ The Senate is considering writing into law what Mr. Obama calls “ the Volcker rule , ” which would effectively bar banks from the risky and often lucrative practice of trading for their own accounts .
The Volcker rule is aimed at undoing a side - effect of the bailouts of 2008 and 2009 :
An assumption that government will always rescue big financial institutions , and thus make it easier for them to borrow heavily to make risky bets . ”
I keep hearing people complain that the Volcker rule would not have prevented the crisis .
The Volcker Rule is aimed at the side effects of the rescue , not prevention .
Indeed , in the post crisis , post - bailout era , we must strive not only to prevent the next set of taxpayer funded bailouts — but to minimize the negative repercussions of the last rescue .
Typical of ignoring the impact of the rescue is the fin services mega lobbyist , the Financial Services Forum .
Consider what their spokesbitch , Rob Nichols , recently bleated :
“ Trading — proprietary or otherwise — did n’t lead to the recent crisis .
Let ’s focus on correcting the major deficiencies in our current supervisory framework first . ”
That is an example of a false dichotomy — there is nothing that prevents a society from a ) attacking the cause of problem and b ) cleaning up the side effects of the prior rescue .
Of course , that is not how bloodsucking lobbyists and preservers of the status quo see it — they simply do n’t want anything to change .
Financial Services Forums ’
Nichols wants the Fed to be in charge of regulating the largest banks .
Based on 1 ) his approval of the Fed ’s performance this past crisis ; and 2 ) His prior job as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush — he is obviously a huge fan of incompetence .
Nichols continues to defend Too Big to Fail , supports taxpayer funded speculation , and wants to insure the mega banks are free from regulation .
In his stint in the last administration , Nichols helped contribute to the crisis ;
As a lobbyist , he is hellbent on making sure future administrations have another crisis .
Heckuva job , Nichols .

Inside The World Of Red Mist
While he is known to the masses as confident nerd McLovin from the teen comedy Superbad , Christopher Mintz - Plasse has moved beyond that .
He recently contributed voice work to the animated film How To Train Your Dragon and the upcoming Marmaduke , and he plays quasi- super hero Red Mist in the controversial and action - packed new movie Kick - Ass .
He ’s an amiable character with a good sense of humor , as ADD discovered when chatting with at the recent NYC press junket for the film .
( For more from Mintz - Plasse , check out my Movies.com interview with the three young Kick - Ass stars . )
So is true that you ’re going to become the Motherfucker ?
Ooooh , that ’s way too far in the future .
I think that [ comic writer ]
Mark [ Millar ] is writing Kick - Ass 2 in a couple of weeks , and he wants to change Red Mist ’s name to the Motherfucker , which I think is hilarious .
If they make the movie that would be very uncomfortable because people would be like , “ Are n’t you the Motherfucker ? ”
Those are fighting words , man !
Do n’t be doing that !
So we ’ll see what happens .
Your co-star Aaron Johnson said that the entire premise of the name change is just so people can stop calling you McLovin .
Mark is a genius like that .
Would you be glad if you lose McLovin ?
It does n’t matter to me .
Hopefully people will remember me for that character because that was my first movie ever .
It put me on the map , and I got to do Kick - Ass , Role Models and all of these movies , so I ’ll forever be grateful for that .
Red Mist is different here than in the comic book .
He ’s tough and more of the bad boy [ in the comic ] .
I think Matthew wanted to change that because he wanted my father to be the main bad guy , so he wanted me to be the son that his father never wanted him to be .
He [ the son , Chris D’Amico ] always wants to be in the family business , and he creates Red Mist to lure Kick - Ass to him .
I think it ’s very genius .
Was it interesting to do a role in an action movie where you might not normally be considered ?
That ’s why I got excited that they sent me the script .
Then I read it , and I was like , “ Oh , my part does n’t really do any action . ”
To be a part of something like this is amazing because these are my favorite kind of movies — very well done action movies .
Do worry about getting stereotyped as an actor ?
Not yet .
Superbad was kind of a nerdy character , and Role Models was kind of a nerdy character , but they were polar opposites .
McLovin was very confident , and in Role Models he just had no friends .
In Kick - Ass he ’s not really a nerd , so I ’m not too worried yet .
Do you worry about people imitating this movie ?
You have to be pretty stupid to imitate what happens in this movie .
There are not going to be any eleven year - old girls going out and trying to murder people , I know that .
It ’s funny because a lot of people are worried about the cursing , but I find the violence more shocking .
That ’s the thing .
People keep talking about the swearing , but what about the violence ?
I ’m glad you ’re saying that because people are always worrying about the swearing , but she [ Chloë ] murders people .
What was it like on set watching her do that stuff ?
It was awesome .
It was so cool to witness it backstage and see it right there .
It was very cool , it was very exciting for her .
Were there a lot of pranks played on the set ?
There were more pranks on Role Models .
There were n’t any pranks on this set .
What was the vibe like ?
Very relaxed and very fun .
[ Director ] Matthew [ Vaughn ] had the same crew he worked on for Stardust and Layer Cake .
He always works with the same people , so you come in there and it ’s already a family .
They just accepted me , Chloë [ Moretz ] and Aaron right away , and it was amazing .
He ca n’t do any wrong yet , Matthew .
He ’s on a roll .
What was it like to work with Mark Strong ?
He ’s amazing , and he always plays the villain in a movie .
He ’s just the sweetest , down - to - earth guy .
He ’s always got his family on set — his two little kids and his wife .
Not on the violent days — he would n’t have them be there .
He did n’t want them to see them beat the shit out of a girl .
You do n’t want to witness your dad doing that .
He ’s a very amazing , talented actor , and I was excited to work with him .
How much improv was there in this movie ?
A little bit .
It was not like Superbad or Role Models , which was improv pretty much every scene .
This movie was very straight to the script because you have to keep action movies going .
You ca n’t improv an action scene because that wo n’t work .
For the scenes where Aaron and I were driving in the Mist Mobile , there was a little improv in there .
This is Einstein , a 6 - pound pinto stallion .
I happen to love beans and horses , so he 's a great combo .
And smart ( I have a dog named Einstein and he's a genius , plus rubs his rocket on my arm ) .
Weighing in at just six pounds , the New Hampshire - born foal may be the world 's smallest horse .
Dr. Rachel Wagner , Einstein 's co-owner , says the Guinness record for the smallest newborn horse is 9 pounds .
Wagner notes Einstein shows no signs of dwarfism , unlike the current record holder .
Great , now I want a pony .
I went my whole childhood not wanting one ( I liked turtles ) and now I do .
I 'm 28 - years old for crying out loud , I feel like such a girl .
Okay , not really .
But as soon as my roommate leaves for work and I put her panties on I will .
High - five , Craigslist roomies !
Hit the jump for a bunch more of the almost unbearable cuteness .

Thanks to Robert Cop , who claims to have a 5 lb horse that looks suspiciously like a cat with a saddle taped to its back .
Making your own green toilet with a bucket , a toilet seat and some sawdust or other wood debris creates the perfect option for camping or the rustic cabin with no septic tank .
Remarkably odor - free , these green portable potties solve sewer and septic problems .
Plus , you have to admit that talking about how to make a composting toilet makes for hilarious conversation about pooping in a bucket .
The simplest version of your environmentally - friendly porta - potty has a toilet seat placed on top of a bucket .
For child - proofing and more stability , the seat can be attached over a hold in a nice cabinet or a homemade wooden frame with the bucket inside a hinged , locked door .
A wooden frame or cabinet is preferable because a hinged door makes for easy bucket replacement , and the seat can be screwed to the frame , making the whole setup look more " normal . "
Set your facility up in an accessible area or behind closed doors if you need extra privacy .
Keep a scoop in a bucket of nearby wood shavings , and place a roll of biodegradable toilet paper within easy reach .
After the deed is done , cover it up with a layer of mulch .
If each deposit is thoroughly covered with wood materials , leaves , and other neutral compost , the smell of the toilet will not be noticeable .
In fact , users should be able to place their face near the open lid of this woodsy port- potty and only smell wood shavings .
As soon as they are covered , urine and excrement alike will be absorbed and start to break down immediately .
The online Humanure Handbook offers clear instructions , pictures and videos about how to make and maintain various styles of composting toilets .
Personal experience may vary , but this author was impressed with how one bucket took care of a family of two adults and one child for an entire week in the wilds of Montana .
For regular use , clean your green toilet at least once weekly and deposit waste into a secluded compost area .
Because compost piles crave moisture , dump the rinse water into the compost pile .
Rinse the bucket with water from a rain barrel if possible .
Use environmentally - friendly dish soap and a scrub brush used solely for this task .
Cover the humanure with grass trimmings or hay to keep it looking nice .
Turn the inner layers with a pitchfork every time more compost is added .
Kitchen scraps and garden leavings may be included as well .
Allow a full year for thorough breakdown of bacteria , mulching the pile into next year 's garden .
Gutter water can also be directed to drain down into the compost pile .
Be sure to keep the compost pile contained or fenced so that small chlldren and animals are not tempted to play in or around it .
If you know how to make a composting toilet , you can save water , plumbing costs , and connect with the earth .
Waste is n't wasted when it 's returned to the ground .
It will produce more food , bringing the cycle of sustenance full - circle back to benefit us again and again .
And , once again , DIY toilets offer limitless laughs !

For the LA Galaxy , Saturday ’s home game against the Philadelphia Union can't come soon enough .
The match wo n't only be played in a much more comfortable setting than last time , but it will help the team move forward after a scoreless draw in Kansas City , which was the Galaxy ’s worst match of the young 2010 MLS season .
“ Admittedly we played poorly on Saturday , ” Galaxy coach Bruce Arena said after training on Tuesday .
" Despite the fact that you can complain about the field and it was a little slick and everything else , we were n’t good .
There ’s no question about it .
We have to get better this week like it is every week and be prepared to play a better game on Saturday . ”
While the Galaxy were shut out for the first time on the season , and needed a stellar goalkeeping performance from Donovan Ricketts not to lose , the club still was able to pull out a point from the encounter .
Still , it ’s a place Arena wo n’t be too disappointed not to have to visit anymore this year .
“ You do n’t ever want to play on that field in a game I think that means a lot because there is so much out of your control , it ’s tough , ” Arena said .
“ It ’s a tough venue to play in .
I ’m happy it ’s out of the way and we ’re out of there fairly untarnished .
We did n’t play well so we need to accept that fact and move on from there . ”
This weekend ’s match may be the exact opposite of the Wizards encounter .
Instead of a team that had given up just one goal in three games and were tough to beat thus far this season , the Galaxy will welcome a squad of players still trying to sort themselves out as a team .
Philadelphia have only ever played four regular - season games , and have lost three of them .
Worse , the Union ’s defense is yielding a load of goals as the first - year team has allowed at least two goals in each game , the last of which was a 2 - 1 loss at New York on Saturday .
With the Galaxy coming off a shutout then , does Arena feel the offense must take advantage of a weakened opponent ?
“ I do n’t think we look at it that way , ” said Arena , who attributed the Union ’s defensive woes on other things .
“ They ’ve had some difficult situations in their first four games where they ’ve had red cards , and they ’ve played with 10 players for significant minutes in two games and therefore lost those players in the next game but it has n’t been easy for them . ”
And even though Philadelphia have won only one regular - season game ever , the Galaxy likely wo n’t go into the match overconfident .
“ My observation with watching Philly play New York was that they outplayed them for 90 minutes and fell short , ” Arena said .
“ They ’re a good team .
I was very impressed with what I saw out of Philly against Red Bull on Saturday . ”
Could you survive for a week without checking your email or looking at the internet ?
How about no mobile phone and making it two weeks ?
So , I called someone up the other day .
An acquaintance , of sorts .
Someone I 've spoken to by email countless times over the past two years , discussing work .
Halfway through the conversation , it became obvious that we 'd never actually spoken before .
" We must have spoken at some point , " I say , a little awkwardly .
" Yes , " she says , meaning no .
" Maybe , a year ago ? "
Meaning never .
There 's nothing shocking in that .
I 'm sure you 've experienced much the same situation yourself .
But surely the fact that it is n't shocking is something we should be shocked by ?
Why is it acceptable to not actually speak to the people we deal with on a daily basis ?
Why do we prefer faceless anonymity ?
Is it cowardice , or mere laziness ?
Of course , the stock defence is efficiency .
We 're so busy , the line goes , that we do n't have time for idle chitchat .
We live – as we 're constantly told – in super - accelerated times .
But no one seems to have decided what to do with all this extra speed in our lives , apart from emailing each other amusing YouTube videos .
We 're so intent on consuming the new that we do n't give ourselves the time to properly absorb it , let alone reflect upon it .
Ironically enough , this is something I 've been reflecting on a fair bit recently .
For a variety of reasons , top of which was an almost perfect alignment of stress - inducing greatest hits ( trying to move house while my wife was pregnant , and having to deal with the worry of unexpected complications ) I felt the need to slow down a little .
And there does n't seem to be an app for that .
I 'm not just being facetious : more and more people appear to be thinking the same thing .
Mobile phones have made us permanently contactable ; remote emails mean that the work week stretches into the evenings , the weekends and even holidays .
Under the barrage of tweets , Facebook invitations and instant messages , it has become almost impossible to switch off .
The idealised version of social media is that it is like a river – you can just dip your toe in or you can dive in and get fully and joyously swept along with the current .
Increasingly , I felt like I was drowning .
Already , as I discovered while wasting time on the internet , a report by Leeds University has claimed a link between increased internet use and stress .
Recent research by Microsoft reveals that 99 % of men use the internet every day , 80 % would feel lost without it and 18 % checked social networks on their phone before they had even got out of bed .
Cosmopolitan even found that three out of four teenagers claim to feel stressed if they 're not online .
But the internet is n't the problem : it 's the people on it .
In other words , me .
I spend so much time on my laptop that my wife 's taken to calling it my " square - headed girlfriend " .
So I decided to do something about it .
And in true self - help style , my road to redemption began with a single step : I quit Twitter .
I 'd already been worrying about how easily I let myself get swept up in predictable online flashmobs of moral outrage .
For a nanosecond , joining a campaign against a Daily Mail columnist might have seemed like a worthy thing to do .
But step away from the stampede of indignation and you realise you 're just another one of the dumb cattle they 've successfully prodded .
And I 'm not convinced by the supposed innate liberalism of Twitter – not if a vigilante campaign to out Jamie Bulger killer Jon Venables can become a tweeting trend .
But the tipping point came when someone who I thought I admired started announcing to me in 140 characters or less that Marvin Gaye was overrated .
Pathetic , I know , but the mere fact I 'd allowed myself to get annoyed by something so petty only hardened my conviction .
It was obvious that I was the only one making myself angry .
So I decided the best option was not to look , and cancelled my account .
And then I just kept going .
This need to wipe the slate clean , to de-clutter – or at least de-complicate – my life , took over .
I needed a holiday from the world of stuff .
So I decided on a very literal form of regressive therapy : I was going to go offline , to see if I could last a week without looking at a website or checking my email ; to somehow re-connect by disconnecting .
Symbolically , my iPhone was the next thing to go ( partly thanks to a friend 's disdainful description of it : " Are those the things I see men stroking like little pets on the tube ? " ) .
My constant , portable window to the internet was too much of a temptation to carry round with me if I was to seriously attempt life offline , so I " de - simmed " it .
( This is not an easy exercise in itself – you need a paperclip to get the sim card out and , as I discovered , paperclips are n't as abundant as they used to be in pre-digital days . )
If quitting Twitter and ditching the iPhone was relatively easy , Facebook made it as hard as possible , tugging on all the virtual heartstrings they could dredge up from their data .
Having selected " deactivate account " from my settings , I was faced with a gallery of family and friends who I was told would miss me .
Fortunately , as someone had tagged the contents of a barbecue grill with my friends ' names , this was less of an emotional strain than was intended ( " Andrew will miss you , " pleaded a photo of a forlorn and slightly singed chicken drumstick ) .
To alleviate my worries , I was given a final reminder : " Remember , you can reactivate at any time … "
But by then the deed was done .
Next came the hard bit .
For this to really work , I should n't tell anyone what I was doing .
But then again , one of the great things about setting yourself an arbitrary task is that you get to decide on the ground rules , set the parameters and cheat accordingly .
So I emailed a friend to explain why he would n't be getting any more emails from me for a while .
His reply was to the point : " How on earth will you do any work ? "
It was a fair question .
So I decided I 'd wean myself off .
On the first day , I allowed myself to look at my inbox , but not to send any replies .
To start off , it was a doddle .
I walked around the office and talked to people .
I delegated .
I rang people up .
The first person I called – honestly – rang off with the words , " Thank you so much for calling me . "
See ?
Being offline was making me a nicer person already .
And it 's amazing how quickly misunderstandings can be defused when you put a voice to an anonymous email .
For a start , there 's no sarcasm font on email , and typing " ha ha ! " does have the tendency to make you look a little unhinged .
But I wo n't pretend it was n't without its difficulties .
As time went by and I got into the habit of checking in with the people I needed to talk to , hopefully pre-empting any electronic conversations , I found ever more subtle pitfalls lying in wait .
For instance , I 'd never before considered the implied rudeness of talking to someone when you 've clearly avoided reading their last email .
I soon learned to brazen it out by saying , " Oh sorry , I 've not opened my inbox yet . "
It was n't long before another one of those acquaintances - I 've - never - met asked , " Do n't you have it on in the background all the time ? "
" Er , no , I find it easier to just check it occasionally – otherwise I never get any work done . "
" That 's a really good idea , " they said .
Come to think of it , it is a good idea .
You only have to go back five years for the digital landscape to alter radically .
Back to a strange offline world : pre-Facebook , pre-Twitter .
( Interestingly enough , the latter predates the former .
At least I 'm pretty sure that 's true .
Obviously I have n't been able to Google it . )
YouTube , which now has " well over a billion views a day " only came into existence in February 2005 .
Crucially , five years ago was also before third - generation phones taken their hold : when reading breaking news , checking your location on a map or updating your friends on your lunch was n't something most of us did with a device we carried around in our pockets , if at all .
And I have fully embraced this new technology .
I 'm now of the generation that actually has a genuine circle of friends made on the internet .
I discuss TV shows live on Twitter with them .
I share photos and random thoughts on Facebook .
I write several blogs .
I 've found myself inadvertently becoming part of an online community that works both as a support group and constant source of light relief – people I hold genuine affection for , resulting in long - standing friendships and at least one job .
But it 's alarmingly easy to disappear completely .
Or , more to the point , to live like we all used to .
I swapped Facebook updates for lengthy phone calls ( often via a phonebox ; 50 p gets you nowhere these days ) .
I read more , I cooked more , I wrote a few postcards ( and managed to forget to leave enough space for the stamp ) .
I drew .
I went on long walks .
I drove to Hastings and ate chips on the beach .
I watched more curling in the Winter Olympics than I would have thought humanly possible .
I rediscovered the rare thrill of staying up until midnight on a Saturday night to see if my football team had won ( we 're in the Championship ) or – better yet – only finding out when I opened the Sunday papers .
But , most of all , I did nothing –and it was great .
I could physically feel my head rising above the water again as the stream of information subsided .
My wife told me I was more fun to be around , probably because I was n't tutting at my phone every 10 seconds .
Obviously , however relaxing , doing nothing is n't that much of a challenge .
So , entering into the new spirit of face - to - face interaction , I went into the local branch of my bank to get some advice on savings accounts for our baby –to–be .
You want interaction ?
They have meet - and - greeters at the door these days .
Did you know that ?
I did n't know that .
It 's like entering a posh hotel , right down to the people complaining about interest rates .
" Hello sir ! " beamed the efficient - looking lady , efficiently .
" What can we do you for ? " I swear she said that .
And she had a clipboard , in case I needed prompting .
" Hi , " I beamed back .
" I 'd like to talk to someone about opening a savings account .
I'm a First Direct customer and I 'm not sure … "
" Ah , " she said .
" Let me stop you there .
If you want to discuss a First Direct savings account , you 'll need to call them . "
OK , that 's within the rules .
So I called my bank .
Obviously , First Direct 's entire USP is that you deal with them on the phone .
And they 're very good at it .
Their call centres play on the personal touch that most banks lost years ago ( I switched to them after my previous local high street bank literally became a trendy wine bar ) .
But still , it 's good practice .
The nice First Direct lady ( comforting Scottish voice ) cheerfully chatted away to me about savings accounts , and soon went off piste , doling out free baby advice , telling me how to deal with everything from in - laws to modern prams .
Eventually , I had so much friendly advice that it was hard to make sense of ( including " Ooh , you 're going to have to put away 50 % of your earnings for the next 25 years !
Ha ha ! " which would have looked downright rude on an email ) .
So I asked her if she could send me the details .
" It 's all on the website , sir . "
" Yes , but I 'd really like to be sent it , so I can take some time to read through it . "
After a brief , affable lecture about how paperless banking helps the environment , she relented ; but not without one parting shot .
" If you do decide you want to go for an ISA , do n't forget you 'll have to set it up online . "
Of coursE , IT'S VIRTUALLY impossible – not to mention pointless – to live and work entirely offline in 2010 .
But if I was hoping to achieve anything from what had now developed into two weeks offline , this was it : if you 're finding life on the information superhighway is getting too much , just pull over to the hard shoulder and stretch your legs for a bit .
It does n't have to be for a fortnight , but you can manage an hour .
And all of a sudden , what with the speed we all work at these days , that seemingly insurmountable problem will have passed you by .
You need to reclaim the internet – to remember it 's there to make your life easier , not to complicate it further .
I 've learned to no longer jump to attention at every " ping " in my inbox .
I 've returned to my iPhone , but I 've pin-protected the web browser , which acts as an extra idiot - proof barrier , and set my email so that I have to manually " push " new messages ( and it sounds rather quaint describing it that way , like I 'm trying to squeeze it all through a virtual letter box ) .
What 's more , I 've started buying a proper newspaper every day from a man who looks me in the eye and says , " Good morning sir . "
I try to reply to emails with a phone call .
I 've been welcomed back to Facebook with a delighted automatic email , but I 'm keeping it strictly friends and family .
And I use my work email for what it was intended .
It has been a hard lesson to learn , but just because a river is there you do n't have to throw off all your clothes and jump in .
POSTSCRIPT
After two weeks , when I turned my email back on , this is what I found in my inbox :
WORK 307 EMAILS
■ 73 of which were an ongoing conversation between friends I 'd been cc'ed into , discussing a leaving gift for a friend ( sorry I missed it , Jimmy ) .
■ Almost exactly the same number ( 75 ) were from colleagues specifically discussing work .
■ 53 were press releases that could conceivably have been of relevance to my job ( and , as I work on an entertainment title , I 'm including one headed " Danny Dyer fancies Ginger Nicola from Girls Aloud ! " )
■ Of the rest , 80 % were unsolicited press releases and spam , while the remainder were emails from friends or general internal announcements .
HOME 471 EMAILS
■ 85 were from people I actually knew .
( Including one apparently from me , generously offering myself 84 % off Viagra pills – which seemed an oddly precise number . )
■ 386 messages went directly into my junk folder ( including this spam from an online marketing company : " Email Productivity – save at least half hour per day .
Almost all email users are spending too much time on too many emails … "
GRAND TOTAL 778 EMAILS
Nine - tenths of which I could happily delete without reading beyond the subject line .
Second life : Eva Wiseman attempts to live entirely online
The internet – my one true love , my only foe ; it giveth , sure , but it taketh awayeth , too : whole sunny days spent reading the Twitter feeds of a minor reality star , whole weekends spent fretting over the opinions of a vengeful blogger , and cash , which feels more like Monopoly money when it 's spent online on novelty kitchenware and dresses that do n't quite fit .
But how would it feel to survive online only ?
Could I give up books , newspapers , TV , telephones ?
Would my contact lenses dry out ?
Would my soul ?
My internet odyssey began on a damp and newsless Tuesday morning .
Around this time , on the train , I like to read a story .
But who needs books ?
Who needs the warm , bready smell of thumbed paper , receipts for bookmarks ?
The New Yorker fiction podcast features meaty - voiced authors reading their favourite short stories in a growling lullaby style .
Afterwards they discuss it and you 're transported to a tiered lecture theatre in an American film , falling slightly in love with the speaker , whose concise criticism makes you feel both cleverer and stupider .
So that 's books obsolete , ho hum .
This week , 19 - year - old Alexander Guttenplan captained his college on University Challenge .
Worshipful Facebook groups for him have sprung up overnight like Portaloos - one links to a letter archived on the Observer site that he wrote to the paper aged 11 , furious about proposed changes to the Science Museum .
His followers , the Guttenfans , are building support for his appearance in the finals , with 1,200 members of one Facebook group planning viewing parties .
The internet 's good at getting people to come together , at campaigning .
One click and the world changes .
Two clicks and it changes back .
Instead of phones I rely on Gmail chat .
By clicking on a friend 's name , all conversations can be had in a 3 - inch box .
I learn quickly that I am too slow for this , too 2008 .
Conversations are had at the speed of light – as fast as I form a bon mot and type it , pun falling over pun , the moment 's gone , the joke 's over .
Though I am an accomplished eBayer , I 've never bought groceries online .
My local Sainsbury 's beckons when I 've run out of tins , but online I can rise above my humble neighbourhood .
Online I can shop at Waitrose .
Waitrose !
Stage name : Ocado .
Unfortunately it would n't let me register .
Perhaps it smelled my ghetto postcode .
I gave up after half an hour and settled for browsing their food categories , then registered at Sainsburys.co.uk which , alongside Mr and Mrs , offers the option of Countess in its title bar .
I shopped , then learnt they could n't deliver for three days , by which time I 'd have starved .
Mournfully , I cancelled my order and made some toast .
Waiting for it to pop , I gazed out of my window at the courtyard and the leafless tree , a blue carrier bag flying from its branches .
I saw the sun sneak over the flats opposite and cursed myself for not upgrading to an internet - enabled phone .
The adventures I could have had .
Instead , I crawl back under my laptop and watch Twitter squeaking about Pineapple Dance Studios for a little while .
Sometimes the internet is too fast , and sometimes too slow .
Sometimes it delivers news the second it happens , other times it 's a kidney , filtering facts so you 're left with just , well , waste .
But living purely online is easier than it should be .
The only difficult moment was at dusk , when I spoke out loud for the first time and sounded like Crazy Frog , slowed down .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
An Italian inventor , Enrico Dini , chairman of the company Monolite UK Ltd , has developed a huge three - dimensional printer called D - Shape that can print entire buildings out of sand and an inorganic binder .
The printer works by spraying a thin layer of sand followed by a layer of magnesium - based binder from hundreds of nozzles on its underside .
The glue turns the sand to solid stone , which is built up layer by layer from the bottom up to form a sculpture , or a sandstone building .
The D - shape printer can create a building four times faster than it could be built by conventional means , and reduces the cost to half or less .
There is little waste , which is better for the environment , and it can easily “ print ” curved structures that are difficult and expensive to build by other means .
Dini is proving the technology by creating a nine cubic meter pavilion for a roundabout in the town of Pontedera .
The printer can be moved along horizontal beams and four vertical columns , and the printer head is raised by only 5 - 10 mm for each new layer .
The printer is driven by a computer running CAD software and prints at a resolution of 25 dpi ( dots per inch ) .
The completed material resembles marble , is stronger than concrete , and does not need iron reinforcing .
The printing process can successfully create internal curves , partitions , ducting , and hollow columns .
Dini also has lunar plans for the D - shape , and is in discussions with La Scuola Normale Superiore , Norman Foster ( a UK architecture firm ) , and Alta Space , as part of the Aurora program run by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , to build a modified D - Shape that could use lunar regolith ( moon dust ) to build a moon base .
Dini will carry out trials in a vacuum chamber at Alta Space ’s facility in Pisa to ensure the process is possible in a low - atmosphere environment such as the moon .
Dini said his ultimate dream is to complete Guidi's Sagrada Familia in Barcelona , which has been under construction since 1882 and which is not expected to be completed until 2026 at the earliest .

Analog Heaven Discovers Synthesizers.com
This is the story of how Synthesizers.com was introduced to the world .
First seen by a random person and posted on the Analog Heaven forum resulting in a firestorm of skepticism , outrage , accusations , and some acceptance .
Now after 15 years , most are believers :)
How to Introduce Synthesizers.com ?
While designing the synthesizers.com product line in the late 90's , I spent some time planning how best to introduce it to the music world .
It was important for me to have products ready to ship when the website went online so I would n't get a bad reputation , especially after numerous past debacles where companies and people made promises they could n't keep .
It 's definitely going to be interesting to see the response when the product line appears all at once , but hopefully people will be pleasantly surprised .
OnLine !
The website went on - line in Feb 2000 after I got most of the pages done .
In April I decided to write a perl script to automatically display the web logs every hour , but still not much traffic .
I had n't posted the website publicly but expected it to be found by people doing random searches .
No flood ?
In May I began posting the site to various small synth - related websites .
Traffic doubled but there was still no flood .
So , near the end of May I posted the site to SynthZone and Sonic State .
There I was , right of the front page of Sonic State !
Strangely though , there was just another doubling of traffic , and virtually no email or contacts .
Down pour
Then , on the weekend of June 3 , 2000 , traffic started pouring in .
The stats page grew huge .
I was n't exactly sure where this was all coming from , but now I was starting to get a few emails asking about pricing and availability .
What is THIS !?!
Monday morning I woke up to see dozens of emails with ' synthesizers.com ' in the subject .
Wow , something has happened - but what ?
As I start reading them , some were not very nice .
This is a unexpected slap in the face for 3 years work , but why ?
Come to find out , a few weeks / months earlier , a prankster had posted a professionally - created set of graphics depicting a new synth which had duped many people in the synthesizer world .
Not being a regular reader of these forums , I missed the story .
Paul Schrieber of Synthesis - Technology who lives nearby told me about it at lunch one day but I had no idea it was such a big deal and caused such a big stink .
Anyway , this caused many folks to assume my work was another plot to overthrow the analog synth world .
They began by pixel - picking the Q119 Sequencer picture which caused me a lot of grief to create due to its size .
This was compounded by my whimsical depiction of a synth monolith linked to the home page .
And I was so proud of my new found PhotoShop abilities too !
On top of that , some people were saying the photographs on the About Us page were fake even though the only thing that was done to them was cropping .
Maybe he 's not a scientist !
Someone on the mail list decided to do a WhoIs to find the domain name owner .
They found my name , street address and my main company Arrick Robotics .
This is n't as clever as it appears since I made that information public on the Order Policy page .
But never the less , this fueled suspicion and rumors .
Another person followed the links from Robotics.com to my personal page where it was discovered I have an interest in unapproved topics such as Prophecy , Creation , Catastrophism , Ancient texts , and Archaeology .
Not only was I a hoax , now I was dumb too !
This unwound a slinky full of postings about dumb creationists , etc .
On both sides I might add .
I did n't know whether to laugh or jump off a cliff .
Yes , I 'm a real person !
As the day went on and I answered email , my endeavor was exposed for the Real Deal that it was .
Many people returned kind messages of encouragement and asked more questions about my products .
For this gracious change of heart I am thankful .
Now my goal is to get back to work producing this stuff so I can make customers happy !
In the meantime I had spent 5 hours answering email .
The paper trail
If you 're interested , here are some of the emails I received on Monday and some of the postings on Analog Heaven .
I 've left out last names to protect the craziness .
This is not all of the emails or all of the message bodies .
You can probably find those in the archives if you want .

I am writing to inquire about your line of analog synthesizers .
They look beautiful and I was wondering when they will start shipping ....
Bill Wrote :
To kick off this week 's discussions ...
What do people know about the new toys at synthesizers.com ?
Sucks / Rocks / Hoax ?
The demo mp3's sound pretty weak but the prices are compelling .
Kevin Wrote :
Jeez .... where did this all come from ?
I 've never heard of this stuff and all looks totally " Moogy " slick and at really low prices .
Who 's baby is this ?
Wow .... I 'm impressed !
Kevin Wrote :
Well there 's a few things for certain : 1 . I do n't know anyone that owns one .
2 . Things are spoken about in a " we will " , " we plan " , future kind of way .
3 . The web site has been highly developed and gives the impression of a " together company " with parts stock , assembly lines , internal server , etc .
But it 's just not very convincing .
4 . The panel designs are done , say synthesizers.com and they 're on that domain .
5 . Much of the current draws seems equal for many modules ( 8 ma or 30 ma mentioned many times on both rails )
6 . The PCB layouts seem rather simplistic .
My guess is that we 've got a some great photoshop and an electrical engineer with access to some great equipment , but possibly not his own .
There 's no reason I see why this biz can't be successful , only that it has n't seemed to start up yet .
Even if some pics like the Q119 sequencer are at different angles .
I 'm not sure the price point that 's offered can support quality in either assembly , calibration or parts .
That is , I 'm not sure this can actually be done .
The prices are low and marginally profitable , but the only way this can make money is if robots are wholly running the joint .
JT Wrote :
Are you for real ?
This all seems a little phony to me .
Mark Wrote :
* wow * ... :)
Okay , so after my heart has come back to rest ...
I 'm interested in a QSP22 , or probably a custom system .
I have a lot of modular gear now , and would love to basically add - on to it .
Steve Wrote :
I will be putting in an order in the next few weeks .
What is not available yet ?
The sequencer looks very worth while .
Mark Wrote
Oh , and in that picture that you pointed out : Q119 Sequencer Check the blur seam between the right and middle sections .
It 's clearly been " Photoshop Smudged " .
Nice looking ideas though .
Ron Wrote :
Hi Roger !
I know you 're very busy , just judging from your websites , etc .
I 'm on Analog Heaven , but I 'm an engineer / firmware guy / programmer , and have been for the last 27 years .
I have similar interests in cosmology , bible things , and eqyptology .
I have an extremely rare set of books I have collected over the years on the Great Pyramid , just because , well ... these things interest me !
BTW , I must commend you on the effort you 're going through on your modular setup !
In fact , I have to say that many of the things YOU'RE DOING , I wish I WAS .
Just letting you know there 's other " strange fellows " out there :)
THANKS !

Beyond the obvious Photoshop goofs , one would have to be a little dubious of a scientist whose interests ran to " prophesy " , etc. as described in Roger Arrick 's personal page ( Not , of course , that there 's anything cringingly absurd about them . )

Looks like a hoax to me .
Come on , the idea is to SELL , right ?
If so , then their doing a bad job .
WHO is synthesizers.com ?
Bill Wrote :
I 've been all over your page .
Your stuff looks really nice .
I think the keyboard and sequencer would be a good place to start with your line of fun .
What 's availability like ?
Eric Wrote :
Looks very promising , I 'm just a bit skeptcal after the way the new " moog " company went down ... thanks for your consideration .
Mike Wrote :
Creationists ...
That 's worse than cringingly absurd , it 's ..it's ...
GAHH !
I know this is not the correct forum , but : Major can of worms , OPEN : " Credulous acceptance of baloney can cost you money ; that 's what P. T. Barnum meant when he said , " There 's a sucker born every minute .
Mike Wrote
.... So when a modular like yours appears out of the woodwork with no known analog fanatics attached to it , it seemed suspicious to my ( admitted in print ) paranoid mind .
I 'm glad the system is real and give kudos to the effort !
( More is better , AFAIC when it comes to analog synths . )
Apologies if my post caused or causes you any trouble .
( However , I stand by my reaction to Creationism .
That 's just me , and there 's room for everyone . )
Larry Wrote
I dunno , this company seems legit .
Too bad there is no LFO module .
Only Sample & Hold .
The sequencer looks pretty darn nice too !

You 're right Mike ... AH is not the place for this discussion .
We have our " religion " ... you have yours .
But I have yet to hear from some Bible - thumper preaching to the list ... time and again it 's those who oppose it who are spouting off at the mouth with their anti-religious viewpoints .
The ISSUE was that someone interested in prophecy could not possibly be a scientist .
That the two are incompatible .
But Sir Isaac Newton ( one of the greatest scientists of all time ) also happened to write a book on prophecy : http://www.csg.net/eschatology/Newton.htm
Now back to our regularly scheduled program ....
Skye Wrote
I live down in Austin TX , and I wanted to say " Wow - Very nice work ! "
I like the looks and the pricing of your synth creations ...
Mark Wrote
Yeup , I agree ...
Too bad the pic is a fake . :)
See my previous message - there 's obvious use of a smudge tool going on , and Kevin pointed out the perspective of the knobs is all wrong , even if this was shot with a super - short lens .
At about noon I decided to respond to all of this : Hello .
I was told about the posts on Analogue Heaven by Zon .
I 've noticed that most people are questioning whether I actually exist or not so I 'm hoping this will help clarify things .
WHO AM I :
My name is Roger Arrick , I own and run Arrick Robotics ( 12 years now ) at http://www.robotics.com
, My personal information page is at http://www.robotics.com/roger.html .
I also run several websites for embedded computing at http://www.pc104.com and http://www.controlled.com
And I build synthesizers at https://www.synthesizers.com
I keep these businesses as separate as possible .
I 'm in in in the Dallas / Fort Worth Texas area in Euless at 2107 W. Euless
Blvd where I have about 3000 sq / ft - mostly manufacturing space .
Here are some other personal pictures of me http://www.robotics.com/hp and http://www.robotics.com/arobot/501c.html
In spite of how all of this looks , I 'm just one small business owner with a handfull of hard working employees .
I live in a normal 3 - bedroom house and have a family with kids and a dog , and yes , plenty of electronic toys .
THE STORY :
Back in the late 70's when building my first 8080 computers with CP /M , I became interested in synths mainly from Yes , Switched - on - Bach , genesis , and the Who .
I would skip school and drive to Arnold and Morgan music in Garland to play the Arp 2600 and Mellotrons .
My first kits were from Paia ( which still work to this day ! ) and I successfully interfaced them to my computer .
Years passed and the internet came along .
One day I discovered that there were a lot of people like me who loved vintage synths - big knobs , cabinets , and those awesome sounds that no one else has ever heard .
Eventually I decided to build a synthesizer and make it into a product line .
This would fit nicely into my existing manufacturing business and the design would last many years .
Since the best way these days to do business is over the internet I tried to acquire ' synthesizer.com ' domain name but the guy wanted $ 50 k .
So I settled for ' synthesizers.com ' and began building the product line .
In the beginning I meet Paul Schrieber who lives very close to me .
Paul is probably the smartest analog designer I 've ever met and a very good person to boot .
We got together and I was hoping we could come up with some mechanical / electrical standards so our systems would be compatible .
Paul decided against much of that .
One of the important things to me was the user interface , cabinets , and cost .
Paul being an excellent engineer , decide to use very expensive pots , etc , and I decided to use open - style carbon pots instead of listening to people complain about the price .
After a couple of years here we are , my product line is about 95 % complete and I can ship systems and most modules .
Letting people know about synthesizers.com was a strange problem .
I did n't want anyone to know until I was actually able to ship products .
In the last month or so I 've watch the access logs on the website as I 've submitted the site to various search engines .
Over the weekend ( Jun 3 , 2000 ) the logs went crazy but I did n't find out that it was because of a posting on Analog heaven until I got a call from Zon Vern Pyles .
I do n't have time to read these lists but I went to the archives and saw many postings .
Most of the postings were pleasant , but some were troubling to me and prompted this letter .
There are probably some out there that will hate me just because I build synthesizers in a way that they would n't but there 's nothing I can do about that .
I 've also received many emails from folks asking about me and it 's been a lot of fun .
Whether it will result in orders or not , who knows , this market is very strange ( and small ) but I 'm in this for the long haul .
PHOTOSHOP :
Concerning the photoshop questions .
Getting a decent image of a module is almost impossible with a camera .
I even broke down and bought a Sony FD91 and was not pleased with the results .
One night I got an idea and actually placed the modules on my HP 4C flatbed scanner and the images came out great .
This works great for single and double - wide modules , but when it came to the sequencer , I had to take 3 images and paste them together .
I 'm a bit new to this photoshop thing so my seams are n't perfect but I 'm still happy with the results .
That 's why some of the shadows and perspective are weird on the large Q119 sequencer pictures at https://www.synthesizers.com/q119.html
When going through a photoshop tutorial I created the mars / synth image on the home page which I thought people would think was cool , instead some think it 's an indication that this is all a fake .
In fact one email I got said " what 's with the crappy photoshop renderings ? " .
I try not to let this impact me but it usually does .
FINALLY :
Anyway , I do n't plan to change anyone 's mind with words alone , I love to build things and I expect this product line to last for 10 - 20 years .
In a couple of years everyone will know that I 'm for real because there will be many systems out there .
There will probably be a magazine review or two in a few months you people are welcome to wait and see .
There are no plans to add to the product line beyond the ' future ' page shown at the website .
This is a small business and it always will be , that 's why it will work well for me .
I hope this clears some things up .
PS : Anyone who has built a website the size of synthesizers.com knows that it is n't some kid pulling a prank .

I think the people of Analog Heaven are universally in favor of your entry into the market .
However , a quick word of explanation ( from my perspective ) on why you may have had a slightly negative response ...
For the past several months there has been a hoax running on AH and other mailing lists - some clown put together some gorgeous Photoshop renderings of a new synthesizer , along with other marketing material , and leaked them in strategic locations on the Net .
It had a lot of people fooled - myself among them - and in the end , most of us quite upset to learn that it was all a hoax .
So we 're a little twitchy .
So again - it 's nice to see your new equipment .
May your fortunes rise - Mark Wrote :
Well , I for one will apologize to you for doubting , but there 's been a number of " fun and games " out here in the world revolving around synths in the last couple of weeks .
And then there was a bit of a catastrophe regarding the " rebirth " of Moog over the last few years via Don Martin .
The " fun and games " revolved around a full - blown faked up ad campaign for a major polyphonic synth .
We 're talking someone creating a 3D wireframe and taking it to the hilt .
The spoof lasted about 6 weeks and had a lot of people fooled .
Anyway ...
Welcome to the real world !
Congrats on the accomplishment , and I most certainly will look closely at putting a system together .
Kevin Wrote :
Basically you 'll have to consider that we 've been duped in AH land several times before and when we see such a slick site , it raises questions .
I did n't doubt you really , only some of what was shown on the site .
( I 've been doing the panels on the scanner for quite some time too .... pretty hip , eh ? :)
As for your work , I wish you utter and complete success . :)
Even if you do n't need or want dealers , I would be happy to show some of your work to some very interested parties at no charge .

The original prank included a fake scan of a magazine review , you could even read the print - through from the " back " of the faked page .

As a member of the analogue heaven list , I would like to apologize for the dragging through the mud you took recently from some of the members .
There are obviously a few rabid members who like to tear any , and everyone down .
Most of us , however , are a little more well mannered .
I am very interested in your systems .
I 'm working on gathering my pennies together to see how much of a system I can afford .
I was looking at the Doepfer and MOTM systems mostly , but now I 've seen yours and I like what I see .
Besides , like me , you are a Texan .
I 'm in San Antonio .
Look forward to dealing with you in the near future .

Thanks for your very upfront post to AH on the synthesizers.com issue ( or non-issue ) .
As one who is anticipating purchasing a modular in the future , I 'm glad to see another participant .
Mark Wrote :
Keep reading through the AH mail today ...
This has all been explained .
The nay - sayers ( that 'd be a few of us here , including me ) were wrong on this one , and we 've all apologized to Roger .
He and I flipped mail for a while today .
He 's quite amazed at how bad his timing seems to of been in the wake of the Sage .
Nice guy , building what looks to be nice gear at incredible prices .
I know I 'm interested in checking it out more .
Paul Wrote :
1. congratulations to synthesizers.com for taking the highly unusual step of manufacturing product BEFORE announcing it , or taking our money .
This is contrary to standard industry procedure .
I suppose you could say that he has accidentally produced a brilliant ' anti- hoax ' in the mirror image of the Sage , even producing a ' faked ' image of a ' real ' synth !
2. send all this god / dog stuff to AHOT
3. wasnt the ' prophesy ' a synth anyway ?
I 'm tired !
Time to go to bed
What a day .....

2015 - 15 year anniversary comments on FB
15 years ago this week , the analog synth community stumbled upon my website and an uproar ensued .
After 3 years of work to get a full product line ready , I was shocked at the reaction .
I was called a hoaxster , and worse , and told I would n't survive the market if it was real .
It was one of the worst days of my life .
Well , that 's all behind us now .

You 'll never guess what I caught today :
The giant hammerhead shark hauled from the deep
A group of fishermen were delighted when they caught a shark in the warm waters off Australia 's east coast .
So imagine their surprise when there was a bigger tug and they realised their catch was being swallowed by an even bigger fish .
This giant , weighing one and a quarter tonnes and measuring 20ft long , was caught off the north coast of New South Wales and is thought to be at least 40 years old .
Monster from the deep : Shark museum boss Vic Hislop with the giant hammerhead shark caught off NSW 's northern coast
Vic Hislop , who runs a shark museum in Queensland , was so excited by news of the catch that he bought the shark , which died as it was hauled to shore .
' It 's a magnificent specimen , that 's for sure , ' said Mr Hislop .
' I 'm planning to freeze it and then put it on display at the shark museum . '
Some species of hammerheads are on the global endangered list but they are not renowned for attacking humans , unlike the man-eating great white shark .
What might be a warning for swimmers to exercise caution about where they chose to swim is Mr Hislop 's comment to Brisbane 's Courier Mail that ' while this one is huge , it 's not the biggest one I 've seen ' .
Sharks are known to feed at dawn and dusk , so people are advised to avoid the ocean at those times to further reduce their small chance of a shark attack .
Hammerheads , which are found in warm waters around the world , get their name from the shape of their heads , which are flattened and extend sideways .
This is thought to help them move in close to their prey and to find food on the sea bed .
While they are not notorious for killing humans , the International Shark Attack file lists them as seventh among sharks that pose a danger to people , the most dangerous being the great white .
Introduction
Microsoft has made a significant investment in Parallel computing features with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0 .
Often the best way to understand new features is to look at core feature components and then find the core features or concepts within ; proceeding deeper and finding a set of components that seem to be everywhere .
The Task Parallel Library ( TPL ) is a core part of parallel computing in the .NET Framework .
The Task class is the heart of TPL .
I 'm going to explain how a developer can use the Task class to leverage TPL .
A New Model
While a developer could leverage the TPL through features that existed in prior versions of Microsoft Visual Studio and the .NET Framework , truly getting all the benefits of TPL requires architectural approaches that may be new to many .NET developers .
I think of TPL as following a new kind of model that simply extends familiar concepts like threads , delegates , and the Threadpool .
Models follow prescriptive patterns to solve problems and work in a particular context .
The first step along the path to understanding the new model is becoming acquainted with the ideas behind the new model .
The basic ideas are as follows :
Delegates are references to functions .
Delegates can be passed around an application without passing a full reference to a class .
A developer can control the flow of an application by organizing and invoking data structures containing delegates .
Delegates can be passed to Threads in the ThreadPool or to Threads created in the application .
Developers use multiple threads to improve application performance and responsiveness .
Because threads can run concurrently and often data structures are shared by two concurrently running threads , executing delegates must control how they access shared data structures .
An executing delegate must signal or lock a shared data structure before changing the data structure .
Locking data structures and creating too many Threads can introduce bottlenecks and / or consume resources in an application and can defeat the purpose of multi-threading .
To really grasp how to apply TPL requires code .
For the remainder of the article I 'm going to walk through some sample TPL code that demonstrates how Task works with other TPL classes .
TPL Core and Sample Code
There are two namespaces that encapsulate many of the TPL classes : System .
Threading .
Tasks and System . Collections .
Concurrent .
Here is a list of some of the classes you 'll find in the namespaces .
Task
TaskScheduler
TaskFactory
TaskCancelledException
BlockingCollection <T>
The code below taken from page 55 in the " Patterns of Parallel Programming " whitepaper on the Microsoft Parallel Computing web site ; utilizes classes from each namespace .
static void ProcessFile ( string inputPath , string outputPath ) { var inputLines = new BlockingCollection < string >( ) ; var processedLines = new BlockingCollection < string >( ) ; // Stage # 1 var readLines = Task.Factory .StartNew (( ) => { try { foreach ( var line in File.ReadLines ( inputPath ) ) inputLines .
Add( line ) ; } finally { inputLines.CompleteAdding ( ) ; } } ) ; // Stage # 2 var processLines = Task.Factory .StartNew (( ) => { try { foreach ( var line in inputLines. GetConsumingEnumerable ( ) .
Select ( line => Regex .Replace ( line , @ " \s + " , " , " ) ) ) { processedLines .
Add( line ) ; } } finally { processedLines.CompleteAdding ( ) ; } } ) ; // Stage # 3 var writeLines = Task.Factory .StartNew (( ) => { File.WriteAllLines( outputPath , processedLines.GetConsumingEnumerable ( ) ) ; } ) ; Task.WaitAll( readLines , processLines , writeLines ) ; }
As you can see , this is an interesting piece of code .
It looks sequential , yet the subject of this article is parallel computing .
If you 've seen or written multithreaded applications before , you 're probably not used to seeing a program structured this way .
TPL hides much of the ugliness you 've seen in multithreaded and asynchronous code .
Now let 's break down how this code executes .
As promised earlier in the article , I 'm starting with the role of the Task class .
Keith 's note :
Only a week and a half remain before the much - anticipated Space Summit at NASA KSC on 15 April .
While no public mention has been made as to venue , agenda , participants , audience etc. , there does seem to be a general consensus forming behind the scenes as to what sort of rethinking might be acceptable to all parties with regard to where NASA human spaceflight is going .
This is the consensus that seems to forming in and among NASA , OSTP , and NSC : Ares 1 and 5 remain cancelled .
Orion is continued - but in a " Lite " variant designed to ferry people to and from ISS .
This " Orion Lite " would fly on human - rated EELVs and would be , in essence , a government competitor to what NASA is also encouraging the so - called " Merchant 7 " ( SpaceX , Orbital et al ) to develop .
The commercial activities would remain unchanged from what was announced in February .
Meanwhile , NASA will continue to fly the Space Shuttle albeit at a stretched out rate ( 2 or so flights / year ) while ET production is restarted .
In addition to closing the " gap " for American human spaceflight , stretched out Space Shuttle operations will allow a rapid implementation of a Shuttle - C ( " Sidemount " ) HLV to be developed .
This Shuttle - C HLV will carry cargo , but no crew .
The Shuttle - C will be a direct upgrade to the existing Space Shuttle Orbiter system with only the Orbiter replaced with engines and a cargo carrier .
Everything else remains the way it is now .
DIRECT and other " inline " shuttle - derived concepts are no longer being given serious consideration .
With specific regard to DIRECT , despite their voluminous and detailed claims , the costs that they depend upon to make their case are simply incorrect and not credible - and NASA knows this ( they checked with the companies involved ) .
This is all about cost right now .
Accurate costs .
While keeping Orion alive , NASA will also seek to develop a human - rated exploration spacecraft that only operates in space .
The initial version will likely use unused ISS modules ( enhanced MPLMs , Node X , Hab Module , ISS ECLSS ) and Constellation systems .
Its component parts would be launched by the Shuttle / Shuttle - C . The exploration vehicle will be assembled on - orbit at the ISS .
This exploration spacecraft will be a pathfinder for more complex systems that will be able to traverse cis-lunar space on a regular basis .
These ideas will be voiced by various participants at the Space Summit .
It is anticipated that NASA will be called upon to do a routine 30 - 60 study following the summit and that formal White House approval would come some time during the Summer .
If adopted by the White House , and accepted by Congress , this " compromise " ( no doubt the White House will want to use some euphemism instead ) will bring layoff numbers back down from the looming abyss that overt Constellation cancellation and Shuttle retirement would have caused ; keeps the Administration 's interest in commercial space alive ; retains in - house NASA experience in human spaceflight systems ( development and operations ) , brings the ISS to its full potential - and then some ; and looks to field human - rated spacecraft capable of leaving LEO much sooner than Constellation is ever likely to have done .
Of course , as with just about anything associated with this Space Summit , its stealth modus operandi , and interagency squabbles , this may all change , your mileage may vary , etc .
As always , stay tuned .
Survival is tough -- especially in space .
Eve Online is a game of depth and mystery , one wrong step and you will find yourself on the wrong side of a laser turret ; go into this game unprepared and welcome a myriad of confusion and tender despair .
My mission was simple ; survive in Eve Online for eight weeks and report my trials and tribulations .
I knew this would be hard but still I was unprepared .
This is Eve Online Survivor Guy .
Week Five : Down and Out in New Eden
It has been five long weeks since I started my survival in Eve Online , I had enjoyed my experience but constantly tasted the bittersweet element of mind boggling depth the game offers .
As I now stand in my survival I feel myself hitting a brick wall ; I am now static , without purpose , unknowing of what I am to do next but scrabbling for my next hit of space adventure which the game dangles above like a metaphorical pot of gold at the end of the rainbow .
Most of my playing time had been cancelled down , invested in pursuits of knowledge on the Internet , a frantic search for some sort of hint or tip , helpful comments on previous posts seemingly have yielded more questions .
I knew Eve Online was to be a difficult mistress , I had heard the tales of its murderous learning curve , now I bore witness to those foreboding scenes .
Since I last left off in detailing my experiences I had found a corporation and subsequently left it in search for a more helpful establishment .
This was a quest I would find myself indulged in for days ; I would search in - game and in - browser for newbie corporations but to no avail , oh sure they were certainly out there but the mountainous applications they receive seemingly relegated me to a long waiting list , it 's like they think I am not important .
The one corporation that had taken my eye was Eve University , a name that would constantly be paraded in front of my vision as I asked for help or guidance .
After finding them I applied and waited ; and I waited more .
Finally I decided to ask how long it would take for my induction into the University - I was promptly told around five days .
What was I to do for this amount of time ?
Search for another Corp ?
Seek out helpful players ?
This week of my survival was going to be testing to my patience and will .
From research and simply conversing with other players , this is perhaps the hardest test of Eve Online , persevering with the game when everything seems at its darkest .
I had indulged in missions and mining for the past month and now I wished to progress , take the next step -- apparently this was corporation warfare but as of yet I had not had much luck with this element .
Unlike most games of the genre , Eve Online simply plunges you into its virtual world and lets you decide on your actions and path .
Coming from games such as EverQuest and the like , this is a real shock to the system , where most games guide you by hand , Eve Online simply refuses , and this is why I now find myself hitting the brick wall of static progress .
I desperately wished to continue and advance but this week was becoming a very hard week for survival .
My week consisted of my routine pursuits ; I would run a dozen or so missions ; use guides and tips to plan my progress into becoming a better combat pilot , then I would mine and haul back with my frigate .
In this time I had amassed a modest amount of wealth , a handful of ships including : a Catalyst , an Iterion Mark II and III and also a Retriever ( a ship I had simply bought in an effort to mine more without having the skills to do so ) I thought I had achieved something with my time , I was enjoying myself also but I could n't help but feel I was going nowhere and fast .
The goals I had set myself early on and simply disappeared , every guide I read told me to pick and choose a path but my objectives simply fell by the wayside .
I had pitted all of my hope and efforts on receiving an invitation into one of the many rookie Corporations I had applied to , this seems like a bad plan but during this week I felt like I had nowhere else to turn .
I need guidance and someone to really explain the advanced basics .
Helpful comments on this very website would explain what I should do and usually these would involve joining a Corporation but I was finding this a very hard prospect , just how does one really go about finding such an establishment that is not only good but understanding to a rookie ?
I had joined and left numerous Corporations by now and all of them were seemingly empty voids existing only to constantly increase in number .
I was despairing at the game for lack of a better word ; I needed something to really reinvigorate my time in the game .
Of course my week was simply becoming a waiting game and in search of excitement and a break in the norm I was to take a metaphorical leaf out of the scoundrel book .
I needed to catch a little adrenaline before I hopefully moved on and so I was to try a method that I had read about , it sounded devilishly naughty but what the hell ?
I was a rookie on a waiting list ; the devil makes work of idle thumbs after all .
Activating my Catalyst I set out into the nearest populated asteroid field , after scanning around I came across one player with a very small ship simply mining into a jettisoned can - this pilot 's foolish trust in space was his undoing .
After around twenty minutes of simply watching from afar I surmised that this can was probably filled with a generous amount of Veldspar , I moved quickly , making a bookmark of this place I returned to my station and made use of my Iterion Mark III , warping back to my prospective crime scene I came upon the jettisoned can and swiftly devoured the content .
With rapid clicks I set about warping back to the station with my ill gotten gains , there I waited , sold my wares and sat smugly like a proud space vagabond .
Space piracy had always sounded like a great idea to me , who does n't like pirates after all ?
I had imagined myself a sort of space traveling Black Beard , commandeering anything I see , plundering all and making good use of Space Rum .
This little excursion was exciting and made me feel like a joyful child , I craved more ; I craved violence and a chance to flex my Catalyst 's muscle .
I returned a little later after my theft to the same asteroid field and found that while my victim had departed , possibly in a funk of depression , several others remained ; mining for my ore .
Weighing up my prospective combatants , naturally I choose the weakest and smallest of them all .
Approaching him I spotted my target , the jettisoned can , with a few simple clicks I had stolen my fill of his gains and waited .
The inevitable laser shot came and I was in business .
Moving quickly I targeted the pilot and unleashed the fury of my six turrets .
It all ended with a satisfying explosion .
Space pirate was I .
Week five had been a difficult week .
I had carried on in my routine activities and had found this a little disparaging , I ultimately wanted to advance and progress but had found myself hitting a brick wall , I had become static and it was becoming the greatest threat to my survival .
In many ways this week had become filler , just something I had to get through until hopefully my application to Eve University and others may be accepted .
In order to satiate my despair I had indulged in the adventurous and devilish piracy that I had heard of , of course in a very minor scale but it was exciting and enjoyable .
Still I found myself scrabbling and on the ropes , my survival in Eve Online was becoming tougher and now it had become a battle of will .
Would I be able to continue if my fortunes did n't look up ?
Once thing is for sure , I had a hell of a lot of reading to be doing .
Join me next week as I continue ....
The full extent of operations would n't be revealed until six years after Erhard was prattling about Scientology trying to kill him , when the world learned of Operation Snow White , which was L. Ron 's little attempt to improve his reputation by stealing and destroying nasty files the government had on him .
If you really want to get the thetans out of your head , you 'll deal with this Erhard guy for me .

Yep , the Scientologists were after Erhard , not because they hated his beliefs or anything , but because he was making money off of brainwashing people using some of their techniques , and they hated having the competition .
Scientology spammed the poor bastard with so many private detectives that they had five file cabinets full of documents about him .
So , even crazy cult leaders can be right sometimes .
Wait ... does this mean when Scientologists complain that other people are conspiring against them , we should take their word for it ?
No .
No it does n't .

I was , to say the least , slightly disappointed .
There is no secret code , no password , no futuristic RFID chip implanted straight into my retina allowing me instant , bar - coded access to gleaming glass corridors in the NSA , Goldman Sachs and the U.S. Treasury .
There 's not even a diamond - encrusted golden key in the shape of a dollar sign that opens recessed steel doors to underground lairs or private cocaine stashes stored in the perfect vaginas of flawless Brazilian supermodels .
Alas .
Also , no blood .
No swapping of any bodily fluids whatsoever , no ceremony where you go to a sweaty , fur - lined conference room , the lawyer stabs his palm , you stab your palm , and you chant some sort of dark incantation to the gods of filthy lucre , offshore bank accounts and D.C. lobbyists .
As you shake bloody hands , you swear to oppress the workers , exploit the tax code and patron multiple Vegas whorehouses and / or LA fetish nightclubs for your Republican Party / NRA donor slut - fests .
But none of that really matters .
Despite the lack of expected ritual and violence , I now officially own your pathetic and meager soul .
It 's true .
I have joined my corporate brothers in holding draconian dominion over all you see and hear and say and do and read and believe , forever and ever .
Amen .
Just the way it is .
Let me explain .
See , I have become a corporation .
A real one .
I have launched a full - blown company , with shareholders ( me ) and a president ( me ) and a full board of directors ( me , me and me ) .
And we are , all of us , in total and complete control .
This is how I discovered all the above insights and secrets -- and a great deal more that I cannot really share with you meager commoners -- as I transitioned from lowly , average tax - paying citizen just like you , into giant , megalomaniacal corporate fat - cat tyrant just like , um , Saudi Arabia .
It was kind of fun .
It happened , as such transformations are wont to do , somewhat unexpectedly , surprisingly , the pieces falling into place like Satan 's dominoes , the Dark Fates of capitalism slapping me on the back and welcoming me into the gilded halls of power and influence , even as they calmly removed a huge chunk of my soul .
Did n't feel a thing , really .
Except for all the screaming .
After the act was done , they handed me the deed to what 's known as an " S " corporation , so termed for the portion of the American tax code it happily exploits so that I -- or rather , my fine corporation -- may now purchase many rarified American goods , such as congresspersons , Supreme Court justices and Malaysian sweatshop workers , without remorse , guilt or concern for pesky trifles known as " ethics . "
You perhaps think I am joking ?
I am not joking .
The name of my corporation is Rapture Machine , Inc .
It is a publishing company , so formed to help me issue my first amazing , tell - all book , the dazzling mega - compendium known as " The Daring Spectacle , " which is available for purchase right here , right now .
Have you ordered one yet ?
Have you ordered , say , five ?
Do you know any angry Republicans ?
They 'll love it .
Give them two .
Why go corporate , you may ask from way down there , in your lowly status as pitiable worker cog lemming creature I no longer have to concern myself with in the slightest ?
Simple : because it was the best way to organize my life and finances as a freelance writer , author and now , overlord of all that is and ever will be .
It just made sense .
See , as I was preparing to self - publish my epic book , I was informed that some of the larger printing houses preferred to work with " real " companies , not individual authors .
So I started Rapture Machine as a tiny sole proprietorship in San Francisco .
But one thing led to another , and on the advice of sage tax accountant counsel , I decided to go all in , and become the Man .
A small pile of lawyer 's fees , an initial shareholder 's meeting , and an $ 800 annual filing with the California Attorney General later , and I have my " S " corporation .
Just like that .
Just like Exxon .
Just like Wal - Mart .
Nike .
I can feel what 's left of my soul shriveling away already .
Just like Dick Cheney .
As you might guess , it was quite the unexpected transmutation , from humble writer and yoga teacher to heartless totalitarian kingpin , all in a matter of days .
But I have to say , it 's been completely wonderful so far .
Except for the nightmares .
And the spiders .
And the zombie clowns .
Otherwise , awesome .
No longer do I walk among you as an equal .
No longer must I concern myself with petty nuisances such as fairness , justice , human decency .
The Supreme Court said so ; I no longer have to care .
Like any American corporation worth its inbred cronyism , my company is only really beholden to one entity : its shareholders .
Of course , as I am the sole shareholder in my corporation , that means , well , me .
Hence , I am only beholden to me , to making me as rich and mercilessly profitable as my shareholders demand that I be , for me , as far as I know .
God bless America .
Perhaps you think I cannot really get away with this .
Perhaps you think there are regulations and laws governing such wanton behavior , that I cannot , say , hire employees for pennies per day and make then mix me fine whiskey drinks and crawl around on all fours wearing only boy shorts and a smile , as they recite poetry and fulfill book requests and update my Facebook fan page .
What are you , high ?
Have you not been paying attention ?
Did you see how many of my vile brethren over on Wall Street are mocking Congress and Obama alike , still giving multi-million dollar bonuses as they engage in the same behavior that nearly caused the fall of the empire ?
Are you not watching the oil titans continue to rape the land worldwide ?
Nothing has changed , plebe .
And it never will .
In fact , we corporate gods laugh in the face of your puny pleas for , um , whatever the hell it is people like you plead for .
Decent wages ?
Health care ?
A tolerable ending to " Lost " ?
Whatever .
I can barely even hear you from way up here on my gilded throne of sticky , glorious evil .
It 's the American dream .
Hey , want to be my intern ?

Investigators on Thursday presented evidence pointing to North Korean involvement in the sinking of the Navy corvette Cheonan on March 26 , including the font style of the serial number 1 handwritten on the rear part of the salvaged propulsion shaft of a torpedo .
It was compared with a North Korean training torpedo retrieved in 2003 , which bears the serial number 4 in Korean .
It is clear that the torpedo was made by the North , given that only two countries , South and North Korea , use Hangeul for inscriptions on weapons such as torpedoes , and the fragment did not come from the South , a spokesman for the investigators explained .

All parties to the debate have the same evidence to draw on ; their conclusions are another matter .
Lindzen and Emanuel ’s collision spotlights the ultimate sticking point :
What steps should we take , and at what cost ?
That is :
How much insurance against the possibility of catastrophe should a prudent planet buy ?
The story of the scientists ’ relationship is much more than a curiosity .
The fact that these serious - minded colleagues and longtime friends disagree so vehemently highlights the immense difficulty of finding common ground on human - caused global warming .
That ’s because their disagreements are not just about interpretations of scientific data , but about how they assess the risks , amid the uncertainty over global warming ’s future impact .
Lindzen has implied that Emanuel is hyping the evidence and making a play for fame and funding in the age of Obama and Gore .
In a letter savaging an opinion piece by Emanuel in the Globe , he branded the reasoning “ more advocacy than assessment . ’’
Emanuel thinks Lindzen ’s key theories do n’t hold up , and just two weeks ago went public with his criticism , penning a tart letter to the editor rebutting Lindzen ’s Journal piece — “ irresponsible and misleading , ’’ he called it , “ advancing spurious hypotheses . ’’
“ I do n’t see how a climate scientist can look at the evidence and not see risk , ’’ he said recently .
Emanuel , an equally respected researcher , emerged as a preeminent voice on climate change ’s potential dangers after he published a paper three weeks before Katrina that suggested global warming might be making hurricanes more powerful .
Named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine , Emanuel , 55 , says he has been persuaded by the evolving science that man-made climate change is a real threat .
Lindzen , a leading specialist on atmospheric physics , has emerged as one of the most prominent climate change skeptics in the world .
At age 70 , he speaks at home and overseas , arguing that there is little to worry about from emissions of heat - trapping gases from power plants , factories , and cars .
We should “ go back to dealing with real science and real environmental problems such as assuring clean air and water , ’’ he wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Earth Day .
But then the climate changed between them .
Friends became intellectual foes , dueling icons in one of the world ’s most acrimonious political debates .
Richard Lindzen and Kerry Emanuel are both brilliant and convivial .
Both study the atmosphere and climate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where their offices overlooking the Charles River are one floor apart .
In an academic world often dominated by liberals , both have strong conservative streaks and once agreed that the evidence for catastrophic man-made global warming just was n’t there .
It is no surprise they grew to be friends .
Emanuel would borrow Lindzen ’s slides for his talks and the duo would have lunch and the occasional dinner together .
They were n’t best friends , but far closer than mere colleagues .
In 1990 , Emanuel ’s future wife , Susan , who was living in France at the time , attended a scientific talk he gave in England .
Lindzen was there and asked a question of Emanuel that Susan saw as hostile .
She marched up afterward to give him a piece of her mind — and ran headlong into his charm .
Back then , Emanuel agreed there was n’t yet enough evidence .
Computer models that tried to project future warming were woefully inadequate .
Temperature data showing recent warming did n’t demonstrate a clear trend .
He reviewed the evidence and came away a skeptic about the projections of future catastrophe .
He came to see opportunism in some of those loudly sounding the global warming alarm — especially as they raced to obtain a piece of the growing pot of federal research funding on the topic .
The professor who once cast his presidential vote for Democrat Michael Dukakis became a Republican .
“ That ’s when I thought , wow , things have gotten really out of hand , ’’ Lindzen said recently .
In 1988 , he began questioning an emerging environmental issue : Man-made climate change .
An economist had written him , saying he had been interrupted by then - Senator Al Gore at a Washington lunch for daring to suggest that there was uncertainty about the case for global warming .
Lindzen delights in questioning many assumptions that most people accept as truths .
He smokes Marlboro Lights and does n’t worry much about dying from them .
He doubts that acid rain was ever much of a problem .
It was classic wry Lindzen and Emanuel found himself drawn to this colleague with the bushy beard and piercing eyes , this entertaining conversationalist with wide - ranging interests , from food to photography .
Emanuel , who is more buttoned - down and cautious — he dislikes attending large sporting events because the crowd mentality unsettles him — saw a little of himself in Lindzen ’s aversion to the status quo .
Emanuel , who had recently voted for Ronald Reagan , was espousing his views .
Lindzen , at that time a registered Democrat , looked up and said , as Emanuel recalls : “ You ’re to the right of Attila the Hun . ’’
Emanuel had to laugh .
He and Lindzen were at lunch in a university dining hall in the early 1980s , shortly after both arrived at MIT in what is now the program in Atmospheres , Oceans and Climate .
“ If these two guys ca n’t agree on the basic conclusions of the social significance of [ climate change science ] , how can we expect 6.5 billion people to ? ’’ said Roger Pielke Jr. , a University of Colorado at Boulder professor who writes a climate blog .
Still , immersion in the controversy seemed to help Emanuel find a public voice .
He wrote a 2007 article in a national magazine , the Boston Review , explaining climate change science , and it was made into a book .
He penned an opinion piece in The Boston Globe this past February .
His message is measured : Climate change may not be as bad as some computer models predict , but the odds are just as good it could be worse .
So - called hurricane wars broke out among climate scientists .
Colleagues , including Lindzen in private , questioned Emanuel ’s findings , and Emanuel himself came to temper his conclusions .
Earlier this year , hurricane specialists — including Emanuel — agreed that it is not clear warming oceans have already made hurricanes fiercer , but that it is likely they eventually will .
He came to be viewed , Pielke said , “ not as scientist but a symbol in the debate . ’’
According to his friends , the mild - mannered and deliberative professor was unprepared for the limelight .
Later that month , Katrina slammed into New Orleans , catapulting Emanuel to fame .
The link between hurricanes and global warming instantly gained a much wider audience : Promotions for the Al Gore global warming movie , “ An Inconvenient Truth , ’’ featured smokestack emissions fueling a hurricane .
In August 2005 , Emanuel published a paper in the journal Nature that linked rising North Atlantic and North Pacific sea surface temperatures , possibly from global warming , to fiercer hurricanes in the previous 30 years .
Hurricanes are fed by warm ocean water , and he projected they would become more powerful if climate change continued heating oceans .
“ It ’s like a trial , ’’ Emanuel said in an interview .
“ None of the evidence is perfect , but it all points in one direction . ’’
As the decade progressed , Emanuel said it became hard for him to ignore the growing evidence that man-made climate change could indeed cause problems .
Computer models of the climate , while still imperfect , improved , and there were 10 more years of temperature data .
He was swayed .
Intrigued , Emanuel tried to verify Lindzen ’s analysis with his own calculations .
He — and other scientists — could n’t , and Emanuel began to think that his friend may have gotten it wrong .
To the contrary , he argues , water vapor and clouds could actually have a cooling effect .
In an early 1990s paper , Lindzen challenged a widely - accepted assumption about global warming — that the amount of water vapor will increase in the atmosphere as the earth heats up , amplifying warming .
It was n’t long before she was friends with Lindzen and his wife , Nadine , a native of France .
Emanuel and Susan stayed at the Lindzens ’ apartment in Paris .
The Lindzens visited a home the Emanuels bought in Burgundy .
Back home , the couples began dining three or four times a year — get - togethers that would continue even as the husbands ’ scientific views diverged .
Lindzen watched his colleague become a media star with growing unease .
He says that man-made emissions are a small factor in climate change and does n’t agree that global warming poses a worrisome threat ; and his water vapor theory is not the only reason .
“ The evidence as I see it says that the risk is so small , ’’ he said in an e-mail .
“ We are proposing trillion dollar solutions to a problem that is much less serious . ’’
He began to see questionable motivations in Emanuel ’s transformation into a scientist outspoken about the possible dangers from global warming .
Emanuel “ would tell me that he really felt that it would be a mistake not to take advantage of the issue . . . there is funding . . . it could benefit the department , ’’ Lindzen said in an interview .
“ I always took a more moralistic view .
There has to be a foundation . ’’
What had been an academic dispute was about to become personal .
Debate gets hotter Emanuel , after casting an uncharacteristic vote for Obama in part because of his promise to combat climate change , threw a small inauguration party with his wife in their Lexington home .
Emanuel , after casting an uncharacteristic vote for Obama in part because of his promise to combat climate change , threw a small inauguration party with his wife in their Lexington home .
Lindzen was n’t happy about Obama ’s win , of course , but he and his wife good - naturedly went to be with friends .
Champagne flowed .
But Obama ’s inauguration proved to be a turning point , both for climate policy and for Lindzen and Emanuel .
The new president ’s pledge to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and international climate treaty talks , catapulted global warming into the headlines like never before .
With the stakes raised , the climate debate became more polarized and venomous , and scientists including Lindzen and Emanuel were tugged into the fray .
In March 2009 , Lindzen took a jab at Emanuel and another colleague in a speech for the Heartland Institute , a conservative think tank , that assailed the political nature of climate science and funding .
Lindzen said many scientists endorse man-made global warming because it “ just makes their lives easier .
“ For example , my colleague , Kerry Emanuel , received relatively little recognition until he suggested that hurricanes might become stronger in a warmer world , ’’ the speech reads .
“ He then was inundated with professional recognition . ’’
The comments , while literally true , suggested that Emanuel ’s science was tainted by other motivations .
Emanuel wo n’t talk about the incident , other than to say that he never spoke to Lindzen about the speech and that he ’s over it .
Lindzen said his words were interpreted incorrectly by some people .
Among several MIT colleagues , however , the comments became infamous .
In July , Emanuel confronted his friend after he saw that Lindzen had signed on to a strongly worded letter to Congress by climate skeptics .
“ We are flooded with claims that the evidence is clear , that the debate is closed , that we must act immediately , etc , but in fact there is no such evidence ; it does n’t exist , ’’ the letter said .
Emanuel fired off an e-mail asking Lindzen to explain himself .
Of course there was evidence , Emanuel argued , and Lindzen knew it .
“ I saw it as untruthful , ’’ Emanuel said in an interview .
“ And it was to Congress . ’’
Lindzen agreed the letter could have been written better , but felt it needed to get to Congress as soon as possible .
Months later , Emanuel and Lindzen participated in MIT ’s The Great Climategate Debate , about the significance of a batch of leaked e-mails among top climate scientists , which had sparked questions about their integrity and data .
Emanuel sat next to Lindzen at the event last December .
At one point — as the two sparred about funding sources for climate skeptics and scientists — Emanuel stopped in midsentence .
He touched Lindzen on the shoulder , and said : “ By the way , I want to make something very clear .
He ’s not part of the machine .
Dick Lindzen is his own machine . ’’
Lindzen laughed .
But the pleasantry could not mask a tough year for their relationship .
Lindzen attended Emanuel ’s annual department Christmas party in his home , and the two saw each other at an autumn wedding , but they have not picked up the phone to socialize with each other in the past year .
Then late last month , Emanuel publicly scolded Lindzen for his Earth Day piece .
“ Mr. Lindzen clings to his agenda of denial , ’’ Emanuel wrote .
When asked whether his relationship with Emanuel has changed because of their views on global warming , Lindzen said opaquely in an e-mail , “ That is a complicated question . ’’
Emanuel is also loath to talk about it .
He acknowledges , however , that their relationship has become “ strained . ’’

The Human Rights
Act has been in force for nearly a decade .
It is now at the centre of English public law – featuring in nearly half the cases in the House of Lords and the Supreme Court .
But it has not been popular .
The Conservative Party is now firmly committed to the repeal of the Human Rights Act and its replacement with a “ Bill of Rights and Responsibilities ” .
David Cameron recently said
“ we ’ll scrap the Human Rights Act , which has put our police in the ridiculous position of trying to tackle the most serious crimes without putting the faces of the most wanted criminals on posters , and made it incredibly difficult for the government to deport people who they know to be threat .
Instead , what we need is a modern British Bill of Rights which clearly sets out people ’s rights and responsibilities , and strengthens our hand in the fight against terrorism and crime ” .
The Labour Government has also expressed a preference for a “ British Bill of Rights ” but has not put any legislation before parliament .
Many lawyers and NGOs have criticised the Conservative proposals as unworkable and as detracting from the real achievements of the Human Rights
Act over the past ten years .
This is one of the most important areas of legal debate in the General Election .
Times Newspapers have joined with Matrix Chambers to organise a forum to discuss these issues .
The forum is followed by a public debate on the motion
“ Should the Human Rights Act be scrapped and replaced by a British Bill of Rights ? ”
Arguing that the answer is “ yes ” :
David Davis Conservative Parliamentary Candidate , Civil Liberties campaigner , Former Shadow Home Secretary
Martin Howe QC Member of the Conservative Party commission to create a Bill of Rights
Andy Hayman Former Assistant Commissioner and Head of Counter Terrorism
Arguing that the answer is “ no ”
Cherie Booth QC ­– a leading barrister specialising in public law , human rights , employment and European Community law
Lord Falconer – Former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
Shami Chakrabati – Director of Liberty
The debate will begin at 5.45 pm .
It will be preceded , in the afternoon between 2.00 and 5.30 pm by a forum on the Bill of Rights and the Human Rights Act , Chaired by Rabinder Singh QC .
The speakers and participants include : Alex Bailin QC , Professor Frank Brennan ( Chair of the Australian National Human Rights Consultation Committee ) , Katie Ghose ( British Institute of Human Rights ) Professor Francesca Klug , Professor AileenMcColgan , Karon Monaghan QC , Tim Owen QC , Jessica Simor , Hugh Tomlinson QC .
There is a special reduced a rate of £ 50 for both the forum and the debate for readers of the UKSC Blog .

BBC News , Bagram
Inmates from the old prison at Bagram have been moved elsewhere Afghan prisoners are being abused in a " secret jail " at Bagram airbase , according to nine witnesses whose stories the BBC has documented .
The abuses are all said to have taken place since US President Barack Obama was elected , promising to end torture .
The US military has denied the existence of a secret detention site and promised to look into allegations .
Bagram was the site of a controversial jail holding hundreds of inmates , who have now been moved to another complex .
The old prison was notorious for allegations of prisoner torture and abuse .
But witnesses told the BBC in interviews or written testimony that abuses continue in a hidden facility .
Sleep deprivation " They call it the Black Hole , " said Sher Agha who spent six days in the facility last autumn .
" When they released us they told us we should not tell our stories to outsiders because that will harm us . "
BAGRAM AIRBASE
I could not sleep , nobody could sleep because there was a machine that was making noise
Mirwais , former detainee
Sher Agha and others we interviewed complained their cells were very cold .
" When I wanted to sleep and started shivering with cold I started reciting the holy Koran , " he said .
But sleep , according to the prisoners interviewed , is deliberately prevented in this detention site .
" I could not sleep , nobody could sleep because there was a machine that was making noise , " said Mirwais , who said he was held in the secret jail for 24 days .
" There was a small camera in my cell , and if you were sleeping they 'd come in and disturb you , " he added .
The prisoners , who were interviewed separately , all told very similar stories .
Most of them said they had been beaten by American soldiers at the point of arrest before being taken to the prison .
Mirwais had half a row of teeth missing , which he said was from being struck with the butt of a gun by an American soldier .
No-one said they were visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross during their detention at the site , and they all said that their families did not know where they were .
In the small concrete cells , the prisoners said , a light was on all the time .
They said they could not tell if it was night or day and described this as very disturbing .
Mirwais said he was made to dance to music by American soldiers every time he wanted to use the toilet .
The ex-prisoners said they were imprisoned at the secret jail before being taken to the main detention centre at the Bagram airbase , a new complex called The Detention Facility in Parwan .
Bagram 's prisoners were moved to the Parwan complex from the old notorious Bagram prison site on the airbase earlier this year .
In 2002 , two prisoners were killed in the Bagram prison while in US custody after being suspended from the ceilings of their cells and brutally beaten .
New jail
The BBC was allowed into the new Bagram prison for an hour .
This was one of the first opportunities any outsider has had to set eyes on Bagram 's interned prisoners since a jail was first established at Bagram soon after 9/11 .
In the new jail , prisoners were being moved around in wheelchairs with goggles and headphones on .
ON BBC RADIO 4
Hilary Andersson investigates detention at Bagram on BBC Radio 4 at 2002 on 11 May 2010 .
The goggles were blacked out , and the purpose of the headphones was to block out all sound .
Each prisoner was handcuffed and had their legs shackled .
Prisoners are kept in 56 cells , which the prisoners refer to as " cages " .
The front of the cells are made of mesh , the ceiling is clear , and the other three walls are solid .
Guards can see down into the cells above .
The BBC was told by the military to wear protective eye glasses whilst walking past the mesh cells as prisoners sometimes throw excrement or semen at the guards .
Prisoner accounts we logged painted a much better picture of the Parwan Detention Facility .
The US military itself has admitted that about 80 % of those at Bagram are probably not hardened terrorists .
It is the process of giving every detainee an internal military trial of sorts , called a Detainee Review Board .
The prisoners are represented by soldiers who are not lawyers .
" To this date , no prisoner has ever seen a lawyer in Bagram " , said Tina Foster , who represents several of Bagram 's prisoners in cases she has filed in on their behalf in the US .
Guantanamo Bay 's prisoners are able to see their lawyers .
About 100 prisoners have been released through this process , but due to an increased intake , the number of prisoners at Parwan is now 800 , up from about 650 in September 2009 .
The BBC put the allegations of ongoing abuses as a secret site on the airbase to the US military at Bagram .
The military categorically denied the existence of a secret detention site .
" I 've never heard of it .
This is the only detention facility in Afghanistan " said Vice Admiral Robert Harward who is in charge of the Detention Facility in Parwan .
The US military promised to investigate any allegations of abuse .

from the book “ Anything You Want ” : A real person , a lot like you 2010- 03 - 31
My friend Sara has run a small online business out of her living room for twelve years .
It ’s her whole life .
She takes it very very personally .
Last week , one of her clients sent her a 10 - page - long scathing email , chopping her down , calling her a scam artist and other vicious personal insults , saying she was going to sue Sara for everything she ’s worth as retribution for her mis-handled account .
Devastated , Sara turned off her computer and cried .
She shut off the phones and closed up shop for the day .
She spent the whole weekend in bed wondering if she should just give up .
Thinking maybe every insult in this client ’s letter was true , and she ’s actually no good at what she does , even after twelve years .
On Sunday , she spent about five hours — most of the day — carefully addressing every point in this 10 - page email .
Then she went through the client ’s website , learning everything about her , and offered all kinds of advice , suggestions , and connections .
She refunded the client ’s money , plus an additional $ 50 , with gushing deep apologies for ever having upset someone she was honestly trying to help .
The next day , she called the client to try to talk through this with her .
The client cheerfully took her call and said , “ Oh do n’t worry about it !
I was n’t actually that upset .
I was just in a bad mood , and did n’t think anyone would read my email anyway . ”
My friend Valerie was doing online dating .
She was half - hearted about it .
She wanted a magic perfect man to sweep her off her feet through divine serendipity .
We were at her computer , when I asked her how it ’s going .
She logged into her account and showed me her inbox .
There were eight new messages from men , each one well - written , saying what they liked about her profile , how they have a mutual interest in hiking , or also speak German , asking her if she ’s also been to Berlin , or has hiked in New Zealand .
I felt for those guys .
Each one pouring out his heart , projecting his hopes onto Valerie , hoping she ’ll reply with equal enthusiasm , hoping she might be the one that will finally see and appreciate him .
She said , “ Ugh. Losers .
I get like ten of these a day , ” and clicked [ delete ] on all of them , without replying .
When we yell at our car or coffee machine , it ’s fine because they ’re just mechanical appliances .
So when we yell at a website or company , using our computer or phone , we forget it ’s not an appliance but a person that ’s affected .
It ’s dehumanizing to have thousands of people passing through our computer screens , so we do things we ’d never do if those people were sitting next to us .
It ’s too overwhelming to remember that at the end of every computer is a real person , a lot like you , whose birthday was last week , who has three best friends but nobody to spoon at night , and is personally affected by what you say .
Even if you remember it right now , will you remember it next time you ’re overwhelmed , or perhaps never forget it again ?
Psst ... have you heard ?
Brandon lost his virginity this weekend .
Victoria called out sick to work so she could see a concert .
And Tony -- poor Tony .
Let 's just say he spent some time at the doctor 's office for a procedure that involved a latex glove and a lot of grimacing .
Let me fill you in on a little secret : I do n't know any of these people .
Thanks to Facebook , though , I know plenty of personal things about them .
And I 'm willing to wager that they might not realize anyone else -- their parents , their teachers , their bosses -- could just as easily know this stuff , too .
Welcome to the weird new world of Facebook 's privacy jungle .
Facebook 's Privacy Problem
Much has been made over Facebook and privacy over the years , but the social network 's most recent privacy changes seem to be generating a particularly loud uproar .
It 's no surprise , really : Facebook 's recent adjustments make it incredibly difficult to control your information in any reasonable way .
To wit : Achieving maximum privacy on Facebook now requires you to click through 50 settings and more than 170 options .
And even that wo n't completely safeguard your info .
To fully understand Facebook 's updated stance on privacy and your personal data , you 'd have to wade through the company 's 5,830 - word privacy policy .
That , as the astute crew from The New York Times noticed , is 1,287 words longer than the United States Constitution .
Those figures are attention - grabbing enough .
But seeing what Facebook 's privacy changes actually mean in practice is even more eye - opening .
Facebook Privacy : What the World Now Knows
Thanks to a couple of handy new tools , you can now check out exactly what Facebook is telling the world about you -- and about everyone else .
First up is Openbook , a project created by three computer geeks from San Francisco .
Openbook lets you search through Facebook 's publicly available user data to find out what everyone is saying .
You enter a search term -- Openbook suggests loaded phrases like " cheated test , " " do n't tell anyone , " and " lost virginity , " but you can enter anything you want -- and the site displays pages of relevant Facebook status updates from recent hours .
Now , some of the things you 'll find are perfectly innocuous .
And others are clearly written by people who , for better or for worse , do n't mind sharing their most intimate moments with the world .
( We all know a few of those sorts , right ? )
Others , though , make you wonder .
Does Rachel from San Jose really want everyone knowing what happened at the gynecologist 's office on Thursday ?
Does Martin of New Jersey want his teachers to learn he cheated on his language test on Friday ?
And does Michael of Pensacola want his boss to hear he called in sick the other day in order to take an impromptu vacation ?
Probably not ; after all , most people do n't think of Facebook in the same way they think of a more public social network such as Twitter .
But all of that info's now out there , along with far worse things that I could n't possibly print in this story .
Facebook Privacy : A Wake - Up Call
A service like Openbook is amusing , sure , but it 's also a real wake - up call .
If your info is public and you 're fine with it , more power to you .
But if you are n't fully aware of what you 're now sharing on Facebook , you 'd better launch your own personal privacy setting investigation before someone finds something you 'll later regret .
Here 's the tough truth : Even if you have certain pieces of information set to be private , it is n't hard for an outsider to connect the dots and fill in the blanks .
Take our pal Brandon , for example -- remember him ?
He 's the lucky fella who lost his virginity this weekend .
I clicked over to Brandon 's Facebook profile after seeing his status update on Openbook .
Because of Facebook 's privacy setup -- which now forces you to have things like your interests and " likes " linked to publicly accessible groups or community pages -- it took only a few seconds for me to ascertain exactly where Brandon goes to high school and what year he 'll graduate .
Martin , our test - cheating youngster from earlier , left some of those details out of his profile .
But Facebook still lets anyone see his friends , his siblings , and all of the things he and his social circle " like " -- and it does n't take Sherlock Holmes to create a fairly detailed docket from those combined tidbits of info .
It 's enough to give anyone a mild shudder .
Protecting Your Facebook Privacy
So what to do ?
You can always say so long to Facebook , of course .
Or you can choose to stay with the site and simply be vigilant about protecting your privacy .
It is n't easy , but it can be done .
You can see what Facebook shares with the world about you by using this free tool at zesty.ca ; just input your Facebook user ID or account number ( found by looking at the URL for your Facebook profile page ) , then click through the fields to see what 's actually public .
The tool wo n't take into account info that could be shared by applications or Facebook 's " instant personalization " feature , but it 's a start .
After that , get ready to dig .
This daunting chart breaks down all of the categories of settings you 'll need to review ( hint : be sure to clear out a couple hours of your afternoon ) .
This story provides a slightly less overwhelming summary of the main settings you should revisit .
And this one goes through some additional steps you 'll want to take to address the aforementioned new " instant personalization " options .
Do all of that , and you oughta be covered -- at least , that is , until Facebook unveils its next " user - friendly " privacy feature .*
* Just kidding about that last part .**

When not adjusting the privacy settings on his own Facebook page , JR Raphael presides over his geek - humor galaxy at eSarcasm.com .
( CNN ) -- A marijuana bust along the U.S. - Mexico border revealed 30 pounds of the drug stuffed into framed pictures of Jesus Christ , the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said Wednesday .
" This is not the first time we have seen smugglers attempt to use religious figures and articles of faith to further their criminal enterprise , " said William Molaski , port director of the agency 's office in El Paso , Texas , in a statement .
" What some might find offensive or sacrilegious has unfortunately become a standard operating procedure for drug smugglers .
This would include using religious symbols , children and senior citizens in their attempts to defeat the CBP inspection process . "
Authorities said a 22 - year - old woman in a Jeep from Juarez , Mexico , told federal border patrol officers that she had nothing to declare besides the framed art .
The officers checked out the vehicle with Cesar , a federal drug - sniffing dog , who alerted them to three framed pictures of Jesus in the vehicle .
The officers pulled the backing of the pictures and found numerous bundles , authorities said .
The woman was arrested .
The bust was one of three marijuana seizures made Tuesday at the El Paso point of entry .
Officers said they seized 214 pounds of marijuana in the two other busts .

I bet you have .
Most projects have some kind of standard source code template which has the copyright and license text and placeholders for things like a description .
All I have to say is :
You do n’t need a template .
Stop using it .
Actually , that ’s not all I have to say .
Sorry .
If you believe me already , you can stop reading now and go do something useful with your life .
If you do n’t quite believe me yet , please read on .
Why you do n’t need to assert copyright
The most common objection to getting rid of these templates goes something like this :
“ Hold on .
We must keep at least the copyright notice in place , surely ?
We do n’t want this to end up in the public domain or anything .
A template is the best way to make sure everyone always puts a copyright in . ”
No , and no .
You do n’t need a copyright notice in every file .
Even if you did , a template is not a good mechanism to do it .
You do n’t need to assert copyright because of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works .
It ’s an international agreement which governs copyright .
Almost all of the world has signed the convention by now :
The convention lays down the basics of what copyright is and what it means , and then says that “ the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality ” .
This means that you do n’t need to do anything to have copyright over your works .
You do n’t need to include a “ Copyright © ” text .
You do n’t need to update copyright years , or figure out when to update them .
I mean , should it be updated every time the file is edited ?
Or automatically at the turn of the year ?
Should each year be separately listed , or can I just give the first and last year ?
You can include a copyright text , but the Berne Convention says it has no legal meaning .
I say it ’s useless baggage , especially the copyright years , so do n’t put them in there at all .
Another common objection to leaving the copyright notice out goes like this :
“ Everyone always puts a copyright notice in their files .
There must be something to it , otherwise they would n’t do it . ”
At this point , I would like to remind you of the story of the five monkeys .
Start with a cage containing five monkeys .
Inside the cage , hang a banana on a string and place a set of stairs under it .
Before long , a monkey will go to the stairs and start to climb towards the banana .
As soon as he touches the stairs , spray all of the other monkeys with very cold , high - pressure water .
After a while , another monkey makes an attempt with the same result — all the other monkeys are sprayed with cold water .
Pretty soon , when another monkey tries to climb the stairs , the other monkeys will try to prevent it .
Now , put away the cold water .
Remove one monkey from the cage and replace it with a new one .
The new monkey sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs .
To his surprise and horror , all of the other monkeys attack him .
After another attempt and attack , he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs , he will be assaulted .
Next , remove another of the original five monkeys and replace it with a new one .
The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked .
The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm !
Likewise , replace a third original monkey with a new one , then a fourth , then the fifth .
Every time the newest monkey takes to the stairs , he is attacked .
None of the monkeys that are beating him have any idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs or why they are participating in the beating of the newest monkey .
After replacing all the original monkeys , none of the remaining monkeys have ever been sprayed with cold water .
Nevertheless , no monkey ever again approaches the stairs to try for the banana .
Why not ?
Because as far as they know that ’s the way it ’s always been done around here .
And that , my friends , is how company policy begins .
Before the United States had signed the Berne Agreement in 1989 , a copyright assertion was actually required if you wanted to enforce your copyright in the US .
Everybody is still doing it , even though nobody needs to .
Why you do n’t need the rest of it , either
Often , source code files repeat the file name in the file itself .
I ’ve never seen the point in that .
It ’s just one extra thing you need to remember to update if you rename the file .
A big ASCII banner with the file name is positively crazy , but some people do that , too .
A list of authors is quite useless , as are version numbers and change logs .
Any version control system will give you much better and much more accurate information for these automatically .
I also object to putting in a big fat license text to the beginning of each and every source code file , as is suggested in the GPL .
If you want to later change the license to something else , you have a lot of work ahead of you .
I ’m not sure , but that may actually be why the GPL advocates putting in all that legal verbiage in every file .
In my opinion , a concise reference to a separate license file should be enough .
A TODO list and a description are actually good to have .
Sadly , these are the parts which most often are not filled in .
What you should do
For source code that you never plan to release to outsiders , you do n’t need any standard header , template , license , or copyright .
None .
All you need to do is put the code in version control , so you can use the logs to prove that you wrote the code , and when you wrote it .
If you really feel you must at least refer to a license in open source code , you should be fine with just one line in each file .
If you do this , I do n’t much care what you then put in the “ LICENSE ” file .
You can put in all the copyright assertions and years for all I care .
Just stop being a monkey ; do n’t borify the source code with attention stealing enterprisey legalese and copyrights .
/* See the file " LICENSE " for the full license governing this code .
*/
Oh , almost forgot .
I am not a lawyer .
This is not legal advice .
Having to say that is stupid .

Kirk Wright , a Florida hedge fund manager , hung himself when faced with a 710 - year sentence for 47 counts of fraud , and swindling $ 185 million from clients including 78 NFL players .
This is the gaudy , pink - festooned Lamborghini he bought his wife .

Remember 2008 ?
It seems like so long ago does n't it ?
Only two years ago the financial markets were imploding after years of recklessness and Florida - based Kirk Wright was a poster boy for everything wrong .
He started out on the up - and - up , investing money for his friends and his own mother , but as things progressed they got out of control .
Wright defrauded as many as 500 investors , including 78 members of the NFL Players Association , stealing between $ 115 and $ 185 million , offering only printouts from Ameritrade as evidence of his spectacular and recurring profits .
When he was caught and prosecuted , facing an impressive 710 year sentence , he decided hanging himself in his jail cell was the easy way out .
So he did just that on May 24 , 2008 .
Morbid but true .

But back in 2007 , this car is the kind of thing Mr. Wright was buying for his wife with defrauded investor cash ( along with a $ 55,000 engagement ring ) .
It 's a $ 200,000 Lamborghini Gallardo with a custom - made rhinestone - bedazzled logo a subtle three inches wider than the original , a pink Alcantara interior , and custom - painted Asanti wheels .
After arrest , the Lamborghini was impounded and eventually purchased from Police impound by EuroMotorSport in Ft. Lauderdale , FL .
The import shop is currently in the process of reselling it with the intent of donating a portion of the profits to the scammed investors .

Richard Stallman
Richard Stallman is the founder of the Free Software Foundation .
He started it in 1984 , many years before Torvalds started Linux .
Stallman is also half of the reason Linux came into existence because he provided Torvalds with the software ( for free ) that Torvalds was missing .
Neither person had created enough software by themselves to make a complete operating system , but together they had something .
( Torvalds ended up developing Linux further , while Stallman pursued other activities . )
I never met Richard Stallman , but I have read more than one article in which he was described as different from other people .
For example , here is a quote from an article from The Register on 6 April 2001 which the author discusses Stallman 's lecture at a conference at Queens ' College , Cambridge :
 Wearing socks but no shoes , brown canvas trousers and a red polo shirt , Stallman is not as other people . 
There may have been a valid reason for him to be at the conference in socks rather than shoes .
For example , he may have a medical problem and shoes are simply too painful .
Or perhaps the airline lost his luggage , and he had no chance to buy another pair .
Or maybe the British police took away his shoes because they were contaminated with hoof and mouth disease .
However , it could be a symptom of a defective mind .
Most of us realize that society has certain behavioral standards , such as wearing shoes to conferences , especially if we are one of the speakers .
But a person who is withdrawn in a fantasy may not be aware of what other people are thinking or doing .
I suggest you consider the possibility that Richard was imagining himself at home in his living room ; that Richard was not completely aware of where he was or what was going on around him .
I also suspect the description of Richard as not like other people  is merely a nice way of saying there is something wrong with him .
When somebody at the conference spoke about patent protection for software :
 This provoked Stallman into an extended rant against the whole idea of patenting software , and ended in him leaving the room to shout in the corridor ...
The shouting incident may seem to be insignificant , but it could be a sign that something is wrong with his mind .
I think that a grown man should be capable of dealing with a difference of opinion without shouting .
Bill Gates is also rumored to lose his temper at Microsoft and shout at people .
( Of course , Bill Gates is also rumored to slobber on people , which is a bit worse . )
If this was the only article that described Richard as being different , then we could say that this particular reporter is incorrect , or that this reporter just happened to see Richard during a bad moment .
But other articles about Richard also make subtle remarks about his different personality .
Eric Raymond
Eric Raymond is interesting for several reasons .
One is that he loves role playing games .
See his document about role playing :
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/larp.html
I lost my interest in playing games when I was in junior high school .
Do the adults who enjoy these role - playing games simply have different personalities than me ?
Or are they suffering from a mental disorder which causes them to withdraw from reality ?
This issue also applies to sports , gambling , and beer .
For example , some of the people who drink beer seem to be healthy people ; others are merely using the beer to withdraw from reality into a state of intoxication .
In regards to adults who play games , especially role playing games , how can we figure out if they are merely playing a game or if they are suffering from a mental problem ?
What do we learn from guns ?
Eric Raymond also loves guns .
You should read his following documents for details .
( The ipscc1.htm document is also interesting because it describes tactical pistol shooting , which many of us do n't know about . )
http://tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/personal.html
http://tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/rig.html
http://tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/gun-ethics.html
http://tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/ipscc1.htm
I found a few of Eric 's remarks about guns to be particularly interesting .
In his discussion of ethics he has a section titled :  What Bearing Weapons Teaches About the Good Life 
There is nothing like having your finger on the trigger of a gun to reveal who you really are .
Life or death in one twitch ...
He goes on to explain that because a gun allows us to kill a person very easily , a gun has a lot of significance to our lives .
This made me think of my automobile .
My automobile allows me to kill more people than I could kill with a gun .
For example , I could crash my car through the fence of a school playground , running over dozens of children .
As Eric might say :
There is nothing like having your hands on the steering wheel of a car to reveal you really are .
Life or death in one twitch ...
Later that evening as I held a jar of honey in my hand , I realized that Eric 's remarks apply to honey as well .
Until I read Eric 's remarks about guns , I thought of honey as merely a sweet liquid .
Now I realize that I 'm holding a dangerous weapon .
I could easily kill several infants by pouring honey down their throat and nose while they lay in their cribs .
As Eric might say :
There is nothing like having your hands on a jar of honey to reveal who you really are .
Life or death in one twitch ...
When I hold a jar of honey , I am a powerful man who has control over the life of many infants .
But please do not suggest that we ban honey .
Honey does not kill ; people kill .
Eric Raymond is only one of millions of people who are fascinated by a gun 's ability to kill .
Not many of these people are fascinated by the ability of an automobile to kill , or the ability of toxic chemicals to create birth defects , or our ability to kill with our bare hands .
Is this fascination of guns a sign of good mental health ?
If so , what about a person who is fascinated by the ability of honey to kill ?
What would you think of a person who was fascinated that a plastic bag could be used to suffocate people ?
At what point would you say there is something wrong with these people ?
Look around the room you are in and try to find an object that you could not kill somebody with .
Almost everything can be used to kill .
What makes a gun so special ?
Why does a gun reveal who we really are , but none of these other objects reveal who we are ?
What about the people who control missiles , nuclear submarines , and bombs ?
They have more control over people 's lives than a person with a gun .
If a gun reveals who we really are , what does having a nuclear bomb reveal ?
What would having a container of tuberculosis reveal ?
I pity the oppressed Europeans
While at the tactical pistol shooting range , Eric Raymond had the following revelation : I thought then of the historian J. A. Pocock 's description of the beliefs of the Founding Fathers of the U.S :  The bearing of arms is the essential medium through which the individual asserts both his social power and his participation in politics as a responsible moral being ... and I felt a flash of pity for the all the frightened , self - disarmed people who have never understood the full truth of that .
And more than a flash of loathing for the would - be gun-banners who would rape away their chance to ever learn .
Indeed , as Robert Heinlein famously observed , an armed society is a polite society .
As I read those remarks , I felt the flash of pity for all Europeans who are suffering under oppressive governments that prevent them from purchasing guns .
As Robert Heinlein would have observed , the unarmed European societies are not polite societies .
Rather , European nations are crude , rude , and unattractive .
The Europeans are not a free people who enjoy life ; rather , they are denied basic freedoms , such as owning guns .
Since I am American , I get to enjoy all the wonderful things of life .
I have freedom , for example , whereas the people in other nations are oppressed .
I have wealth , while other nations have poverty .
I have a free press , while other nations have biased news and distorted history books .
I certainly am glad that I am an American !
Let 's reduce crime around the world
The crime rates in Europe , Singapore , Japan , and other nations is appalling .
As Eric Raymond and many gun enthusiasts proudly boast , guns lower crime .
As Eric describes it :
It is time for us to embrace bearing arms again  not merely as a deterrent against criminals and tyrants , but as a gift and sacrament and affirmation to ourselves .
Therefore , by providing guns to other nations , we will reduce crime in the world .
Furthermore , the guns will provide a gift and sacrament and affirmation to the people ( do n't ask me what that means ! ) .
Open Source Guns , and the Free Gun Foundation Eric Raymond has purchased and used many guns , but all of them have been closed source guns from corporations .
I am certain that Eric will support me in my request for Open Source Guns .
The Linux fanatics complain about the price of Microsoft software , but guns are expensive , and bullets are also .
Why not describe the gun corporations as evil empires ?
Why not complain about the money that we must spend on guns ?
Richard Stallman started the Free Software Foundation ; I am certain that he would agree with me that it is more important that we start a Free Gun Foundation .
What good is free software when people are oppressed ?
It is more important that we provide the world with free guns so that all nations can become polite societies and experience the freedom that we Americans experience .
We should start an open source / free gun movement in which the blueprints for guns are distributed freely on the Internet .
Why should corporations have control over guns ?
Why should they keep this valuable technology a secret ?
As Eric Raymond would explain :  The basic idea behind open source is very simple .
When gun engineers on the Internet can read , redistribute , and modify the source for a gun , it evolves .
People improve it , people adapt it , people fix problems .
And this can happen at a speed that , if one is used to the slow pace of conventional gun development , seems astonishing . 
( Read my main document , Linux1.html , to understand what Eric Raymond 's quote means ) .
Actually , we should have open source nuclear weapons , also .
Why should a few nations or corporations have control over nuclear weapons ?
As Eric Raymond would explain :
 The basic idea behind open source is very simple .
When nuclear bomb engineers on the Internet can read , redistribute , and modify the source for a nuclear bomb , it evolves .
People improve it , people adapt it , people fix problems .
And this can happen at a speed that , if one is used to the slow pace of conventional nuclear bomb development , seems astonishing . 
I want to help my relatives in Europe Several generations ago my ancestors left Europe for America .
Someone from this Scala family left Italy , someone from the Hufschmid family left Switzerland , someone from the Hendrickson family left Denmark , and there was one relative who was a mixture of Dutch and who knows what else .
Those immigrants then found freedom , wealth , a free press , and liberty .
I feel sorry for my European relatives who remained in that oppressive , gun - free part of the world .
So I will offer to help my relatives .
If any of you reading this are related to me , send me your name and address and I will send you a free gun .
This offer is limited to one gun per family , and supplies are limited , so hurry !
I want to help the people of Finland , also Finland lost one of its greatest citizens to America ( ie , Linus Torvalds ) .
No doubt Linus left Finland because he could no longer tolerate the oppressive , gun - free nation .
He certainly craved the freedom that we Americans have to purchase guns , and I am certain that he wanted to be able to read the truth in newspapers , and to be wealthy .
As is typical of the immigrants from Europe , we get Europe 's finest people .
All that remains in Europe are the losers who do not care about freedom or enjoying life .
So to thank the losers of Finland for giving us their best people , I will offer free guns to the first 100 Finnish people who contact me .
Bruce Perens
Bruce started the Open Source concept .
His web site has details :
perens.com
In an interview
upside.com/texis/mvm/open_season?id=37d5b4060
Bruce mentions a bit about his childhood :  I was a phone hacker back when phone hacking was what people did .
I used to be able to whistle 2600 Hz and could , for a time , nullify the long distance charges . 
I do not remember any time when  phone hacking was what people did .

Rather , I remember a time when phone hacking was what mental defects did .
I suggest that you consider the possibility that Bruce promotes free software simply because wants everybody to provide things to him for free , and if we do not provide things for free , he will find a way to steal them .
Perhaps Bruce has stopped all illegal activities , but I would still suggest you consider that he is not the sort of person we should look to for guidance .
Jon " maddog " Hall Jon is Executive Director of Linux International .
In an interview he is asked where his nickname comes from : I am called " maddog " .... because I used to have much less control over my temper than I do now .
Great !
Another Linux fanatic who has lousy control of his temper !
What would happen if we put a bunch of Linux fanatics in a room and asked them to discuss Linux ?
Would they accomplish anything , or just fight with each other ?
Looking over the past few years shows that there is little except fighting among Linux fanatics .
If you want a sample , this link shows a discussion at slashdot.org .
This discussion is from Feb 1999 .
It started when Bruce Perens announced his resignation from the Open Source Initiative , which is some type of organization that promotes open source .
Bruce complained that Eric Raymond seems to be losing his free software focus . 
He also calls Tim O'Reilly a parasite , for the same sort of reasons that I complained about Tim in my main document .
Take a look at the remarks the slashdot people posted , and then ask yourself :
Are slashdot posters typical of Linux fanatics ?
Do you want these people to dominate software and replace Microsoft ?
I suggest you consider that the Linux and free software movement is attracting people who are suffering from mental disorders .
The Northern Lights as you 've never seen them before : Astronaut takes amazing photo as ISS hurtles through space
It 's an image which lends a new gravitas to the well - worn phrase room with a view .
But this is exactly what astronaut Soichi Noguchi saw from inside the International Space Station ( ISS ) as it hurtled towards aurora borealis - or the northern lights - at 28,000 km per hour ( 17,500mph ) .
After taking the spellbinding photograph and then travelling through the aurora itself , he posted it on Twitter for all to see .
A photo of the aurora taken from the ISS
Astronaut Soichi posted this picture with the caption : ' Aurora , Moon , and my home away from home . '
The photo shows a green glow hovering approximately 60 miles above the Earth 's surface .
This natural light display is created when particles enter the atmosphere and collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms , giving them an electric charge .
The extraordinary red glow above it can reach up to 300 miles above our planet .
This means that Mr Noguchi 's online boast of travelling through the aurora is technically correct as the space station was 240 miles above Earth .
The craft in the foreground of the picture is a Progress capsule , which brings supplies such as food , water and air to the ISS .
Mr Noguchi , who is known as Astro_Soichi on Twitter , and his Expedition 22 colleagues recently broke the world record for the number of photos taken by an ISS crew .
They have snapped over 100,000 images of space in an accumulated six months in the craft .
The total number of photos taken by crew members aboard the ISS now totals 639,000 .

A stunning clear view of Earth showing the Vietnam Pacific coast
Mr Noguchi wo n't be the only Japanese astronaut aboard the ISS after Naoko Yamazaki became the second woman from her country to fly into space over the Bank Holiday weekend .
She was one of three women among seven astronauts who blasted off in space shuttle Discovery and is taking Japanese curry and noodles up to Mr Noguchi , who has been up there for three months .
The three women on board Discovery will join a fourth already at the space station , setting a record for the most women in space at the same time .

CSM reports on a RAND study by Ben Conable and Martin Libicki of 89 major insurgencies in the 20th century and early 21st , and what they might tell us about the likelihood of Obama succeeding in Afghanistan .
Connable found that weak governments prevail militarily against insurgencies only 10 percent of the time .
RAND ’s own news release and link to the full study is here .
Among the findings are that modern insurgencies go on for about a decade , and the longer they continue the more likely it is that the government will find a way to defeat them .
Where an insurgency has external state support , loss of that outside help is often fatal to the uprising .
Where the government attempting to face down the insurgency claims to be a democracy , in those instances where it is really only a pseudo - democracy it often proves unable to defeat its foe .
Where the insurgency has a safe area to which it can retreat at will , that external base of operations helps it prevail .
Where insurgents can learn to be careful not to kill innocents , they have a better chance of coming to power .
The Taliban and other Afghan insurgents look like winners in this scenario .
This conclusion in part lies behind Tom Englehardt ’s impassioned plea for the US to just withdraw from Afghanistan .
It seems clear that NATO is planning a withdrawal .
Although abandoned governments often fall , so too do those perceived as puppets .
You could n’t have a more pseudo - democracy than that in Afghanistan .
The president , Karzai , stole the presidential elections last August - October .
The ministries are inefficient and riddled with corruption .
Based on this historical study , you ’d have to admit that things do n’t look good for Obama ’s grand toss of the dice in Afghanistan .
Dow Drops on Greek Protests & Trading Error
A look at the laggards of the Dow today , with Andy Busch , BMO Capital Markets and the CNBC news team .
So you want to learn another language .
Maybe you want to travel , to expand your knowledge , or just prepare yourself for the day when the Feds track you down and you have to flee the country .
Learning a new language can be a fun , enlightening and rewarding thing to do , provided you follow one easy step : avoid the languages on this list .
1 .
Japanese
According to the Foreign Service Institute , part of the US Department of State , Japanese is the hardest language in the world for English speakers to learn .
So put aside the anime and start learning Spanish or something .
No ?
Well , we warned you
Like Chinese , Japanese has a character - based alphabet .
In order to read a Japanese newspaper with a good degree of understanding , you ’ll have to memorize about 2000 of the little bastards .
That ’s less than Chinese , at least , right ?
Well , except that to make up for that fact , Japanese also has two different alphabets , each with forty - six characters in them each .
They ’ll make you learn both of them before you can even start to think about characters .
Oh , also keep in mind that the way each character sounds changes according to whether it ’s on its own , in a word in front of another character , in a word behind another character , which character it ’s next to , and sometimes just for the hell of it .
But that ’s not even what makes Japanese difficult .
It ’s the goddamn grammar .
Not only are there more than fifty ways to modify a verb in Japanese ( in English there ’s three ) , the adjectives are modified too .
So in the English sentence “ I was not sad ” , the past tense is contained in ‘ was ’ and the negative in ‘ not ’ .
In Japanese , the same sentence ( kanashikunakatta ) only needs one word because the past tense and the negative form are contained in the adjective .
So you need to learn eight billion conjugations even when you ’re avoiding verbs .
There ’s even a special form of verb to describe how freakin’ insane this picture is .
Oh , and we ’re not done .
Different sets of verbs , pronouns and even nouns are used in Japanese according to whether you ’re talking to someone of a higher , equal or lower social status than you , and using the wrong form of speech can potentially cause great offense .
As if social situations were n’t awkward enough already .
2 .
Russian
English might be a notoriously hard language , but it ’s got one thing going for it : for the most part , it lost its cases a long time ago .
Cases are modifications to words that show how they relate to other words in the sentence .
Basically , to make up for the loss of meaning that comes with caseless words , English has a very strict word order .
So in these English sentences :
A dog bit Bill
And
Bill bit a dog
… the meaning is determined by which comes first , Bill or the dog .
In a language with cases , these words can go in any order , because whether Bill was the biter or bitee is determined by which case is used , instead of where his name is in the sentence .
Other languages , unlike English , have retained a lot of their cases .
German , for example , keeps case endings on its adjectives .
So if you want to use an adjective in a German sentence , you have to determine whether it ’s going before the subject or the object or the indirect object or a possessive .
Does n’t seem too hard , right ?
That ’s just four endings to remember .
But then keep in mind that German has three genders , which means three rules for every type of noun .
So whenever you want to simply describe something as ‘ good ’ ( gut ) in German , you have to choose between seven endings .
Now we see why Germans are so grumpy all the time .
So why is n’t German the one in this entry ?
Because although German kept the case endings on its adjectives and a few other types of words , it was sensible enough to drop them on most of its nouns .
Not so Russian .
Teaching someone a language should be easy .
You point at a book and say ‘ book ’ and they know the word .
But when you ’re learning Russian , it ’s not so simple : ‘ book ’ can be kniga , knigu , knigy , knigoy , knig ’e , or several other forms according to where it is in a sentence and whether it ’s got a preposition next to it .
Another language that does this is Latin .
But Russian beats out Latin here , because you have to learn a whole new alphabet in order to speak Russian :
At least you ’ll be able to read this !
Also , you ’re probably not likely to need to learn Latin these days unless you ’re exorcising some demons at the Vatican .
But before you do that , remember to brush up on your cases !
Six months .
That 's right .
This dream - like picture shows each phase of the sun over Bristol 's Clifton Suspension Bridge taken during half a year .
The image was captured on a pin-hole camera made from an empty soda can with a 0.25 mm aperture and a single sheet of photographic paper .
Photographer Justin Quinnell strapped the camera to a telephone pole overlooking the Gorge , where it was left between December 19 , 2007 and June 21 , 2008 – –the Winter and Summer solstices .
( That 's a 15,552,000 second exposure . )
' Solargraph ' shows six months of the sun 's luminescent trails and its subtle change of course caused by the earth 's movement in orbit .
The lowest arc being the first day of exposure on the Winter solstice , while the top curves were captured mid-Summer .
( Dotted lines of light are the result of overcast days when the sun struggled to penetrate the cloud . )
Quinnell , a renowned pin-hole camera artist , says the photograph took on a personal resonance after his father passed away on April 13 , halfway through the exposure .
He says the picture allows him to pinpoint the exact location of the sun in the sky at the moment of his father passing .

Transcendental meditation , the technique of achieving a state of " restful alertness " popularised by The Beatles 40 years ago , may be an effective treatment for depression in older people , scientists have found .
Two studies of more than 100 patients at risk of heart disease showed that those who practised the technique experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms of up to 48 per cent .
Depression increases the risk of a heart attack even at moderate levels .
The small studies were led by a researcher from the Maharishi University of Management in Iowa in the United States , which was founded by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , who introduced Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) to India in 1955 and subsequently promoted it across the world .
Although the Maharishi University exists to promote Transcendental Meditation , the research was conducted with the Charles Drew University in Los Angeles and the University of Hawaii , and the findings were supported by other academics .
They add to a growing body of evidence about the health benefits of the technique .
" These results are encouraging and provide support for testing the efficacy of Transcendental Meditation as a therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of clinical depression , " said Hector Myers , professor of clinical training at the department of psychology at the University of California in Los Angeles .
Gary Kaplan , associate professor of neurology at New York University , said : " Any technique not involving extra medication in this population is a welcome addition .
I look forward to further research on the Transcendental Meditation technique and prevention of depression in other at - risk populations . "
Transcendental Meditation became popular in the UK after The Beatles visited the Maharishi at his ashram in India in 1968 .
Other stars who beat a path to the Maharishi's door included Donovan , the Welsh troubadour , the actress Mia Farrow and Mike Love of The Beach Boys .
The movement received a boost two years ago when Donovan teamed up with the cult film director David Lynch to launch a campaign encouraging children to meditate in school .
Lynch donated millions to the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness - Based Education and described the difference it made to his own life .
" When I started meditating I had a real anger in me , and I would take this out on my first wife .
Two weeks after I started meditating , this anger lifted , " he said .
About 6 million people worldwide practise Transcendental Meditation , according to the movement 's official website .
The technique involves a form of concentrated attention in which the mind is turned inward and focused on a single point of reference .
This is achieved by uttering the mantra , a word given to the student during the initiation ceremony which is chanted silently over and over .
The aim is to empty the mind of thoughts , feelings and fantasies , not by blocking their intrusion , which is impossible , but by observing them as they intrude and then always returning to the central task of attending to the mantra .
In this way a state of " restful alertness " is achieved .
Scores of scientific studies on the technique have been published since the 1970s , a number of which have shown benefits in lowering stress , blood pressure , cholesterol , smoking , drinking and anxiety .
In 2005 , The American Journal of Cardiology reported that among 202 patients with raised blood pressure who were followed for 18 years , those who practised TM had a 23 per cent lower death rate .
In 2006 , a study in Archives of Internal Medicine found patients who practised the technique for 16 weeks had improved blood pressure , insulin resistance and nervous system .
The National Institutes of Health in the US has found that people practising meditation have lower breathing and heart rates yet possess " higher EEG coherence " – indicating greater concentration and alertness .
The Maharishi travelled the world for decades before establishing a headquarters for his global activities in Vlodrop , a town in the Netherlands , in 1990 .
In 2005 he ordered his followers to stop teaching the technique in Britain in protest against Tony Blair 's support for the US during the Iraq war and the British electorate 's failure to unseat him at the general election .
He said there was no point in wasting the " beautiful nectar " of TM on a " scorpion nation " .
The ban has since been lifted .
The authors of the latest study say that if the benefits of Transcendental Meditation in depression are confirmed , the technique could be of value to millions .
One in five elderly people are thought to suffer from depression and half are undiagnosed by their family doctor .
Drugs and therapy have a useful but limited effect .
Take a deep breath ... TM facts and figures
* The Maharishi , who died in 2008 , believed that the spiritual wellbeing of the world would be transformed if everyone spent 20 minutes each day meditating .
* The technique is claimed to reduce stress and anxiety and to offer a way of dealing with unpleasant emotions .
* Course fees are : £ 590 for individual income over £ 40,000 , £ 490 for individual income over £ 25,000 , £ 390 for individual income under £ 25,000 with concessions of £ 290 for students , unemployed and retired people , and £ 190 for students under 18 .
* Instruction begins with a short ceremony and then the student learns and begins practising the technique .
In the UK there are 80 official TM teaching centres .
* Some TM teachers have become concerned about the cost and have left the organisation to offer instruction on their own .
* John Lennon fell out with the Maharishi and wrote a song , " Sexy Sadie " , about his supposedly materialistic ways .
Opera Mini launched on the iPhone a mere few weeks ago and the Apple handset has already has taken the top spot as the device with the most Opera Mini users , as measured by number of installs , in the US .
The iPhone ousted BlackBerry , the previous reigning champ in the US , and is reportedly well ahead of its mobile competitor from Canada .
Globally , the iPhone is in third place and is surrounded by Nokia and Sony Ericsson handsets which occupy 19 of the remaining top 20 slots .
Not only a US - based phenomena , the iPhone is also top dog in the UK and has a strong presence in Australia , Korea , Canada , Germany , and Japan .
Though impressive , these initial numbers may be boosted artificially by iPhone owners who download the app merely because it is new and noteworthy .
It will be interesting to see if this trend continues as the novelty wears off .

( CNN ) -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday approved the nation 's first offshore wind farm , signing off on a project that has bitterly divided Cape Cod over the last nine years .
The 130 turbines are to be located several miles from the Massachusetts shore in the iconic waters of Nantucket Sound .
The interior secretary said Cape Wind , as the project is known , is the start of a " new energy frontier . "
" The United States is leading a clean energy revolution that is reshaping our future , " Salazar told reporters in Boston .
" Cape Wind is an opening of a new chapter in that future , and we are all part of that history . "
" Cape Wind will be the nation 's first offshore wind farm , supplying clean power to homes and businesses in Massachusetts , plus creating good jobs here in America , " he said .
" This will be the first of many projects up and down the Atlantic coast . "
" Thank you for this decision , " said Gov. Deval Patrick .
" With this project , Massachusetts will lead the nation .
This day has been a long time coming . "
The location of the wind farm has stirred heated emotions over the years .
Cape
Wind became one of the most heavily vetted energy projects in the world .
Seventeen state and federal agencies weighed in , reviewing everything from its impact on shipping , aviation and fisheries .
Salazar visited the Cape earlier this year .
At the time , he pledged to cut through the nine years of regulatory red tape and make a final decision by the end of April .
At Wednesday 's news conference , the interior secretary said the process took far too long and future offshore projects would follow a " more rational and orderly " process .
There is no reason , he said , " why an offshore wind permit should take a decade to review and approve . "
The most notable opponent of Cape Wind was the late Sen .
Ted Kennedy , a champion of green energy who , to the dismay of environmentalists , fought against the wind farm .
The Kennedy compound will have a view of the wind turbines .
See how the views on the Cape will change
Other opponents ranged from billionaire energy giant William Koch to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
American Indians in the region also objected , saying the wind farm would be located on sacred ancestral grounds and disturb important sunrise ceremonies .
" I am strongly opposed to the administration 's misguided decision to move forward with Cape Wind , " Sen. Scott Brown said Wednesday .
" While I support the concept of wind power as an alternative source of energy , Nantucket Sound is a national treasure that should be protected from industrialization . "
In announcing his decision , Salazar said Cape Wind must follow stringent measures during construction , and it must conduct additional marine and archeological assessments of its impact .
The company must also explore ways to make the wind turbines less visible from shore .
" The smart responsible development of wind potential on Horseshoe Shoal need not conflict with the history and tradition of Nantucket Sound , " Salazar said .
Greenpeace , the Sierra Club and nearly every major environmental group in the nation supported the project , saying it 's necessary in moving the nation forward .
Six governors in the region also backed Cape Wind .
" Even though we enjoy overwhelming majority support , it 's not a popularity contest , " Cape Wind CEO Jim Gordon told CNN .
" This decision needs to be made on the merits .
And the record shows that it is in the public interest . "
In an editorial today , the Boston Globe said simply : " Make clean energy a reality ; approve Cape Wind now . "
The New York Times earlier this week also endorsed the project .
" Offshore wind farms are a common sight in Europe but not here , " the Times wrote .
" Cape Wind would be this country 's first -- sending , finally , a signal to the world about America 's resolve to fight global warming and reduce its dependence on foreign oil . "
The wind farm would bring hundreds of jobs and provide up to 75 percent of the power needed by the Cape and islands of Martha 's Vineyard and Nantucket , according to Cape Wind .
Estimates of the project have ranged from $ 800 million to $ 1 billion ; Cape Wind has not released how much it believes the wind farm will cost .
See the location of the wind farm
The 130 turbines , spaced a third - to a half - mile apart , will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of Nantucket Sound .
They will stand more than 40 stories tall , well over 10 times bigger than nearly every other structure around the Cape .
Cape Wind has said the project will not necessarily bring cheaper energy , but will bring cleaner electricity and become a model for offshore wind energy .
The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound , the project 's chief nemesis , has vowed to file suit to continue to try to block it .
The project already has withstood multiple court challenges .
Buddy Vanderhoop , a member of the Wampanoag Tribe , harshly criticized the decision to go ahead with the project .
" This is a federal embarrassment and a slap in the face not only to the tribes ... but it's also a slap in the face to the people who make their living " off fishing in the area of the wind farm 's location , Vanderhoop said .
Barbara Hill has long supported Cape Wind as the executive director of the grassroots organization Clean Power Now .
" We 're going to be partying later on tonight , " she said .
" We applaud Secretary Salazar for his vision and leadership in making this landmark decision and look forward to the day when the wind farm in Nantucket Sound will be producing the majority of the electrical needs of the Cape and islands . "
Wind farms produce roughly 2 percent of the nation 's energy , all from land - based facilities in California , Texas , Oklahoma , Wyoming and a few other states .
Locations offshore are considered optimal because the winds are stronger and more consistent .
A 2008 Energy Department report calls for " 20 Percent Wind Energy by 2030 . "
It said 18 percent of the nation 's wind energy should come from offshore sites .
Cape Wind first sought a permit in fall 2001 .
During that time , China built its first offshore wind farm .
Nine other countries have offshore farms : Belgium , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Ireland , the Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
On Wednesday , Gov. Patrick said Cape Wind will now allow the United States to join the offshore wind race .
" America now has a chance to turn that around . "

Payday Loans and Consumer Protection in Kansas
The first time state lawmakers took steps to regulate the industry and help keep consumers protected was in 1991 .
The state legislation attempted to pass laws to limit interest rates and help consumers not get in over their heads for payday loans , but the bill never got out of the Senate .
In 1993 , state lawmakers in Kansas were finally successful at passing the first bill to help regulate the payday loan industry .
Kansas was one of the first states in the country to take this step to protect consumers .
The new law capped interest rates , limited the amount of money consumers could borrow and set a ceiling for finance charges .
In 2004 , the Kansas state legislature went back to the law and amended it with the new , current regulations .
It set a loan term minimum for seven days and a maximum for 30 days .
Only two loans were allowed to be taken out at a time , according to this new set of regulations .
Lenders were also required to keep detailed records from borrowers .
Payday loans are also monitored through a state database .
The OSBC Division of Consumer and Mortgage Lending in Kansas is responsible for recording information about the payday loan industry in the state .
All lenders are part of the database and must update their information regarding license numbers and the location of their company .
As of 2015 , there were 11 online lenders in Kansas , 65 payday loan companies in the state and 326 individual locations for payday lending .
In 2006 , the federal government passed new laws for military borrowers .
The Military Lending
Act also impacted the payday loan industry in Kansas .
Borrowers who were serving in the military can't be charged more than 36 % interest .
Additionally , it is illegal to garnish wages for a member of the military if the payday loan is n't being paid back on time .
During a deployment , any type of collection or repayment can be put on hold .
What 's Next for Payday Loans in Kansas Since 2004 , there have been a few attempts by the state legislature to change the payday loan laws , but most of these attempts have not made it past committee or the Senate .
Lawmakers attempted to limit the number of consecutive payday loans to five with the same company in 2007 , but that bill never passed .
In 2010 , a bill failed that would tack on an additional $ 1 to each payday loan to help the state raise more revenue for programs .
In 2015 , the state tried to put more regulations on the industry to help senior citizens and cap interest rates for this group at 36 % , but that bill did n't make it into law .
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enacted new regulations in 2016 for the payday loan industry that should go into effect in 2020 .
These nationwide regulations will also impact Kansas payday loans .
First , the lender will be responsible for making sure the borrower can afford to pay back the loan before signing off on the paperwork .
Borrowers may also not take out more than three consecutive loans in a short period of time .
The borrower 's debit account for payment must also not be used after there are two unsuccessful payment attempts .
This helps a struggling borrower avoid pricey bank fees for insufficient funds .
In the future , Kansas lawmakers are proposing to set the interest rate at 36 % for all payday loan consumers .
This interest rate cap could help lower the cost of getting these loans and make it a more feasible option for many people struggling with paying their bills .
It can also help the most desperate borrowers avoid getting into the cycle of overwhelming debt .
The key to making payday loans work is to only take out the amount of money you need and to use them sparingly .
Payday loans should n't be taken out on a consistent basis .
It 's also important to consider credit counseling if you are regularly having trouble paying your bills each month .

Never one to shy away from making an entrance and promoting the Dogwood brand , Dogwood 's manager took to his horse , Raj , and hoofed it to the polls yesterday .
After a few bemused looks from passers - by he tethered Raj outside and strode in to cast his vote .
It was only when he came back out that he realised , regrettably perhaps , it was n’t his own masculine figure which had drawn all the admiring glances from the female voters , but it was Raj who had them eating out of the sole of his hoof … well , palm of his hand does n’t quite work with horses !
After much stroking and pats a’ plenty , ( that ’s Raj – not Dogwood 's manager ) he hopped back on and rode off into the sunset .
He told us it was easier to ride to the polling station rather than to drive or walk , but the Dogwood staff do n’t really buy that , we believe it was really a long harboured John Wayne - esque fantasy of his .
Catholic Church in crisis over sexual abuse reports
By Dietmar Henning
15 April 2010
Shortly after reports of the first cases of sexual abuse by members of the Jesuit Order in the renowned Berlin Canisius College , new victims of Catholic institutions have come forward on an almost daily basis .
Reports of these abuses have plunged the Catholic Church into a deep crisis worldwide .
The lawyer appointed by the Jesuit Order , Ursula Raue , said at the weekend that she knew of about 170 victims , including 59 former pupils of the Canisius College .
Abuses by priests in the Jesuit Order were also carried out in the 1950s and 1960s .
She did not give a precise figure for the number of those accused .
What is clear is that thousands of children and young people in Germany were victims of the Roman Catholic Church .
Cases are also increasingly coming to light in other countries .
Currently , the full extent of the abuse can only be the subject of speculation .
But a report issued by a commission of inquiry in May 2009 in Ireland provides an estimate , documenting the mistreatment and abuse of 35,000 children in Irish religious institutions between 1914 and 2000 .
The never - ending stream of reports about the abuse of mostly male children and teenagers by Catholic priests and officials behind church doors , in boarding schools and children ’s homes , in parishes and vestries , have breached the dam of silence imposed by the Church .
Cases of sexual abuse in other public , private and church schools have now also been reported .
The victims , many of whom had kept silent out of shame , fear for the consequences and because of the suffering caused by the trauma , have been encouraged by the media attention to break their silence .
The decades of cover -up of these crimes by the respective institutions — especially the Catholic Church — has led to an outcry .
Representatives of the Vatican and politicians close to the Church have sought to use the reports implicating other institutions to divert attention from the scale of the abuse that took place within the Catholic Church .
In particular , in Germany , cases of mistreatment at the Odenwald School in Hesse , known for its liberal approach to education , are being cited to claim that sexual abuse occurred in all sorts of institutions .
Some conservatives have even claimed that a liberal approach to education itself and the educational reforms of the 1970s were the cause for the abuse .
The Hesse deputy state premier , Jörg - Uwe Hahn ( Free Democratic Party , FDP ) , went so far as to make the absurd claim that the Social Democrats and Greens had “ prepared the ground ” for a climate of sexual abuse in the 1980s and 1990s .
Similarly , cases of sexual abuse reported in children ’s homes in the former East Germany , with the help of the crimes of the Stalinist regime , are being used to relativise the crimes of the Catholic Church .
Bishop Walter Mixa of Augsburg , an arch - conservative , blames the abuse on the increasing sexualisation of public life , and claims that the level of abuse in Church institutions was “ very small . ”
Raniero Cantalamessa , preacher to the Papal household , has tried to portray the Catholic Church as a victim of a campaign .
In a sermon on Good Friday , he compared the current situation with anti-Semitic persecution — a statement the Vatican subsequently had to retract .
These are transparent attempts to deflect attention from their own crimes and preserve the status quo of the Roman Catholic Church .
In reality , the present crisis is shaking the Catholic Church to its foundations .
The silence of the Vatican
This is why the history of abuse within the ranks of the Catholic Church has been covered up and suppressed by those in the very highest offices , including the Pope himself .
According to the “ Report Mainz ” TV programme and the Badische Zeitung , the chairman of the German Bishops ’ Conference , Robert Zollitsch , while working as personnel officer in the Archdiocese of Freiburg in 1991 — without informing the state attorneys — ordered the early retirement of a priest who was said to have abused at least 17 children and adolescents .
The priest then committed suicide in 1995 .
Former residents of children ’s homes have accused Bishop Mixa of physical mistreatment during his time as pastor at Schrobenhausen .
Mixa denies this .
The current Pope , Benedict XVI , while he was a cardinal , is said to have opposed the removal from office of a paedophile priest in California .
A letter from 1985 , signed by the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , expresses concerns about the consequences for the world church should the priest be removed from office .
In 1978 , the priest in question , Stephen Kiesler , had already been given a three - year suspended sentence for the sexual harassment of two boys .
In 1981 , once his sentence had expired , he asked to be released from the priesthood , and the diocese sent a letter to the Vatican .
The case then sat in Rome for four years before Ratzinger replied to the bishop .
Two more years passed before dismissal of the paedophile priest , during which the man worked with children .
The letter “ De delictis gravioribus , ” which Cardinal Ratzinger wrote in 2001 , announced that the Vatican was assuming sole authority for cases of abuse — a blatant attempt to force the bishops into silence .
Until now , the Pope has kept a low profile .
On March 19 , he signed a pastoral letter directed towards the Irish congregation on the subject of sexual abuse .
But he has said nothing about the cases in Germany .
He also said nothing in his Easter message .
Meanwhile , a “ round table ” on the topic is planned in Germany .
This will be chaired by Family Minister Kristina Schröder ( Christian Democratic Union , CDU ) , Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger ( FDP ) and Education Minister Annette Schavan ( CDU ) .
The first meeting of the 40 - strong body is planned for April 23 .
Its full title — “ Sexual abuse in dependent and power relations in private and public institutions and within the family ” — reveals that the Church has got its way on one question .
The German Bishops Conference had vehemently rejected the original plan for a round table looking solely at abuse within the Catholic Church .
The body will now be little more than another attempt by the Catholic Church to cover things up .
Church critic Uta Ranke - Heinemann doubts the round table will have any positive effects .
In 1970 , Ranke - Heinemann was the first woman in the world to gain a professorship in Catholic theology .
The professor had to abandon her chair in 1987 because she expressed doubts about the virgin birth .
For many years , she has been investigating cases of sexual abuse in the Church .
In an interview with Zeit Online she said she feared that “ such a round table in Germany would suffer a similar fate to the ‘ National Review Board , ’ established in 2002 to investigate allegations of abuse in the Church in America . ”
After one year , its director , former governor of Oklahoma , Frank Keating , came to the conclusion , “ This is not my Church , it ’s the Mafia , this is the Cosa Nostra . ”
He then had to resign .
Ranke - Heinemann also recalled the case of the Cardinal of Boston , Bernard Francis Law .
While he resigned in 2002 because of the constant transferring of paedophile priests and the concealment of abuse cases from the state authorities , “ After that , however , he was given a high office in the Vatican . ”
The sexual teachings of the Church
Critics both from within and around the Church believe the time has finally come to question Catholic sexual teachings , especially regarding celibacy .
This they regard as the main reason for the recruitment problems of the Catholic Church .
There is a dramatic shortage of priests in the Church , not only in Germany .
According to these critics , lifting the celibacy rule would not only raise the prestige of the Catholic Church in the eyes of the population , but also attract more young people to become priests — ultimately saving the Church as an institution .
The critical clerical theologian Hans Kung wrote in the Süddeutsche Zeitung that celibacy was “ the most important structural expression of a repressed attitude by the Catholic Church on sexuality , as is also expressed regarding contraception and other matters . ”
For many centuries , bishops and others that professed the faith were married , Küng stressed .
“ Mandatory celibacy is the main reason for the catastrophic shortage of priests , the neglect of the Eucharist and the collapse in many places of personal pastoral care , ” he wrote .
Celibacy was imposed in the Middle Ages after centuries of discussions in the Church .
One of the main reasons was economic .
The Roman Church tried to prevent the decimation of ecclesiastical benefices administered by married priests through necessary payments for the subsistence of their family and through inheritance .
The common practice in the Middle Ages of offices being passed from father to son also led to conflict with Rome .
These conflicts were resolved in the interest of Rome through the affirmation of the requirement that priests be celibate .
To the present day , the Catholic Church relies on the theory of sexuality developed in the Middle Ages .
In an article in Tagesspiegel , the head of the Berlin Canisius College , Father Klaus Mertes , was critical that the Catholic Church still suffered from homophobia and was far removed from real life when it came to the topic of sexuality .
Bishop of Trier Stephan Ackermann , recently given responsibility by the Bishops ’ Conference for dealing with cases of sexual abuse in the Church , conceded in an interview that one must pose the question “ whether the priestly life attracts morbidly predisposed men or homosexuals in a special way . ”
A “ special vigilance in the qualifying examination ” was called for , he said .
At the same time there is more to the current crisis of Catholic Church than the obligation of celibacy .
Every aspect of the present crisis — the victims ’ plight , the disturbed sexuality of priests , the malice of Church officials in dealing with abuse — is indicative of a sick institution , whose practices and teachings run contrary to basic human needs , and inevitably create unhealthy psycho-sexual conditions .
The Catholic Church is an anachronism , a mockery of modern society .
The bloated and corrupt church functionaries live like kings , rail against sin and vice , in which they themselves not infrequently indulge , oppose contraception and the right to abortion , condemn homosexuality , are enthusiastic about spiritual oppression and oppose science and rationality .
Ever since Christianity arose from a revolutionary Jewish sect , becoming the state religion in the Roman Empire in the year 380 , it has allied itself with the existing powers ( in 1939 blessing the weapons of Hitler ’s armies ) and making life a scourge for millions of people , who are supposed to console their miserable lives on earth with the heavenly paradise that comes after death .
This mass of social reaction and backwardness must necessarily be reflected in the personal relationships within the Church , and between priests and members of the congregation .
The prejudice against healthy sexual relations , the duty of celibacy , the thesis of the immaculate conception , the virgin birth , the nonsense of the Holy Trinity and other Catholic doctrines and dogmas are inextricably linked .
It is virtually impossible to remove a single element without the entire edifice coming crashing down .
This is the deeper basis of the appalling involvement of the Roman Catholic Church in sexual abuse .
It is a question of self - preservation .
Church leaders would rather endanger the lives of the children and young people entrusted to them , placing their priests in hopeless situations and rejecting the realities of civilization , than risk the dissolution of the entire institution .
On May 12 , 2006 , I hacked together my first bash script that was more than a dozen lines and published it on Lifehacker .
todo.sh manipulated a todo .
txt file at the command line using grep , tail , head , sort , and cat : all the shell - based text tools that I knew and loved .
Back then , in Lifehacker ’s heyday , I was obsessed with the simplicity and portability of text files , mostly because Danny O’Brien featured them front and center in his original life hacks talk .
Since then , Todo . txt CLI has grown into a legitimate open source project with dozens of contributors , hundreds of people on the mailing list , regression tests , custom add - ons , and a Python fork .
This script has literally run my life since 2006 , but using it has n’t been its greatest value –the collaborative development experience has .
Because the project attracted Unix geeks with skills way beyond mine , through mailing list discussions , I learned much more about Unix software design than I could have ever expected .
Last year , when I left Lifehacker and had more time to pay attention to the project , thanks to a suggestion on the mailing list , I moved it over to GitHub and absolutely fell in love .
( All of my active software projects live on GitHub now , including my full - time job project , ThinkTank . )
GitHub ’s commit history does n’t include all the early contributors , but I ’m still getting pull requests for the project , as recently as this week .
Check out a screenshot of the fork network graph :
At this point the todo.sh code is stable ; I just released version 2.6 with some fixes and tweaks .
I use it plus some key add - ons ( like projectview ) every single day .
Four years after I hacked together todo.sh ’s first pathetic iteration , my done .
txt file is a delightfully grep - able 1,000 + line archive of completed tasks .
I ’m still using GeekTool to pin my high - priority tasks to my desktop in a heads - up display ; and I store my todo. txt and done .
txt files in Dropbox so I can access it from all of my computers and my phone .
Call for Android Developers
Todo.sh ’s biggest problem right now is mobile access .
While a contributor did put together an awesome web - based mobile interface to todo.sh , I ’m gearing up to create an Android application that displays and updates your todo .
txt file using Dropbox ’s APIs .
Let me know in the comments or on the mailing list if you ’re interested in helping out with that .
If you have n’t seen todo . txt in action , here ’s a quick screencast .
“ I am an Iranian lesbian . ”
It seems an introduction designed to shock anyone who knows anything about official Iranian attitudes to such admissions .
After all , it was the country 's own president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who in 2007 confidently stated during an address at New York 's Columbia University that Iran did not have any gays .
But Kiana Firouz , a 27 - year - old writer , actress and gay rights activists , is not only real — she 's out , and proud , having adopted London as her hometown almost two years ago .
Until then , Kiana lived in the Marzdaran neighborhood west of Tehran .
She went to school and studied cinema .
It was during her time at school that she became a member of an underground network of lesbians who gathered frequently to talk about their problems .
She says each of the women had their own tragic stories to tell .
One of the girls told the group of her mother ’s reaction when she told her she was a lesbian .
" She told me ' I would have been less devastated if you had told me you have cancer . ' "
Life is far from easy for gays and lesbians in Iran .
The issue is a taboo and the government is determined to brush it aside , or — following Ahmadinejad 's lead — pretend that it does n't exist .
As a result of lack of awareness in the society , gays and lesbians are usually marginalized , and many suffer depression .
Kiana recalls the story of another well - educated lesbian living in Tehran who wanted to set up her own publishing company but needed permission from the Ministry of Culture and Guidance and was told she needed to be married .
“ There was no way she would enter a forced marriage , ” Kiana said , “ in the end she just decided to give up on her company . ”
And while Iran might not officially have gay citizens , it does have 3,000 “ patients with sexual orientation complications , ” according to Hassan Mousavi Chalak , head of the Iranian Welfare Organization .
Men caught for a second time having gay sex face the death penalty according to the law in Iran , and women receive 100 lashes on the second conviction .
Fourth - time offenders face the death penalty .
The Islamic Republic still follows a fatwa issued in 1978 by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the revolution ’s leader that the government should financially help those in need of a sex - change operation .
This was after Maryam Molkara ( a transgender going by the male name of Ferydoon ) visited the Ayatollah in person wearing a man ’s suit and a carrying the Quran .
After a clash with guards , she managed to get to the Ayatollah telling him she was “ a man trapped in a woman ’s body . ”
He was moved by her story , and asked that government officially help those who have such problems .
Perhaps ironically , now the government provides “ patients ” who need sex - change operations with financial aid .
Payments for operation could range from $ 1,000 to $ 4,000 .
However , many gays and lesbians are still driven underground .
To help fellow lesbians , Kiana and a group of like - minded friends decided to promote increased awareness in society by producing an online magazine in Farsi .
“ Iran is a country where any opposition is killed in its inception , ” Kiana said in an interview with GlobalPost .
“ We could n’t operate openly , so the only medium that we had was the internet .
That ’s why we created an online magazine . ”
The magazine is called “ My Sex , Iranian lesbian ” and content ranges from poems and literature about lesbianism to how to have a better orgasm with a partner .
Some features talk about dangers of AIDS and prevention methods .
It was a daring act in a country where basic sex education is not officially offered to young people until right before their marriage .
So far they ’ve published 10 issues .
Kiana says she contributed to the magazine by writing poems and articles .
She said she had been writing short stories and poems since age 18 .
Kiana said she moved to the U.K. to continue her studies in cinema , but faces an uncertain future as her application for asylum has been rejected .
There , she was approached by film makers Ramin Goudarzinejad and Mahshad Torkan , who proposed a movie about her life .
Kiana says she was hesitant about the project because of fear of complications if she returned to Iran , where she has family .
She ultimately agreed in order to become “ the voice of lesbians in Iran to be heard . ”
The movie , called “ Cul de Sac , ” is based on her own life , though she admits it is dramatized .
It follows her through the process of escaping pressures in Iran and stepping into a life that she — mistakenly — thought would be much better .
Kiana said that although she lived in a free , democratic country , she had not yet found peace .
“ I ’m still faced with social stigma from fellow Iranians , " she said .
“ I get hate messages all the time . ”
Even life for the director of the movie has n’t been easy .
He has been receiving messages telling him he should stop tackling this topic .
Goudarzi Nejad has previously made a movie about Iranian lesbians called “ Have I ever Happened , ” and says that after his movie came out , an Iranian woman got in touch , pleading with him to help increase awareness inside the country .
Kiana , meanwhile , is no longer shy about revealing sexuality .
“ I ’m happy to be the first Iranian lesbian who dared kiss her girlfriend on screen , ” she said proudly .
The scene has raised eyebrows in the Iranian community .
Even less traditional and more secular Iranians living in Los Angeles are surprised by Kiana ’s outspokenness .
“ We ’ve never seen such things before from Iranian women , ” said Ali Reza Nourizadeh , the Iranian presenter of Channel One , a satellite channel , based in the U.S. and a fervent supporter of the Shah .
“ With this movie , Kiana has signed her own death warrant , ” he added , indicating the level of danger she faces .
Kiana said she was not worried about her own life any more .
“ I feel like I ’ve been told I have only a few days to live , ” she said .
“ I ’m completing all my unfinished projects .
I just do n’t know what will happen in the future . ”
For her , the greatest achievement has been her movie , and the chance to get her message across .
“ I just wanted to say to everyone , we are not sick or mentally ill .
For one moment , let ’s leave all religious , cultural and traditional beliefs behind us .
Let ’s all once again review love , the true love between two human beings . ”
Well , reported today ( although apparently the details have been known for a while , slow news day perhaps ? ) have been the details of the Unreal Development Kit ( UDK ) commercial licencing terms .
In brief ( focusing on indie game development ) the details are , and I ’m assuming this is all on a per - title basis as it does n’t specify :
$ 99 ( £ 65 ) up - front
0 % royalties on first $ 5000 ( £ 3250 ) of UDK related revenue
25 % royalties on all revenue above $ 5000
They have some examples behind the second link , but basically you get £ 3185 per game before their royalty kicks in .
This might sound great to aspiring Indies , and yes it does mean you have access to one of the most widely used and respected game engines , but I personally feel it would be a bad deal .
Say you make £ 5,000 revenue from your game ( sorry for £s but hey , I ’m from the UK 🙂 ) , now comparing it with Unity Pro as an example :
Unity Pro – you pay £ 780 for the engine with no royalty terms .
Total cost = £ 780 upfront
Total profit = £ 5000 - £ 780 = £ 4220
UDK – you pay £ 65 up front , 0 % on the first £ 3250 , then 25 % on the remaining £ 1750 .
Total cost = £ 65 + 25 % of £ 1750 = £ 503
Total profit = £ 5000 – £ 503 = £ 4497
So the upfront cost of Unity Pro is higher , meaning you make £ 227 more by using UDK on your first £ 5000 .
Great !
Until you realise that you will always have 25 % taken from any future earnings .
In fact any revenue above £ 6250 will see you worse off under the UDK deal .
And unlike big studio developed games that aim for that sales spike on release to reap most of their profits , Indie devs rely much more on the ‘ long tail ’ – those sales that keep trickling in months , years after release .
If you depend on that revenue model the UDK royalty deal is far less appealing .
What also concerns me is this particular section of the terms :
“ UDK related revenue includes , but is not limited to , monies earned from : sales , services , training , advertisements , sponsorships , endorsements , memberships , subscription fees , rentals and pay - to - play . ”
Most royalty terms I ’ve seen for other engines focus on revenue from sales of the title only .
However Epics ’ terms not only include revenue from direct sales , but also seemingly any revenue generated by ad banners on the game ’s webpage , Google ads / adwords for the game or money coming from third parties that you use to promote your game ( e.g. at a con or in an Indie game showcase ) .
And the ‘ but is not limited to ’ means they could stretch this to anything bringing in some cash that they deem to be in any way connected to the game you have made .
For example , you make game related T - Shirts or some art books to sell – 25 % cut please .
Your game wins a competition that comes with a cash prize – they would be well within their terms to request a 25 % cut of that too as it is ‘ UDK related revenue ’ .
Now I ’m not promoting Unity over UDK as a game engine .
Unity is great , but as engines go UDK is far more established , more feature packed , incredibly powerful and using it will give you many transferrable skills should you wish to apply for a ‘ proper job ’ in the industry .
But using Unity as an example of an engine with a flat - fee and no royalty structure , especially with regard to where the smallest Indies make profit , UDKs royalty structure is not a good deal .
Also their far - reaching and simultaneously open - ended definition of what constitutes ‘ UDK related revenue ’ should be very concerning for any Indie that relies on trickle revenue and merchandising sales to keep things ticking over .
In fact I would go so far as to say that any royalty - based deal for a game engine for an Indie is a no no .
You ’re already having big % cuts taken from the likes of Steam and / or your website store provider , you do n’t need yet another party taking yet another cut .
Pay a single upfront fee instead – it will hurt more to start with , but you will benefit in the long run .
5 MP camera and 64GB of storage are still unconfirmed yet as the device become official presumably this June .
Then suddenly beside all this iPhone 5G is much way ahead and up with rumor of taunting an 8 MP camera supplied by Sony .
Even the iPhone 4G seems to be premiered early with iPhone OS 4 capabilities however the hardware rumors ofandare still unconfirmed yet as the device become official presumably this June .
Then suddenly beside all this 4th generation early rumors , theis much way ahead and up with rumor of taunting an 8 MP camera supplied by Sony .
“ Apple has picked Sony ’s 8 - megapixel camera chip for the 2011 iPhone , according to supply and manufacturing sources , said Rodman Renshaw analyst Ashok Kumar . ”
Currently the iPhone ’s camera is from OmniVision hint that the 5MP camera will come from them too .
Knowing Sony ’s phones mounted by their camera modules boast high quality captured images then I must say it ’s not a bad choice .
Along the way the 2011 maybe time for 4G networks so possibly we can have an iPhone 5G with 4G support .
In the 1920s , J.B.S. Haldane published a paper entitled , " On Being the Right Size . "
It is deliciously gruesome , and to this day , it remains one of the most accessible papers on the intersection of biology and physics .
Advertisement
The paper shows its age a little when Haldane opens with a reference to Pilgrim 's Progress .
My exposure to that terrifyingly pious tome was when Meg , Amy , Jo and Beth , America 's most sickeningly moral girls , read it every morning in Little Women .
Little Women is set during the Civil War. Pilgrim 's Progress was considered old - fashioned even then .
Suffice it to say , there are sixty - foot - high giants in Pilgrim 's Progress .
Haldane explains why it is n't good to be big .
It basically comes down to some very old geometry ; area versus volume .
Advertisement
Imagine a cube resting on one of its sides .
The side it is resting on is the length of one side , L , squared .
The volume is L cubed .
As the cube gets bigger , L x L x L amount of volume is resting on L x L amount of surface area .

This is n't just a problem for the part of a giant that touches the ground ( although their feet have got to be hurting ) .
It 's a problem for every cross-section of the body that takes weight .
Making something giant - sized looks cool in science fiction .
Seeing it basically disintegrate under the strain of its own weight would n't look nearly as cool .
Okay , maybe it would .
But it would n't make for an interesting fight for the protagonist .
But Haldane does n't stop there .
By shrinking or expanding , all sorts of new physics phenomena have to be dealt with .
Most of us have been dunked in water .
When we come out , we brush the drops away .
Most of us have also seen insects in water .
They are n't able to brush the droplets off them when they come out .
Water has a certain surface tension that allows droplets to form a certain size .
That size is tiny to us .
To an ant , it is huge , and heavy .
A good - sized water droplet can be , to an ant , a swimming pool big enough to drown in .
Advertisement
Of course the most vivid imagery happens when Haldane explains what happens to various animals when they 're dropped from a great height :
" You can drop a mouse down a thousand - yard mine shaft ; and , on arriving at the bottom , it gets a slight shock and walks away , provided that the ground is fairly soft .
A rat is killed , a man is broken , a horse splashes . "
Advertisement
It 's no wonder why the paper has stuck around .
It 's entertaining , informative , and gives the reader a perspective that is usually entirely new .
It 's a paper to consider before you test out that shrink - ray .

6 Ever wanted to scan a suspicious looking file using multiple antivirus software ?
This happened to me recently , as I stated in my last post that I upgraded my Ubuntu linux to Lucid Lynx and installed Oracle Virtual Box over it .
I later installed Windows XP as a virtual operating system and thought it might be better if I would install an antivirus program on it .
However , as I moved my antivirus program and some other files from my USB drive , I had a gut feeling that things are just not right .
So ..a bit of googling landed me at Virustotal.com which allows to scan a file using multiple antivirus software , and it does what it says perfectly :)
The site is extremely easy to use , I uploaded a file over it and it took less than a minute to generate results .
The file was found positively ID ’ed by it and one antivirus triggered a positive result from a scan of 41 antivirus .
Overall , it saved my day and is worth having a look at it .

I like the stream of light in photograph , it impressive me .
The spots of light make a stream or line of light .
Dark night be color full of lights , photo more worth .
In low light conditions it hard to got good photo .
Motion is not always bad , Basically three areas that you can adjust are ISO , Aperture and Shutter speed .
The opening and closing of the lens diaphragm , or aperture , affects the amount of light .
Shutter speed setting affects the amount it take the time for light entering to camera sensor .
So if you have a fast shutter speed , then you need more light .
If your shutter speed is slower , then you need less light .
As a result , an open aperture means a faster shutter speed .
A closed aperture means a slower shutter speed .
The other variable in the exposure equation is ISO , which refers to the sensitivity of the film or imaging sensor inside your camera .
So before we find out more technically .
I have collected some amazing photograph of light speed .

Mona - Lisa - Skulptur am Karlsplatz
Eine temporäre Installation des indischen Künstlers Subodh Gupta wird am Abend des 27 .
April 2010 auf dem Wiener Karlsplatz am public space der Kunsthalle eröffnet - als Projekt im Rahmen von Kunst im öffentlichen Raum .
Zu sehen ist eine überdimensionale Mona Lisa .
Kultur aktuell , 27.04.2010
Subodh Gupta , Jahrgang 1964 , zählt zu den bedeutendsten , zeitgenössischen Künstlern aus Indien und zu den vielseitigsten - mit Skulpturen , Malerei , Installationen , Fotografie , Performance und Video .
Ein Kopf im Autoverkehr
Mona Lisa steht mitten auf dem Wiener Karlsplatz .
Sie ist 2,40 Meter groß und lächelt unverdrossen - obwohl der Autoverkehr an ihr vorbeirauscht und obwohl ihr ein Schnauzbart und ein Spitzbart verpasst wurden .
Der indische Künstler Subodh Gupta hat es Marcel Duchamp gleichgetan .
" Für mich gab es zuerst Duchamp , dann Mona Lisa " , sagt Subodh Gupta .
" In der Tate Modern habe ich vor Jahren erstmals eine Ausstellung von Duchamp gesehen , und dort war auch diese Postkarte mit der bärtigen Mona Lisa - ganz ehrlich , seit damals verehre ich ihn als den Gottvater der Konzeptkunst .
Ich wollte ihm einen Brief schreiben und mein Brief ist diese Skulptur .
Ich wollte über ein Kunstwerk , das ich ihm widme , einen Dialog mit ihm führen . "
Kunst - Ikonen in neuem Kontext
" Et tu , Duchamp ? " heißt denn auch die bärtige Mona Lisa - Bronzeskulptur von Subodh Gupta .
Gupta lebt und arbeitet in Neu - Dehli und immer wieder verknüpft er in seinen Arbeiten seine indische Identität mit Referenzen an die westliche Kunstgeschichte und stellt Ikonen europäischer Kunst in einen neuen Kontext .
" Meine Heimat ist für mich der Ausgangspunkt jeder Arbeit , sie hat mich geprägt , aber zugleich sehe ich die ganze Welt als Projektionsfläche und Ideenreservoir , die Ideen kommen von überall .
Hier in Wien präsentiere ich mich nicht als indischer Künstler , sondern als Künstler " , betont Subodh Gupta .
Totenkopf aus rostfreien Stahltöpfen
Bekannt wurde Subodh Gupta vor allem mit " Very Hungry God " , einem überdimensionalen Totenkopf aus jenen rostfreien Stahltöpfen , in denen Inder ihr Mittagessen transportieren .
2007 war diese Arbeit - ausgestellt in Venedig vor dem Palazzo Grassi am Canal Grande - eine der meist diskutierten der Biennale .
" Diese Skulptur erzählt von den Katastrophen , die auf diesem Planeten passieren " , sagt der Künstler , " von jenen die vom Menschen verursacht sind , von den Kriegen im Nahen Osten , in Afghanistan oder wo auch immer , und von den Naturkatastrophen , von Tsunamis und Vulkanausbrüchen - immer wenn so etwas passiert , sagen wir : Oh God !
So als hätte Gott das verursacht - Gott bist du so hungrig , dass du so viele Menschen verschlingen musst ? "
Kommerziell erfolgreich
" Damien Hirst des Subkontinents " wird Subodh Gupta auch genannt oder auch " Marcel Duchamp von Asien " .
Als einer der international bekanntesten zeitgenössischen Künstler Indiens ist er auch einer der der kommerziell erfolgreichsten - seine Werke werden mittlerweile um einige hunderttausend Euro gehandelt .
Während sich die Trendscouts der globalisierten Kunstwelt auf Indien stürzen , wird die zeitgenössische indische Kunst im eigenen Land aber erst langsam entdeckt , sagt Subodh Gupta : " Es ist noch ein weiter Weg , die Indien - Begeisterung der Kunstszene ist mehr ein Medien - Hype , mit der Realität hat das wenig zu tun .
Es gibt viele Defizite : Wir brauchen mehr Ausbildungsstätten , Akademien , die neue Ansätze fördern , und : Es gibt in ganz Indien nicht mehr als drei oder vier Kunstsammler .
Aber wir sind froh , dass wir international mehr und mehr beachtet werden , dass wir unsere Kunst außerhalb des Landes zeigen können . "
Searching for microplastics within the human body
Rick Smith decided to conduct an experiment on himself to see if he could measure an increase of microplastics in his body .
The author and Executive Director of the Broadbent Institute says the lab - based tests on his stool samples are the first of their kind in North America to search for traces of the tiny plastic particles in people .
Microplastics have been discovered circulating in the environment and are linked to health concerns .
After the client received their first set of mock - ups for a Catholic church brochure with a beautiful oil painting on the cover , I received this message :
“ Brochure looks great , but we ’d prefer to use a photograph of Jesus instead of a painting ”
Masterplan - Fantastic DM tool for 4th Edition D&D !
Today 's blog wo n't be too long I 'm afraid , I 'm mid-way in exams !
However , I am still blogging today !
Hurrah !
I was browsing the web when I stumbled upon a little gem which I thought might help my readers whenever they write up their adventures .
The software is called Masterplan .
It enables DMs to actively write a story , prepare encounters and even design the maps themselves .
I 've played around with it for about 20 minutes today and it 's absolutely fantastic .
I 'll break it down a bit so you can understand it a bit easier : Writing the plot :
The plot is obviously the biggest part in any D&D game .
No plot means no story and therefore no adventure to go on !
There are the exceptions of those dungeon crawling types where you just smash monsters in each room and find treasure with no goal in mind ( aside from possibly exploring the whole place ) .
However , this piece of software enables DMs to write a plot but not just as a chunk of text ... oh no , but actually as seperate plot points that you can link to each other .
This enables the DM to break down the main story into digestable elements for the player , and also allows to maybe pop some side quests in there as well .
The plot writing aspect of the software can help DMs keep track of where they are within the main plot and can type notes of character 's actions etc without having to fumble around for pieces of paper or looking up the place to type it in a word document .
A very useful tool .
Maps :
You can create maps using this software .
You can download additional tiles from other places , however after looking around I could n't find any ( any help would be great with this !
Leave a comment if you find anything ! ) .
The tiles can easily be dragged and dropped to a large grid and can easily be connected together to create a dungeon .
Tiles include dungeon floor , water and doors just to name a few of them .
Once you 've created your dungeon you can save it and load it back whenever you wish .
Encounters :
Encounters can also be created .
You can create traps , hazards , skill checks or combat encounters .
The nifty thing is , it works out the Encounter Level ( how hard the encounter will be ) so you can assess how hard or easy it will be for your players to over come .
This applys to all encounters you can create .
I played around mainly with making a monster encounter and realised there is a grey bar at the bottom that fills up the more difficult it becomes and provides an encounter level .
Very useful if you want to mix and match some of the monsters .
On top of this , if you have made a map you can also drag your monsters to their starting positions in your dungeon !
Regards to combat encounters , you can add the players onto the map and then run the combat how you would .
The software automatically rolls for initiatives for the monsters , you just have to fill in the players and place them on the board .
Then , it orders the initiative for you and you can move the monsters / players around the board for the combat .
I thought this was a brilliant part of the system , but I did n't find an in - built dice roller ?
However , you do n't want to completely take away the player experience , they have to do something to be involved ... which leads me to a final point ...
Player view
The software assumes you will hook up the computer to a monitor or another laptop / related device that the players can look at .
This enables the DM , from his computer / laptop to display to the players what their characters can see .
The DM simply clicks on " Player View " and this enables the players to see where their characters are in relation to all the monsters .
You can include cool features such as " fog of war " or " line of sight " which shows only what the character can see within the dungeon .
An absolutely fantastic addition to the software !
Concluding thoughts
Yes , FREE :
Anyone used this software ?
What did they think ?
What about those extra tiles and monsters ... did anyone find anywhere else you can download them ?
All in all I am very impressed with this software .
It can be a bit confusing at first and muddle your mind up a bit but once you have the basics it will be able to save so much time for a DM when he prepares .
With already pre-made monsters , the DM does n't have to fumble around the Monster Manual to look for a goblin when he has the stats right in front of him .
If you 're a D&D insider you can apparently download tiles and monsters from there .
But apparently you can get them for free if you search on the internet ... but anyone can contribute here if you like !
The fact you can show the maps and encounters on another screen I thought was absolutely fantastic , and best of all , it 's free .
Yes , FREE : Get it here !

A massive , quickly growing oil slick steered by unpredictable winds and rough seas lapped closer to land Saturday , bearing down on a stunned gulf coastline that had been just beginning to get its swagger back after Hurricane Katrina .
From shrimpers in Mississippi delta fishing towns such as Venice , La. , to urban settlers trying to rebuild lives in New Orleans ’ Lower 9th Ward , the approaching environmental disaster punctured the upbeat mood with a frightening and uncertain menace .
“ People were feeling up for a little while , and people were starting to come back , ” said Gilbert Lee , 71 , a shrimper in Venice , one of the towns closest to the slick .
“ But what are they going to come back to now ?
I ’ll tell you , this ai n’t nice .
It ’s pitiful . ”
Outside a Lower 9th
Ward church where a waving banner said , “ We ’ve Come This Far by Faith , ” residents meeting with Environmental Protection Agency officials were stoic but fearful that the steps they had taken to recover from Katrina would be undone .
It ’s a community “ that ’s not fully recovered , ” said Alice Craft - Kerney , a nurse who runs a clinic there .
The oil leak “ triggers that anxiety of ‘ what ’s going to happen ? ’
You remember that from the storm .
It ’s like , ‘ Here we go again . ’ ”
As residents fretted , experts argued over the size of the slick , and federal officials acknowledged that no one knows exactly how much oil is still leaking from the underwater well , which ruptured April 20 during an explosion on a drilling platform 130 miles southeast of New Orleans .
“ Any exact estimate of what ’s flowing out of those pipes down there is probably impossible , ” said Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , named Saturday as the point man for the spill .
It was Allen whom President George W. Bush turned to after Katrina to take control of the slow and much - criticized response to that disaster .
Allen said the efforts of the federal government , and of BP , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig , remained focused on stopping the gush from the seabed nearly a mile beneath the surface .
“ Estimates are useful , but we are planning far beyond that , ” said Allen , a four - star admiral and commandant of the Coast Guard .
“ That ’s why it is so important to stop [ it ] at the wellhead . ”
Already , oil has reached some of the environmentally sensitive islands near the coast .
Depending on the weather , Allen said , more significant amounts of oil could hit gulf state shores by Monday or Tuesday .
The Coast Guard has estimated that 200,000 gallons of oil are pouring from the well daily , a figure that would put the total spilled so far at 1.6 million gallons .
By comparison , the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska in 1989 resulted in a spill of 11 million gallons .
Most of the assessments of the size of the spill have come from studying satellite images of the Gulf of Mexico , though that analysis does n’t calculate the thickness of the oil .
However , several academics and consultants said Saturday that the size of the slick is larger than previously thought , and may be growing more rapidly .
A tiny nonprofit group , SkyTruth , said Saturday that its analysis of satellite and radar data suggested that more than 11.1 million gallons of oil was contained in the slick .
John Amos , the group ’s president , also estimated the rate of oil leaking at 25,000 barrels a day ( more than 1 million gallons ) .
There are 42 gallons in a barrel of oil .
Last week , SkyTruth challenged BP ’s initial estimate of 1,000 barrels a day , arguing that it was closer to 5,000 .
The figure was quickly revised .
Allen said it was fruitless to discuss the differences between spill rates .
“ The continued leakage of anything for an extended period of time is going to cause an extraordinary amount of problems for us , ” he said .
BP officials said they were doing all they could to stop the oil gusher .
Using robotic submarines , BP is trying to shut the blowout preventer , which would be the quickest fix .
Separately , the company is preparing to drill a hole into the seafloor near the accident site and angle it into the well to seal it off , an effort that would take several months .
Also , BP plans to lower 40 - foot steel boxes over the gusher in order to contain it .
That plan could begin by late this week .
Federal officials have made it clear that they intend to hold BP responsible for costs expected to reach billions of dollars .
Weather continued to hinder efforts to protect the coast Saturday .
Winds were kicking up 8 - to 10 - foot waves , and traditional cleanup techniques such as skimming and using small boats to position booms to corral the fuel were put on hold .
The National Weather Service predicted thunderstorms and higher seas Sunday .
President Obama , in a commencement address at the University of Michigan , said the disaster illustrated the importance of government regulation .
“ Government is what ensures that mines adhere to safety standards and that oil spills are cleaned up by the companies that caused them , ” the president said .
The White House said Obama planned to visit the Gulf Coast on Sunday to observe the cleanup efforts .
Administration officials had conducted response drills for Katrina - style disasters during the last year , including a mock oil spill in March .
The Interior Department sent a crew and established a command center within four hours of the rig explosion .
Commandant Allen said there were few parallels between the response required for Katrina and the oil rig explosion .
“ We have a failure of critical infrastructure at 5,000 feet under the ocean , ” Allen said .
“ That ’s the only comparison to Katrina , when we had failure of critical infrastructure everywhere on land . ”
But for those living in these coastal areas , the feeling of powerlessness in the face of an oil slick that could devastate the fishing industry has echoes of Katrina , and comes at a time when the region was beginning to get back on its feet .
Scars of Katrina remain in fishing towns along coastal Louisiana : empty lots where once - humble homes had stood , unrepaired docks , and the empty metal frames that once were billboards .
But shrimpers who lost their homes and trawling boats are back in business , helped by federal loans and a short - lived side effect of Katrina :
The hurricane pushed tons of shrimp and fish inland , which boosted business .
In New Orleans , a couple hours ’ drive from the prime fishing grounds , worry is palpable .
That city ’s culture and self - image is deeply tied not just to the genius of its chefs but to their access to fresh gulf seafood .
The city had begun feeling it had “ turned a corner , after years and years of hard work , ” said D. Eric Bookhardt , a New Orleans art critic and culture writer .
Now , “ people are just very apprehensive — not because of any immediate threat , but because [ it ] is going to require so much extraordinarily hard work to overcome . ”
Those raw feelings were on display in the Lower 9th Ward at a community meeting Saturday with EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson .
Some residents said they wanted to make certain that the government would “ not let BP off the hook , ” as one put it .
Others were leery of the government .
“ We are veterans of disaster , ” said Ronald Lewis , who runs the House of Dance and Feathers museum .
“ We survived Katrina .
Mentally , we ’ll be prepared . ”
But , he added , “ our fate was in the hands of the government , and the government failed us on all kinds of levels after Katrina . ”
“ I know everyone ’s mad , ” Jackson told the group .
She assured them that BP would be responsible for the bill , adding , “ I ’m still praying they will be able to cut off the source . ”
In the French Quarter , restaurant owners tried to reassure their staff and patrons that , after Katrina , they could survive anything .
Steve Pettus , one of the owners of Bourbon House Seafood , said New Orleans had been on a high with the Saints ’ Super Bowl victory and one of the country ’s lowest unemployment rates .
“ We ’ve been to the bottom and we did n’t like it , and we ’re not going to be there again , ” he said .
Just to be safe , though , Pettus had taken precautions .
He bought a four - week supply of shrimp .

Scientists record world 's tiniest nudge
A bowl of trapped ions have been used to measure the smallest forces ever recorded , report scientists .
The discovery opens the door to solving unanswered questions in materials science areas such as computing and nanotechnology .
Reporting in the pre-publication blog ArXiv , Professor Michael Biercuk of the University of Sydney and colleagues from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado have measured forces as small as 174 yoctonewtons , beating the previous best measure by three orders of magnitude .
Yocto is the smallest prefix recognised by the International System of Units ( SI ) , which was first developed in the 18th century .
Shrinking units
The initial list of prefixes ranged from mega ( one million ) down to milli ( one thousandth ) .
In 1960 , additional prefixes were introduced , such as giga ( billion ) , tera ( trillion ) , nano ( billionth ) and pico ( trillionth ) .
The prefix yocto ( septillionth or 10 to the power of minus 24 ) was added in 1991 .
The new record , may force the listing of a new prefix for an octillionth , or 10 to the power of minus 27 .
The device developed by Biercuk and colleagues consists of a few dozen beryllium ions in a device called a Penning trap .
Any movement caused by an applied force are measured by a laser .
Dr Peter Fisk , general manager of the Physical Metrology Branch at the National Measurement Institute in Sydney , says the trap uses very cold ions held by an electro - magnetic field .
" They need to be cold so motion due to thermal effect ( such as room temperature ) is completely removed leaving them extremely still .
" In this state the ions , being charged , are highly susceptible to the effects of stray magnetic and electric fields responding to very small forces which cause them to vibrate . "
Bowl of marbles
Fisk says it 's a lot like marbles in a bowl .
" They 'll normally sit in the bottom of the bowl until you apply a force causing them to roll back and forth .
" In the same way , the atoms will normally line up in the centre of the trap , getting displaced from the centre by an applied force .
" It 's this motion which is detected by bouncing a laser off the ions and measuring any doppler shift they cause .
The reflected laser light will be a slightly higher frequency as the ion moves towards you compared to when it 's moving away .
" It turns out , this system can measure forces from these stray fields that are only a few dozen yoctonewtons in strength . "
The most sensitive force detectors until now have been resonating spring boards that are limited to attonewtons , or 10 to the power of minus 18 newtons .
Biercuk and colleagues achieved their 174 yoctonewtons measurement using a trap holding about 60 beryllium ions .
The researchers hope to eventually measure a single yoctonewton using an individual beryllium ion .
Click and Grow is an almost foolproof way to grow houseplants .
In fact , it appears to be the perfect product for the plant - loving but absent - minded geek .
The Click and Grow will be a plastic nursery - box which look very much like Apple 's Mac Cube .
Instead of a pot of soil , the Click and Grow grows plants using aeroponics : the plants are grown in air with nutrients and water delivered together in a fine mist .
To grow a plant , you buy a seed - pod , a capsule which contains both seeds and nutrients .
You then hook up the box to your computer via USB ( we told you this was nerdy ) and download the correct program .
The Click and Grow then does the rest , although you will still need to add water from time to time .
Because food and water delivery are taken care of by the box , and the care programs are tailored for each plant - type , its hard for things to go wrong .
Or is it ?
You could still neglect to water the plant , you could put it in a place with too much or too little light and you could put it in a drafty corridor when it should be in a sun-dappled corner .
In fact , pretty much anything you could do to kill a regular plant you could also do to the Click and Grow .
Still , I signed up to be notified when these go on sale :
To my geek - brain , anything , even a pot-plant , is cooler when hooked up to a computer .
Now , if only I could hack it to Tweet me when its thirsty .
Click and Grow will be around $ 23 , with seed - capsules starting at $ 3.50 .

US - Militär WikiLeaks - Sprecher kündigt neues Enthüllungsvideo an
Mit der Veröffentlichung eines US - Militärvideos aus dem Irak hat WikiLeaks weltweit für Schlagzeilen gesorgt - jetzt legen die Macher der Website nach : Im SPIEGEL - ONLINE - Interview kündigt Sprecher Daniel Schmitt eine neue Enthüllung an und erklärt , wie das Netzwerk arbeitet .
Badshah , not bad man
INSIDE his hovel of branches and rags , a grizzled pauper called Badshah Kale keeps a precious object .
It is a note , scrawled by a policeman and framed by Mr Kale , proclaiming that he “ is not a thief ” .
For members of his Pardhi tribe , who are among some 60 m
Indians considered criminal by tradition , this is treasure .
Squatting beside Mr Kale , on a turd - strewn wasteland outside Ashti , a village in India 's western state of Maharashtra , Pardhi men and women describe what it is like to be branded criminal at birth .
A woman says her husband is hauled in every week or two by the police , against whom the Pardhis have ring - fenced their wretched colony with thorny branches .
He has thrice been tried for robbery but was never convicted .
Sporting a bright pink turban , another Pardhi says six of his seven sons have been imprisoned numerous times .
All , predictably enough , claim to be law - abiding — though , giggling , Mr Kale 's wife admits to hawking copper trinkets as gold .
“ Even if we try to live like normal people , ” she says , “ the [ Hindu ] upper - castes will never accept us . ”
This stigma goes back over a century .
Mostly itinerant — some blue - eyed Pardhis look like they might come from the far north - west — India 's “ criminal tribes ” have always lived on society 's edge .
Yet their plight was made worse by a series of 19th - century changes , including rapid deforestation , which stopped them from hunting , and the imposition of a tax on salt , which many had traded .
No doubt this drove many to crime — which encouraged India 's British rulers to a harsh conclusion .
Imbued with a bureaucratic aversion to nomadism and a Victorian relish for the Hindu caste system , they adjudged many Indian tribesmen , Pardhis included , to be preordained crooks .
According to an 1880 report of the Bombay Presidency , an area dominated by the modern states of Maharashtra and Gujarat , members of a Pardhi sub - tribe are “ always ragged and dirty , walking with a sneaking gait ” .
To fix these vagabonds , the Raj introduced the 1871 Criminal Tribes Act , under which members of around 150 tribes were forced to register with the police , forbidden to move around freely and , in many cases , herded into barbed - wire camps .
The law was scrapped soon after India won independence , and the criminal tribes were formally “ de- notified ” in 1952 .
Some have prospered : in Rajasthan , the Meenas dominate a preferential - treatment scheme to allocate government jobs to tribal people , which has let them become part of India 's elite civil services .
Yet the fortunes of many de-notified tribes ( DNTs ) have scarcely improved .
The Pardhis , of whom there are more than 200,000 in Maharashtra , are especially wretched .
They are mostly jobless and landless , and they are often informally barred from villages .
Thousands live destitute in Mumbai , Maharashtra 's capital .
In response , the state government has made two of the three local Pardhi sub - tribes eligible for positive - discrimination measures .
Yet few Pardhis have the documentation or education needed to take advantage of this .
Around 80 % are illiterate , even if more than half of Pardhi children may now be in school .
Among 60 - odd Pardhis squatting outside Ashti , only one has a formal job , as a school janitor .
He credits his success to passing himself off as a dalit , one of Hinduism 's former “ untouchables ” .
To examine the plight of India 's estimated 100 m - odd DNTs and other nomadic people , the central government appointed a commission which reported back in 2008 .
Its recommendations , to which the government has not responded , included taking steps to extend positive - discrimination measures to those tribals — perhaps a fifth of the total — who lack them .
It also urged state governments , which control policing in India , to scrap draconian laws used by the police to lock up repeat offenders .
These are often used against DNT members , enforcing a cycle of poverty and discrimination that keeps many in crime .
Pardhi poachers , for example , are one of the biggest threats to India 's dwindling population of tigers , which they have eradicated from several national parks .
According to Ashti's police chief , S.S. Gaikawad , a quarter of local thefts are carried out by Pardhis .
His deputy reckons half of Pardhi men are criminal .
Mr Gaikawad attributes high rates of criminality to poverty , but believes culture also plays a part : “ The more criminal cases against a Pardhi man , the higher his status , and therefore the better his marriage prospects are . ”
In a country where over a quarter of parliamentarians face criminal charges , this is not as surprising as it might seem .
Yet Rajendra Kale , a Pardhi activist in the nearby town of Ahmednagar , says it is exaggerated .
He reckons no more than 10 % of Pardhi men break the law .
To help his poor community , Mr Kale , who says he was twice wrongly imprisoned for theft as an eight - year - old , demands a reform that the government cannot easily provide : “ Pardhis must be accepted into the village . ”
This is happening , he says , but slowly .
He points to some bloodied figures , a Pardhi man and two women , waiting on the pavement nearby .
The man , Faillu Bhosle , said they had been attacked by high - caste Marathas while they were cultivating common grazing - land .
They had come to town seeking treatment for Mr Bhosle 's father , who lost an eye in the attack , and to report the incident to the police .
The policemen of their own village , who have arrested Mr Bhosle four times , refused to record their complaint .
Several months ago there was a lot of hot blogospheric debating about the so - called output gap -- the gap between what the economy is producing and what it could be producing .
The fact that this gap was significant was enough for the likes of Paul Krugman to argue that there was no reason for the Fed to do anything but pump or the Congress to do anything but stimulate , since with a large output gap ( slack , basically ) there would be no chance of inflation .
We disagree with this and think the output gap is a lousy concept .
Here 's why :
Imagine if we had a gigantic boom in the hula - hoop industry and everyone in the country became skilled in designing , marketing , and manufacturing hula - hoops .
Then hula - hoops go bust .
Sure we have a huge output gap then , but merely stimulating the economy with cheap money wo n't help because all anyone knows how to do is make hula - hoops , an industry that 's of no use anymore .
Well that 's what we did have , except ... instead of hula - hoops we built homes .
And the skills that allowed us to create ( and sell , and finance , and market ) homes en masse , are n't translating into a post - housing economy .
The reason this idea invalidates the output gap is that there 's no real potential for output .
Sure you have idle hands and idle factories , but they can't actually be used to produce anything , and thus stimulus wo n't actually work .
Despite a seemingly big output gap , you might actually have very little slack .
Let 's go back to this Census hiring question .
They 're having trouble finding workers qualified to count our growing Spanish - speaking population .
The housing boom was great for Spanish - speaking immigrants , and it allowed us to paper over any integration problems we might have worried about .
Now it 's an issue .
The bottom line :
The economy is n't just a machine that can one day produce hula - hoops and the next day produce wind turbines , so long as you provide enough cash and cheap money .
We may have a lot of unused capacity .
It does n't mean we know how to do something with it .
NB : Independent of the actual rating , practically every album from 15 and down to 12 is worth its standard price ( of course , if it is not inflated - it 's a different thing that I do n't think $ 18 should be considered " standard price " for any CD ) .
Also note that ratings might be afflicted by the exceptional quality of some of the songs ( a particularly great song on an otherwise dull album might give it a point more , while an unbelievingly filthy piece of ' music ' on an otherwise decent album might seriously damage its rating ) .
This means that the general comments on ratings might sometimes not fit in with my general assessment of a particular record .
But usually , it does work .

Number of albums reviewed in the regular section : 2128
15 : Never To Be Topped
[ 15 albums ]
Go and buy this now .
These are superalbums by the few really great and timeless masters of rock : the cream of the cream of the cream .
These records set the highest standard for all those that follow them and they probably wo n't be superated by anybody , not in the nearest couple thousand years .
And yes , maybe I 'm a fool for giving the highest mark to five Beatles ' albums in a row , but fifteen years of Beatle - listening have n't cured me of the attitude .
14 : Immaculately Ideal
[ 36 albums ]
A major album .
Nearly every one of these records either introduced a universally new type of sound or helped ' define the era ' .
All of them are milestones in the band 's own history , and deservedly so : the level of songwriting is at an all - time high .
If there are one or two slightly less captivating tracks on the album , they are entirely overshadowed by the splendour of the glorious majority .
Not as proverbially ' perfect ' as the 15 - point albums , maybe , but an absolute must for any music lover with even a passing interest in classic rock .
13 : Close To Perfection
[ 148 albums ]
There are a couple weak tracks on here - either a result of the band 's lack of experience in the studio ( The Who Sings My Generation ) , or they might be a little longer than necessary , or anything else .
Another case is that the record might sound slightly monotonous , with brilliant songs which resemble each other too closely and do n't feed your ear properly - not on first listen , at least .
But , apart from these minor problems , all of these records are just as enjoyable as any 14 - point record .
Pay no attention to the five - ten percent of filler and prepare yourself for a rewarding musical journey .
12 : Simply Excellent
[ 388 albums ]
This is ' your average great album ' - that is , a record that cannot be called neither a ' chef - d' oeuvre ' nor a ' routine album ' .
The songs may lack the inescapable thrill of the better records , but they 're nevertheless all melodic and catchy , usually well - produced and guaranteed to give you a good time .
There 's usually little or no filler , but the ' milestone ' factor is not there , if you know what I mean .
Usually it 's just a fairly notorious band / artist at a solid stage in his / her / their career , with a respectable studio / live effort .
Far from being ' lightweight ' , but not an album one can really pray upon .
11 : Just Very Good
[ 519 albums ]
The last group of albums which you can enjoy freely , with little or no effort .
Not a ' classic ' or ' milestone ' by any means , all of them are eminently listenable .
You might see that this group includes the biggest selection of Bob Dylan and Neil Young albums , and it 's understandable : this is the type of ' user - friendly ' , but not ' ground - breaking ' record .
There 's enough catchy tunes which you can sing along or play air guitar to , the boring stuff is rare and the crap level is either low or , again , you just forget about the crap because it 's overshadowed by the good material .
A couple of tracks might even be friggin ' great .
However , all of this never goes far beyond ' cute ' : if spiritual uplift and catharsys is what you 're looking for , go to the higher ratings .
10 : Good , But Flawed
[ 483 albums ]
This is where the filler slowly starts to take over - it was possible not to notice it before , but on here it can't but remind you of its existence .
These albums are still ' good ' rather than ' bad ' , but their listenability , at least , the listenability of a large chunk of their material , starts to fall under question .
This is usually due either to an unreasonable amount of filler ( Yellow Submarine ) , or to a confused state of affairs at the time ( Waiting For The Sun ) , or , well , to a lack of songwriting skills .
Proceed along these records with care , trying not to despise them for all their faults by emphasizing their good sides .
There 's still very much to laud about them , usually .
And , who knows ?
you might even be able to uncover a hidden gem now and then .
9 : Somewhat Mediocre
[ 277 albums ]
This is where you should feel free to stop forking out your money if you 're not a hardcore fan .
It 's the first group of records that find their way onto my CD player maybe once in a couple of months .
The amount of filler is at a very dangerous level , so that the good sections do not always compensate .
This group even includes low points for the 5 - star bands ( the Stones , the Who ) ; what can be said about bands of lesser stature ?
Lengthy uninspired jams , disco perversions , failed experiments with song structure , straightforward dumb lyrics and modern production ' values ' all infest these records , which are often only saved by the bell with some decent songwriting and good performances .
Or it can be vice versa - with none of the evils listed above , but with utterly derivative and routine songwriting .
Still , repeated listenings may help you digest this , and , after all , this is only the beginning of the ' bad ' section .
8 : Almost Below Average
[ 132 albums ]
This is the ' really close to bad ' album .
The songs are for the most part totally insipid , sometimes even atrocious .
Only a real diehard could enjoy such a record in its entirety .
However , even fans often have to admit that these records do not make them proud of their idols .
What usually saves them from being a total disaster is a ) a decent level of performance , musicianship and production and b ) a couple of gems that seem to have gotten on here almost by accident .
But there they are , and help to save the record from facing the depths of humiliation .
7 : Plain Bad
[ 56 albums ]
The only thing that redeems this kind of records is one or two really catchy numbers that manage to get it to your head so that if you 're in a good mood you can even associate the whole album with these ditties .
For the most part , these albums are ' failed experiments ' , with a band trying out an idea or a style that is n't too familiar to them and relinquishing it soon afterwards ( A , Stonedhenge ) .
Or it 's a band in its final stage of falling apart ( The Visitors ) .
Or something like that .
Buyer beware .
6 -5 : Truly Offensive
[ 53 albums ]
This ain't bad , it 's ' urrible , plain and simple .
Usually more ' failed experiments ' , but with even worse results : electronic monsters ( Under Wraps , Press To Play ) , gospel hogwash ( Saved ) , lame country - western ( Mardi Gras ) and heavy metal ( Rock Island ) imitations .
Or , as usual , a band just coming in ( Waterloo , Mr Wonderful ) or going out ( Positive Vibrations , Roots To Branches ) .
Anyway , only a scholar or a systematic completist needs any of these records .
I 'm surprised they 're still around and available on CD .
Any artist should be ashamed of this tripe .
4 - 3 : Atrocious Beyond All Imagination
[ 9 albums ]
It 's hard to imagine anything worse than the previous group of records , but I 've reserved this section for the ' etalonic monstruous records ' .
If you can afford a little joke now and then , buy these ( there 's but eight currently ) just to find out what a truly hideous record really is ( of course , there 's a lot of lesser bands with even worse records , but I 'm speaking here of hideous records made by notorious bands / artists , which makes it all the more exciting ) .
I wo n't diss these records here ; you might find out the true reasons of their disgrace in the actual review pages , just by clicking on the album title .
See ya .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Arizona lawmakers passed a controversial immigration bill on Monday requiring police in the state that borders Mexico to determine if people are in the United States illegally , a measure critics say is open to racial profiling .
Lawmakers in the Arizona Senate voted 17 to 11 to approve the bill , widely regarded as the toughest measure yet taken by any U.S. state to curb illegal immigration .
The state ’s House of Representatives approved the measure last week .
Governor Jan Brewer , a Republican , has five days to veto the bill or sign it into law .
Immigration is a bitterly fought issue in the United States , where some 10.8 million illegal immigrants live and work in the shadows , although it has been eclipsed in recent months by a healthcare overhaul and concern over the economy .
The law requires state and local police to determine the status of people if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are illegal immigrants and to arrest people who are unable to provide documentation proving they are in the country legally .
It also makes it a crime to transport someone who is an illegal immigrant and to hire day laborers off the street .
“ I believe handcuffs are a wonderful tool when they ’re on the right people , ” said Russell Pearce , the Republican state senator who wrote the bill .
We want to “ get them off law enforcement and get them on the bad guys , ” he told Reuters .
Opponents of the Arizona law , some of whom held a vigil outside Brewer ’s home on Monday to urge her to veto the measure , say it is unconstitutional and would discriminate against Latinos .
“ You can not tell if a person walking on a sidewalk is undocumented or not ... ( so ) this is a mandate for racial profiling , ” said Pablo Alvarado , director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network .
Alvarado said his group would call on the federal government to intervene and was considering legal action to overturn the bill .
Now the way I see this nobody has to " invite " , the key word being invite Mr. Perkins anywhere and to make this seem even more like he is a spoiled brat Bill Donohue at the Catholic League has chimed in wanting an official investigation .
His Catholic counterpart , Bill Donohue at the Catholic League , called for an official investigation of the episode because of the " damage " done to Perkins and the threat to religious freedom .
" There are legitimate reasons to accept and reject the current policy regarding gays in the military .
No one , therefore , should be censored from speaking at any private or public forum -- much less a military installation -- because of his or her views on this subject . "
On Jan. 29th , 2010 the Chaplains at Andrews Air Force base sent a letter and were concerned by Perkin 's saying his speech was " non political " .
According to Perkins the letter said his FRC statements are incompatible to the members of the military as they serve the Commander - in Chief .
The letter was sent to Perkins two days after Obama delivered the State of the Union address in which he pushed Congress to repeal " Do n't ask , Do n't tell . "
The president 's address prompted Perkins to open an ongoing campaign to retain the law despite the desire of military leaders and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to end it .
This is short but wanted to get the word out to you .
It 's late March , and that means that it 's hwangsa time here in Korea .
Hwangsa ( 황사 , 黃沙 ) is the yellow dust that blows in from China around this time of year , turning the city into something reminiscent of a post - apocalyptic or dystopian science fiction movie .
The dust also brings pollutants in and a lot of people wear masks when they have to go outside .
The pollutants it carries are :
Sulfur ( an acid rain component ) , soot , ash , carbon monoxide , and other toxic pollutants including heavy metals ( such as mercury , cadmium , chromium , arsenic , lead , zinc , copper ) and other carcinogens , often accompany the dust storms , as well as viruses , bacteria , fungi , pesticides , antibiotics , asbestos , herbicides , plastic ingredients , combustion products as well as hormone mimicking phthalates .
Luckily it only happens about a day at a time .
One day of hwangsa , two or three clear days , then some more hwangsa , and so on until hwangsa season is over .
The overall impression you get when outside is this : it 's like the whole city has been covered by a big dusty glass bowl , one that extends across the whole sky and in all directions .
This glass bowl has then been turned on to emit a low orange light , and because of this it feels almost as if the light is coming even from the ground itself .
So in a sense it actually feels like the earth has been lit up rather than the sky has been darkened .
Today I took advantage of the weather though to take a few pictures , and thanks to Daum 's Road View ( like Google Street View ) we can compare them with a normal sunny day .
Clicking on the link will take you to the location and you can walk around yourself a bit as even though the controls are in Korean it 's basically the same thing : click on the arrows to go in the direction you want to go .
Clicking on the images here will also bring up a much larger version .
First the street near my apartment .
And on a normal day Down the street a bit more , looking towards the main road .
Now next to the school close to the temple .
or you can explore it for yourself here
The next picture is from the temple .
This parking lot otherwise looks like this Two more pictures from the parking lot :
And again on a normal day .
Now we 've left the temple and are back on the streets .
Today the sky was this colour .
On another day it would look like this Then on to another street :
The same street from a slightly different location .
By the way , the trees look that way because of the terrible pruning job done on them around November .
After summer ends and the weather gets cold , the trees get " pruned " , which means that teams of guys in a truck go around and completely remove all the new growth from the year before .
Because of this pruning job done every year the trees actually look worse just before they are hacked at , because the leaves have fallen off and there is a pretty striking contrast between the relatively thick parts of the trees that never get cut off , and the super thin growth from that season alone , making them look like distorted hands where the palm is twice the size it should be while the fingers jutting out are far too thin and too great in number .
The same location on a normal day And finally , one more picture from the same road .
Here it is on a normal day , but take a close look at the trees there .
This part of the Road View map was clearly taken in early winter because you can see the unnatural - looking trees there .
First too thick , then suddenly way too thin and stringy .
Yeah , so that 's Seoul at its worst .
Having uploaded these pictures , I should now balance that with a few positive recent developments : the city buses have almost entirely converted to natural gas , in 2005 the city restored a stream that had been paved over in the 1970s , a new forest ( Seoul Forest ) was created within the city in 2005 , and the air quality is continuing to improve year after year .
When considering a move to a city like Seoul location is most important , since living next to this park for example ( there are a lot of quaint apartments all around it ) means living in an area with some fairly good air most of the time .
Now if only we could do something about the horrible pruning job done to the trees every winter .
Also , if you have enough of three types of plants in your house ( Areca palm , mother - in - law's tongue , and money plant ) then the air inside will be near perfect anyway so proper planning can make living in almost any city possible , as long as there is enough sunlight for them to grow properly .

GRAND CANYON , Ariz .
—The American Southwest has again become ground zero in the debate about nuclear power .
Since December , miners have resumed crawling deep into the earth on the edge of the Grand Canyon to mine high - grade uranium ore at the Arizona 1 Mine , which had been closed since the late 1980s .
Owned by the Canadian Denison Mines Corp. , it is the first uranium mine to open in northern Arizona since nuclear power again became a popular idea in Washington within the last decade .
The greater Grand Canyon area faces a possible explosion in the number of new uranium mines .
The price of uranium has rebounded in recent years due to a surge in reactor construction throughout the world and thanks to political support from the White House , starting with George W. Bush and reinforced by Barack Obama .
The price has varied from $ 10 to $ 138 per pound since 2001 , and is currently valued at $ 41.25 per pound .
More than 8,000 uranium mine claims have been filed in northern Arizona , an increase from 110 in 2003 — a rate seen across the West .
The area ’s sedimentary rock layer called breccia pipes , which exists up to 1,800 feet below the surface , is the most concentrated source of uranium known in the United States .
According to the Arizona Daily Sun , Denison plans on operating four days per week , extracting 335 tons of uranium ore per day .
The hazardous ore will be hauled by truck more than 300 miles through towns and rural communities to the company ’s White Mesa mill located near Blanding , Utah , where it will be processed into “ yellowcake ” ( refined uranium ore to make uranium oxide ) and then sold .
A coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit last November to stop the opening of the mine , alleging that the legally required documents were outdated and did not offer protections required by contemporary environmental laws .
While the lawsuit is pending , the Bureau of Land Management and Arizona Department of Environmental Quality say the mine is properly authorized .
In response to growing concern about the pending mining boom in northern Arizona , U.S. Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar called for a “ two - year time - out ” last summer to allow federal agencies to complete a two - year environmental review before authorizing new mining claims within the one million acres on federal lands near the Grand Canyon .
Existing claims , such as Denison ’s mine , were exempt from the temporary moratorium .
Environmentalists and local Indigenous communities hope that after the review in February 2011 , Salazar will make the area unavailable for new mining claims for the a maximum 20 - year period allowed by the Interior Department .
Meanwhile , the U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Grand Canyon Watersheds Protection Act ( H.R. 644 ) , legislation that would permanently protect the one million acres on federal land from new mining claims — creating a five - mile buffer zone of around Grand Canyon National Park .
However , Arizona ’s Department of Mines and Mineral Resources Director Madan M. Singh is just one of many who oppose the ban .
Testifying to a U.S.
House subcommittee hearing in July 2009 , he said that mining in the Grand Canyon region is necessary for worldwide power needs .
Citing U.S. Geological Survey estimates , Singh said that the ban would keep approximately 375 million pounds of yellowcake in the ground , which “ at the present rate of generation , could replace all the power generated by coal plants in the United States for a decade .
Another way to look at this : it is the equivalent of 13.3 billion barrels of oil .
That is the total amount of recoverable oil in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield [ in Alaska ] , the largest in the U.S .
At a price of $ 50 per pound , this resource is worth $ 18.75 billion . ”
Under the anachronistic General Mining
Act of 1872 , created when pickaxes and shovels were used , mining companies can freely file claims on federal public lands .
The law permits mining regardless of cultural impacts on Indigenous tribes .
Additionally , no royalties have to be paid to the taxpayers in exchange for extracting riches from public lands .
A SACRED CANYON
The Grand Canyon is the ancestral homeland to the Havasupai Nation .
The Nation has battled uranium interests for decades and banned mining on their lands as early as 1991 .
However , their lands are surrounded largely by federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management , the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service — agencies that all have the power to authorize new mines .
The Colorado River is held sacred by more than 30 Indigenous nations .
It emerges in the Rocky Mountains in north - central Colorado and winding 1,450 miles to the Gulf of California , the Colorado River and provides drinking water for up to 27 million people in seven states throughout the Southwest .
Drilling for the radioactive material in previous decades has been found to contaminate underground aquifers that drain into the Colorado River and sacred springs that have sustained Indigenous peoples in the region .
Surface water can also flow into drill holes and mine shafts , poisoning underground water sources .
The 600 members of the Havasupai Tribe , who live at the bottom of the Grand Canyon , are concerned that future mining nearby could contaminate water sources and further desecrate sacred sites , including Red Butte , which is located three miles away from the closed Canyon Uranium Mine .
Denison indicates that it is also interested in reopening the mine .
Some 300 people joined a rally at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon last August to support protecting the butte , known as Wii’i Gdwiisa , or “ clenched fist mountain . ”
“ As the ‘ guardians of the Grand Canyon , ’ we strenuously object to mining for uranium here , ” said Matthew Putesoy , vice chairman of the Havasupai Nation , to reporter Brenda Norrell .
“ It is a threat to the health of our environment and tribe , our tourism - based economy and our religion . ”
“ We ’re fighting to save our sacred Red Butte and our only source of water , now that Denison Mines has begun uranium mining on the North Rim , ” said Carletta Tilousi , a Havasupai Tribal Council member , in Indian Country Today March 26 .
THE URANIUM LEGACY
Communities living in the arid southwest plateaus are still suffering from the consequences of the 20th - century uranium boom from the 1940s to late 1980s which fueled the nuclear weapons program and the first wave of nuclear power plants .
The tragic legacy is the contamination and illness that remains .
Today , there are more than 2,000 abandoned uranium mines in the Southwest , and the U.S. government and private companies have done little or nothing to clean up contaminated sites and abandoned mines .
Throughout the Diné ( Navajo ) Nation east of the Grand Canyon , families have been subject to decades of health effects due to past unsafe mining conditions and living near to mines and mills , in some cases even living in houses built from uranium tailings .
Nearly four million tons of uranium ore were extracted from some 500 mines on Diné lands .
At Rare Metals mine near Tuba City on the Diné Nation , a layer of soil and rock is the only material covering some 2.3 million tons of hazardous waste .
A rock dam surrounds the radioactive waste to control runoff water that flows into nearby Moenkopi Wash .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has found well water to be undrinkable in at least 22 Diné communities .
According to the EPA , “ Approximately 30 percent of the Navajo population does not have access to a public drinking water system and may be using unregulated water sources with uranium contamination . ”
Uranium exposure is a known cause of cancers , organ damage , miscarriages and birth defects .
Flocks of sheep and other livestock still graze among radioactive tailing piles and ingest radioactive water .
According to the Diné Nation , every year up to 2.5 million gallons of uranium - contaminated water leaches out of the Shiprock Uranium Mill near Shiprock , N.M. , into the San Juan River , a tributary to the Colorado River .
In July 1979 near the small Diné town of Church Rock , N.M. , a dirt dam breached at the nearby uranium mine and processing site , releasing more than 1,100 tons of radioactive waste and nearly 100 million gallons of contaminated fluid into the Rio Puerco ( which ultimately flows into the Colorado River ) — marking the largest nuclear accident in U.S. history .
More than 875,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste continue to contaminate the land .
In 2005 , the Diné Nation government banned uranium mining and processing within its 27,000 - square miles of land .
That ’s why thousands of Diné residents near Church Rock were outraged in early March when the Federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals voted to uphold a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license to allow Hydro Resources , Inc. , to engage in uranium mining operations in the area , dangerously close to the aquifer that provides water for 15,000 Diné residents .
“ Because the majority ’s decision in this case will unnecessarily and unjustifiably compromise the health and safety of the people who currently live within and immediately downwind . …
I must respectfully dissent , ” wrote Judge Carlos F. Lucero in the minority opinion .
“ The Navajo [ Diné ] communities … are demanding that they [ the mining companies ] stay off of Navajo lands , ” wrote the New Mexico Environmental Law Center in a March 9 press release .
“ This court setback is even more devastating now that the nuclear industry ramps up its lobbying campaign to gain access to stimulus funds for construction of new nuclear plants . …
It ’s critical to look at the entire nuclear fuel chain . ”
A PLACE FOR WASTE
Today , the United States has more than 75,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear waste stored in concrete dams at nuclear power plants throughout the country .
The waste increases at a rate of 2,000 tons per year .
In 1987 , Congress initiated a controversial project to transport and ultimately store 135,000 metric tons of waste at Yucca Mountain , located about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas , Nevada .
The project would have involved shipping the radioactive waste via rails and highways starting in 2020 .
In February 2009 , Obama met his campaign promise to cut funding for the multi-billion dollar Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository project and asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to withdraw the license application .
Yucca Mountain is considered holy by the Paiute and Western Shoshone Nations .
Western Shoshone lands , were never ceded to the U.S. government and have long been under attack by the military and nuclear industry .
Between 1951 and 1992 , more than 1,000 nuclear bombs were detonated above and below the surface at an area called the Nevada Test Site on Western Shoshone lands , making it one of the most bombed nations on earth .
Communities around the test site faced exposure to radioactive fallout which has caused cancers , leukemia and other illnesses .
The late Western Shoshone spiritual practitioner Corbin Harney helped initiate a grassroots effort to shut down the test site and abolish nuclear weapons .
In February , a new proposal for Yucca Mountain threatens to further desecrate the sacred mountain on Western Shoshone lands .
Several Republican candidates for governor in Nevada have expressed support for using the area as an experimental “ reprocessing ” site , where radioactive waste would be reprocessed to extract additional fuel .
GRASSROOTS DIRECT ACTION
The Southwest also has a legacy of resistance to the onslaught of mining interests .
In March 1988 , more than 8,000 people converged for massive 10 - day direct action to “ reclaim ” the Nevada Test Site , and nearly 3,000 people were arrested .
Groups such as the Nevada Desert Experience and Shundahai Network continue their work to shut down the test site and resist the corporate and military nuclear industry .
Throughout the 1980s , a fierce movement of grassroots organizing and direct action against uranium mining near the Grand Canyon had taken shape , galvanized by the Havasupai , Hopi , Diné , Hualapai tribes and a Flagstaff group , Canyon Under Siege .
Prayerful and strategic meetings were held once a year throughout the 1980s .
In 1989 , five individuals were charged for eco-actions including cutting powerlines to the Canyon Uranium Mine .
Partly due to the resistance , but mainly because of a sharp drop in the price of uranium , companies like Dennison were forced to shut their mines down .
For seven years , Indigenous people from throughout the world have gathered to organize against the nuclear industry at the Southwest Indigenous Uranium Forum on the Acoma Nation near Mt. Taylor .
Mt. Taylor is located on U.S. Forrest Service - managed lands between Albuquerque and Gallup , N.M. , and has also faced the threat of uranium mining .
The mountain sits on one of the richest reservoirs of uranium ore in the country .
It is considered holy by the Diné , Acoma , Laguna , Zuni and Hopi Nations .
In June 2009 , Indigenous nations and environmental groups unified to protect the mountain and through their efforts Mt. Taylor was given temporary protection as a Traditional Cultural Property .
At the 2006 Indigenous World Uranium Summit on the Diné Nation , community organizations such as Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining joined participants from Australia , India , Africa , Pacific Islands and North America in issuing a declaration demanding “ a worldwide ban on uranium mining , processing , enrichment , fuel use and weapons testing and deployment and nuclear waste dumping on native lands . ”
OBAMA FUELS NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE
In January , the Obama administration FY2011 budget included a $ 54 billion dollar taxpayer loan guarantee for new nuclear reactor construction , three times what President George W. Bush promised in 2005 .
“ On an issue that affects our economy , our security and the future of the planet , we ca n’t keep on being mired in the same old stale debates between the left and the right , between environmentalists and entrepreneurs , ”
Obama said about nuclear power in the State of the Union .
He did not mention the impacts of mining and processing .
Currently , there are 104 nuclear reactors in operation in the United States that meet approximately 20 percent of the total U.S. electricity demand .
In 2009 , there were 17 uranium mines in operation producing more than 3.8 million tons of uranium oxide annually , according to U.S. Department of Energy statistics .
Of the 50 former and present uranium milling sites across a dozen states , 24 have been abandoned and are now the responsibility of the Energy Department .
President Obama announced Feb. 16 that the Energy Department had approved $ 8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees for Southern Company and its partners to construct twin reactors in Georgia .
Authorized by the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 , the loan guarantee programs are structured so that if the reactors are built and operate profitably , the borrowers pay the government a fee and repay the banks for the loan .
However , if the borrowers default on the loan — which critics say is incredibly risky for the taxpayers — the federal government will repay the bank .
Since 2007 , 17 companies or groups of companies have sought licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for 26 more reactors with plans to complete four by 2018 and up to eight by 2020 .
New reactors are estimated to cost more than $ 12 billion each .
The last nuclear power plant in the U.S. was built in 1977 .
“ The demand for the fuel will expand in the future , especially with the emphasis on control of greenhouse gases , ” Arizona Mines Department Director Singh said .
“ There are 436 reactors in operation in the world ; another 433 are in development or on the drawing boards .
It is evident that the demand for uranium will be strong in the coming years . ”
Obama said , “ Nuclear energy remains our largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions . ”
“ Obama ’s support for nuclear energy is misguided and destructive federal policy , ” said Stacy Hamburg of the Grand Canyon chapter of the Sierra Club .
“ The nuclear energy cycle is destructive from start to end … and is not the solution to climate change . ”
According to The Washington Post March 22 , a recent Gallup poll found that 62 percent of adults surveyed said they favored nuclear energy as one way to meet national electricity needs — the highest level of support reported by Gallup .
Although nuclear energy is being touted as a solution to the current U.S. energy crisis and global warming , those more closely affected by uranium mining , transportation , processing and dumping of waste recognize the true environmental costs .
“ There are six licensed commercial nuclear reactors in New York , ” Hamburg said .
“ It is critical for people in New York City , as well as nation - and world - wide , to understand how mining uranium , possibly destined for one of these six reactors , devastates indigenous communities throughout the Southwest . ”

Bernard Kerik said he hopes he 'll be remembered for ' my 30 years of public service ' instead of ' imperfections or the mistakes that I may have made . '
On eve of prison , Kerik reflects
On the eve of heading to a Maryland federal prison for a four - year sentence , disgraced former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said he hopes that he 'll be remembered for " my 30 years of public service " instead of " imperfections or the mistakes that I may have made . "
Kerik , who George W. Bush had tapped to head the Department of Homeland Security before scandal scuttled his appointment , also rapped the prosecutors in his case , and the judge who gave him a sentence that well exceeded the federal guidelines on his guilty plea to eight felony counts including charges of lying to the White House .

Kerik began his association with Rudy Giuliani as his driver during the 1993 campaign , was ultimately appointed by the mayor first as Correction Department commissioner and then head of the nation ’s largest police force in 2000 .
Catapulted by the fame he gained in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center , Kerik was tapped by then - President Bush as the interim interior minister in Iraq for a few months in 2003 , and then again as his nominee to head Homeland Security – only to have it fall apart within days as Kerik withdrew his name amid claims of unpaid nanny taxes .
Those stories gave way to others about Kerik 's time as Corrections and Police Commissioner , including allegations of using an apartment near Ground Zero meant for emergency workers to carry on an affair and having unpaid work done on his home by mob - linked firms , and he finally pled guilty in 2009 to several charges related to that second scandal .
The drip of scandals involving Kerik , 54 , became an issue for Giuliani during his 2008 bid for the Republican presidential nomination .
Kerik said he took the second federal plea deal prosecutors had offered because he was " financially helpless " and facing a year in prison waiting for court - appointed lawyers .
He said the 33 - month sentence prescribed by federal guidelines was " severe .... especially considering my otherwise unblemished record of service to this country . "
Judge Stephen Robinson instead gave him four years , saying , " The fact that Mr. Kerik would use that event [ 9/11 ] for personal gain and aggrandizement is a dark place in the soul for me , " and vowing tough penalties if the former top cop left his property in Franklin Lakes , NJ , while he was under house arrest awaiting his prison intake date .
" Words can not express my disappointment in the prosecutors , the judge and his sentence that followed , " Kerik said in his statement .
" I have repeatedly expressed remorse for what I may have done , however , unlike many , I ca n’t remain silent in the face of what I believe has been a gross injustice , which I pray will be remedied by an appellate court . "
The statement made no mention of Giuliani .
At home with an electronic ankle bracelet for the past five months since his guilty plea , Kerik said he'd been preparing his ten - and seven - year - old daughters for him leaving .
He said he " had to teach them that there are times when we are put in situations which are beyond our control and that no matter how undeserved , unsought , or unwanted , we must find the strength , courage , and perseverance to carry on and move forward , " and added he had watched the original " Rocky " movie to help himself find those virtues .
" In my life , I have been confronted with extraordinary challenges , from the age of three when I was abandoned by my own mother who was later murdered , to gun battles on the streets of New York City , through the aftermath of 9/11 , to my work rebuilding a shattered Iraq , these are the principles by which I have lived , " he said .
Sounding defiant , Kerik said , " I became a convenient target of personal and political attacks , most of which were waged by people that have never met me and know nothing about me other than the media headlines that they have read .
As I have listened to my critics , I have often wondered , how they would have fared under the same circumstances and the same scrutiny . "
He ended , saying he hoped to be with his family again " sooner rather than later . "
Kerik will be heading for the Federal Correcitonal Institution in Cumberland , which has both a medium - security facility for men and an adjacent minimum - security site , which is said to be the pen Kerik will be placed in .

When exactly did oxygen first appear in Earth ’s atmosphere ?
Although many physical and chemical processes are thought to be responsible for that profound transformation , scientists have tried to answer at least part of that question by looking for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis — the process that organisms use to split water to make oxygen — in rocks that are billions of years old .
One way they try to pinpoint the start of that process is by searching for biological links between the distant past and the present .
Specifically , they study molecules known as biomarkers that are produced by modern organisms and can be traced to the origins of certain biological processes because they are found in rocks that are 2.5 billion years old .
One biomarker that had been proposed for such research is a type of lipid , or fat molecule , known as 2 - methylhopanoid .
This substance was thought to be a good biomarker because it has been found in ancient rocks ( where it is referred to as 2 - methylhopane ) and is also produced in the modern environment by cyanobacteria , which are oxygen - producing bacteria located in shallow marine environments .
But it turns out that these molecules might not be the best biomarkers for oxygenic photosynthesis , according to a recent collaboration between MIT ’s Department of Biology and Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences ( EAPS ) .
In a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the group reported it had discovered the gene and related protein that are responsible for producing 2 - methylhopanoids .
Because this DNA can be traced to bacteria that do not produce oxygen , 2 - methylhopanoids cannot confidently be used as biomarkers for oxygenic photosynthesis , the researchers say .
The research , which was supported by NASA , the National Science Foundation and the Agouron Institute , counters previous work of co-author Roger Summons , an EAPS professor of geobiology , who first proposed in 1999 that 2 - methylhopanoids could be a biomarker for cyanobacteria .
That work was called into question in 2007 when researchers in the lab of co-author Dianne K. Newman , the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Biology and Geobiology , in collaboration with Alex Sessions at the California Institute of Technology , discovered a type of bacterium that does n’t produce oxygen but does produce 2 - methylhopanoids .
To determine whether this was a chance finding or whether different kinds of bacteria produce 2 - methylhopanoids , Summons , Newman , Sessions and several postdoctoral researchers joined forces to figure out which genes and proteins are involved in making the lipids .
Knowing this gene , the researchers could then search the genome databases for other bacteria that also produce these molecules .
They could also learn more about the purpose of the molecules , such as whether they emerged in response to some sort of environmental stress billions of years ago .
“ This is an excellent example of how genes themselves can also be used as fossils , ” said lead author Paula Welander , a postdoc from Newman ’s lab , who explained that previous surveys of bacteria that produce 2 - methylhopanoids were limited because they were done in the laboratory under arbitrary growth conditions which did not necessarily elicit their production .
Moreover , because there are lots of bacteria that biologists can’t yet grow in the lab due to technical limitations , this means they might not be aware of some that can produce 2 - methylhopanoids .
By taking a molecular genetics approach to analyzing lipid production , the group was able to circumvent these limitations .
Ann Pearson , a biogeochemist at Harvard who was not involved in the research , said that although scientists still have a long way to go before understanding the earliest origins of these biomarker molecules , the discovery of this DNA is “ crucial ” because now scientists know where to look as they start to “ fill in the holes ” about the earliest history of oxygenic photosynthesis .
What makes 2 - methylhopanoids unusual from other lipids that are produced by bacteria is that they have an extra methyl group ( one carbon and three hydrogen atoms ) .
To determine which gene and protein are responsible for adding the methyl group , the MIT researchers analyzed the genome of the bacterium that Newman ’s lab had previously discovered also produces 2 - methylhopanoids .
Once they found a gene cluster that is responsible for making lipids , they generated mutants with deletions in genes encoding proteins likely to be responsible for adding the methyl group .
After pinpointing the gene that encodes this protein , they searched the genome databases to determine what other types of bacteria contain this specific gene .
It turns out there are three major groups containing many bacteria , including cyanobacteria , but the researchers were not able to trace the complex history of the protein to determine which bacteria carried the oldest version .
In addition to determining this history , the researchers are trying to decipher the function of 2 - methylhopanoids , which could reveal something about what microbial life and its environment were like on Earth billions of years ago .
They are currently conducting microbiology and molecular biology experiments to examine the features of membranes that contain the molecules , and they are also researching the environments where these molecules are found today .

With April 15 almost upon us , this would be a good time to remind ourselves of how the income tax contributed to the destruction of American liberty .
We should first keep in mind that with the exception of the Civil War , the American people lived without an income tax from the beginning of the United States until 1913 , when the 16th Amendment was adopted .
This was not an accident .
Americans living during that period of time understood that freedom and an income tax were contradictory notions .
If people wanted to live in a free society , it would have to be a society in which government was prohibited from levying taxes on income .
Conversely , if people wanted to live in a society in which government is taxing income , then the price they pay is the loss of freedom .
In an income - tax free society , everyone is free to keep the fruits of his earnings .
He keeps everything he earns .
He is free to accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth .
He is free to do whatever he wants with his own money .
And there is nothing the government can do about it because the government is prohibited from taking any portion of a person ’s income from him .
There is no IRS .
There are no income - tax returns .
There are no deductions to keep track of .
There is no need to keep records .
There is no withholding tax .
Again , everyone simply keeps everything he earns and decides for himself how to spend it , invest it , donate it , or otherwise dispose of it .
This is what Americans once believed was an absolute prerequisite to a free society .
That ’s why Americans lived without an income tax for more than 100 years .
Everything changed in 1913 , when socialist ideas were being imported from Europe into the United States .
That was the watershed year , the year that brought into existence what would become the twin jugular veins for the welfare state and warfare state — the income tax and the Federal Reserve System .
From that date forward and continuing through today , Americans would be coerced , on pain of fine and imprisonment , into sending some governmentally imposed percentage of their income to the IRS .
The magnitude of that change cannot be overstated , for it actually inverted the historical relationship between the American people and the federal government .
Prior to the enactment of the income tax , the relationship between the citizen and the government was one of master and servant .
The citizen , who was free to accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth , was sovereign because there was nothing the government could do to interfere with that process .
The government was the servant .
The nature of that relationship fundamentally changed in 1913 .
With the enactment of the income tax , the citizen became the servant and the federal government becoming his master .
How was this so ?
The income tax effectively nationalized people ’s income , in that it placed everyone ’s income at the disposal of the government .
While before , government lacked the power to take any portion of people ’s income , now it wielded the power to take any or all of their income .
It all depended on the specific percentage that the government required people to send to the IRS .
Sometimes the government is nice and sets a lower percentage .
Sometimes it ’s not so nice and sets a higher percentage .
But what matters with respect to freedom is not the particular percentage that is set but rather the fact that the government has the power to set the percentage .
By having that power , the amount of income that the government permits people to keep effectively becomes akin to an allowance that a parent permits his children to have .
As April 15 rolls around once again , let us remind ourselves what Jefferson stated in the Declaration of Independence : that everyone has been endowed with certain unalienable rights , including the right to life , liberty , and property .
For more than 100 years , Americans understood that such natural , God - given rights encompassed the right to accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth and the right to decide what to do with that wealth .
Too bad 20th - century Americans consigned themselves and their successors to a life of subservience and servitude by abandoning the income - tax - free heritage of their ancestors and making the income tax a permanent feature of American life .

“ Obama ’s Katrina ” : that was the line from some pundits and news sources , as they tried to blame the current administration for the gulf oil spill .
It was nonsense , of course .
An Associated Press review of the Obama administration ’s actions and statements as the disaster unfolded found “ little resemblance ” to the shambolic response to Katrina — and there has been nothing like those awful days when everyone in the world except the Bush inner circle seemed aware of the human catastrophe in New Orleans .
Yet there is a common thread running through Katrina and the gulf spill — namely , the collapse in government competence and effectiveness that took place during the Bush years .
The full story of the Deepwater Horizon blowout is still emerging .
But it ’s already obvious both that BP failed to take adequate precautions , and that federal regulators made no effort to ensure that such precautions were taken .
For years , the Minerals Management Service , the arm of the Interior Department that oversees drilling in the gulf , minimized the environmental risks of drilling .
It failed to require a backup shutdown system that is standard in much of the rest of the world , even though its own staff declared such a system necessary .
It exempted many offshore drillers from the requirement that they file plans to deal with major oil spills .
And it specifically allowed BP to drill Deepwater Horizon without a detailed environmental analysis .
Ever since Oracle 's acquisition of Sun , MySQL users have been nervous about Oracle 's commitment to the open source database , given Oracle 's own database product line .
At the O'Reilly MySQL Conference that began today in Santa Clara , Calif. , Edward Screven , Oracle 's chief corporate architect took to the stage to win over the hearts and minds of the users with a simple message : MySQL matters to Oracle .
" MySQL has some properties that Oracle does not , " Screven said in an interview with InfoWorld before the keynote speech .
" It 's small , it 's easy to install .
It 's easy for developers to get going with it . "
[ Also on InfoWorld : Peter Wayner assesses MySQL 's post -Sun future .
| Among dramas unfolding around the Oracle takeover of Sun is the fate of JavaFX technology .
|
Relive the rise and fall of Sun Microsystems in our slideshow . ]
The MySQL open source database lets Oracle target a segment of the market it 's not reaching with Oracle Database .
" It 's important for us as a business for MySQL to be successful .
For that to happen , we have to keep investing in it , " Screven said .
Screven said Oracle is already bringing some big performance improvements by integrating the MySQL and InnoDB teams -- increases of up to 35 percent for MySQL databases operating with several hundred concurrent connections .
The forthcoming new version of MySQL gets its speed improvements from using even finer - grain locking of rows and avoiding some of the contention for tables .
MySQL is in charge of parsing the SQL queries and interacting with outside clients , but it delegates responsibility for storing the data to several different engines with different properties .
The InnoDB engine offers transactional processing , a requirement for ensuring data consistency in case of hardware failure .
( Oracle purchased the Finnish company Innobase in 2005 , a move that led many to predict that the company would eventually move to purchase MySQL . )
" Part of the problem that used to exist between InnoDB and MySQL was that we did n't have coordinated review cycles .
It was very hard to have improvements roll into the final product , " Screven said .
Screven noted that the performance boost , as well as several other planned enhancements , will be included in both the community and commercial editions .
However , some features , such as hot backup , will be found only in the commercial editions .
( Hot backup had been a separate product but will now be rolled in to the enterprise edition of MySQL . )
Under Oracle 's ownership , " I do n't see foresee any substantial changes from how MySQL AB or Sun made the distinction [ between what was in the community and commercial editions ] , " Screven told InfoWorld .
" I expect that core features will end up in community edition .
There will be some value - add , like monitoring or backup , that make sense in the enterprise edition . "
While Screven said that Oracle definitely wants to run MySQL as a business to make money , he emphasized that he and others at the company liked the way the open source community edition made it easy for people to start up projects .
" It would be a mistake for us to starve the community edition because that would impinge upon the ubiquity of MySQL , " he said .
The larger MySQL community now includes several forks of the MySQL core tool like MariaDB and Drizzle produced by ex-MySQL employees .
Both are experimenting with different data storage engines and other enhancements .
Screven wished them the best of luck , but suggested that the new Oracle - backed MySQL will continue to focus on taking care of commercial customers .
" I think it will be hard for those guys to create a forked product with the kind of commercial support that our customers need for production applications , " Screven said .
" We 're really focused on ensuring that MySQL becomes a better product and appeals to our customers .
What we 're fundamentally selling here is support . "

El ex candidato presidencial plante� la necesidad de reorganizar un movimiento fuerte de centro izquierda , para integrar el cambio que requiere el pa�s rumbo a las elecciones presidenciales

Only 2 percent of the public says it participates actively in the Tea Party movement , according to a poll released Wednesday .
An ABC News / Washington
Post survey also showed that support for the movement was statistically split , with 27 - 24 favoring it and 44 percent saying they are neutral .

But when registered voters were asked if they would be more or less likely to support a candidate associated with Tea Party activists , 24 percent say they would be inclined to oppose him or her while only 15 percent say they would lean toward supporting the candidate .
Also , 43 percent of the general public say the more they hear about the movement , the less they like it compared to 34 percent who say they like it more as they have become more familiar with it .
The poll raised questions about the broader appeal of the Tea Party , according to ABC 's polling analysts , but the survey contained numbers that showed its strong appeal among the conservative base .
It 's backers are overwhelmingly opposed to the Obama administration and have a strong anti-Washington sentiment .
Simon Reeve presents a travel documentary as embarks on a journey along the Tropic of Capricorn , the line of latitude which cuts through Southern Africa , Australia and South America .
In the four - part BBC2 series Tropic of Capricorn , broadcast in 2008 , Simon followed the southern border of the tropics region around the world .
While filming Tropic of Capricorn , Simon traveled through Namibia , Botswana , South Africa , Mozambique , Madagascar , Western Australia , the Northern Territory , Queensland , Chile , Argentina , Paraguay and Brazil .
The journey took him to stunning areas of the world , but it was also a chance for spontaneous discoveries about the changing global environment , poverty , globalisation , AIDS , the rise of the Chinese economy and the suffering of Africa .
Even in the digital world , standards are still necessary and some old rules deserve respect .
Creators should still be fairly compensated for their work , and we should n’t tolerate stealing as the road to profit .
And , as much as we love YouTube , we should n’t countenance the way its founders muscled their way to riches by enabling the online trafficking of stolen videos .
From garage entrepreneurs to mega-millionaires sounds like the quintessential American success story , except that e-mails released recently by a federal judge plainly show that YouTube ’s magic elixir was theft , not creativity .
Consider the “ business strategy ” discussions in which the YouTube co-founders , Chad Hurley and Steve Chen , concede that drew the original traffic to their website largely through offering stolen property which , they well knew , radically inflated the value of their site before they flipped it to Google for $ 1.65 billion .
As Chen wrote in one e-mail : “ if you remove the potential copyright infringements “… site traffic and virality will drop to maybe 20 percent of what it is . ”
In a discussion with co-founder Hurley about competing for content with a rival website , Chen advised : “ steal it . ”
And when Hurley demurred , Chen responded : “ We have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic .
How much traffic will we get from personal videos ?
Remember , the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type [ stolen ] “… viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos . ”
Chen ’s suggestion of stealing may well have been tongue - in - cheek , but Chen and his colleagues clearly knew their website depended on its users to upload copyrighted work — without any respect for the economic rights of the actors , producers , directors and other professional artists who created it in the first place .
Admittedly some in the “ free culture ” fringe argue that anything that can be digitized should be common property , posted to the Web and free to anybody who wants it .
The counter to that is a moral philosophy that philosophers from Aristotle to John Locke have been teaching us for millennia : “ Do n’t take things that are n’t yours . ”
I ’ve poured my heart into my written work , as have most other professional creative artists , and we expect to be paid a fair price for our honest labor .
As my Arts & Labs colleague Mark McKinnon put it : “ It ’s not free culture ; it ’s freeloader culture .
When you become a millionaire by stealing other people ’s work and get treated like a hero , it tells me that the Internet ecosystem is getting out of whack . ”
What ’s more , excerpted memos from David Eun , then head of Content Partnerships at Google , seem to suggest that playing fast and loose with copyrighted content might be a way to pressure content creators to cut deals with Google and embrace the “ free ” business model .
After Google adopted a digital fingerprint system that could have been used to identify and block copyright infringement on YouTube , Eun wrote that the capabilities “ are only offered to partners who enter into a revenue deal with us . ”
Similarly , an internal Google video presentation contemplated : “ pressure premium content providers to change their model toward free . ”
Happily , Google has moved away from that initial instinct and now says it ’s committed to policing YouTube against copyright abuse .
But the episode shows that the Internet is vulnerable to the tacit acceptance of mass larceny .
So let ’s follow Google ’s lead and not allow crime to pay on the Internet .
We all wind up losers if dishonest speculators exploit the Web ’s wonders to pickpocket their way to personal riches .

An epistemic community may consist of those who accept one version of a story , or one version of validating a story . . .
In philosophy of science and systems science the process of forming a self - maintaining epistemic community is sometimes called a mindset .
In politics , a tendency or faction is usually described in very similar terms . . .
Some consider forming an epistemic community a deep human need , and ultimately a mythical or even religious obligation .

Epistemic Community
A few weeks ago I pointed out that the conservative propaganda machine was resorting to a standard " disinformation " technique to try to negate ( or at least blunt ) the PR damage done by the teabagger fit of rage following the passage of health care reform .
The specific disinformation tactic ( which I like to call " Spock With a Beard " ) essentially consists of creating a false narrative in which black is white , up is down -- and , in this particular case , where liberal Democrats are " inciting " violent threats against peace - loving Republicans like GOP Minority Whip Eric Cantor by , well , making a big fuss about violent threats from angry teabaggers .
By disinformation , I meant :
the systematic creation and dissemination of false narratives . . . aimed at constructing an entire alternative reality -- one in which the truth can find no foothold because it conflicts just not with a specific falsehood , but with the entire fabric of the false reality that has been created .
Since then , I 've noticed the conservative fondness for propaganda methods that would not be out of place in Orwell 's Minitrue ( oldspeak translation : Ministry of Truth ) is also drawing attention from other observers -- including , at least obliquely , some on the right .
Paul Krugman , who is rarely oblique about anything or anyone , points the Orwellian finger at GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , for his stubborn insistance that fiercely defending the interests of huge Wall Street banks is actually a way of preventing future government bailouts .
Has there ever been a time in US political history when one of the two major political parties was so addicted to doublethink , so committed to pretending that it ’s advocating the opposite of its actual agenda ?
To which , one can only reply :
Do the years 2001 through 2008 count ?
Or are the Rove Administration 's two terms in office still too fresh to be treated as history ?
But what really caught my attention was a blog entry by fellow New York Times columnist Ross Douthat ( posted , coincidentally or not , on the same day as Krugman 's question ) which managed , in Douthat 's pretentious yet obtuse way , to talk all the way around the current state of the conservative " mind " without ever acknowledging , much less addressing , the fact that this " mind " is , to a large and ever - increasing degree , a propaganda construct , and thus not really a " mind " at all -- more like an anti-mind .
But , fortunately , Douthat also linked to a much more interesting take from the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez , who digs a bit closer to the truth ( although not quite all the way there ) in the quote cited at the beginning of this diary .
Sanchez 's post , which appears to have caused a buzz in both left and right Blogistan ( I 'm usually late to party these days ) was in reaction to the summary excommunication of David Frum , banished from the American Enterprise Institute for his apostasy on health care reform .
( It 's a telling sign that the AEI 's commissars deported Frum to the conservative version of Siberia not for dissenting on the substance of health care -- he did n't , really -- but rather for questioning the political line , i.e. extreme stonewalling , adopted by the GOP .
Truly , the party must always be right .
Sanchez comes closest to admitting what the game is when he compares the GOP 's current obsession with orthodoxy to the insecurities of the other major surviving totalitarian power on the planet :
Think of the complete panic China ’s rulers feel about any breaks in their Internet firewall :
The more successfully external sources of information have been excluded to date , the more unpredictable the effects of a breach become .
Internal criticism is then especially problematic , because it threatens the hermetic seal .
Apparently , the Cato Institute ( where Sanchez hangs his hat ) has n't yet been brought under full party discipline .
Or at least , he 'd better hope it has n't .
Sanchez 's second brush with a full Orwellian realization of what he 's describing is when he cites the importance of the " other " ( i.e. the liberals ) as the essential bogeyman in the conservative system :
To prevent breach , the internal dissident needs to be resituated in the enemy camp .
It seems that for modern conservatives , the equivalent of being identified as an agent of Emmanuel Goldstein is to be accused of harboring the secret desire to attend Georgetown cocktail parties :
The Cocktail Party move serves this function particularly well because it simultaneously plays on the specific kind of cultural ressentiment that so much conservative rhetoric now seems designed to stoke . . .
You [ i.e. conservative Outer Party members ] are supposed to feel as though you ’ve been snubbed socially -- discarded for " better " company -- which evokes both more indignant rejection of the quisling and further resentment of the liberal snobs who are visiting this indignity on you .
All in all , Sanchez paints a pretty accurate , not to mention damning , picture of the modern conservative ideological machine and its increasingly Orwellian methods -- both of message propagation and social control .
But , apart from the China reference , he more or less elides the question of intentionality .
In Sanchez 's telling ( and even more so in Douthat 's retelling ) the current withered , sectarian and paranoid state of the conservative " mind " is something that just happened -- a bottom - up social trend , not a top - down directive .
This is partially true , I guess , in the sense that a formal Republican Politburo does not exist ( and even if it did , its members most likely would be found chilling at a lesbian bondage club , not steering a high - tech dictatorship from the bowels of a fortress - like ministry . )
But it ’s also not true , in the sense that the conservative propaganda machine referenced at the start of this diary does exist , and has shown a relatively high degree of self - awareness and top - down control -- as witnessed , for example , by the infamous daily guidance memos circulated within Fox News by vice president John Moody ( " Let ’s be on the lookout for any statements from the Iraqi insurgents , who must be thrilled at the prospect of a Dem- controlled Congress . " ) and the talking points distributed directly to Fox commentators by the White House in Rovian times ) .
It may not qualify as a bona fide Inner Party , but it is a party cadre , and it knows its business .
( Figuring out exactly where and how and from whom it learned that business would make for a fascinating social study -- or possibly a legal one ) .
The business , of course , is disinformation : the creation of a closed loop of emotions , beliefs and pseudo - facts that buttress , at all times and all points , the party line .
However , the more I study this , the more I ’m convinced the primary goal of the exercise is n’t to convince the broader public , whom I think the Rovians essentially view as the equivalent of the " proles " of 1984 -- dull lumps of unthinking flesh who , nine times in 10 , will follow the loudest , most simplistic and most passionate voice they hear .
The goal of conservative disinformation , then , is to provide that voice by creating the kind of " mind " ( e.g. epistemic community ) among the true conservative faithful that Sanchez is talking about : one impervious to reason , logic and -- most importantly of all -- factual evidence .
The growing nervousness of some conservative intellectuals , like Douthat and Frum , about this project perhaps reflects the dawning realization that they are basically irrelevant to its success .
The creation of a closed mind is , of course , a prerequisite for successful doublethink ( defined as the ability to hold two diametrically opposed beliefs at the same time , and to immediately change one or both of those beliefs when instructed ) .
By their very nature , doublethink constructs tend to be fragile .
They have a low tolerance for contact with non-managed reality -- much less open debate ( thus the need , in 1984 , for the constant writing and rewriting of history , to ensure a seamless and timeless continuity to the party line ) .
But the real breakthrough discovery by the conservative propaganda machine ( Fox News , in particular ) is that despite this inherent fragility , it does n’t take an Orwellian police state to create and maintain the kind of self - contained , artificial consciousness that doublethink requires .
Indeed , it can be done even in a supposedly free and open society -- that is , as long as two conditions are met .
The first is that the target audience must be trained to be active participants in their own indoctrination , and not just the passive recipients of it .
The circular logic that Sanchez mentions -- i.e. if something contradicts the accepted conservative narrative it must be liberal , and therefore false -- is a key tool for creating this kind of " self - executing " doublethink .
The second requirement , however , in many ways is the more important , at least in a society not fully under the control of those seeking to create the closed mental loop :
Reality must not push back too vigorously against the false reality that ’s being constructed .
In particular , non-conservatives ( especially the non- or quasi - conservative mass media ) must accept the disinformation narrative as legitimate -- i.e. as simply another political point of view -- and ignore the manipulative process by which it has been created .
But in a free society , those two conditions cannot be maintained perpetually and indefinitely ( knock on wood ) , which may explain why the conservative movement in the US has shown a tendency to crash and burn whenever it runs into realities ( the 1991 recession , the aftermath of the Iraq invasion , Hurricane Katrina , the 2008 financial meltdown , etc. ) that can neither be assimilated by the false conservative reality nor fully denied by its inhabitants -- thus puncturing the doublethink bubble .
So far , however , these setbacks have all proven temporary .
The conservative " mind " has shown an impressive ability to pick itself up and put itself back on the track after every derailment .
Whether that 's mainly due to the machine ’s technical efficiency , or a testament to the sheer power of the will to believe among the conservative faithful , I do n't know .
Both , I suspect .
One final note : I should clarify that when I refer to the creation of a " self - executing " conservative doublethink as a breakthrough , I ’m only talking about the American political experience .
The ability of an authoritarian movement to build a powerful false narrative -- and then persuade millions of followers not only to believe it but actively defend it against encroaching reality , even in a more - or - less free society -- was clearly demonstrated in Weimar Germany during the 1920s and ’30s by [ GODWIN REDACTION ] .
One can hope the peculiarities of time , place and culture explain much , if not all , of the catastrophic success of that previous experiment , which is unlikely to be repeated now .
But I ’m not entirely sure it would be the smart way to bet .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said Thursday that he supports a boycott of Arizona by the city of Los Angeles , and he called that state 's newly passed immigration law " unpatriotic and unconstitutional . "
" No person should be treated differently in the eyes of the law , " he said at a news conference .
The mayor said boycotts have worked in the past and cited the city 's divestiture from South Africa in the 1980s to protest apartheid .
Villaraigosa is the latest of a growing a number of elected officials who have called for boycotts against Arizona in the wake of its new immigration rules .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that she had " deep concerns " with the law and said it could siphon resources needed to target criminals .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said he was considering " the possibility of a court challenge . "
The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requires police to check suspects for immigration paperwork .
The legislation also bars people from soliciting work or hiring day laborers off the street .

on the fifth floor of a formerly modern building in West Hollywood , looks like a lot of office lobbies :
Under a battered foam ceiling , a receptionist sits behind a high counter , answering a phone that never stops ringing ; on either side of her there are some neglected potted plants , dusty in the fluorescent light ; in front of her a glass table has been covered with the type and vintage of magazines normally found at a dentist's .
The only difference between Ryan Kavanaugh 's office lobby and your office lobby is that Ron Howard is sitting in his , in hiking boots , declining politely the receptionist 's offer of a bottle of Yosemite water .
" I 'm A - okay , " Howard says .
He 's come here this afternoon looking for more than something to drink .
The chances are good that Howard has come here , like many of the people who come here , looking for money .
For the most part , money has become hard to find in Hollywood , even for men like Ron Howard .
Plagued by a combination of rising costs , the credit squeeze , investor flight , digital piracy , the repeal of arcane German tax laws , and too much crap , the usual vaults have gone empty .
The Weinsteins have been told by consultants to cut back their slate to ten films a year , New Line has all but disappeared into the maw at Warner Bros. , and Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer , founded in 1924 , is on the verge of bankruptcy .
No one has any money anymore — no one , it seems , except Ryan Kavanaugh : a thirty - four - year - old onetime venture capitalist and wannabe rock star with messy red hair , a man who refuses to wear anything on his feet but blue Converse All - Stars , even on those rare occasions when he wears a suit .
About thirty feet away from the chair presently occupied by Ron Howard , Kavanaugh sits behind a curved zebrawood desk and on top of an estimated $ 2 billion in liquid assets , much of which comes courtesy of Elliott Associates , a venerable New York — based hedge fund that has $ 13 billion more where that came from .
Which means that if you see a movie sometime in the next twelve months , it 's even money that it 's been financed at least partly by Kavanaugh through his company , Relativity Media , LLC .
The majority of the movies made by giants Sony and Universal — three quarters of them , in fact — rely on his financing .
Warner Bros. has been known to dip into his kitty , and so has Marvel .
Atlas Entertainment , where Batman was born , recently struck a coproduction deal with him .
Earlier this year , Relativity bought Rogue , Universal 's horror imprint , and it will also put out a dozen of its own films — " single pictures , " in the local lexicon — next year .
All told , Relativity , and thus Ryan Kavanaugh , will produce or coproduce as many as thirty - five movies in 2010 .
But what separates Kavanaugh from most producers is not just that he 's making movies , it 's how he 's making movies .
Ron Howard has to wait in the office lobby because , at the moment , Kavanaugh is delivering his own pitch to an author who has written a book that a lot of people want to turn into a movie .
The author has been making the Hollywood rounds and has spent the last several minutes dropping the names of the famous directors he has met .
( Kavanaugh seems unimpressed :
He has 10,476 numbers stored on his phone ; later , when he goes to the Chateau Marmont for dinner , it takes maybe sixty seconds for Baz Luhrmann to appear out of the foliage and give him a hug . )
Kavanaugh counters by telling the author that he , too , knows lots of famous directors — there might even be one waiting in the office lobby — and then he explains to the author why he would be foolish to sell the rights to his book to anyone else .
" We might not give you $ 10 million up front , " Kavanaugh says .
" But if we tell you we 're going to make a movie out of your book , we 'll actually make a movie out of your book . "
That should n't sound revolutionary — it should sound exactly like the point — but Hollywood has long bought much more than it sells .
Every year , the six major studios shell out for hundreds , if not thousands , of pitches , scripts , and books , sometimes for millions of dollars a throw ; on average , each studio will turn only eleven of those ideas into movies .
The rest of all that hope and capital ends up lining shelves and clogging hard drives .
" There 's no other industry where that kind of waste would be acceptable , " Kavanaugh says .
" I 'm not in this for the art , you know ?
I do n't care about awards .
I want to make money .
I want to own a business . "
Since founding Relativity in 2003 , Kavanaugh has , by learning from his failures as often as his successes , helped build a new studio model , soaking the guesswork out of movie - making and replacing it with a harder science every step of the way — starting with the idea .
Kavanaugh claims that Relativity turns more than 90 percent of the raw material it buys into finished product , an almost ridiculous level of efficiency .
He tells this to the author , and he tells the author that the real money comes when movies get made , at the back end , and that the author will surely collect later everything that someone else might promise him now , with the added benefit of boosted book sales and seeing his name in big letters on three thousand screens across America and in 110 countries around the world , perhaps even side by side with Ron Howard's .
The author finds himself nodding , because Ryan Kavanaugh 's greatest talent is his ability to make other people nod .
The author is still nodding when he leaves the office , walking beside Tucker Tooley , Kavanaugh 's president of production .
On his way to the elevators , he passes through the office lobby and sees Ron Howard rising from his chair , next in line .
He stops , grabs Tooley by the arm , and says , " That was Ron Howard . "
Tooley says , Yes , it was .
The author looks as though he has witnessed something like a miracle .
" He was n't lying , " he says .
" You ca n't think of it as money , " Kavanaugh says , kicking those blue Converse All - Stars up onto the table in front of him .
" You have to think of it as math . "
Kavanaugh and Tooley have sat down to talk about a movie they 've just lifted from another producer who has , in accordance with modern custom , run out of math .
The movie was allegedly complete , but it's also terrible — " I have no idea why it has so many midgets , " Kavanaugh says — and it needs some serious overhauling .
In Relativity 's screening room , with its plush leather chairs and popcorn machine , the movie plays on a white screen with minutes - long stretches of it filled by placeholders , ink - on - paper storyboards rather than celluloid .
Those scenes , dreamed up by hired guns so the movie might be made logical and midget - free , now need to be shot .
Tooley puts two options in front of Kavanaugh : a ten - day reshoot that will cost one price , or a fifteen - day reshoot that will cost $ 1 million more .
The extra million bucks will give him a killer new fight scene .
Now Kavanaugh has to project , in the next few minutes , whether that disputed million is a wise investment — not in the movie as a piece of cinema but in the movie 's bottom line .
Will that killer new fight scene , after it's been threaded into the trailer and Twittered about at the premiere , yield him more than $ 1,000,001 in additional box office ?
" What I first see is a bunch of numbers , " says Ramon Wilson , Relativity 's thirty - year - old executive vice - president of business development .
A former investment banker , Wilson leads a team of young - turk statisticians —
Hollywood 's equivalent of Moneyballers — who occupy a cramped , windowless back room littered with empty cans of Diet Coke .
On a tall bookshelf , there are rows of thick black binders , each of which has the name of a movie stickered onto its spine : Zombieland , Charlie Wilson 's War , Paul Blart : Mall Cop .
Before Relativity commits to financing a particular movie — either through its slate deals with Sony and Universal or on its own — it 's fed into an elaborate Monte Carlo simulation , a risk - assessment algorithm normally used to evaluate financial instruments based on the past performance of similar products .
Enough variables are included in the Monte Carlo for Wilson and his team to have reached the limits of their Excel 's sixty - five thousand rows of data : principal actor , director , genre , budget , release date , rating , and so on .
After running the movie through ten thousand combinations of variables ( in marathon overnight sessions ) , the computers will churn out a few hundred pages that culminate in two critical numbers : the percentage of time the movie will be profitable , and the average profit for each profitable run .
The computers will also calculate the best weekend for the movie to be released , whether Russell Crowe will earn his salary or Sam Worthington will be good enough , and the box - office effect of an R rating versus PG - 13 .
But for Kavanaugh , those are secondary considerations :
Unless the movie shows the distinct probability of a return — no one at Relativity will reveal the precise green - light figure , but it 's something like 70 percent — the script gets shredded .
" Everything has to run on the principle of profit , " Kavanaugh says .
" We 'll never let creative decisions rule our business decisions .
If it does n't fit the model , it does n't get done . "
Now , if Kavanaugh or Tooley are kept awake at night by a script , they might put more effort into massaging the variables — plugging in different actors and budgets , finding the right combination of elements — until the percentages make sense .
They 'll remain sensitive to the potential for foreign box office , which more frequently rewards challenging material .
They 'll try to make the numbers add up by keeping costs down , by filming in Hungary ( the upcoming Season of the Witch ) , substituting Puerto Rico for Hawaii ( A Perfect Getaway ) , or convincing Montreal to give them back 25 percent of everything they spend there in the form of tax breaks .
They 'll encourage creative talent , such as the author , to take their paychecks out of the profit rather than up front .
( " Giving actors $ 20 million for a movie that loses money is like giving bonuses to the CEOs of bankrupt companies , " Kavanaugh says . )
But if no amount of fiddling and hustle will yield a consistent return , then the dream is over and it's on to the next one .
Some in Hollywood — even more than some — see Kavanaugh as this town 's latest false prophet and his talk of regression analysis as so much mathematical flimflam .
( " All he 's built is a house of cards , " says one rival producer . )
They read through his catalog of misses and mostly modest hits — in the normal studio equation , a multitude of sin is covered up by a single gigantic success — and wonder how he keeps the money flowing .
Kavanaugh says his critics are missing the point .
His system is designed to eliminate the dice rolls that made legends and goats of the old moguls — it 's designed especially to eliminate the calamitous , crippling flop .
" Volatility is a bad thing in any business , " he says .
" We 're just not going to take big risks .
That means we 'll probably never hit a home run , because the model makes it hard for us to swing for the fences .
We would n't have made The Matrix .
But we would n't have made Waterworld , either . "
" Rule number one here , " Tooley says , " is do n't lose your shirt . "
It 's antiromantic , Kavanaugh 's singles - and - doubles model .
Maybe it 's bad for the future of art .
Relativity will never make a movie that bends genres , or is set in Victorian England , or stars midgets .
It will never make those movies , because the computers know that we wo n't go see them , even when they win awards and four - star reviews .
" Do you know how many people saw The Assassination of Jesse James ? "
Kavanaugh asks , referring to one of his most beautiful early efforts .
" You and seven other people .
Paul Blart grossed nearly $ 200 million worldwide .
I 'll take Paul Blart all day , every day . "
And because he 'll take Paul Blart all day , every day — and because he knows New Mexico can double as both the Middle East and Minnesota , and because he knows Natalie Portman is a bigger draw in France than you might reasonably expect — Ryan Kavanaugh still has money , and he 's still making movies .
He might even save movies , the way he 's saving this terrible movie and its bankrupt producer from abject failure by footing the bill for the reshoot ( taking place in Montreal , because 25 percent is 25 percent ) .
Now Kavanaugh needs to decide exactly how much of a savior he 's willing to be .
He looks at the sheets of paper that fill the black binder laid open on his lap .
Tooley watches him flip between his two options , back and forth , back and forth ... .
Just another million - dollar decision .
Just more math .
In the end , Kavanaugh keeps his choice a secret .
But there 's a 96.7 percent chance that you wo n't even miss the killer new fight scene that 's probably not there .
In the chair formerly occupied by Ron Howard , a rabbi now sits .
When Mark Wahlberg ( who 's not Jewish ) came here to discuss his starring role in Kavanaugh 's upcoming film The Fighter , Wahlberg , for unexplained reasons , brought along the rabbi .
Since then , the rabbi has stopped by the office every few weeks hoping to give Kavanaugh ( who is Jewish ) a blessing .
Kavanaugh has not accepted the rabbi's offer until today , which happens to fall between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur .
The days between , including today , are set aside for reflection , for righting past wrongs , and for summoning a renewed purpose for the year ahead .
" I just thought on the off chance that somebody 's watching these things ... "
Kavanaugh says .
The rabbi comes into his office and gives him a cake wrapped in tinfoil and sealed in a plastic bag .
The rabbi then blesses the cake .
By eating the cake , the rabbi says , Kavanaugh will ensure that he will not go hungry this year .
The cake is a hedge on the bet .
The rabbi sings himself out to the elevators , and the cake sits on Kavanaugh 's desk — a reminder that despite his best efforts to turn movies into a conventional , numbers - driven business , randomness persists here , an unpredictable mischief that 's been built into the machine .
In Hollywood , there have always been variables for which there is no accounting , and those variables remain .
Their persistence means that the computers can't always be trusted .
( Kavanaugh is careful to call the Monte Carlo a " rejection tool , not an acceptance tool . " )
The computers told Kavanaugh that Evan Almighty was a good risk :
Its predecessor , Bruce Almighty , had collected more than $ 480 million in worldwide box office ; Morgan Freeman was willing to return in the role of God , and the computers have always liked Morgan Freeman ; director Tom Shadyac was set to return as well , having made four movies that grossed nine figures ; and it was going to star Steve Carell , who was fresh from the mammoth success of The 40 - Year - Old Virgin .
But much to Kavanaugh 's chagrin , the movie 's production budget spiraled out of control ( reportedly reaching the head - scratching neighborhood of $ 175 million ) , and the fractured marketing campaign — was it a family flick about Noah 's Ark , or a teenage poop - and - puke comedy ? — left a movie that might have appealed to everybody appealing to nobody instead .
" That 's one I 'd love to have back , " Kavanaugh says .
" But the fact is , we 'll never be perfect .
Every movie is like a little company , and any little thing can make it not work .
So , sure , sometimes we 're surprised when a movie fails to find an audience ; sometimes we 're surprised when it does . "
Whenever they 're confronted with either of those scenarios , Ramon Wilson and the rest of the boys in that windowless back room will spit out a single word like an epithet : outlier .
They can't say it without holding their hands out at their sides .
Outliers represent those dark , unknown edges of the statistical universe that lie beyond the limits of our understanding .
When the computers favorably assessed Land of the Lost , they did n't factor in our sudden collective fatigue with having Will Ferrell yell at us .
When they ran the numbers for 300 — a movie about an ancient battle waged between mostly naked men starring nobody famous set against a blood - soaked , computer - generated backdrop framed by a cult graphic novel — they could n't have bargained for anything like its eventual worldwide gross of more than $ 450 million .
Despite the popular opinion that Hollywood has run out of new ideas , some movies still arrive on screens without precedent .
Those outliers , good and bad , give even Kavanaugh 's conservative model some sense of gamble .
No matter how many blessed cakes he receives or how broadly his theories become practice — and they 're circulating among the moneyless these days like whispers —
Hollywood will never be built on certainty .
Hollywood will never do better than probable .
" I wish every movie was 100 percent , " Kavanaugh says .
" I wish every movie was a sure thing . "
Now Ryan Kavanaugh is lying .
Because the truth is , for Kavanaugh , as for all of us , a life filled with sure things would be death .
And even though Kavanaugh tries to mask his love of movies with his love of money , he loves movies just a little bit more .
He says he does n't care about awards , but he knows his movies have been nominated for precisely thirty - seven Oscars .
He claims he would take Paul Blart all day , every day , but his next movie , Brothers , is a very good film about a love triangle set against the war in Afghanistan .
Kavanaugh fell in love with the script for Brothers , not its Monte Carlo numbers —
" That one 's my baby , " he admits — and even though he 's erased his risk by recruiting foreign distributors to cover its production budget , it still seems an unlikely bet for him to make .
But there 's a poster on the wall of Kavanaugh 's office , a tattered one - sheet from what he says is his favorite movie , a movie so unpopular that he could find the poster only in Spanish :
En algún lugar del tiempo — Somewhere in Time .
It 's a 1980 tearjerker starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour as unlikely lovers separated by a half dozen decades , until Reeve learns to close his eyes and open his mind and convince himself that he can travel through time .
It was a critical and commercial failure , and yet something about it worked for Kavanaugh .
Maybe it was the physics behind it .
Maybe it had something to do with where he was when he first watched it or the lens he saw it through .
Whatever it was , even he can't explain why , exactly , Somewhere in Time caught hold of him .
" It 's just an insane love story , " he says , his hands held out at his sides .
" Titanic was an insane love story , too . "
The computers have told him again and again that love is an outlier .
This time , Kavanaugh has chosen not to believe them .

• Book : Fast Times At Ridgemont High , Cameron Crowe , 1981
• Film : Fast Times At Ridgemont High , adapted by Cameron Crowe , directed by Amy Heckerling , 1982

When I first set out to write my Better Late Than Never column about Amy Heckerling 's Fast Times At Ridgemont High , I was vaguely aware of the background : Cameron Crowe started his career at 15 , playing an adult role in society by writing for Playboy , Creem , Rolling Stone , and other high - profile publications .
Seven years later , as a nominal adult , he reversed the formula by playing a much younger role .
At age 22 , he returned to high school and spent a year pretending to be a senior , so he could observe the wild American teenager in its native habitat and document what he learned .
Fast Times
At Ridgemont
High was the book that came out of that experience , essentially a year in the life of a California high school .
A year later , Crowe 's screenplay version of the book was a hit teen sex comedy that still maintains a positive reputation today .

So what happened to the book , which is now out of print and fairly rare ?
( Worn paperback copies go for $ 40 and up online , according to a couple of reputable book search engines . )
Why did n't Crowe 's book go on to similar glory and a similarly warm place in the hearts of pop-culture addicts everywhere ?
After all , the two versions are very similar–virtually all the action in the film is right there in the original version .
The simple , direct , obvious answer is that the film had hit music , high levels of charisma from newbie actors who went on to be stars , and nubile naked breasts .
That breast thing in particular likely made a big difference with the film 's intended teen audience :
The book just had boring old words on paper .
But even accepting the book 's boobless handicappitude , I think there 's a little more going on , and frankly , I blame the way Crowe chose to frame the book .
I strongly suspect that if he 'd written it as more of a personal essay , more of a tell - all , more of a sociological " Here 's what 's going on with the kids of today , and here 's what grown - ups think is going on , and here 's why they 're wrong " analysis rooted in the moment , that people would still be reading it today with fascination .
Instead , what he gave us is framed as fiction , and it comes across as a fairly dull , plodding , unfocused novel .

Here 's an excerpt , starting from page 2 of the book :
Stacy was a sweet - looking girl with long , blond hair and only the last traces of adolescent baby fat .
An interesting thing had happened over the summer .
She had caught the flu and had lost weight , and slimmed down to what her mother constantly reminded her was a " voluptuous figure . "
Stacy was not quite used to it yet .
She had noted increased attention from boys , but as Linda Barrett pointed out , boys did n't count .
The idea was to interest men .
Advertisement
Stacy had been working the cash register on the August night that The Vet first walked into Swenson's .
He looked to be in his early 20s .
He sat down at table C - 9 , clasped his bandless fingers in front of him , and ordered a French dip sandwich .
Stacy watched as the main - floor waitresses all vanished into the back kitchen .
He was kind of cute , she decided , in a blow - dry sort of way .
He kept staring at her .
It was n't Stacy 's imagination .
Even the other girls noticed .
The man finished his sandwich , bypassed any ice - cream order , and walked directly over to Stacy with his check .
Advertisement
" So , " he said , with a ready smile .
" Are you working hard , or hardly working ? "
Stacy smiled back–they were supposed to enjoy all customer jokes , unless obscene–and punched up the amount .
Advertisement
" Working hard , " she said , with studied indifference .
She took his ten - dollar bill .
" Out of ten . "
" Listen , " the man said .
" My name is Ron Johnson . "
She counted back his change .
" I'm Stacy . "
" You really look like someone I 'd like to know .
I never really do this , but … "
He pulled a business card from his wallet and wrote his home number on the back .
" Why do n't you give me a call sometime ?
I 'd love to take you out for dinner .
What do you say ? "
Advertisement
Caught by surprise , Stacy reverted to the tone and phrasing she usually reserved for customers asking for substitutions on to - go orders .
" I 'll see what I can do . "
" I look forward to hearing from you . "
" Okay .
Thank you , and have a nice evening . "
As soon as he walked out of Swenson's , three waitresses beelined for Stacy .
" What 's his name ?
What 's his name ? "
" What a total fox ! "
" Does he work in the mall ? "
Note the choppy , repetitively declarative sentences , the flat dialogue , the tell - don't - show style , the physical - appearance - as - characterization summary .
If this was a straight - up fictional novel , I can't imagine it would have gone too far as a pop-culture artifact .
It 's pretty clumsy stuff .
( Better than my writing when I was 22 , sure , but none of that is in print either . )

And the shame of it is that Crowe 's introduction , where he tells the story of how his experiment came about , is much more dynamic and involving .
Over a few short pages , he talks about pitching his idea to a principal who was dubious until Crowe mentioned meeting Kris Kristofferson , at which point the principal was apparently so dazzled by this brush with fame that he let the whole project ride .
Then he apparently forgot about it : Crowe mentions seeing him again at the end of the year , at which point " a fleeting look of panic crossed his face .
Nine months later , it was as if he could n't quite recall my name or where he knew me from . "
Crowe also talks about his first meeting with the girl he calls Linda Barrett ( the Phoebe Cates character from the film ) , and about how people from that year of high school probably largely remember him as " the guy with the bad bladder , " because he was always requesting bathroom trips so he could run outside and write down some telling piece of conversation he 'd just overheard .
And finally , he talks in a few bare sentences about how his friends and family reacted to his experiment –their horror at how into " cars and the prom " he became during his second adolescence , and at how little he was writing professionally : " Magazine journalists , like P.O.W.'s and Turkish drug prisoners , are presumed dead if not heard from over two major holidays . "
Coming out of Crowe 's intro to the book , I wanted much more of that kind of personal touch–his lively sense of humor , his reflections on the experiment , and above all , descriptions of what it was like sneaking into a high school and pretending to be a teenager again , especially given that he apparently was n't much of a typical teenager back when he was a teenager .

As a sideline , compare all this to one of my favorite Harlan Ellison essays , " The Gang , " from Memos From Purgatory .
Ellison famously infiltrated a Brooklyn street gang when he was 23 , as research for a novel .
He hung out with them and went through a standard initiation , fucking a girl and fighting the gang to prove his commitment .
Then he hung with them and fought alongside them for weeks before bailing .
The essay is an observation of how those kids lived , what they did for fun , how they interacted , and what they thought and believed , but it's also an observation of Ellison 's personal experiences , including his terror that they 'd find him out as a phony , and the mental gymnastics he went through to stay in the game .
It 's far more interesting than the debut novel , Web Of The City , that came out of the experience .
And I think Fast Times the book needed that frank personal insight .
Crowe did something authentically brave and interesting and unique , and he had a chance to file a detailed report on an extraordinary experience that virtually no one else is likely to have .
Instead , he gave us a clunky , choppy novel billed as " a true story , " though it contains any number of things that are hard to take as fact .
Advertisement
Without the intro , there 'd be no reason to believe that Fast Times is based on real life instead of being pure clumsy fiction .
About the only time Crowe as author interferes in the narrative is in a very brief–and yet tellingly entertaining –rapturous comment about the teen buzzword that was apparently all the rage when he went back to school : " wussy , " an amalgam of " wimp " and " pussy " that was n't as mild as the former or as dirty as the latter , but summed up the contempt of both .
All that is the downside .
The upside , naturally , is that Crowe 's book Fast Times At Ridgemont High is full of ground - level observations of teenagers on their own turf , and as such , it 's reasonably involving .
Most of the film was taken directly from the book , and just condensed or streamlined .
Here 's the scene from the film that came out of the scene from the book excerpted above :
Advertisement
Maybe it 's just Jennifer Jason Leigh 's shy charm as Stacy Hamilton , and maybe it's that Crowe cut a lot of the book 's unnecessary dialogue for this scene , and the description is all right there on her face .
Either way , the scene is fleeter and sweeter on film .
But you can see where the dialogue and scenario came straight from the book .
Most of the film comes directly from the book in similar fashion , given that Crowe wrote both based on the same experiences .
But he tweaked the story considerably for the film , tightening it up and focusing on just a few characters , seemingly to give it more of a story arc , and in some cases , possibly to make it more palatable for audiences of the day .
One of the more notable plot changes is that in the film , Ron ( " The Vet " ) takes Stacy out to The Point on their first date and deflowers her ; she 's shy , but more than willing , even eager , to get this rite of passage out of the way .
In the book , they go on several dates , he refuses to make a move , and she gets impatient and consults Linda , who tells her " Most guys are just pussies …
So I started making the first move , and you know what else ?
Most guys are just too insecure and too chicken to do it themselves . "
So Stacy meaningfully suggests that Ron take her to the Point , and she 's the one who kisses him on the mouth , suggesting he go further , and he seems … well , shy , but more than willing .
( Maybe Crowe and director Amy Heckerling thought that an America that was barely ready for teen girls who wanted sex was n't yet ready for teen girls who practically had to mug guys to get it . )
In the film , he sends her flowers afterward but never calls again , in a " Wham , bam , thank you ma'am " sort of move ; in the book , he continues to call her and angle for more dates , but she 's done with him , because she 's sick of hiding him from her mom and lying about her age .
After a round of speculative note - passing between her and Linda , she writes him a disingenuous letter revealing that she 's only 15 .
Only then does he stop bugging her .
Later , during her abortion crisis , she calls him seeking solace , but he nervously gives her the quickest brush - off possible , before even hearing why she 's calling .

Another major book - vs. - film difference :
In the film , surfer - dude Spicoli ( Sean Penn ) is a clownish but sympathetic figure , the affable , relateable stoner in us all , whereas in the book , he 's more obviously being mocked every time Crowe observes him .
Crowe never comes out and says " Look how dumb this guy is , " but the slant of the stories about Spicoli all point in that direction .
For instance , in the scene where a student named Louis Crowley loses his father and sister when their car is smashed over the side of a bridge by a reckless driver .
Everything is somber until Spicoli charges into Louis ' journalism class , obliviously lofting a newspaper featuring photos of the accident : " ' Look at these bitchin ' photos of the crash , ' boomed Jeff Spicoli .
' You can see the people inside and everything . '
Everyone froze .
No one spoke .
Louis Crowley hung his head and began to sob .
It would be another month before anyone spoke to Jeff Spicoli again . "
Losing scenes like that may help make Spicoli more palatable in the film , but Penn 's bantery cheerfulness and infectious grin are also a large part of the change .
I also wonder if he improv-ed some of his scenes ; the dialogue in the Spicoli scenes is further from the dialogue in the book than most of the rest of the film , with some of his most notable lines ( telling a wave " Hey , bud , let 's party ! " ; telling a friend " That was my freakin ' skull !
I 'm so wasted ! " ) not appearing in the book at all .
Advertisement
The last really major difference between the book and the film involves Charles Jefferson , Forest Whitaker 's character .
In the film , Charles shows up as a high - school football star , with little more characterization than " scary big black dude " ; the book , by contrast , gets into his family life , his desire to not " be anyone 's ' black friend , ' " the racist taunts that drove him away from high - school football , his coach 's successful bid to get a huge cash influx for the school 's losing football team by re-recruiting Charles Jefferson , and Jefferson 's general attitude of " fuck this , I 'm headed for the majors " defiance throughout his senior year .
There 's also a fairly amazing story where he hijacks a city bus and makes it take him directly home because his car is in the shop and he 's in a bad mood .
( This is before Spicoli wrecks his car ; at this point , it 's apparently just having maintenance done . )
The cops come to question Jefferson about the incident , but he denies it ; he 's banned from city busses thereafter , but he 's fine with that .
Eventually , he 's arrested for involvement in a robbery with two dudes who break into a Radio Shack after a party .
He loses his scholarship and effectively ceases to exist as far as the school is concerned .
The whole dealing with Charles Jefferson is one of the many places where Crowe 's authorial voice would have been immensely welcome , to clear up exactly how much of Fast Times is conjecture , amalgamation , or outright fiction .
How would he know any of these things about a solitary , angry kid who does n't speak to people ?
Are all the stories Crowe tells about him just passed - on rumors ?
Given how overblown the gossipy retellings of Spicoli's " You dick ! " encounter with Mr. Hand become , how could Crowe trust any stories about such an overblown , widely feared kid ?
Given that this is all presented in a fictionalized setting anyway , how much of it is real , and how much of it does Crowe actually meant to be taken as real ?

At any rate , the film is a relatively faithful adaptation of maybe half of the book .
While a few characters were condensed into each other –in the book , the school scalper and Mike Damone are two different people , for instance–and a lot of scenes were left out , the ones that made it into the film are generally kept close to the source .
For instance , here 's the book 's version of the famous scene where Brad Hamilton ( Judge Reinhold ) masturbates to a mental image of Linda Barrett , and she walks in on him :
A short film unreeled in his mind .
This film featured Linda Barrett , just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago .
She was gorgeous .
Her breasts seemed even bigger than usual .
Her nipples were hard , poking through the filmy maroon string bikini .
Water rolled slowly down her cheeks into the corners of her mouth .
Her lips were parted slightly .
Her eyes were filled with desire .
Advertisement
" Hi , Brad , " she said in the daydream , " you know how cute I always thought you were .
I think you 're so sexy .
Will you come to me ? "
In the daydream , Brad was wearing a nice shirt .
His hair was combed back and looking great .
He walked to Linda .
She reached out and grabbed him for a kiss , pulling him close .
Then she pushed him away so he could watch as she carefully unstrapped the top of her bathing suit .
The incredible Linda Barrett breasts fell loose .
She took Brad 's hands and placed them on her as she began unbuttoning his shirt .
They were just about to fall into passionate teenage love making when Brad heard …

" Hey Brad ? Got any Q - ti … "
There was a swift knock at the bathroom door and then –Jesus–it just opened .
The words I 'm in here stalled in Brad 's mouth .
Advertisement
There stood the real - life Linda Barrett , her top very much still on .
She was standing in the doorway , paralyzed by the sight before her .
Poor Brad was kneeling on the bathroom floor , a sizable erection shriveling in his hand .
" Sorry , " she said , " I did n't know anybody was in here . "
Linda Barrett pulled the door shut as if she wanted to forget what she saw as quickly as possible .
They would never again discuss the incident .
Advertisement
Brad stared down into the toilet bowl , still not believing what had happened .
It was funny how everything could just turn around on you in a matter of seconds .
Brad slammed the toilet bowl cover down .
" Does n't anyone fuckin ' knock any more ? " he said .
( As a side note here , I once again wound up wondering where this story came from .
Who spilled the beans about this encounter , exactly ?
Did the real - life " Brad " actually fess up about what was going through his head ?
As with so many scenes in Fast Times the book , it 's all but impossible to believe that everything really happened as Crowe captured it ; the difficulty of verifying stories like this is likely why he wrote from a fictional standpoint .
That , and to protect these poor , embarrassed bastards . )

Still , the book contains a ton of material that was left out , likely for clarity and for run time , with entire storylines and characters omitted completely .
Here are a whole bunch of details that did n't make it to the final cut of the film :
• Mr. Hand ( the brusque , hilarious teacher played by Ray Walston ) is revealed as being obsessed with Steve Garrett , the chief detective from Hawaii 5 - 0 .
He imitates Garrett 's mannerisms and speech patterns to the point where students apparently ask him every year why he acts so much like that guy .
He always responds " I do n't know what you 're talking about . "

• Linda and Stacy go to the free clinic together to get Stacy on birth control once she 's sexually active .
Linda , an old pro at this business , tells Stacy exactly what to say and do in order to make sure she gets on the pill and does n't just get a diaphragm , apparently the birth control of choice for less sexually active girls .
• Linda is in a complicated relationship with a 20 - year - old ; they 're engaged and she shows off her engagement as a mark of her maturity over mere high - school boys , but at the same time , she and her fiancé see very little of each other .
She treats him like a weapon against people she does n't want to date or sleep with , while not letting him get in the way of people she does .
There 's also a fairly harrowing story about how Linda and Stacy became friends : Linda was a bad kid who sold and did copious amounts of drugs , until she ODed and her drug buddies panicked and dumped her outside at a closed mall .
Afterward , " Linda set about courting the straightest girl she knew , " basically making Stacy into a friend by force of will , and remodeling her life after Stacy 's more clean - cut one .
Advertisement
• Stacy 's semi-love interests Mike Damone and Mark " The Rat " Ratner ( Robert Romanus and Brian Backer in the film ) are actually a little undercharacterized in the book , but more details about their pasts are forthcoming , particularly how they met , when they both worked at Marine World and Damone faked epileptic fits to freak people out .
There 's also an ongoing plotline where The Rat attempts to chat up Stacy , who works at the student information desk , by asking her for information he does n't actually want or need .
Sometimes he just hovers by the information desk , trying to work out when to approach so he gets to talk to her instead of the other person working the desk .
• Brad does n't get fired from his plum fast - food job at Carl 's Jr. for threatening to kick a customer 's ass ; a bitchy female customer goes out of her way to get him in trouble , and his manager purposefully frames him as a thief in order to get rid of him .
Meanwhile , all the friends he brought on to work with him refuse to stand up for him , to his disgust and fury .
He gets fired from his second job ( at Jack - In - The - Box ) for threatening to kick a customer 's ass .

• The " we want to be called Spirit Bunnies " scene in the book is much more protracted , and comes from established characters , rather than being a joke line from nowhere .
The book includes a lot of descriptions and little scenelets featuring key players at Ridgemont , most of whom become background texture in the film , or are omitted entirely .
• There 's a whole section on Spirit Week ( or " TOLO Week , " which somehow stands for " totally outrageous " ) , when everyone dresses up in costumes .
Crowe offers up some suspiciously committed handicapping on the big homecoming king and queen race , with all the contenders explored as if by someone who really cares about who wins .
Incidentally , the football coach 's big rallying cry , revealed during the homecoming section , is " HQA !
Hellfire !
Quickness ! Agility ! "
Which , you know , just rolls comfortably off athletes ' tongues and gets them all fired up to play .

• While Spicoli and his brother do wreck Charles Jefferson 's car , and they do set it up to look like a rival school did it , the comedic sequence from the film where Charles Jefferson takes out his fury on that school is much less pronounced in the book , and just amounts to a mild note that he makes one fairly determined touchdown , possibly because of his anger over his car .
• One prominent character from the book , Steve Shasta , is left entirely out of the movie , possibly because the movie winds up being a coming - of - age sex comedy largely about Stacy , so there 's no room for observations about a guy who 's getting a great deal of sex himself .
Shasta is a self - aggrandizing blowhard who spends a lot of time in the local media , talking about his sports successes in highly printable , colorful soundbites .
He also tells everyone in school that he 's celibate , because he 's saving all his strength for soccer .
This makes him seem inaccessible and mysterious , and gets him a lot of blowjobs from a lot of girls , including Linda Barrett herself .
The book includes a number of colorful Steve Shasta stories ; he 's about as big a character as Linda or Spicoli or The Rat .

Whew .
Yes , I 'm aware that at this point , this column rivals the length of the book , but given how hard it is to lay hands on the book , that does n't seem as embarrassing as it might be .
Besides , I have n't used the word " penis " nearly enough yet in this column .
To that end …
The book also includes many , many , many little scattered vignettes , amounting to a page or two apiece .
Among the most interesting :
• some business about School Picture Day , where Damone persuades Rat to moon the camera during the all - class shot .
The two of them later wind up consigned to the school gym , glumly erasing Rat 's ass - crack from every copy of the school yearbook ;
• a sequence where Spicoli , called upon to give a speech in class , tells an obviously improvised story about how Mick Jagger personally gave him the necklace he 's wearing , after they did coke together .
The class , assigned to collectively grade him , gives him a D. ( A version of this scene was reportedly filmed ) ;
• a bunch of random plot threads following Ridgemont High's " dean of discipline , " a hardcore adult bully who wears cop suits and acts like a cop , except when trying to make friends with Charles Jefferson , who tells him to go fuck himself .
Eventually , he pulls a gun on Spicoli , claiming he mistook Spicoli 's bong for a shotgun .
He 's subsequently sued and fired ;
• a sequence where a tremendously charismatic paraplegic class - ring salesman comes through and successfully sells rings to most of the school , even people who had no interest in them before hearing his nostalgic , manipulative , " I remember the good old high school days before I crippled myself in a car crash … " sales pitch ;
• a sequence where some eerily glib , robotic Frisbee champs come in to do a school presentation on behalf of Frisbee , unaware that they are n't appearing at a college .
This does n't keep them from hitting on the older girls ;
• various funny late - night phone conversations between Linda and Stacy , about boys , dating , and what exactly constitutes " a total orgasm " ;
• an unusually long and detailed but detached sequence chronicling the high - school talent show , where various people show off obnoxiously , and Spicoli is " merciless " about playing a loudly beeping handheld football game during acts that bore him ;
• Damone notices a pimple near his penis and obsesses about possibly having VD .
Eventually , he exposes himself to the assistant P.E. coach , asking for his input , and enduring a joke about the possibility that Damone caught something from the coach 's wife ;
• meanwhile , The Rat measures his own penis , worrying about average sizes , whether he 's underendowed , and how to measure honestly .
He later mail - orders a penile extender called the " Exer - Gro Plus , " unsure what form it will take .
It turns out to be " a rubber dickhead " designed to be worn on the end of his cock to " lengthen " it visually .
He tries it .
It falls off and slides down his pant leg while he 's shopping in Safeway ;
• the suicide of a little - known and little - loved student causes a popular teacher to lecture every one of her classes about their self - absorption and selfishness , and they 're all cowed and considerate , " for about two weeks " ;
• an April Fool 's day prank draws 30 Hendrix impersonators of varying talent to the school to audition for a supposed Off - Broadway tribute to the guitarist .
Once they learn it 's just a prank , they decide Jimi would have wanted them to jam , so they take over the cafeteria and play for an hour and a half before someone cuts off the electricity ;
• a long graduation - night sequence follows various characters ' attempts to procure booze and sex during a nighttime trip to Disneyland ;
• Brad writes himself a fairly touching letter about graduation and his hopes for the future , designed to be delivered 10 years later .

Finally , there 's the matter of Stacy 's abortion .
In the film , this sequence is refreshing in a number of ways :
It 's frank ( surprisingly so , for a sex comedy ) , it 's brief rather than being a wallow in miserablism or humiliation , and it's up - front both about the fact that abortion can be depressing , scary , and off - puttingly clinical , but that it does n't necessarily serve as a life - changing moral experience that makes people stop wanting sex .
In other words , it 's fairly realistic about the emotional impact and the experience itself .
Crowe 's original version is about the same–but with a lot more detail , both about the lead - up and the procedure .
In the film , Damone ( who got Stacy pregnant ) agrees to help pay for the abortion and to drive Stacy to the clinic , but he never shows up to drive her , seemingly embarrassed about the whole thing and uncomfortable with the cost .
In the book , they fight about the pregnancy .
( " You made me do it ! " he whines about the sex .
" You wanted it more than me ! " )
He stands her up .
She reschedules .
Damone stands her up again , paralyzed with panic and immaturity .
( " All he wanted to do was go away , forget about this problem .
Why would n't it just go away ?
Why did it fall on him ?
She 'd had just as much fun as he ; it was her responsibility , too .
Things like this were n't supposed to happen when you had The Attitude . " )
Finally , Stacy goes on her own , and Crowe dedicates a couple of careful pages to what an abortion is like , and how Stacy feels during and afterward .

Which is one of the few places where the book seems to have a clear agenda :
To let people vicariously experience something they might never endure in real life .
Take it as a warning , as an exercise in empathy for young sexually active males , or whatever else , Crowe is unflinching and rational about it , much as he is with the rest of the book .
He does n't judge , and he does n't editorialize .
It 's the one part of the book that 's probably better off without his intruding personal voice .
So .
Book , or Film ?
The film , as mentioned earlier , is faster , fleeter , and more fun , whether you 're looking for one - liners , early celebrity sightings , memorable music , or boobs .
For the film , Crowe cropped a lot of the rabbit trails and ephemera , and concentrated on a few strong , well - played characters and a couple of specific story arcs .
The book is like his primitive first draft of the story he built with the film , and it amounts to a mildly interesting curiosity at best .
But it does have some pretty funny stories .

No but im in my 30's and my half sister is in her early 20's and i have been gone for a long time with college out of state and then working out of state but anyways when no ones around shes very freindly and touchy with me .
Three times i had to get up and leave cause she was making me hard , usually by sitting next to me and brushing up against me or nonchanlantly putting her hand on my thigh while leaning over to look at something .
She always wears very sexy / revealing clothes too , like short shorts and a tube top .
One time she leaned over behind me and was brushing her breasts across my back with no bra on , i could feel her very erect nipples like two eraserheads brushing against my back .
I really tried not to get hard and was like ' oh god no in my head ' but i was so aroused i got incontrollably hard and at the same time i felt really embarressed and ashamed so i said i have to goto the bathroom and got up .
She looked right at my bulge but didnt say anything .
After that i noticed she glances at my crotch like shes seeing if i get hard or not and when i do i get up cause im scared she might think im some weirdo .
I havent touched her back or anything like that at all .
Previousely to these instances we have never messed around at all or even talked about sex or anything .
I dont know if shes being like girl friendly and thinks im a freak or if shes doing it on purpose .

A dog is seen through bars as it is herded to a metal container euphemistically called a " dream box , " where stray dogs are asphyxiated with carbon dioxide gas , at an animal welfare center in Tokushima , Japan on March 11 , 2010 .
In Japan a canine that ends up in the municipal pound is far more likely to be put down than to find a new home .
While in some other industrialized countries the idea of " saving " a pet from a shelter is well - established , in Japan animal welfare activists say strays often fall foul of an attitude that prizes puppies and pedigrees as status symbols .

Warner Bros .
Pictures has released the new trailer for the R- rated sci- fi thriller Splice , opening in theaters on June 4 .
Directed by Vincenzo Natali , the movie stars Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley .
In the film , Clive and Elsa are superstars of the genetic engineering world .
They specialize in splicing together DNA from different animals to create fantastical new hybrids .
The charismatic couple wants to use human DNA in a new hybrid  something that could yield astronomical medical benefits .
The pharmaceutical company that funds their research , however , is more interested in exploiting their earlier triumphs for easier , short - term profit .
Clive and Elsa secretly conduct their own experiment .
The result is Dren : an amazing creature who exhibits an array of unexpected developments , both physical and intellectual .
Dren exceeds their wildest dreams … and , ultimately , their most terrifying nightmare .
Last month Democrats on the Senate banking committee passed a reasonably tough financial regulatory reform bill .
Now Republican leaders have suddenly begun lashing out against it .
Did they belatedly discover some problem ?
No .
They suddenly realized that their bet that reform would be watered down as it moved along might not pan out .
Their battle cry of “ no more bailouts ” is disingenuous .
They are not worried that reform will make bankers ’ lives too easy , they are worried that it will make them too hard .
The Republicans started loudly objecting only after Senator Blanche Lincoln , an Arkansas Democrat who is chairwoman of the agriculture committee , took an unexpectedly strong stand in favor of reining in financial derivatives , the complex and largely unregulated instruments that were at the heart of the financial crisis .
( Her committee has jurisdiction , because derivatives have long been used to trade commodities . )
Today Rosenberg releases yet another piece that scratches the veneer off the government " data " and finds that the less presentable truth is always beyond just skin deep .
First , on the government 's " centrallized " intervention in the economy :
We have reached a point where government transfer payments are up more than 12 % in an otherwise flat retail inflation environment , and they now represent about 20 % of the overall personal income pie .
What the government doles out today in the form of “ income ” supplements is equivalent to the total income the private sector generates in terms of rental income , partnership income and goods - producing wage income all combined .
The only market that seems even remotely concerned with all the fiscal largesse may be the Treasury market , but we are told by the experts that such an environment of government - led economic activity is fertile ground for high - risk high - beta investment strategies .
( Though we should add that at the same time the state and local governments are doing everything they can to absorb income out of the private sector to plug their huge fiscal gaps — see Taxes on Hotel Rooms are Rising on the front page of the USA Today . )
Liquidity continues flowing the wrong way :
Liquidity conditions are actually becoming less pro-cyclical as U.S. M1 money supply contracted $ 10 billion in the last reporting week — down now for four weeks running — and MZM shrank $ 50 billion and is down now in four of the past five weeks .
In fact , MZM is now contracting at a 1.0 % YoY rate , which last happened just ahead of the Fed ’s easing cycle in the summer of 1995 .
This should actually be very bullish for the fixed - income market .
A record number of personal bankruptcies in March as nobody feels like paying off their mortgage anymore .
Why should they - moral hazard is now in the constitution .
There were over 158,000 bankruptcy filings in the personal sector in the U.S. ( that ’s 6,900 per day ! ) which was a 35 % surge over February ’s result and up 19 % from last year ’s elevated levels .
This also shows the extent to which fewer people are attempting to save their homes .
They realized that their mortgage payments are not affordable and their attitudes towards residential real estate as a viable retirement asset have been altered permanently as many now see their house as nothing more than a debt - laden ball and chain .
On the transition from employment contraction to wage deflation , and a finer read of NFP :
Here we are fully 28 months past the point of the onset of the Great Recession and ostensibly nine months after the bottom in real GDP , and it seems safe to say that the economy is out of job - shedding mode .
The steady downdraft in jobless claims and layoff announcements would attest to that view .
Then again , after a record 8.4 million decline in payrolls from the cycle peak , bringing employment down to levels prevailing a decade ago in a cycle of job destruction not seen since the 1930s , inertia alone would have ensured that a bottom has been reached .
After all , the level of payrolls was not going to decline forever .
So while it may be encouraging to see employment , especially in the business sector , finally begin to rise after such a lengthy and precipitous decline , the labour market still remains in the grips of a serious deflationary undertow .
Indeed , the most disturbing aspect of the jobs report was the 0.1 % MoM decline in average hourly earnings — to see a contraction in wages in any given month is practically a 1 - in - 100 event and the last time it happened in April 2003 , Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke were busy building a ‘ firebreak ’ around deflation .
The year - over - year wage trend has been sliced to 2.1 % from 2.5 % three months ago when employment hit rock bottom , not to mention the 3.5 % pace a year ago .
As long as excess supply dominates in the jobs market , expect the downward trend in wages to persist .
So despite the positive headline print on payrolls , do n’t think for a second that the Fed is not aware of or sensitive to the deflationary pressures that continue to build in the labour market .
Against this backdrop , any premature tightening by the central bank or a sustained backup in bond yields is simply out of the question .
In a nutshell , as one chapter of the labour market downturn is closed ( employment contraction ) , another one starts ( wage deflation ) .
March ’s employment data , on the surface , may well have met the challenge served up by the consensus of economists , but it fell well short of addressing the massive amount of excess slack that still exists in the labour market .
Not only did the headline unemployment rate not budge , at 9.7 % , but the broader U6 measure actually rose for the second month in a row , to 16.9 % ( the highest it ever reached in the prior recession / jobless recovery in 2003 was 10.4 % , just to show what we are up against this time around ) .
So long as we have this much spare capacity in the labour market — with nearly one in every six unemployed Americans vying for every job opening — deflation pressures can be expected to build .
Finally , the ranks of the unemployed who have been looking for work for at least six months soared 414 k in March , or nearly 7 % , to 6.5 million .
This is double from 3.2 million this time last year when equity investors believed the world was coming to an end .
Of course , the world did not end for the equity investor who was bailed out by massive government incursion , but the world for the long - term unemployed has tragically become even darker ( the gap between Wall Street and Main Street has scarcely been as wide as it is today ) .
Long - term unemployment as a share of the total jobless pool now stands at a record 44 % versus 26 % and the last time the official unemployment rate was as high as is today was back in the early 1980s .
There are three main reasons for this :
The first has to do with the lack of mobility in a distressed national real estate market .
The second reflects the permanent job loss that permeated this recession because the jobs in bubble sectors like construction and finance are simply not going to be coming back any time soon .
Thirdly , large states such as California , Florida , Illinois and New York could always be relied upon in the past to be significant drivers of employment opportunities but they are just too cash - strapped today to play any role at all .
Finally , there are many factors related to the tragedy of rising long - term unemployment that lead us to the conclusion that deflation will prove inevitable , because the longer it takes to find a job — the average duration of unemployment just hit a fresh all - time high of 31.2 weeks from 29.7 in February — the more likely it is that these people will be rehired at a lower wage than they were receiving before they were let go from their previous job .
Deconstructing someof the key facts , that Zero Hedge has also been keenly focusing on over the past month :
U.S. consumer spending in the first quarter is higher because the savings rate has slipped to 3.1 % from 4.7 % at the end of last year .
Organically , spending is actually doing quite poorly and that reflects the fact that wage - based incomes remain under pressure .
So , without that unsustainable decline in what is already a low personal savings rate , consumer spending in January would have actually contracted 0.4 % and 0.6 % in February .
In other words , what we are seeing unfold right now is a ‘ low quality ’ consumer recovery in the U.S. , not deserving of the P/E multiple expansion that the retailers have enjoyed in recent months .
A sector to clearly fade going forward is consumer discretionary .
On home prices , the seasonally adjusted data did indeed show an increase of 0.4 % MoM ( using the Case - Shiller Composite - 10 ) , but the raw data revealed a 0.2 % dip — the fourth decline in a row !
Now it would be one thing if January was an unusually weak seasonal month for home prices deserving of an upward skew from the adjustment factors ; however , from 1998 through to 2006 , they rose in each and every January and by an average of 0.6 % .
But what happened is that home prices collapsed in each of the past three Januarys — by an average of 1.8 % , or a 25 % annual rate .
And , seasonal factors typically weigh the experience of the prior three years disproportionately so what looks like steady gains in housing prices may be little more than a statistical mirage .
Consumer confidence ( Conference Board version ) rose to 52.5 in March and yet again this was treated gleefully on the Street and in the media because it beat the consensus estimate .
But here is the reality : in recessions , this confidence index averages out to be 71.0 , and in expansions , it averages 102.0 .
What does that tell you ?
The ISM index came out before the payroll numbers did and injected a big round of enthusiasm into the pro-cyclical camp .
The index did shoot up in March , to 59.6 from 56.5 , and while many of the components were up , the prime reason for the increase was the eight - point surge in the inventory component , to 55.3 .
Moreover , the orders - to - inventories ratio slid to a level suggesting that we could be in for a big pullback in the next few months .
Meanwhile , very little attention has been made to the construction spending data , which sagged 1.3 % MoM in February with broad - based declines across sectors — and January ’s 0.6 % drop was revised to - 1.4 % ( the fourth slippage in a row ) .
Stock buybacks are widely ( and erroneously ) viewed as being a major fund - flow driver of the equity market , and many a pundit points to the 37 % QoQ jump ( +98 % from the 2009 lows ) in buybacks as source of comfort .
But here ’s the rub :
The vast majority of companies are buying back their stock to avoid the dilutive effects of expiring stock options — of the 214 companies that did a buyback in Q4 , only 50 resulted in share count reductions ( see page B2 of the weekend WSJ ) .
Moreover , it really says something about the widespread excess capacity in the economy and poor perceived rates of return on new investments that companies would opt to deploy cash for buyback strategies at this presumed early stage of the business expansion .
If there is one trend that is indeed constructive — certainly for our income theme — it is that companies are beginning to pay out more of their retained earnings in the form of dividends — $ 5.1 billion in net dividend increases in Q1 , the most since 2007Q4 ( but still down 21 % from two years ago ) .
There seems to be this entrenched view now that the government can be expected to come in and resolve all the problems in the economy .
This view is deserving in some sense because not only did the Fed and the Treasury break the boundaries between the private and public economy this cycle to bail out the banks , auto sector and housing companies , but they have continued in these efforts despite a record $ 1.5 trillion deficit .
With no other goal , it would seem , than to allow the residential real estate market to clear at lower prices , the government now intends to permanently reduce the mortgage balance for all homeowners who are “ under water ” and unemployed homeowner mortgage borrowers are also going to be recipient of taxpayer assistance ( but not the renter ) .
The problem ahead is that the bond market may no longer be in a cooperating mood to finance all this largesse .
With the 10 - year yield now pressing against the 4 % threshold , we have a crucial week ahead for the Obama team ’s financing capacity as a further $ 82 billion of debt sales are being put to the market for added digestion .
Another source of concern for the bulls who continue to rely on government support for the recovery is the general population — the part of the public that took in a mortgage it could afford and never used the house as an ATM .
Resentment is starting to build as Uncle Sam is increasingly being viewed as Robin Hood at best , or the Artful Dodger at worst .
There were two great reads over the weekend pertaining to this theme of emerging class warfare — Tea Party Anger Reflects Mainstream Concerns on page A13 of the weekend WSJ and Help Paying Mortgages Elicits Anger on page B1 of the Saturday NYT .
While everyone is treating the nonfarm payroll report as gospel , let ’s keep in mind that the ADP count showed that private payrolls fell 23 k , completely at odds with the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , which claims that this metric was up 123k .
Now , we are not going to dismiss the BLS data at all , but would n’t it be nicer if both surveys said the same thing ?
The ADP is a pretty simple concept — and does not have any “ plug ” factors to try and assume how many new businesses were created or destroyed in any given month .
Meanwhile , wages are now deflating and the 0.1 % decline in March could be the thin edge of the wedge as the Gallup Daily tracking finds that 20.3 % of the U.S. workforce was underemployed in March — a slight uptick from January and February .

A language acquisition study published in the journal Cognition in 2008 suggests that listening to and singing along with music may play an important role in learning a language .
Reported by Cognitive Daily , the study supports that singing in a foreign language can help a student learn that language faster .
The concept is n’t unusual .
Over the years , several friends have told me they practiced their French listening to Serge Gainsbourg , their Spanish listening to Cafe Tacuba , their Mandarin listening to Carsick Cars , and so forth .
You can test the study ’s findings with the 10 Foreign Language Cover Songs we compiled here .

Now With More Speed
Over lunch today , I did some benchmarking with Linpack on my own Nexus One , using a stock Android 2.1 build , and the Nexus One provided by Adobe .
It was astonishing to see the difference in MFLOPS ( Millions of FLOating - Point operations per Second ) , essentially a high - precision mathematics sequencing instruction set that tests how quickly a CPU can run a known number of calculations .
Since Linpack themselves publish a benchmark Top 10 for Android devices , I ’m not disclosing anything that has n’t already been publicly confirmed by others .
Dare to Compare
The stock Nexus One with Android 2.1 averages in the high 6.9 to low 7.0 range for MFLOPS , but the Nexus One running the Debug release of Android 2.2 ( aka FroYo , “ frozen yogurt ” ) can apparently achieve a score of up to 40 MFLOPS .
My own testing confirms it at a high - 36 to mid-37 range :
How it ’s Done
Google has already confirmed that a new JIT ( just - in - time ) Java compiler will be in Android 2.2 , but I do n’t pretend to know how the Java virtual machine works or how JIT would improve it .
Rumor has it that Android 2.2 will be announced at Google IO next week , so hang tight !
As specified above , I do n’t know whether this is JIT in action .
I ca n’t confirm or deny that JIT is part of the Froyo release .
The Nexus One provided to my employer has a developer release of Froyo on it , but I ’m not allowed to disclose the features of the OS – but if this stuff makes it into the official release WHOA BABY .
Google announced at Google IO that Froyo does indeed have the new Just - In - Time compiler .

Bill Totten sent me a very interesting article from David DeGraw published on Alternet , The Economic Elite Have Engineered an Extraordinary Coup , Threatening the Very Existence of the Middle Class :
David DeGraw followed up with another article , The Richest 1 % Have Captured America 's Wealth -- What 's It Going to Take to Get It Back ? :
I realize many of you will dismiss Mr. DeGraw 's writings as socialist banter , but I will add that as far as I am concerned , the real master coup revolves around pensions and mutual funds .
Many people have no clue where their pensions are being invested , who is profiting off the misfortune of others and what a racket mutual funds are charging exorbitant fees for mediocre results .
There is a financial coup going on right now across the world and while it may have started in the United States , the debt disease is spreading across the globe at the speed of light .
Where and how will this all end ?
Can capitalism survive if wealth is increasingly being concentrated in the hands of an economic elite that shows no sense of civic and moral duty to the societies they inhabit ?
Karl Marx may be dead and his theories debunked , but I have a sick feeling in my gut that down the road , his dire prediction that capitalism is destined to self - destruct will ultimately be proven right .

It has just been released by Thai authorities that customs officers at Bangkok ’s Suvarnabhumi Airport seized almost 1.4 tonnes of elephant ivory tusks , officials in Thailand announced yesterday .
Acting on a tip - off , Customs officers discovered 296 African Elephant tusks weighing a combined total of 1,390 kg inside three crates on board flight from Qatar .
The cargo was labeled as “ printing metal ” and addressed to a Thai company based in Bangkok .
This is the latest in a series of large scale ivory seizures involving Thailand and ivory illegally transported from Africa via the Middle East : in February , Customs officials at Suvarnabhumi seized 239 African Elephant tusks weighing an estimated two tonnes , reported to be the country ’s biggest ever ivory seizure .
The ivory was said to have arrived on an Emirates flight from Dubai where it arrived from Nairobi , and was apparently destined for Lao PDR .
Earlier , in August 2009 , officials at the airport were reported to have seized 316 pieces of ivory weighing 2 tonnes in a shipment from Uganda and Kenya .

Forces on the Marshal Shaposhnikov freed the captured tanker Russian forces have freed the crew of a Russian oil tanker seized by Somali pirates off the coast of Yemen , in a dramatic rescue operation .
Forces based on the warship Marshal Shaposhnikov approached the tanker with 23 Russian crew on board .
The Russian forces then boarded the Moscow University tanker , freeing the crew who had locked themselves in a safe room after disabling their ship .
As they did so , the pirates opened fire , sparking a shoot - out .
Before boarding the tanker , the Russian forces carried out reconnaissance from a helicopter , RIA - Novosti reports .
Ten pirates have been arrested , and one was killed during the gun battle .
They are being held aboard the tanker , Russian defence ministry spokesman Col Alexei Kuznetsov said .
They will be transferred to Moscow to face charges .
" Pirates have released the tanker ...
All crew on board the tanker are alive and well , " a spokeswoman for the Russian shipping company that owns the tanker , Novoship , told Reuters news agency .
Novoship praised the operation as one carried out " in the best traditions of the Russian naval mariners " .
The decision to free the ship was made knowing " that the crew was under safe cover inaccessible to the pirates " , Novoship added .
ANALYSIS Richard Galpin
BBC News , Moscow
Navy officials involved in the international operation to protect commercial shipping off the Horn of Africa say there has been a huge increase in the number of attacks by pirates so far this year - and this despite the presence of up to 40 warships in the area from the European Union , Nato , Russia and India .
So now the foreign navies are becoming more aggressive .
According to Cdr John Harbour , the main spokesman for the EU Navy Force , one new tactic is to lie in wait near the pirates ' main bases and take them out when they set sail on a hijacking mission .
Also this year , there have been three incidents when foreign forces have managed to board hijacked boats and capture the pirates .
But this can only be done if all the crew have managed to lock themselves in a secure room on board the ship and have contacted the nearest navy forces to say they are safe - exactly what happened in Thursday 's incident .
Although there are dozens of warships patrolling the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden , it is rare for rescue efforts to be launched once pirates have boarded a vessel as it is often felt that intervening would endanger the hostages , says the BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi .
But in this case , the crew switched off the engine and locked themselves in a strong room with a reinforced door .
It also helped that the warship was less than a day away , says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
So while the idea of having a secure room in all commercial ships sailing the route near Somalia is a good one , it can only work in very specific circumstances , he says .
The Moscow University was seized on Wednesday in the Gulf of Aden , off the coast of Yemen , as it sailed for China , carrying more than 80,000 tonnes of crude oil worth some $ 50 m ( £ 33 m ) .
The Gulf of Aden is one of the world busiest shipping routes , and the Russians , Europeans and Americans have all deployed navy forces in the region after a growing number of attacks by pirates on commercial vessels , our correspondent adds .
Even so , pirates are reported to be holding more than 20 foreign ships with almost 400 sailors .
The Marshal Shaposhnikov was sent on Wednesday to rescue the hijacked tanker .

Yours Is Not a God of Love
By TK Burton | Film | June 18 , 2010 |
8 : The Mormon Proposition is a stirring , tragically depressing documentary about the Mormon Church ’s massive efforts to support and pass California ’s Proposition 8 ballot initiative ( also called the California Marriage Protection Act ) , which in 2008 redefined marriage in the state of California as being only between a man and a woman , effectively making marriage between same - sex couples illegal and unrecognized .
Depending on which side of the debate you stand on , you will find it either silly and pointless , or obscenely infuriating and find yourself filled with a sense of righteous fury .
I found myself in the latter category .
If you ’re looking for an impartial review , I confess that you wo n’t find it here .
It ’s an unbelievably in - depth film , covering the history of the Mormon church , a good bit of their philosophies and ideologies , and then their concentrated efforts to pass anti-marriage laws in both Hawaii and California .
The film comes at the topic from several angles — from that of Spencer and Tyler , a sweet and sympathetic couple who both come from Mormon backgrounds who live in San Francisco ; from Fred Karger , a reporter and political activist who does the bulk of the investigative journalism thanks to an anonymous source within the church ; and from numerous fascinating interviews with current and former Mormon church members , politicians ( including the current and former mayors of San Francisco ) , community leaders and other gay citizens and activists .
It ’s an engrossing , sometimes over - the - top and slightly propagandist film that achieves two unfortunate goals — it creates a sense of anger and frustration and ultimately sadness , and it gives an unprecedented look deep inside the Machiavellian undertakings of the church to force their beliefs into the lives of innocent , loving couples .
The story of Spencer and Tyler is particularly tragic , though no more so than the hundreds of other couples who woke up that morning in 2008 to find out that their marriage was no longer recognized .
The film starts with interviews of them , footage of their marriage at City Hall , and then slowly creeps towards the tragically inevitable realization that Prop 8 is going to pass .
Their devastation is palpable and gut - wrenching , as they sobbingly watch protests by Prop 8 supporters who hurl the vilest of epithets at them and then have to deal with the aftermath of the bill ’s passing and the hideous gloating that came with it .
They ’re supported by Tyler ’s adoring mother , but much of the rest of their family has abandoned them .
I ’m not the cry - at - the - movies type , but I admit that their story left my eyes a little shinier than usual .
Meanwhile , Karger vigorously investigates the church ’s efforts to promote Prop 8 .
From creating and funding what are essentially PAC ’s and ambiguously named organizations that do n’t have plainly apparent links to the church , to organizing protests , to cajoling , persuading , and sometimes outright bullying parishioners to donating to the cause , they became a juggernaut of self - righteousness and bigotry , raising literally millions of dollars and mobilizing tremendous numbers nationwide , both Mormon and not , to rally for their cause .
It ’s all supported by documents , emails , and transcripts that Karger obtained , all showing the insidious , devious , and in many ways ingenious methodologies devised and used to achieve their goal .
Adding additional weight and support to Karger ’s claims are the interviews with former church members who explain the hard - fisted ways that they were pressured into helping , even when such help was beyond their means .
Coupled with this , Karger and directors Reed Cowan and Steven Greenstreet use much of the readily available marketing materials that the church created — fliers , videos , etc. , all talking about how somehow gay marriage will affect the rights of regular people to free speech , free assembly , and will ultimately endanger their rights and beliefs .
Much of it was crazed exaggeration .
Much of it was just outright fucking lies .
Finally , the aftermath of the bill ’s passing is shown , as well as statistics and demonstrations of what can only be described as a holy war on homosexuality and gay rights .
Statistics and interviews about the staggering rate of suicide , drug abuse , homelessness , and prostitution among young gays , and particularly among young gays in Utah , all speak to the sad consequences of their endeavors .
In the end , of course , films like 8 : The Mormon Proposition would hopefully change people ’s minds by giving them a chance to see the effects of Prop 8 and the innocent lives left ruined in its wake .
For those like me , it was preaching to the choir , so to speak .
Because ( and excuse me while I toss any semblance of impartiality out the goddamn window ) , Proposition 8 and this film have taught me , or rather reinforced my belief that Proposition 8 was a well - funded , well - coordinated , brilliantly organized and masterminded effort to destroy human happiness and create suffering out of its ashes .
There is simply no other way for me to see it .
No amount of explanation or justification or proselytizing can convince me otherwise .
To try to justify it by saying it ’s God ’s will , or that gay marriage somehow threatens or weakens or makes illegitimate or less important your marriage is so baffling and idiotic that it makes me grind my teeth down to the roots .
I can’t imagine how I would feel if I woke up tomorrow morning to find out that through nothing but ignorance and bigotry and someone else ’s beliefs , that my marriage to my wife somehow no longer was the equal of others .
To take away the right to marry is not only hideously unfair , but also mindlessly and brutally cruel .
It mystifies me that people can maintain that their beliefs are ones generated out of love when they ’ve made a conscious decision to not only cast their vote , but to give their time and money to try to persuade others to cast their vote for a ballot initiative that serves no practical purpose other than to create misery and to take away the from people what could be the happiest moment in their life .
It is one of the few times in modern American history that people have voted to remove people ’s rights .
It is prejudiced , viciously hateful , and unconscionable , brought upon us by a venal small - mindedness and a refusal to understand or recognize people ’s humanity .
[ Deep breath ]
Pardon me .
Things got away from me there .
In any event , the sad truth is that Proposition 8 passed , and now there are people left in its wake trying to figure out what to do next .
But of equal importance is to understand how and why that happened , to know and understand the gathering of ideas and minds that put a cleverly orchestrated plan into effect that led us to this place .
8 : The Mormon Proposition is a heartbreaking film that exposes some very real and frightening truths , but also helps people come to grips with those realities , and teaches them to dust themselves off and get back in the fight .
8 : The Mormon Proposition will be released in theaters and on IFC On - Demand in June 2010 .

The Rise Of Capy Games
By Christian Nutt
Capy Games slipped into the consciousness of hardcore gamers with the PlayStation Network release of its puzzle game Critter Crunch .
Originally a mobile title , the game burst with color , personality , and humor .
The Toronto , Canada based studio , co-founded by president Nathan Vella and creative director Kris Piotrowski then released its first packaged game , Might & Magic : Clash of Heroes , for the Nintendo DS .
Both games were critical successes , with Critter Crunch currently resting at 87 on Metacritic , and Clash of Heroes at 86 .
Here , Vella and Piotrowski discuss the evolution of the studio from an unknown mobile game developer to an indie with fans , how they pick , choose , and pursue projects , what the support of the Toronto indie scene means to them -- while touching on issues such as pricing , the benefits of polish , and why working on multiple game projects at once is essential for inspiration .
You guys recently announced you 're doing your Might & Magic : Clash of Heroes or Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network .
Nathan Vella :
We had finally got the game finished on DS .
We were waiting for it to come out .
We were always thinking about -- after we figured out the core battle concept in the game itself , once we started liking it , we were like , " Okay , well , we 're already doing Critter Crunch on PlayStation Network . "
We really like the fan base in general .
The people who play digital download games , I think in general , are a very cool subsection of the video game - buying public .
So it made a lot of sense to us .
Ubisoft was really receptive of it .
We 'd been talking back and forth about it , and they were just as gung - ho about it as we were , which was really nice .
We did n't have to fight to make it happen ; it was actually a really cool process .
So we actually got to start on it before Clash even came out [ on DS ] .
It 's something that we had to do , you know ?
The idea of having someone else make Clash of Heroes on XBLA and PSN -- take our idea , and go somewhere else with it , and run the risk of it being a shitty XBLA and PSN port ...
Because I think there are a bunch of shitty XBLA and PSN ports .
Kris Piotrowski : Yeah .
The trend tends to be that people kind of quickly upscale and get the game out there .
We wanted to give it the Critter Crunch treatment , which is it 's not an upscale ; it 's completely , from top - to - bottom , brand new art , brand new music , and all that kind of stuff .
That 's something that I do n't think we could ever trust anybody else to do .
( Laughs )
NV : Fuck no .
We had that experience on Critter Crunch : taking cute pixel art with personality and then bringing it up from like teeny - tiny screen to huge HD ...
KP : It 's not just blurry pixel art .
Critter Crunch
You did such a good job .
The art in the PSN version is beautiful .
NV : Thank you .
We 're a very visual - focused studio .
A lot of the guys just started to come from that background , and just , as a company , that 's what excites us .
So to do the same 2D , HD , hand - animated , fun - time Clash of Heroes version is exactly what was right to do .
KP : Yeah , and it's also something that we 're focusing on , too .
Right now , it 's one of the defining features of the studio -- this expertise in 2D HD stuff .
So this gives us kind of another opportunity to work out that muscle , and hopefully we can actually do some more awesome stuff after with even more of the sort of experience that we 're going to get from this project .
So it makes a lot of sense for us to do it that way , as well .
Before we started the formal interview , you said that Clash of Heroes for DS might be the only boxed product that you guys ever do .
Do you really believe that ?
NV : As a studio , we 've done the " make games for other people " thing .
The first three and a half years of Capy was making games for other people , aside from one or two projects , the entire time .
But the space that is the easiest to do the ideas we actually want to do , the ideas that we care about , are the digital spaces .
Small teams ; smaller budgets ; do n't need to necessarily go to a publisher -- that 's where it 's going to happen .
That 's why I think there 's a good chance that we wo n't have another retail game , because that space is so much more conducive to the types of projects that we love to make as a studio .
I 'd love to do another DS title ; we 've got great tech just sitting there , you know what I mean ?
But at the same time , the process of getting those retail games made is just so much different , and there 's so much extra work involved .
KP : And the benefits are n't always there .
You 're setting yourself up for something that 's significantly more difficult and stressful , and the rewards on almost all levels -- financial , creative , and everything else in between -- are usually not worth it , basically , especially when we 've had a taste of developing games for downloadable stuff , and you 're missing like 70 percent of the bullshit .
It 's just not there !
( Laughs )
Game development is stressful enough , anyway .
( Laughs )
NV : For sure .
The whole selling things in an actual box ...
It was such a big professional moment for us , because we all started the studio because we actually just really wanted to make games , and a big part of that is remembering our childhoods , and getting a Super Nintendo and plugging the cartridge in , and keeping the box , and putting it on our wall and that kind of stuff ; so having our first and maybe only retail game being on a Nintendo handheld ...
KP : Yeah .
That 's magical .
NV : It is .
It is .
We were probably more excited about that than people who played the game were excited about playing it .
The actual process of developing something like that , for us , was ...
Only two years ago , it was unfathomable .
It did n't make sense .
And now , to see a game wrapped in cellophane that has a manual that someone printed and see our little logo -- our teeny - tiny , itty - bitty little logo on the back of the box ...
Now , Critter Crunch came out on PSN .
How do you feel about its reception ?
What about sales ?
NV : The reception has been awesome .
It was better than we even thought .
We put the extra effort into Critter Crunch .
We could have put it out earlier , less polished , less finished , with less of the features that we had , and sales - wise it might not have affected it very much .
But I think that the people who played it and appreciated it appreciated the fact that we made it a tightly polished , complete package .
On the sales side , we all wish it was a giant smash super - hit .
KP : Sure ; I 'd loooove to be rich .
NV : It has n't been selling phenomenal , but , compared to a lot of other puzzle games on PSN and XBLA , it 's doing all right ; we really can't complain at all .
People have been very supportive of the game on internet communities or the press sites or just teeny - tiny little forums or Twitter or whatever .
People have just been very vocal about their love for the game .
I hope that that 's kind of the pinnacle for developers ; I hope that that 's the main goal .
Sales byproduct is great ; it helps you keep going .
But if people are talking about the game and evangelizing the game and trying to get their friends to play it , I think that 's the best - case scenario for a project .
The fact that I think we got that is really , really cool .
I think everybody in the studio is super proud of that .
KP : And surprised , too , I think ; the reception on the critical end was beyond what we expected .
That 's done huge things for us in terms of helping us actually establish the studio as something that some people might actually care about -- like a " wonder what they 're making next " kind of thing .
There was a whole thing about someone hunting down this prototype for this game called Zombie Tactics that we were just working on the prototype for .
The fact that that 's something that someone would do now -- someone sleuthed the internet to try to find some extra cool stuff ...
Two years ago , there would be no reason whatsoever .
NV : Yeah , we 're so genuinely amazed that people care .
KP : And they care now because of Critter Crunch and Clash of Heroes .
Hopefully , down the line , that 'll actually matter more and more , so that 's cool .
What do you think about pricing ?
I know you guys particularly picked Critter Crunch 's price - point , and I think the last time I heard something about it was kind of closer to release .
Do you have any insight into it ?
Because it 's still a huge question , right ?
NV : It is , and it 's something that I do n't think that we even really know if it worked or if it did n't , necessarily .
The big thing for us was that Critter Crunch was a game that we really wanted to make as a studio , but it was also a game that we were very conscious of the fact that it 's the first thing that anybody will actually play that our studio has made .
We wanted to do everything we could to make sure that as many people as possible could play it .
Flower is a $ 10 game -- fuck , I 'd pay 20 bucks for that .
I 'd pay a full retail price for that game .
There are certain games on digital distribution platforms that are very worthy of that $ 10 , $ 15 price - point , and I do n't know if Critter Crunch provides the same experience that those games do .
KP : It 's a beautiful puzzle game ; it 's not ...
Let 's be honest .
It 's not Flower .
( Laughs )
NV : I think we were very conscious that there are levels of digital download games .
I used this in another interview , and I 'll use it again because I think it 's a good metaphor :
It 's like meal sizes .
There 's appetizer games that are like five dollars .
Noby Noby
Boy is , I think , a great appetizer .
You play it for awhile , and you 're immersed ; but when you 're done you want to play something else .
And there 's the meal games that are like $ 10 games : Flower and Castle Crashers and those type of games that you play for a sitting and then go do something else because you 've used up your game - playing time .
I think Critter Crunch and games like Shatter , as well , fall in between these two .
They 're not Flower - type experiences , but they 're not little itty - bitty things .
We were very conscious about trying to find that middle ground , and it 's good that we can do that on PSN .
It 's good that we can define a price - point -- that Capy can actually say , " Here 's how much our game costs . "
We talked to Sony a bunch about it , but , in the end , they just kind of said , " Your project .
You made it the way you want to make it ; you price it the way you want to price it . "
KP : Yeah .
We would have to have balls of steel to price the game at the level where Braid or Castle Crashers are , because it 's not that kind of game .
NV : It is n't .
It 's like a large appetizer .
If you 're not really hungry , you can eat that and you might leave some on the plate ; but if you 're starving , you might want a little bit more after .
It 's kind of in between .
KP : The next game 's going to be in the bigger category .
You mean Clash of Heroes , or you mean your next next game ?
NV and KP : Next next game .
( Laugh )
NV : Clash of Heroes , Ubisoft will define the price - point , and we 'll smile and nod because that 's their job and our job is to make it amazing .
But our next games ... like Sword and Sworcery on iPhone , we get a chance to do what we want to do with pricing there .
Heartbeat we 'll get a chance to price the way we want to .
Then , the next big project that we 're working on -- we 're going to be constantly making a bigger game , so we 'll definitely adjust and figure out that price - point as well .
The whole price - point thing is just kind of crazy .
It 's such an interesting part of the video game landscape that we exist in right now where small , independent studios get a chance to define the financial component of their own game .
Well , there was a little shockwave when Adam Saltzman did n't make Canabalt cost a dollar .
Like , " Oh !
You can do that ! "
It sounds funny to put it that way , but everyone seems to be really grasping at straws to find what the pattern is .
NV : Totally .
KP : Yeah .
I think it 's mostly about just being honest about what kind of game you 're making , but also I think it 's important to make sure you 're not devaluing games in general by saying , " Here 's my awesome game !
It 's going to be 99 cents ! "
That does no good for anybody .
NV : I think overall , pricing is something that comes out of understanding the type of project you 're making .
We do n't have to sit there and do sales forecasting and all this kind of crap .
We need to make sure that we make our money back -- hopefully ; cross fingers -- but we do n't have to be scientific about it .
We can just be honest about it .
How do you decide what projects to pursue ?
You have Heartbeat ; you have your " next next game , " which will be a big part of your efforts moving forward .
But how do you identify big versus small projects ?
How do you settle on them and make them go ?
KP : Actually , I think it 's a little bit of an organic process .
We sort of just go with the flow , and there 's constantly discussion about different games that we'd want to make .
We 're constantly talking about our next next next next next project .
There 's a big , long list at Capy of the games that we eventually want to make , and it's a combination of where the opportunities are coming from and also , I guess , what we just feel like we need to make .
Coming out of Clash of Heroes and Critter Crunch , we cautiously wanted to make two games that were not puzzle games because it 's kind of just ended up that way .
You do n't want to get pigeon - holed , or you just got bored ?
KP : Yeah , exactly ; we do n't want to be pigeon - holed into " That 's the puzzle game studio . "
So that was part of the motivation for Sword and Sworcery and Heartbeat -- but definitely not the full motivation for them .
It 's hard to pin down .
We get very excited about an idea ; we 'll just go with that .
NV : We 've had ideas that have come out of a meeting where we 're like , " Let 's pitch an idea " or " Let 's get together and talk about ideas , " but we 've also had ideas come out of having a few beers in a bar and somebody makes a joke and that joke turns into something we actually think could be cool .
Or we 'll be sitting there , riffing on an idea just for fun at midnight one night , and something will just pop out of Kris 's mouth and we 'll laugh at it .
I think a lot of ideas that we have come out , at least in some way or another , from our sense of humor , but I think the idea of being able to just have ideas coming constantly so that we do have that list and can say , " Yeah , that idea that we came up with six months ago does n't seem as appealing now ; but this one that we had three years ago or whatever -- what if we did this with it ? "
Just making sure that we always know that there 's always an open opportunity to pitch an idea for a game ...
It 's so easy to do when you 're small and comfortable , when that 's just the norm -- that 's the culture : to just have ideas .
KP : And a lot of it I think just comes from the kind of games that we actually want to play .
That 's a big thing , at least for me .
Clash of Heroes was one of those things where I wanted to play that game on DS ; that 's what I wanted to play .
That 's kind of where it came from .
Our next next game is kind of like , what do we want to play on PSN or XBLA ?
When you log on , what 's that one game that you 'd love to be playing right now ?
I really want to play the games that we pursue .
You said , " it 's easy when you 're small . "
How small is small ?
NV : We 're 25 ; we 're not really small small .
But I think we 're 25 because Clash of Heroes is on two platforms .
Even when we 're at 25 , we 're still small , and we still operate as a small studio .
KP : We 're big by indie standards , for sure ; we 're not big by game studio standards .
But within Capy , though , there 's a bunch of teams that are working on different things at the same time .
We generally do maybe three to four projects at once .
NV : One of them is larger , and then we 're always like , we 'd love to do that .
Like Kris was talking about , kind of rolling off Critter Crunch and Clash of Heroes , we 'd like these larger - scale projects , but we also need to ...
KP : Cleanse the palate .
NV : Yeah .
Flex the creative muscle .
Also , I think it 's an advantage that we have in a way that we can kind of do these longer games combined with these two smaller games so that there 's just constantly something percolating .
KP : Yeah .
It 's good not to have the entire studio locked into one project for two years because that can really drain .
Even if you 're on a big project and there 's a little project happening beside you , it keeps things fresh and good .
NV : I totally think so ; I totally think that , even just seeing it happen , the motivation that 's come out of Craig 's pixels and Jim 's music for Sword and Sworcery , on other projects , or just listening in when Kris and Kenneth and Andrew are working on Heartbeat and the music 's blaring and people are talking about it -- even though I 'm not even working on that project , I 'm still inspired by it , and I take stuff away from it .
It 's been really cool , and I can't wait to do more of that in the future .
Superbrothers : Sword and Sworcery EP
What happened to the " bara " in Capybara ?
NV : It 's still there !
It still exists .
So we went through this whole process , and the studio got named , and blah , blah , blah .
It ended up being Capybara , and we stuck with it .
But we found whenever we were talking to people about it , they either did n't get it or could n't pronounce it .
KP : It 's a tough word .
And always internally , almost from day one , we always called the studio " Capy " .
We ended up just going , " Fuck it .
The ' bara ' is hard to say . "
NV : It was kind of an important thing for us , too , because we had gone through all this mobile stuff as Capybara Games , with this different logo that nobody really loved , but we just kind of had .
The current logo , and the " Capy " , came out of us saying , " That part of the studio is over .
Now , we need a quirky logo , a logo that we all genuinely love and really we feel actually represents what the studio is . "
Then the whole " Capy " part was like , that 's how we talk about ourselves .
We see ourselves as that .
KP : It was like Capybara 2.0 .
Like , " Okay , guys .
We 're releasing Critter Crunch on PSN , and we 're releasing Clash of Heroes .
It 's a new era . "
NV : We 're gonna do collaborations with Superbrothers and Jim Guthrie .
We 're gonna make two - person games for WiiWare .
The studio was something that we did n't want it to be , and we actively changed it .
KP : Yeah , it was a pretty strong course correction .
( Makes creaking sound effect )
Not that way ; this way .
NV : And I think a lot of that came out of seeing local Toronto people like Metanet , when Mare and Raigan did N+ , seeing Jon Mak .
Being friends with them ; having them set this really crazy bar .
We almost felt like , personally , like we 'll always be friends with those guys -- they 're fantastic people -- but , professionally , having people that are our friends making stuff like that was inspiring .
It was like , these guys have proven that what we wish we could do you can actually do , and in most cases it 's actually creatively , financially , professionally better .
KP : Yeah .
I 'd say definitely those guys are a huge motivating factor for us .
You can't hang out with your peers when you 're making crappy mobile games and they 're making Everyday Shooter .
But now you can hang with them !
KP : Now we can hang with them .
( Laughs )
NV : It was never a deal with them ; they did n't care at all .
KP : But for us , internally , it was like , ugh .
They 're doing such amazing crap , and we 're doing crap crap .
NV : It 's just nice to always be with people who take pride in their work .
KP : Yeah , and make awesome stuff .

In case you were wondering , the answer is " yes " , it is very possible to make money online .
However , you have to separate the good from the bad .
This is easier said than done .
Unfortunately , the Internet is inundated with " get rich quick " schemes falsely promising online riches within a matter of months , if not days .
These schemes strive by taking advantage of the naivety of people who are generally new to the make money at home sector .
The majority people getting started with a dream to make money online most likely do not understand what it takes .
Most of the time they have a good grasp on the Internet , and they fact that the world lives in their computer .
More likely than not , they deduce that since the Internet is so vast , they can simply receive a website from some get rich scheme , after paying a fee , and have others do the same after visiting the website they just received .
Sadly enough , thousands of people are taken by " get rich quick " schemes daily .
They come across an advertisement which alleges that they can make twenty to thirty thousand dollars within their first month with the scheme , ask a few questions , get a few answers , and hand over their hard earned money .
However , what they should be asking themselves is if it were this easy to make money at home , why are people trying so hard to show you how to do it , rather than just focusing on doing it themselves ?
It is because naive people on the Internet comprise their cash cow .
One of the best ways to understand why " get rich quick " schemes do not work is by comparing an online startup business to a traditional offline startup business .
First and foremost , the goal of any business is to keep the startup costs to a minimum .
The lower your startup costs , the more quickly the business becomes profitable .
Hence , the offline business is likely to be started in a garage , a spare room , or a basement .
This can be compared to an online business registering a domain name , and obtaining a website plus hosting plan .
Thereafter , you have to find something of value to sell with your offline business .
Something of value can either be a product , or it can be a service .
Similarly , online businesses need something of value which can be sold to the public in exchange for money .
Thus , if the only way to make money online with a " get rich quick " scheme is to recruit other members to join and pay a fee , such payment is not in exchange for a product or service .
Hence , such a scheme is not a business in any definition of the term " business " .
Now that you have determined what is and is not a business , and have your product or service to offer , how do you get customers ?
In both businesses , online and offline , you will need to do some advertising so that people become aware of your business .
With an online business , you will specifically need to promote your website so that others will know that your business is out there .
As an offline business begins to take off , there is a need to bring in other resources to assist with the additional business .
One may also outgrow their garage or basement , or simply require space with better accessibility for more people .
Similarly , an online business will also require more resources as it grows .
More often than not , the needs of an online business are " digital " as opposed to the " physical " needs of an offline business .
For example , as an online business grows , you may need to upgrade your website hosting plan to allow a greater bandwidth so that you can accommodate an increased volume of visitors to your website .
The main goal of this compare and contrast is to show you that a business , by virtue of simply being online , does not make it any more likely that you will be put in a position to make money at home in the $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 range per month within your first month , six months , or even year .
Yes , there is the odd exception to the rule .
However , these are very few and very far between .
If anyone tells you something to the contrary , subject them to the aforementioned compare and contrast exercise .
I am quite certain that they will fail to be recognized as a business .
While it is possible to make money online in the tens of thousands per month , it is highly improbable that this will happen without something of value being sold , and a business being built over time .
