With the resistance to naked body scanners in airports building , the corporate media is now claiming that technology which allows fat TSA thugs sitting in back rooms to ogle your naked daughter actually “ enhances privacy ” .
In our Orwellian brave new world where down is the new up , University of Ottawa professor Mark Salter gushes over the virtual strip searches with a gusto that makes you wonder whether he’s on the same payroll as people like Michael Chertoff , who have been aggressively promoting the scanners they are invested in as a solution to the underwear bomber threat , no matter that such scanners would not even have stopped Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from boarding Flight 253 .
In his Globe and Mail article , Salter does n’t try to deny that the scanner produces a crisp image of your naked body , indeed , he ends his piece by asking , “ Will Canadians be willing to fly naked ? ”
“ Let me be controversial by saying the millimetre - wave scanner actually enhances privacy , ” Salter ludicrously claims , arguing that everything is kosher because the government has promised to keep the strip search anonymous and not store the details in a database – and you can really trust them – after all , governments never keep illegal databases of our information do they ?
They have n’t been caught doing exactly that on almost every front since 9/11 .
Salter is n’t really concerned about how a man with no passport who was on a terror watchlist and who was aided by a sharp - dressed man after his own father had warned U.S. intelligence that he was a threat was allowed to board a plane .
No , that pales into insignificance , what ’s really important is that brow - beaten Americans and Canadians , who are already treated like criminals and ordered around like prisoners by airport gestapo , are forced to undergo yet more humiliation by being routinely strip - searched , just as the Nazis did to the populations that they conquered during world war two .
Salter is also unperturbed by the fact that the body scanners fire ionizing radiation at the body which penetrates a few centimeters into the flesh and unzips DNA , increasing the risk of cancer and other life - threatening illnesses .
He is similarly unflustered at the fact that the body scanners violate laws against child pornography because they produce indecent images of children , meaning airports will become the primary peddlers of child porn .
Salter could n’t care less that top civil liberties groups in Canada have publicly attacked the scanners as a violation of human dignity .

Salter thinks that thugs in uniforms who have made getting into America a worse experience than entering East Berlin sitting alone in back rooms enjoying naked images of your children is a good thing , because apparently being alone in a private room while staring at people ’s genitals all day is sure to encourage nothing but the utmost professionalism , I ’m sure .
Since Salter ’s enthusiasm to see the invasion of the body scanners become a reality is so effusively boundless , he ’ll doubtless also welcome the next wave of tyranny being prepared for travelers – mandatory taser bracelets that allow officials to electric shock passengers on a whim , passive brain scanners that pick up brain waves in order to sense the behavior of travelers , as well as surveillance cameras on every seat providing a big brother babysitter for every potentially disobedient slave .
People like Salter and others in the establishment press who are pushing naked body scanners certainly know which side their bread is buttered on .
Since the corporate media is owned by the very military - industrial complex making a windfall from the orders for thousands of scanners now being made , as well as the shot in the arm for the fraudulent war on terror helpfully provided by the underwear bomber , it ’s unsurprising that we ’re seeing such ceaseless propaganda in favor of the scanners .
But an outraged hardcore of Americans , Canadians and people from around the world are standing up and saying enough is enough – with boycotts , lawsuits and mass protests in the pipeline as part of a growing resistance against the latest manifestation of the prison planet being constructed around free humanity .

India 643 for 6 dec ( Sehwag 165 , Laxman 143* , Dhoni 132* , Tendulkar 106 ) beat South Africa 296 ( Amla 114 , Petersen 100 , Zaheer 4- 90 , Harbhajan 3 - 64 ) and 289 ( Amla 127 * , Harbhajan 5 - 59 , Mishra 3 - 78 ) by an innings and 58 runs
Scorecard and ball - by - ball details
How they were out
Hawkeye
Harbhajan Singh 's five - for handed India a tense win AFP
They could n't out Hashim Amla at all .
So India , down to three bowlers and led by an exceptional Harbhajan Singh , found a way around him , leaving him stranded with nine mandatory balls to go and sealing a heart - stopping , series - levelling win that also meant they retained the top spot in the ICC rankings .
As was fitting , it was Harbhajan who brought about the final wicket with a slider to the left - hand batsman Morne Morkel , who had put together a 76 - minute last - wicket stand with Amla .
The final few steps did n't come easy for India : the last three wickets batted out 53.3 overs to set up a beautiful Test - match finish .
For eight hours and 19 minutes in this innings , which took to 23 hours and 22 minutes the total time he 's spent at the wicket for the series , Amla saw everything : offbreaks , topspinners , unintended doosras , big legbreaks , googlies , bouncers , full ones , a blow to the elbow , the bowlers ' joy , their frustration , and Harbhajan 's eruption on taking the last wicket .
At every stage - when he reached fifty or his hundred , when he was hurt , when he was concentrating , when he was defending , during those final few overs of counting each delivery down , and when he was walking back after one of the biggest disappointments he has experienced on a cricket field - the calm expression on his face was unchanged .
Amla batted like the Monk who did n't need to sell a Ferrari , and it took a special bowling effort to deny his side the series win .
Harbhajan answered India 's call with spin bowling aggressive and patient , smart and persistent , and came up with that wicket - taking delivery when it had deserted the other bowlers .
If Amla never looked like getting out , Harbhajan never looked like letting anyone settle .
India had 98 overs to get seven wickets but 52.2 of them were a write - off : they were bowled to Amla , and this man was not going to get out .
Not today .
They did well , though , to create enough pressure in the remaining overs - despite two dropped catches - to finish off the match with 16 minutes remaining in the day 's play .
India woke up to a bright and sunny day , but were thwarted in the first session by Amla and Ashwell Prince .
For about two hours , Amla kept killing their hopes , Prince kept raising them only to not edge to hand .
Finally , just when the draw started to become the favoured result , Harbhajan came back for his second spell of the day , from his favoured High Court End .
In the first spell , he had tried to get Prince lbw in a fashion similar to the one in the first innings , and failed .
In his second he went over the stumps and made it difficult for Prince to judge which deliveries to leave .
The leg line troubled Prince , and finally he jabbed at one outside off and lobbed it to mid-off .
Amit Mishra once again produced the special delivery out of nowhere , this time a googly to take out AB de Villiers in the penultimate over before the lunch break , the third time he had taken a wicket just before a break in the innings .
de Villiers ' was the big wicket because he was the one batsman capable of using his feet and hitting spinners off their length .
Hashim Amla stood between India and victory AFP
In the second spell , six overs each either side of lunch , Harbhajan looked menacing with almost every delivery .
After lunch , Harbhajan went on to suggest JP Duminy might become his new Ponting .
Offbreak , offbreak , slider .
Duminy caught in front again .
Dale Steyn did n't have a clue about deliveries spinning down the leg side , and kept getting beaten .
Harbhajan smartly moved round the stumps , and trapped him too .
Thereafter Amla found an able partner in Parnell , who looked much more assured than Steyn , and helped by a dropped catch by Suresh Raina at a wide fourth slip , played out 24.2 overs .
Amla manipulated the strike well : out of eight overs that Harbhajan bowled during that stand , Parnell got away by facing only 12 balls from the best bowler around .
A soft shot befitting a No. 9 arrived duly , after which Amla shielded Paul Harris for a while .
From facing four balls of each over , he gradually let Harris face three each , and by the time Harris generated enough confidence in Amla , a soft shot befitting a No. 10 came by .
Ishant got both the wickets , but 8.3 more overs had been negated .
That started the most exciting period of the match .
Morkel batted solidly along with Amla , they both judged the leaves well , they both defended with soft hands , they both frustrated India more with every passing delivery .
Towards the end , mind games began .
Amla took a single late in a Mishra over to face Harbhajan in the next over , Dhoni removed Harbhajan and tried the part - time stuff from Sachin Tendulkar and Sehwag , and got Harbhajan to bowl at Morkel again .
Nothing gave .
Amla seemed to have found a partner who was holding his nerve well .
The desperation on Indian faces kept getting more and more apparent with every passing delivery .
With 3.2 overs to go , Amla cut Tendulkar towards the boundary , took a single so as to face two more overs as opposed to one .
Sehwag hoped it would reach the boundary as he chased , but slyly tried to kick it over when he saw it stop inches before the rope .
Just to keep Morkel on strike .
That 's how much it mattered .
Amla duly played out the next over , Dhoni duly saved Harbhajan for the over after that .
Harbhajan had six more balls left , from the High Court End .
The first pitched middle , turned away .
The second pitched leg , and broke towards off .
The third was the killer slider , Morkel made his first mistake in 60 deliveries .
Harbhajan roared , Amla 's expression did n't change much .
With the historic U.S. House vote on Sunday night , the promise of universal health care first floated by Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 came a step closer to reality .
Some 31 million Americans — including about 6 million Texans — will get health coverage .
And health - insurance companies will have to behave , at least in some respects , like halfway decent corporate citizens .
It ’s a damn fine — if not quite great — moment in American history .
But the hatred that flared up among the anti-health care crowd over the heated final weekend of debate — whipped up in no small part by Texas Congressmen Louie Gohmert and Ted Poe — added a troubling undercurrent to what should be a celebration of democracy working , for once , to the benefit of millions of Americans and Texans who need and deserve help .
We do n’t yet know which Republican congressman hollered “ baby killer ! ” at pro-life Democratic Rep.
Bart Stupak as the health - care debate wound down — though the slur sounded just as Southern - accented as South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson ’s infamous “ You Lie ! ”
But one thing ’s for sure : Anti-health care forces showed their vicious , intolerant side for all to see .
With Poe , Gohmert and their ilk whipping the “ tea party ” mob outside the Capitol into a frenzy , House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - SC ) told reporters that the spitting , anti-gay and racial slurs reminded him of the civil rights demonstrations in the ’60s .
“ I heard people saying things that I have not heard since March 15 , 1960 , when I was marching to try and get off the back of the bus , ” he said .
( UPDATE : The congressman who shouted “ Baby Killer ! ” has been positively ID ’d .
Surprise : It ’s a Texan , Rep. Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock .
He ’s apologized , and says he was referring to the bill , not to Stupak . )
Gohmert was instrumental in firing up the mob on Saturday when he told the protesters to “ remember the Alamo ” and said that the only difference between that fight and the health care fight is that “ if we lose this battle millions of Americans are going to die . ”
Earlier in the week , Gohmert had set a tone for the proceedings by informing the crowd that “ demons ” has possessed the Capitol and lying that that the House bill would appropriate $ 700 million for abortions .
“ I brought an abortion to show you today , ” he said , brandishing a copy of the health care bill in his right hand .
The crowd responded with a chant of “ Abort the bill ! ”
Who says Texas is n’t sending any real leaders to Washington anymore ?
Poe was only a tad bit less incendiary , invoking poor old much - abused Thomas Paine : “ ’ Tyrrany , like hell , is not easily conquered , ’ ” he quoted .
“ Our choice is clear .
The American people do n’t desire more obtrusive government that takes away our personal liberty . ”
Clyburn had the single smartest analysis of what the opposition ’s fury boiled down to : “ A lot of us have been saying for a long time that much of this is not about health care at all .
And I think a lot of those people today demonstrated that this is not about health care … it is about trying to extend a basic fundamental right to people who are less powerful . ”
As Rep. Sheila Jackson - Lee of Texas noted , “ The bill will help those who cannot help themselves . ”
And that is a repulsive notion for folks like Poe , Gohmert and Sen.
John Cornyn , who has vowed to gum up the works in the Senate later this week with another round of procedural highjinks .
This whole vile display raises an interesting question about the 2010 mid-terms .
It ’s long been assumed that Republicans would benefit from Obamacare - bashing in November .
But now that the opposition has so vividly shown what it really opposes , is it too much to hope that might there be a bit of backlash against health - care haters in store as well ?
On Sunday night , soon after the bill ’s final passage , Texas GOP Chair Cathie Adams dispatched a press release decrying the expansion of health care .
“ Make no doubt about it , ” she prophesied , “ come November the people of Texas will come to the ballot box in droves to vote for Republican candidates who will listen to them and focus on creating an enviroment ( sic ) that promotes jobs in the Lone Star State — not a government takeover of their healthcare .
“ To those Obama - Reid - Pelosi Democrats in Texas , today we send a message : In November , Texans will remember . ”
After right - wing Republicans ’ revealing outburst of hatred and dishonesty , it might just be a good thing for Democrats if Texans and Americans remember what - all went down in Washington this weekend .
The United States plans to unveil a new $ 100 bill aimed at foiling counterfeiters .
The US Treasury Department says the design for the new note will be released in late April .
The $ 100 bill is the highest - value denomination in general circulation .
It is used in commerce worldwide and is a popular target for counterfeiters .
Since 2003 the US has issued a series of notes that incorporate new anti-counterfeiting features and for the first time , background colours other than green .
Apple is developing a new iPhone to debut this summer and also appears to be working on a model for U.S. mobile phone operator Verizon Wireless , say people briefed on the matter .
While Apple has unveiled a new iPhone every June or July since launching the product in 2007 , the new model with CDMA capability , the cellular technology used by Verizon , is notable because Apple and AT&T have long had an exclusive relationship with the iPhone .
That has given AT&T a competitive edge over other carriers including Verizon for the last three years .
The people briefed on the matter said one of the new iPhones is being manufactured by Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , which produced Apple 's previous iPhones .
The model that has CDMA capability , used by Verizon Wireless , is being manufactured by Pegatron Technology , the contract manufacturing subsidiary of Taiwan 's ASUSTeK Computer said these people .
One person familiar with the situation said Pegatron is scheduled to start mass producing the CDMA iPhones in September , but it was unclear when Apple might make the model available .
Spokespeople for Apple , Pegatron , Hon Hai and Verizon Wireless , which is majority owned by Verizon Communications declined to comment .

C'est plus fort que lui : quand on lui parle de ses échecs , Nicolas Sarkozy renvoie vers ceux de Barack Obama .
Interrogé , lundi dernier sur TF1 , sur sa méthode consistant à multiplier les réformes tous azimuts , il a répondu par une pique cinglante : " J'ai vu que M. Obama , pour lequel j'ai de l'estime et même de l'amitié , [ a tout misé sur sa réforme de la santé ] .
Je n'ai pas vu que ça rendait les choses plus simples . "
LES REMARQUES D'ALAIN MINC
Le président français n'en est pas à son coup d'essai .
Début novembre , il avait déjà énoncé cet argument devant quelques journalistes – mieux vaut faire beaucoup de réformes qu'une seule – , assorti d'un commentaire peu amène : " Obama est au pouvoir depuis un an et il a déjà perdu trois élections partielles .
Moi , j'ai gagné deux législatives et les européennes .
Qu'est - ce qu'on aurait dit si j'avais perdu ? "
Loin d'être anecdotique , la mauvaise humeur envers son homologue américain est devenue quasiment structurelle chez Nicolas Sarkozy .
" Chaque fois qu'il peut le critiquer , il le fait , que ce soit en Conseil des ministres ou devant des visiteurs " , indique , sous le couvert de l'anonymat , un bon connaisseur de la diplomatie française .
" Il n'arrive pas à avoir des rapports normaux avec Obama , ajoute cette source .
Il dit toujours : ' Si j'avais fait la même chose que lui , qu'est - ce qu'on m'aurait dit ? '
C'est une relation malsaine .
On a l'impression qu'il tire prétexte des difficultés d'Obama à chaque fois qu'il peut .
Son comportement est infantile , indigne d'un président . "
Sur le plan officiel , l'Elysée assure que la relation entre les deux hommes est excellente .
Mais le fond de la pensée sarkozyenne s'exprime sans doute mieux dans la bouche de conseillers informels , comme Alain Minc .
Depuis quelques semaines , ce dernier s'en prend systématiquement au président américain , qu'il décrit comme mou face aux Chinois et " sous l'influence " de Wall Street .
" Il est charmeur , conciliant , mais je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit un leader très ferme dans une crise " , déclarait - il le 27 décembre au Parisien .
Pourquoi tant de hargne ?
Les spécialistes situent l'origine du problème au voyage éclair de Barack Obama en France , en juin 2009 .
Lors de son séjour à Paris , il avait évité toute rencontre avec Nicolas Sarkozy , alors que ce dernier brûlait de s'afficher à ses côtés .
" Il avait fait dire clairement qu'il ne voulait pas de contact avec lui , rappelle l'observateur cité plus haut .
Ça n'est jamais arrivé dans toute l'histoire de la Ve République . "
BONNE ENTENTE
L'adulation de la gauche bobo pour Barack Obama , ou ses comparaisons désobligeantes entre son physique et celui du président français , n'ont rien fait pour arranger les choses .
Les déboires récents de l'hôte de la Maison - Blanche – défaite dans le Massachusetts , baisse de popularité – risquent de conforter Nicolas Sarkozy dans son attitude , lui qui pense avoir vu ses faiblesses plus tôt et mieux que les autres .
Cela n'empêche pas la France d'afficher sa bonne entente avec les Etats - Unis .
Le 19 janvier , Nicolas Sarkozy a salué " la mobilisation exceptionnelle du président Obama et de l'administration américaine " en faveur d'Haïti .
Le 27 janvier , à Davos , il s'est dit " d'accord avec le président Obama " concernant ses projets de mise au pas de la finance .
Enfin , le président français pourrait annoncer prochainement l'envoi de nouveaux soldats ( des " formateurs " ) en Afghanistan , une mesure réclamée de longue date par les Américains .

Everyone and their mother 's got video of dealer technicians applying the Toyota pedal recall fix ( CNN 's had it all week ) .
We 're not everyone .
Instead , here 's what dealer techs get : the Technical Service Bulletin Toyota does n't want you to see .
Advertisement
Below , we have the technical service bulletin ( TSB ) for the Toyota pedal recall as well as the technical instructions and work procedure below that .
It 's really nothing secret — it 's just the " how to " for dealer techs to install a reinforcement bar behind 2.23 million Toyota accelerator pedals so beige - mobiles wo n't accelerate against driver intention into walls , cars , people and park benches anytime the weather conditions are right .
You 'd expect Toyota PR would be willing to toss documents like that our way , right ?
Well , they were n't .
When we initially asked Toyota PR for these documents earlier this week they would n't send them to us .
Then , when we explained we'd be able to find them on our own sooner rather than later ( as NHTSA will provide them to other media later this morning ) , they still seemed unable to procure them for us .
Now we know the reason why .
Toyota 's trying to micro-manage every aspect of the media inquiries on this safety recall — including explaining to dealers they 're not allowed to talk to media without input from Toyota corporate — or give us documents like these .
From the TSB :
For News media inquiries only : Due to the nature of this Safety Campaign , it is imperative that all media contacts ( local and national ) receive a consistent message .
In this regard , all media contacts must be directed to Brian Lyons ( 310 ) 468-2552 , John Hanson ( 310 ) 468-4718 , in Corporate Communications .
( Please do not provide these numbers to customers or direct dealership associates to call ) .

So , remember Toyota techs , do n't give out these numbers that any consumer will be able to find on NHTSA 's home page later today to just anyone — just any media outlets from the local school paper all the way up to the New York Times , OK ?
As usual , we 're not about page views , so if you 're not interested in walking through the gallery below , click here to see all of the images in - line .

Bernard B. Kerik , a former New York police commissioner , pleaded guilty to eight felonies in a Federal District Court in White Plains on Thursday morning .
Mr. Kerik , who will be sentenced in February , faces 27 to 33 months in prison .
Wearing a blue suit and a red tie , Mr. Kerik , with a subdued expression , appeared in the packed courtroom and said , “ Guilty , your honor , ” as each of the charges were read by Judge Stephen C. Robinson .
Throughout the 90 - minute proceeding , Mr. Kerik ’s lawyer , Michael F. Bachner , rubbed the defendant ’s back in support .
Mr. Kerik , 54 , pleaded guilty to two counts of tax fraud , one count of making a false statement on a loan application — the most serious — and five separate counts of making false statements to the federal government .
These last charges stemmed from statements Mr. Kerik made to the White House during the vetting process after the Bush administration nominated him to lead the Department of Homeland Security .
He later withdrew his name .
The loan application charge could have resulted in a maximum of 30 years in prison .
As part of Mr. Kerik ’s plea deal , prosecutors requested far less time behind bars for Mr. Kerik , who had also been commissioner of the city ’s Correction Department .
One charge that had been expected , depriving the public of his honest services as a government official , was not addressed .
Judge Robinson asked Mr. Kerik a series questions to be sure he was aware of his rights .
Mr. Kerik , who was jailed in October , had been planning to fight the charges in court .
Sentencing was set for Feb. 18 . Mr. Bachner said he would ask that Mr. Kerik be freed on bail prior to that , and the judge said he would be receptive to such a request .
“ I think you had a very full life , ” Judge Robinson told Mr. Kerik , saying he would take the good with the bad as he mulled sentencing .
“ There is much good in that full life , I believe . ”
The case against Mr. Kerik centered on claims that a construction company suspected of having ties to organized crime paid for much of the renovation work at Mr. Kerik ’s home in Riverdale , in the Bronx , in the hope that he would help the company obtain a city license .
One of the tax charges is directly related to the renovation case .
From the title Can a Biologist Fix a Radio ? â€ ” or , What I Learned while Studying Apoptosis ( Y. Lazebnik 2004 ) would seem pretty off topic for LtU .
It starts with a humorous take on how biologist might try to understand the workings of a radio , but it ends in a plea for ( computer aided ) formal languages and quantitative modeling of biological systems .
The question is how to facilitate this change , which is not exactly welcomed by many experimental biologists , to put it mildly .
Learning computer programming was greatly facilitated by BASIC , a language that was not very useful to solve complex problems , but was very efficient in making one comfortable with using a computer language and demonstrating its analytical power .
Similarly , a simple language that experimental scientists can use to introduce themselves to formal descriptions of biological processes would be very helpful in overcoming a fear of long forgotten mathematical symbols .
Several such languages have been suggested but they are not quantitative , which limits their value .
Others are designed with modeling in mind but are too new to judge as to whether they are user friendly .
However , I hope that it is only a question of time before a user friendly and flexible formal language will be taught to biology students , as it is taught to engineers , as a basic requirement for their future studies .
My advice to experimental biologists is to be prepared .
Further , at a meta - level , the issues he raises seem to directly mirror the challenges software developers and researchers face in trying to understand and design complex computing systems .
If nothing else it 's good to know we 're not alone .
And it does n't hurt at all that it 's a fun read .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
If Dennis Hopper attends the dedication of his star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame Friday , it may be the last time his fans see the actor alive .
Hopper is dying of prostate cancer , according to documents filed in his divorce case this week .
Hopper 's acting career has spanned almost six decades .
In the '50s he had roles in several TV shows and films , including " Rebel Without a Cause " ( 1955 ) and " Giant " ( 1956 ) .
He became a Hollywood sensation for " Easy Rider , " the 1969 film he directed and co-wrote in which he played a dissolute , countercultural biker .
He was twice nominated for Oscars .
Hopper , 73 , is undergoing radical chemotherapy for advanced , metastasized prostate cancer , his doctor said .
He is too weak and ill to be questioned by lawyers in the divorce , but attending Friday 's ceremony " is a positive experience in every way , " his doctor 's sworn statement said .
Hopper 's lawyer has not confirmed if the actor will attend the ceremony in front of the Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard , but his doctor is recommending it .
" I believe the ceremony honoring his career may be something which he will actually enjoy in the company of his daughter , who he hopes will attend with him , " Dr. David Argus said .
Dennis and Victoria Hopper married 14 years ago and they have a 6 - year - old daughter , Galen .
They separated in January when he filed for divorce , claiming the stress of their relationship was threatening his life as he battled cancer .
" The presence of his estranged wife is hampering Mr. Hopper 's present cancer care as she introduces significant additional stress into his life , " Argus said .
" The less Mr. Hopper has to do with his estranged wife at this time , the more likely he is to have his life extended . "
Hopper 's lawyer , Joseph Mannis , argued that Victoria Hopper , knowing he was " extremely ill and fragile , repeatedly engaged in conduct which appears to have been calculated to subject [ Hopper ] to severe emotional distress . "
This distress " subjected [ Hopper ] to a significant risk of causing his premature death , " Mannis wrote .
The divorce case is set for an April 5 hearing in Los Angeles County Superior Court , but lawyers for Victoria Hopper are trying to force Dennis Hopper to take part in a deposition .
His lawyer and doctor told the judge it could kill him .
" Compelling Mr. Hopper to participate in a deposition where he is being asked questions he is compelled to respond to under oath regarding his wife and / or his daughter could actually threaten his ability to survive his current health crisis , " Argus wrote .
Hopper , who weighs " a little over 100 pounds , " is " extremely weak and extremely ill , and he tires very quickly , " he said .
Emily Davis , Hopper 's personal assistant , said in a sworn statement that Hopper is " only able to have brief conversations at times when his nurses permit him to have such conversations and then only for very short periods of time . "
" He is not able to concentrate and he tires quickly , " Davis said .
The court filing also contends that Hopper 's finances have dwindled with his illness .
An affidavit from his accountant said the cost of his cancer treatments exceed his income , which is $ 58,000 in annual residual payments from his TV and movie roles .
His last acting job was last year when he completed the television series " Crash . "

Washington DC is forecast to get 20 to 28 inches of snow .
Naturally , the capitol is preparing for the impending blizzard by hoarding Lunchables , half & half and Chunky Monkey according to this tipster photo taken at Safeway last night .
Meanwhile up here in New York , the forecast is bit more uncertain .
The current advisory is a less - than - metropolis - paralyzing 4 to 8 inches , with this corollary that makes any prediction useless Since " the forecast area will be along the northern edge of the storm system , " we could get " more snow " or " little or no snow . "
But do n't let that make you second - guess your evening date with a pint of Ben & Jerry's .
Urgent ! :
There is no more produce or canned soup on sale at the Fairfax , Va. , Wegmans except for — can't tell really — jalapenos , ginseng and a few cans of Chef Boyardee .
Nope , you wo n’t see a public option in the legislation that is expected to come to a vote in the House later this week .
But if it passes , we may well see a public option established in some–maybe many–states .
As Kate and I have written before , if this bill becomes law , states will be on the front lines of health reform .
What they do will likely be the difference between whether this whole endeavor succeeds or fails .
This morning , at the invitation of the National Governors Association , I moderated a health reform roundtable of four Governors : Democrats Ted Kulongoski of Oregon and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia , and Republicans Jim Douglas of Vermont and Mike Rounds of South Dakota .
Their insights were important and revealing .
Here ’s one that surprised me : Governor Kulongoski said one of the first questions he will confront is the issue of setting up a public option as part of the state “ exchanges ” that would be required under the new law .
Kulongoski supports a public option .
And in his state , work on the feasibility of one is already under way .
Oregon ’s HB2009 , passed last year , includes this direction to the state ’s new Health Authority :
Develop and submit a plan to the Legislative Assembly by December 31 , 2010 , with recommendations for the development of a publicly owned health benefit plan that operates in the exchange under the same rules and regulations as all health insurance plans offered through the exchange , including fully allocated fixed and variable operating and capital costs .
Afterward , I asked Douglas and Manchin whether their states might also be giving serious consideration to a public option .
Douglas said no , but Manchin insisted : “ All of us are going to have to look at that .
…
What we ’ve got to do is make [ insurance companies ] compete–and a public option is probably the only way . ”
In a broader sense , this reminds us that , for all the talk of this bill imposing a “ one size fits all ” health care system on the country , the reality could be very different .
If and when President Obama signs the health care bill into law , the action moves out to the states , where many of the same political battles are going to be fought once again–and possibly , with a very different result .

Brendan Burke , the youngest son of Leafs president Brian Burke , is dead after an accident in Indiana .
A brief statement from the Leafs indicated that 21 - year - old died of his injuries from the accident which happened earlier on Friday .
The family has asked for “ privacy at this difficult time , ” the statement said .
Brendan and his friend , Mark A. Reedy , 18 of Michigan , were in a two - car accident at about 2:50 p.m. Friday in Wayne County , according to local police .
Brendan was driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee when , witnesses say , the vehicle slid sideways into the path of a Ford truck .
The roads were treacherous with heavy accumulation of snowfall at that time , police said .
The fatal accident was one of 35 crashes reported in U.S. Friday .
Burke and his son Brendan were featured in a Toronto Star story in November 2009 after the younger Burke came out and said he was gay .
He ’d told his dad at Christmas 2007 .
Burke , who has five other children , had told the Star ’s Damien Cox that Brendan was very special .
“ People trust him immediately .
He has a very sweet side that I envy because I do n't have it , ” Burke had said .
“ I just wish every parent could experience having a child like him . ”
“ On behalf of the entire Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment family , we extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Brian Burke .
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Burke family during this extremely difficult time . ”
New York Magazine found the " interview " noteworthy , saying :
" Last night Stephen Colbert provided the " Oh Snap ! " moment of the evening when he shut down Republican superflack Mary Matalin mid-argument .
His rebuttal was so perfect that it made her completely drop her line of reasoning and complement him , which is no small victory . "
watch
This was in response to the one attempt Matalin made to revert to her standard talking points in service of the Dick Cheney legacy , and Colbert left her stammering with his quick retort .
Far more fun for me was watching her babble on in an attempt to keep Stephen from screaming " BINGO ! "
Here 's a rough , highly edited transcript of some of my favorite snippets from the interview :
SC : " I 've never had a republican strategist of your caliber before and if
you do n't mind , I want to play a little game I 've wanted to play for
years .
It 's called Republican Talking Points Bingo . "
MM : " Ooohhh .... "
SC : " Uh , everytime you say something that 's a Republican talking point ,
I just mark it off .
You mind ? " MM : " No . " SC : " Okay , that 's great .
First question ...
Why are you wearing a cross of
Jesus , he preached social Justice , He was a communist , right ? "
MM : " Yes He did .
He also preached ' teach them how to fish , do n't
give them a fish , right ?
You do n't work , you do n't eat . "
SC : " He said ' I will make you fishers of men . '
I do n't believe Jesus
said ' If you do n't work , you do n't eat . '
I believe that was from
Cool Hand Luke . ( snip ) I believe you 're paraphrasing . "
Try as she might , Matalin was not actually able to refrain from the talking points , though Stephen mostly gave her a pass .
SC : " Talk me down the nightmare path .
What happens if the Democrats
push thru reconciliation ? "
MM : " Well , they already passed reconciliation , you know .
Today was when
the aptly named ' SLAUGHTER RULE ' took place and you get to be
self - executing now ... you do n't have to vote on this now . "
SC : " Self - executing ... that 's committing suicide ! "
MM : " We 'll see .
It might be that they are committing suicide .
They
do n't want to vote on this bill but they want to say they voted for
Health Care , so that 's called ' The Slaughter Rule ' and that 's
self - executing so we 're past reconciliation , which ... "
SC : " What happens to America if this goes through , Madame ?
How long do
we have ? "
MM : " Can I glance at my BINGO ! card ? "
SC : " No .
Not yet .
It does n't work if you know what the answers are . "
I never saw Stephens BINGO !
card , but I imagined it must have looked like this :
After some banter about the upcoming mid-term elections and Rahm ,
SC : " If the Democrats get this through will the Republicans run on
repealing Health Care ?
I 've heard that .. I 've heard that ..
McConnell said that .
Well do you think they should run on
repealing Health Care ?
MM : " They will run on repealing this kind of architecture that is this
expansionist .
They will also run on the targeted reforms that are
in this architecture .
SC : " I do n't know what you mean .
I 'm not an architect .
What do you
mean ? "
MM : " I 'm trying to knock you out of BINGO !
So far ... "
SC : " You 've done very well at not saying any of the things that everyone
says .
You have n't said much , though .
You 've talked real s - l - o - w - l-y . "
Feel free to add ideas in the comments for Republican Talking Points I overlooked in my version of Republican Talking Point BINGO !.
I 'll post the video of the interview when it comes up later today , if the diary survives .
Otherwise , watch for it here .

I still can't get the embedding right though .
Well known LDS political pundit Glenn Beck recently told his radio listeners that they should leave churches with the words “ social justice ” or “ economic justice ” on their websites :
I beg you , look for the words ’ social justice ’ or ‘ economic justice ’ on your church Web site .
If you find it , run as fast as you can .
Social justice and economic justice , they are code words .
Now , am I advising people to leave their church ?
Yes ! ”
This overheated rhetoric has already drawn fire from Catholics and Protestants .
But it ’s not just Protestants and Catholics who are in trouble .
In fact , if Glenn followed his own instructions , he ’d be an ex-Mormon .
Let ’s try it out , shall we ?
Step one : Look for the words ’ social justice ’ or ‘ economic justice ’ on your church Web site .
This is easily enough accomplished with the handy search function at LDS.org .
Among the results is this 1986 Ensign article by Elder James E. Faust of the Quorum of the Twelve .
It very clearly contains the words economic justice — and they are described in a good way , by an apostle — and it is indeed on the church ’s website :
It is unfortunate that it is taking so long to bring full economic justice to women .
The feminization of poverty is both real and tragic .
That is why you should work very hard to prepare for your future by gaining some marketable skills .
Step two , of course , is If you find it , run as fast as you can .
The end result is very clear :
Any LDS church members who decide to follow Glenn Beck ’s ( very clear ) instructions on this topic , will leave the church .
File as exhibit 200 ( or is it 2000 ? ) in the “ be careful with your overheated rhetoric ” file .
For once , some actually good insight from a CNBC guest .
Philip Manduca , Head of Investment of the ECU Group , discusses Greece and the very severe implications of what the final outcome will look like .
" Trichet said the Greeks are crooks , and they 've been lying about the numbers .
There is a deeply embedded corruption within the Eurozone .
Combined with the endemic European socialism and there is just no way you are going to get spending cuts and tax raises and maintain a GDP that makes any sense of the percentage aspect of debt to GDP .
So the whole show is wrong .
This is an intractable situation , this is going to continue on and on .
The onle hope for the Eurozone , and the Euro as a currency , is that sameone takes the spotlight soon , and that may be the United States . "
Watch the rest as Philip 's perspective is spot on ... Not to mention that he sees gold as the only alternative to the fiat bonfire soon to engulf the western world .
A radical windmill design could hold the key to making offshore wind power more economical and helping the UK meet its ambitious renewable energy targets .
The Aerogenerator turns conventional windmills on their side , with a 100 m tall V - shaped blade rotating on a vertical , rather than the usual horizontal , axis .
By building all the moving parts and machinery at the base of the windmill rather than the top of a tower , its designers claim it will be easier to build and maintain , making its renewable electricity cheaper .
Nova ( Novel Offshore Vertical Axis Demonstrator ) — which came up with the design — is one of three projects being funded by the government - backed Energy Technologies Institute ( ETI ) as part of a project to find ways of bringing down the cost of offshore wind power .
The UK has the biggest wind resource in Europe - some estimates put the UK 's share at one - third of the continent 's total .
Taking advantage of the country 's potential wind power will be critical in meeting the targets set by government for the UK to meet 15 % of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 .
In January , the government announced a £ 75 bn programme to build 25 GW of offshore wind turbines .
The nine sites in line for development in the Crown Estate 's programme — including Dogger Bank , the Bristol Channel , the seas off Norfolk and the Firth of Forth — are all further away from the coast and in deeper waters , around 30 m , than any existing offshore project , and therefore more challenging to build .
" The current cost of electricity by offshore wind is somewhere between 12 - 15 p per KWh , that 's about double the cost of onshore wind and three times the cost of conventional generation .
Our job is to significantly reduce that .
By 2020 , we want it to be comparable to onshore generation .
As we move to 2050 , we want it to be comparable to conventional generation , " said Grant Bourhill of the ETI .
He said that traditional offshore windmills seemed to have reached their economic limit with the huge 10 MW turbines that are planned for the next few years , but Nova could potentially deliver more .
" No one understands the economic limits for vertical - axis and it may be the economic limit is significantly better than a 10 MW can provide , so we will be able to generate electricity at a much lower cost .
The design could be more reliable and the maintenance costs could be significantly lower because the main components are actually closer to sea level than they are with the horizontal - axis design , " said Bourhill .
Nova , which has collaborators from Cranfield , Sheffield and Strathclyde universities , is being developed by OTM Consulting Limited .
The team aims to have 1GW of offshore vertical axis turbines installed by 2020 , with a demonstrator Aerogenerator turbine built offshore by 2015 .
Each windmill would be designed to generate between 5MW and 10 MW of power but , because each would be cheaper to build than an equivalent modern turbine , the overall cost of an offshore wind farm , and the electricity , should be lower .
The ETI 's strategy for offshore wind is to find ways to make this source of energy much cheaper and more reliable .
The other two projects funded by the institute 's £ 20 m offshore scheme are Helm wind , a consortium led by energy company Eon that is focused on examining how conventional windmill designs can be made more cheaply , and Project Deepwater , a design for floating windmills out at sea led by Blue H Technologies and which includes collaborations from BAe Systems and EDF energy .
The ETI 's funding for the three projects so far is aimed at producing detailed design specifications for the three ideas .
Bourhill said that , once these plans have been evaluated by the institute , one of the ideas will be in line for a multi-million pound demonstration project .

CPAs with clients or companies using thrift institutions as depositories can continue to rest easy .
Office of Thrift Supervision third - quarter 1993 call report data for the nation 's 1,788 savings and loans showed an increase of 7.2 % in equity capital to $ 52.4 billion from $ 48.9 billion since September 30 , 1991 .
An analysis by Veribanc , Inc. produced a 10.9 % gain in the number of thrifts receiving its highest rating .
Thrift fortunes improved despite a 20.9 % decline in the number of S&Ls in operation and a 16.3 % drop in total thrift assets over the two - year period .
Gregory C. Talbott , CPA , vicepresident of Pomona First Federal Savings and Loan , Pomona , California , said the thrift industry should not be given full credit for the increased profitability .
" It was a combination of well - run , healthy institutions getting their problems behind them and a very favorable interest rate environment that allowed these institutions to profit from wide yield spreads , " he said .
However , there may not be another upswing in thrift finances . …

This one is for those that want to prevent Emacs from getting pwned by advanced modern applications like …
Notepad .
Heh .
“ MS - DOG ” users that have been “ brain damaged ” by Windows generally think of text editors as… well … a text editor .
They like Notepad because it ’s fast , easy , and it does n’t do anything to your files behind the scenes like just about every other frickin ’ Windows program .
Now , for just the general “ I ’m not going to do any serious editing , I just want to rt-click ->
Open this text file and scroll around on it to see what ’s going on ” type of thing , Notepad has this truly tremendous feature called “ Word Wrap . ”
If it ’s on , you get soft word wraps added to your text to make it more readable .
As is standard in the Notepad way , this does not do anything to your file , it ’s just a feature to make it look good on the screen whether you resize it or not .
If you turn word - wrap off then you do n’t get any wrapping at all – this is good for looking at files that have fixed length columns .
Emacs defaults to a form of wrapping that puts in “ soft line breaks ” where ever a line goes off the screen .
These are marked on either side with little squiggle arrows .
This approach has its merits in that you can see all of your file on screen at one time in a mostly sort - of kind - of the way it is sort - of way .
To turn this off , type M-x toggle - truncate - lines .
Now you will have a text editor that ’s almost as good as notepad with “ Word Wrap ” turned off ! 😉
This should make the wrapping lines extend off the right side of the screen .
Note that this command makes using the SQL mode much nicer … though sql- ms / isql still screws up your column headings with the timer text : “ 1> 2 > 3 > 4 > ” .
One core NotePad feature has only recently become available to Emacs users via Emacs 22 .
M-x longlines turns the feature on , after which M-x longlines - mode toggles it on and off .
Longlines mode gives you the easy reading soft word wrapping of NotePad with “ Word Wrap ” turned on .
Note that , splitting the screen horizontally vertically with C-x 3 seems to give you “ Word Wrap Off ” huge lines scrolling off the screen whether you want it or not .
And no horizontal scroll bar for you , either !
The only way to see the text that is off - screen in this case appears to be to scroll by hitting C-x > and / or C-x <.
Alternately you can resize the windows a bit by hitting C-x } and / or C-x { .
( For that last one you may want to use the repeat command of C-x z and then as many z‘s as you want after that .
But do n’t blame me if you accidentally shut down Emacs when you try But do n’t blame me if you accidentally shut down Emacs when you try this ! )
If you really have to use the mouse , then you can click on the arrows on either side of the frame / window / whatever .

In his new book , Mitt Romney accuses Barack Obama of fueling anti-American sentiments .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Mitt : Obama fuels anti-Americanism
In his new book , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of providing “ kindling ” to the “ anti-American fires burning all across the globe . ”
The book “ No Apology : The Case for American Greatness ” hit shelves Tuesday , and in it Romney focuses much of his time attacking Obama ’s foreign policy .
Advertisement
“ Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds , both real and imagined , ” Romney writes of Obama ’s overseas trips .
“ It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is , at least in part , understandable . ”
“ There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe ; President Obama ’s words are like kindling to them , ” the former GOP presidential candidate adds .
Romney goes on to urge Obama to show a stronger commitment to U.S. allies , especially Israel , and speak more about “ America ’s values ” rather than “ America ’s failings . ”
While Romney offers plenty of criticism of the president ’s approach abroad , he does n’t provide much insight into his own run for president or on the two years since he dropped out of the race .
There are few criticisms of his fellow Republicans and he offers little detail mapping his course forward .
Instead , Romney is focused on the American mood and how the country can regain its swagger .
“ Whenever the world faces potentially insurmountable threats , military or otherwise , it turns to America , ” Romney writes .
“ Yet with all that we have done to help others , and with so much more that remains to be done , our popularity and persuasive sway are on the wane . ”
“ The self - loathing of Western intellectuals should not hinder our sturdy defense of all that should make us the most admired and respected of nations , ” he continues .
“ We must argue our case , leading others to eagerly join us in the case of liberty and peace . ”
Romney blames an American culture that he sees as too eager to accept American failings and too weary of celebrating triumphs .
“ The time has come for American schools to once again systematically teach our children about the heroes of the battles that won our freedom and about the heroes that fought in the wars that gained liberty for millions of people around the world , ” he writes .
“ The multiculturalism movement must be unmasked for the fraud that it is .
There are superior cultures , and ours is one of them . ”
But in touting American culture , Romney allows that the U.S. has some major shortcomings of its own such as not placing enough value on the family , specifically by condoning out - of - wedlock births .
“ Given the dire consequences for the nation and the heart - wrenching implications for children , why has no alarm been sounded and no emergency measures enacted to staunch this grave crisis ? ”
Romney asks .
“ To reclaim marriage and family , we must begin by telling children and young adults the truth .
Strong voices of concern and redirection must come from the president , governors , legislators , community leaders , pastors and teachers . ”
Romney also blames the American education system — which he refers to as an “ epic failure ” — for allowing societal decline , as well as the decision by “ progressives ” to de-emphasize “ the subjects that had previously been considered essential . ”
“ The consequences of a failing education system reach to the foundation of our democracy , ” he writes .
“ If our children do not learn about and come to cherish America ’s heritage , history , culture and founding principles , how can they be expected to defend the freedoms on which their country is based ? ”
“ It did not point to anything that has actually happened as a result of the release , ” Mr. Assange said .
“ It contains the analyst ’s best guesses as to how the information could be used to harm the Army but no concrete examples of any real harm being done . ”
WikiLeaks , a nonprofit organization , has rankled governments and companies around the world with its publication of materials intended to be kept secret .
For instance , the Army ’s report says that in 2008 , access to the Web site in the United States was cut off by court order after Bank Julius Baer , a Swiss financial institution , sued it for publishing documents implicating Baer in money laundering , grand larceny and tax evasion .
Access was restored after two weeks , when the bank dropped its case .
Governments , including those of North Korea and Thailand , also have tried to prevent access to the site and complained about its release of materials critical of their governments and policies .
The Army ’s interest in WikiLeaks appears to have been spurred by , among other things , its publication and analysis of classified and unclassified Army documents containing information about military equipment , units , operations and “ nearly the entire order of battle ” for American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in April 2007 .
WikiLeaks also published an outdated , unclassified copy of the “ standard operating procedures ” at the military prison in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
WikiLeaks said the document revealed methods by which the military prevented prisoners from meeting with the International Red Cross and the use of “ extreme psychological stress ” as a means of torture .
Spending more on healthcare does n’t make a nation healthier .
We evaluated 5 factors to compare the state of health around the world .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the United States spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world .
But that high spending does n’t mean we are healthier than other countries .
A look at healthcare costs and service outcomes seems to indicate that others are getting more bang for their buck .
Here are some of the key statistics that tell us just where the United States ranks with other world powers in samples of expenditures and outcomes :
1. Total Health Expenditures as a Percentage of GDP
GDP , or gross domestic product , refers to a value placed on a country 's goods and services .
It is the single most important measure used in determining inflation and the economic health of a nation .
At 17.2 percent of GDP , the United States was definitely spending a higher percentage of its resources on healthcare in 2016 than these other developed countries .
2. Annual Costs of Healthcare Per Capita
Another useful way of looking at what a country is spending on healthcare is to examine the average amount it spent in a year per person for this purpose .
This number can be compared to other years and to other countries to get some idea about the effectiveness of governmental policies concerning healthcare .
With numbers such as these , we can compare what other developed countries spent on average for each of their citizens in 2016 in contrast to the United States ' per capita healthcare expenditures that year .
In the United States , the annual cost of healthcare per capita was $ 9,892.00 and is still rising .
While politicians fight with one another , the United States continues to be number one in high healthcare costs per capita .
3. World 's Infant Mortality Rates Per 1,000 Live Births
The infant mortality rate is based on the number of deaths in children under one year of age per 1,000 following live births .
The highest rates in the world are found in underdeveloped countries without government services , clean water or adequate health care .
The infant mortality rate remains higher in the U.S. than in most other developed nations .
The infant mortality rate in the United States is estimated to be 5.67 , almost three times that of Japan .
4. Life Expectancy Across the Globe
Life expectancy is the average number of years persons born in the same year are expected to live and is based on the numbers and ages of recorded deaths .
In the U.S. , life expectancy is surprisingly lower than in many other developed countries .
For the United States , the average life expectancy was 81.6 .
That is five years less than Japan .
5. MRI Machine Availability
MRIs are used to take pictures of the inside body structure and of organs .
They are used both for diagnoses and for monitoring certain treatments .
A recent Globe Newswire article from October 2017 reported that the " Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems market is projected to exceed USD 8.5 billion by 2024 . "
The high costs associated with MRI Machine use further restricts the likelihood that poorer countries will be able to afford the machines in their local environments .
This chart shows the number of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) units in selected ( OECD ) countries per million inhabitants as of 2015 ( or latest year available ) :
In the United States , 35.5 MRI machines were available for every million people , second only to Japan in this grouping of industrialized nations .
Why the Discrepancy ?
Statistics such as these beg the question of why the United States spends so much on healthcare but achieves inferior outcomes to its neighbors .
The answer may lie in costs for drugs , medical equipment , health insurance administration and waste .
Nuns ' singing is ' ancient , unchanging and timeless '
A record label is launching a talent hunt aimed at religious orders around the globe in a bid to recruit a troupe of chart - topping nuns .
London - based Decca wants to record an album of plainsong and chant in time for the Pope 's UK visit in September .
The idea for the album was inspired by an old recording of singing nuns rediscovered during an office move .
Nuns and religious orders are being asked to contact Decca with examples of their singing within a month .
Decca general manager Mark Wilkinson said : " This is a genuine appeal to find what you could call a ' sister act ' for the 21st Century . "
Platinum album
Decca executive Tom Lewis , who found the recording as he looked through piles of old records , said : " When you hear the sound of nuns chanting , it 's like an immediate escape from the challenges , stresses , pace and noise of modern living .
" You 're given a glimpse of another world - a world of peace and calm .
This is a sound of something ancient , unchanging and timeless . "
Decca is hoping to replicate the success it found with The Monks of Stift Heiligenkreuz , who won a similar contest organised by Mr Lewis in 2008 .
The Austrian monks contacted the record label with a YouTube clip of them singing .
Their subsequent album of plainchant singing went platinum .
After years of rumor and speculation , Apple 's now taking orders for its iPad tablet .
And now that cash money is involved we 'll finally see if Apple has a success on its hands by filling the void between smartphones and netbooks / laptops -- something Microsoft and its hoard of vendors just have n't been able to muster .
Today 's order is delivered on April 3rd ( in the US ) for free and orders are limited to two per customer .
But rather than wait for analysts and Apple 's financial reports to tell the tale , let 's get a jump on things with an informal poll : are you ordering the iPad ?

The goal of the MyHDL project is to empower hardware designers with the elegance and simplicity of the Python language .
MyHDL is a free , open - source package for using Python as a hardware description and verification language .
Python is a very high level language , and hardware designers can use its full power to model and simulate their designs .
Moreover , MyHDL can convert a design to Verilog or VHDL .
This provides a path into a traditional design flow .
Modeling
Python 's power and clarity make MyHDL an ideal solution for high level modeling .
Python is famous for enabling elegant solutions to complex modeling problems .
Moreover , Python is outstanding for rapid application development and experimentation .
The key idea behind MyHDL is the use of Python generators to model hardware concurrency .
Generators are best described as resumable functions .
MyHDL generators are similar to always blocks in Verilog and processes in VHDL .
A hardware module is modeled as a function that returns generators .
This approach makes it straightforward to support features such as arbitrary hierarchy , named port association , arrays of instances , and conditional instantiation .
Furthermore , MyHDL provides classes that implement traditional hardware description concepts .
It provides a signal class to support communication between generators , a class to support bit oriented operations , and a class for enumeration types .
Install MyHDL in ubuntu 9.10 ( Karmic )
Open the terminal and run the following commands
sudo add - apt - repository ppa:balau82 / ppa
sudo apt - get update
sudo apt - get install myhdl
This will install all the required packages for myhdl including gpg key .
To get started , many examples are provided in “ / usr / share / doc/ myhdl / examples “ , and more information can be found on the MyHDL cookbook .

The airline is known for its funny and colourful adverts .
Photo : kulula.com
A South African budget airline has pulled its tongue - in - cheek advert after a Fifa complaint that it infringed its trademark during the 2010 World Cup .
kulula.com 's ad described the firm as the " Unofficial National Carrier of the You - Know - What " .
It also had pictures of stadiums , vuvuzelas and national flags .
But Fifa said the airline could not use the symbols - even the word " South Africa " , kulula.com 's spokeswoman said .
Fifa , however , said the images taken together were " ambush marketing " .
' Pushing boundary '
" For the record , Fifa did not tell Kulula that they could not use soccer balls , or the word ' South Africa ' , or the Cape Town stadium , or the national flag or vuvuzelas , " said a statement from football 's world governing body .
It was the combination of these elements which were banned , the statement said .
Fifa said the advert breached South African law " by seeking to gain a promotional benefit for the kulula brand by creating an unauthorised association with the 2010 Fifa World Cup " .
However , Heidi Brauer , a marketing manager of Comair Limited , a holding company for kulula.com and British Airways in South Africa , told the BBC :
" We 're surprised by this Fifa complaint but have to be respectful because Fifa has very stringent rules . "
But she said that many people across the country had criticised Fifa 's move , saying that football 's world governing organisation did not own South Africa 's soccer stadiums , soccer balls or vuvuzelas ( a South African plastic trumpet used by football fans ) .
However , Mrs Brauer admitted that the airline 's advert - which was pulled last week - was " challenging " and " pushing the boundary " .
The budget airline is known for its quirky adverts .
Fifa has a history of protecting its image rights around World Cups .
The month - long World Cup kicks off in South Africa on 11 June .
Sarah Palin faked pregnancy of Trig A great expose on the faked pregnancy by the disgraced former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin has been posted at Theimmoralminority blog .
From the blog : " The next twist in our storyline was Sarah 's trip to give a speech at the Republican Governor 's conference in Texas on April 18th .
What really happened there ?
No one knows .
But what is known for certain is that Sarah left the conference abruptly in the early afternoon of April 17th and came back to Alaska , a ten plus hour trip involving two four hour flights and a layover in Seattle .
( Not only did this decision seem abrupt , but even Sarah 's security staff was not contacted and did not know she was arriving to have a baby until after the birth . )
What is also known for certain is that no one has ever come forward to say that they noticed anything special or different about the Gov during this trip .
In fact , she was seen reading a book in the lounge during the layover in Seattle .
" Alaska legislators , media staffers , and former staffers of the ex-governor have all been saying the same thing for years - she was never pregnant .
Why the hoax ?
If she would show Trig 's birth certificate it would solve everything .

Disguised as Indians , they poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed down Hutchinson Street for Griffin 's Wharf .
At a packed meeting to condemn the Tea Act , Samuel Adams declared " they had now done all that they could for the salvation of their country " .
And this was the excuse the patriots needed as they smashed their way through the East India Company chests , dumping some 90,000lb of tea worth nearly £ 10,000 into Boston harbour .
Today , the Tea Party patriots come dressed in George Washington outfits and Joker masks , with posters accusing President Obama of socialism , communism , even nazism .
This remarkable political insurgency , which mushrooms by the month and has both Democrats and Republicans terrified for their congressional seats , regards itself as the true heir to the republic 's ideals .
Thomas Jefferson 's adage , that " the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants " , is a favoured banner .
And , to be fair to the Tea Party ideologues , they are being faithful to the principles of 1773 : both as tax - dodgers and demagogues .
For behind all the lofty talk of no taxation without representation , the Boston tea party hid some grubby material truths .
Few in the early 1770s regarded a split from Britain as either possible or preferable .
In fact , the American colonies – and New England in particular – had done well out of the British Empire on the back of shipbuilding , whaling and war .
Chief among the new merchant class was John Hancock , whose family firm had been built on provisioning the British army and Royal Navy .
The capture of Canada – the campaigns against the French and the Spanish – ensured huge military profits for Boston businesses .
But it was when – in the aftermath of the seven years war – the government asked America to start paying its way , that trouble began .
By the 1760s the British Treasury was massively in debt , with the costs of empire falling disproportionately on English taxpayers .
Not unreasonably George Grenville , the prime minister , wanted the prosperous colonies to accept more of the financial burden .
New taxes on foreign imports were introduced together with a professionalised customs administration .
Unfortunately these levies hit Boston hard as it faced a postwar slump .
What was more , the big merchants relied extensively on tax - dodging and smuggling for their riches .
Cargo ships laden with molasses from the West Indies , wines from Madeira , coffee from the East Indies , textiles and indigo – all slipped into Boston harbour in the dead of night with no duties paid .
Even as the New England colonists urged London to hammer Louis XV and protect them from French encirclement , they refused to face up to their fiscal responsibilities .
Time and again , Britain indulged their wants .
The Townshend Duties on foreign imports were reversed , the Stamp Act taxing newspaper and pamphlets was dropped , but it would not give in on the 1773 Tea Act .
The legislation was designed to shore up the finances of the East India Company , carve out the Boston harbour crooks , and deliver cheap tea to the colonies .
All of which posed an unacceptable threat to the Boston Brahmins .
Far from being a spontaneous outpouring of liberty , the " tea party " was brewed up by wealthy merchants worried their secret deals on tea imports were about to be exposed .
And so today , once more , wealthy corporate interests are winding up an angry populace – amid an economic slump – with spurious talk of freedom .
Having enjoyed the benefits of their own empire for the last 50 years and pocketed tax cuts during the Iraq war , the 21st - century Tea Party movement is now grumbling about paying for power .
Of course , there are some differences .
Today the Tea Party is a suburban , rather than urban , phenomenon ; its Fox News philosophers lack something of the depth of Hancock , Adams and Benjamin Franklin .
But the parallels are noteworthy : in its use of marches and street theatre it echoes the tarring - and - feathering mob politics that once governed Boston harbour .
So , too , its impressive use of new media .
The pamphlets and cartoons of 18th - century New England are now replaced by blogs , cable television and internet radio .
Also its religiosity : out of the Boston tea party emerged a " solemn league and covenant " , drawing on America 's Protestant pre-history and committing its members to collective action against the British .
In vogue among modern Tea Party members is the line from the Declaration of Independence : " We mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . "
What turned the Boston tea party into the American Revolution was the British response – with the Coercive Acts radicalising opinion across the 13 colonies .
Wisely , President Obama has not antagonised his Tea Party opponents ; he has chosen instead to give them enough rope to hang themselves .
But with disillusion growing and the November mid-terms looming , his prospects do n't look promising .
What Obama needs to know is that if he is being set up for the role of Thomas Hutchinson – the last British governor of Massachusetts – in this historical morality play , what remains of the British empire is ready to offer him asylum .

Are Americans among the most religious people in the world ?
The answer depends on which " world " you 're talking about .
If you 're referring to the entire planet , the answer is plainly " no . "
In 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 , Gallup asked representative samples in 143 countries and territories whether religion was an important part of their daily lives .
The accompanying map shows religiosity by country , ranging from the least religious to the most religious on a relative basis .
Across all populations , the median proportion of residents who said religion is important in their daily lives is 82 % .
Americans fall well below this midpoint , at 65 % .
But before you point out the considerable effect religion has on U.S. society and politics , let 's change the lens to account for a basic insight multicountry surveys offer : a population 's religiosity level is strongly related to its average standard of living .
Gallup 's World Poll , for example , indicates that 8 of the 11 countries in which almost all residents ( at least 98 % ) say religion is important in their daily lives are poorer nations in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , the 10 least religious countries studied include several with the world 's highest living standards , including Sweden , Denmark , Norway , Hong Kong , and Japan .
( Several other countries on this list are former Soviet republics , places where the state suppressed religious expression for decades . )
Social scientists have noted that one thing that makes Americans distinctive is our high level of religiosity relative to other rich - world populations .
Among 27 countries commonly seen as part of the developed world , the median proportion of those who say religion is important in their daily lives is just 38 % .
From this perspective , the fact that two - thirds of Americans respond this way makes us look extremely devout .
What 's more , as Gallup 's Frank Newport recently pointed out , there is wide regional variation in religiosity across the 50 American states .
The proportion of those who say religion is important in their daily lives is highest in Mississippi , at 85 % -- a figure that is slightly higher than the worldwide median ( among all countries , rich and poor ) .
Two others , Alabama ( 82 % ) and South Carolina ( 80 % ) are on par with the worldwide median .
Lining up these percentages with those on our worldwide list allows us to match residents of the most religious states to the global populations with which they are similar in terms of religiosity .
The results produce some interesting comparisons -- Alabamians , for example , are about as likely as Iranians to say religion is an important part or their lives .
Georgians in the United States are about as religious as Georgians in the Caucasus region .
On the less religious end of the spectrum , residents of New Hampshire look similar to their neighbors in Canada and Alaskans are about as religious as Israelis .
Bottom Line
Obviously , these data only compare the importance of religion in people 's lives -- they say nothing about what being highly religious means in different parts of the world and among different faiths .
Nonetheless , it 's fascinating to note that in terms of religiosity , Americans span a range that invites comparisons to some predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and tribal societies in Southern Africa , as well as to some relatively secular nations in Europe and developed East Asia .
Examining regional variations within many other large countries would almost certainly uncover similar diversity .
Recognition of that fact should give Americans pause when we 're tempted to apply blanket generalizations to other cultures ; for example , to say residents in those nations are less devout or more prone to zealotry than people in America .
It should also help those outside the United States avoid applying such oversimplified judgments to Americans .
Survey Methods
Global results are based on telephone and face - to - face interviews conducted in 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 with approximately 1,000 adults in each country .
Results from each country have an associated sampling error of ±4 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
For U.S. state - level religiosity data , results are based on telephone interviews with 355,334 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted in 2008 as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
The margin of sampling error for most states is ± 1 percentage point , but is as high as ±4 percentage points for the District of Columbia , Wyoming , and North Dakota .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In which we are introduced to our mysterious friend , and regaled with an amusing anecdote .
Avangard and Vityaz get 840 PIMs , set new world record ( Photo © khl.ru )
The participants of the Saturday ’s bench - clearing brawl in the KHL , Jaromir Jagr ’s Avangard Omsk and Vityaz Chekhov , set a new world hockey record getting 840 PIMs .
The KHL disciplinary committee met on Sunday to spend 7 hours studying the incident .
As a result , the total number of PIMs was increased from 691 to 840 minutes .
Six Vityaz and one Avangard player were suspended for one game .
Both teams got fined for the total of $ 133,000 .
Vityaz was warned that in case of a similar situation happening in future the team will get excluded from the KHL .
According to Russian newspaper Sport - Express the teams were awarded with enormous 840 PIMs .
Vityaz got 421 minutes , Avangard — 419 .
The teams surpassed the record set by NHL‘s Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers in 2004 , when teams together earned 419 PIMs .
It should be noticed that Vityaz beat this record just by themselves having 2 more PIMs than Senators and Flyers combined .

Alternative approaches to medicine are stock - in - trade in the ASU laboratory of microbiologist Shelley Haydel .
So when ASU senior Jenny Koehl joined Haydel 's investigative team seeking firsthand knowledge of how basic research is done , how drugs are tested and potential cures produced , she found it and much more .
With the guidance of Tanya Cunningham , a graduate student mentor , Koehl has helped advance understanding about the antibacterial activity of clay minerals and their ability to kill what the best antibiotics on the market can't touch .
Haydel 's group , part of the School of Life Sciences , in the College of Liberals Arts and Sciences , and the Biodesign Institute at ASU , did the work in collaboration with Jack Summers , an inorganic chemist at Western Carolina University .
They uncovered two factors that control the antibacterial activity .
Their article " pH - dependent metal ion toxicity influences the antibacterial activity of two natural mineral mixtures " was published March 1 in the journal PLoS ONE , published by the Public Library of Science .
" This work sets a baseline from which to look for potential mechanisms of antibacterial action , " said Cunningham , lead author , who is now a research technician with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .
" We need helpful alternatives , natural approaches to antibacterial cures , because there is bacterial resistance to drugs , " Koehl said .
" Knowing the mechanisms of action will help us develop our own topical treatments . "
Clay has had a role in human health as ancient as man .
However , specific identification of the mechanisms underlying this antibacterial activity has been elusive , until now .

The Haydel - Summers collaborative has added clarity to these distinctly muddy waters by screening more than 50 mineral mixtures ( and aqueous extractions from them , known as leachates ) marketed as health and cosmetic products using pathogens Escherichia coli , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , Staphylococcus aureus , methicillin - resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
Only two mineral mixtures of significantly different compositions ( and their leachates ) were discovered to possess antibacterial traits .
Clay minerals often are recognized as the slimy slurry of minerals that slicks rivers ' banks .
Understanding clay 's structure is integral to answering questions about the mechanisms behind its antibacterial activity .
Negatively charged surfaces attract positively charged elements , such as iron , copper , silver and other metals .
In turn , water is absorbed between layers of the crystal structure creating a cation sandwich with aqueous filling or interlayer .
Antibacterial activity in leachates , extracted from the mineral mixtures , confirm that the antibacterial activity is chemically - based , rather than a result of physical interactions with microbes .
Because of the tendency of clay to attract multivalent ions , particularly metals , the scientists next examined the leachates ' chemistry and antibacterial activity in the presence of chelators , which bind metals .
The researchers also used thiourea , a hydroxyl radical scavenger , at various pH levels .
Chelation of the minerals with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) or desferrioxamine eliminated or reduced toxicity , respectively .
Further testing of the mineral leachates confirmed that there are higher concentrations of chemically - accessible metal ions in leachates from antibacterial samples than from non-bactericidal mineral samples .
advertisement
In addition , acidic conditions were found to increase the availability of metal ions and their toxicity .
Overall , these findings suggest a role of an acid soluble metal species , particularly iron or other sequestered metal cations , in mineral toxicity .
However , whatever advances the study puts forward also present researchers with further challenges .
Acidity may complicate development of topical treatments , if neutral pH , least damaging to skin and tissue , also reduces the mineral 's antibacterial action .
Another complicating factor , accentuated by the PLoS ONE study , is that chemical environments under which any particular clay can emerge can greatly influence its toxicity , adsorptive qualities and , according to their findings , its antibacterial effects .
" Because natural mineral mixtures can be variable , both mineralogically and chemically , we must continue to define specific chemical properties that influence the antibacterial effectiveness , " Haydel said .
" Our goal is to understand the details , so we can , in the future , perhaps generate mineral mixtures that mimic the chemical compositions and environment , so that the antibacterial activity can be controlled and ensured . "
This work is about eliminating the unknowns , " Koehl said .
" We have more analysis to do , looking at the leachate composition , the action of the chelators and activity of the iron scavengers . "
Koehl , who is working with Haydel as part of the School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research ( SOLUR ) program , said of her experience : " Science is like an obstacle course .
I 've learned that when you come across problems in the laboratory , you have to be creative to work them out .
This process has helped me be more critical , to be a thinking scientist , because I 've had to analyze my own experiments and figure them out .
This is n't just something that someone handed to me on paper in a classroom . "
Studies are moving forward in other laboratories to develop structured clays for slow - release topical medical treatments , but there may be chemical schemes that come from Haydel 's research , supported by the National Institutes of Health , that enhance their effectiveness .
" This study has given me an idea of how things move from idea to shelf , " Koehl said .
" One day , when I am a pharmacist , maybe I 'll be selling this ! "
Most things gadgety are seemingly wirelessly enabled in one way or another , and it ’s pretty clear that soon everything will be .
Now physicists have worked out a way to make it all happen : Microrings , which are tiny radio systems .
With lasers !
The image above is a representation of the microrings that boffins at Purdue University have created : Each is a miniscule ( 10 micron ) radio transmitter , crafted into a solid - state device .
The tiny circuits are actually activated by 100 femtosecond bursts of light from diode lasers , with complex pulse - profiles that excite the microring into emitting precisely - controlled radio waves .
That all sounds groovy , or possibly mystical if you ’re not too into micro-scale radio physics .
But let me explain the benefits :
It ’s easy to make the microring resonators emit radio waves in the region of 60 GHz , far above the 2 - 5 GHz used in current 802.11b/g/n
Wi - fi tech ( you can also tune the precise frequency by varying the temperature of the ring with a micro- sized heating element . )
And this frequency range has two absolutely cool upsides .
First , it ’s outside normal commercial , governmental and military radio spectrum bands , and it ’s both unlicensed and available world - wide , meaning radio devices in this band could be fantastically useful .
Secondly , it enables extremely fast data rates to be achieved –quite definitely enough for HDTV signals , broadband Net signals , and pretty much everything in your future home that ’ll be wirelessly connected all controlled from one single base station .
The Purdue success is in miniaturizing the ring resonator devices down to on - chip sizes , so that they ’ll be able to be slotted into almost any gadget that benefits from Wi-fi .
There ’s even the suggestion that they ’ll be suitable for in - car wireless comms systems , because the pulsed nature of the radio signals the rings produce is excellent for avoiding signal - sapping radio reflections that the car body can create ( and this benefit extends to in - home use too . )
It ’ll be years until the tech is perfected and commercialized , but basically Purdue ’s researches have guaranteed the future will indeed be a wireless - saturated one .

Just how little tolerance is zero tolerance ?
A Staten Island fourth - grader was reprimanded and almost suspended yesterday when the principal spotted him playing with a LEGO policeman and a two - inch - long toy gun during lunch , the Advance reports .
Under the city 's no-tolerance policy regarding guns in schools , PS 52 Principal Evelyn Matroianni brought 9 - year - old Patrick Timoney to her office and called his mother to say the boy might be suspended for carrying the miniature toy gun to school , pending the approval of the Department of Education 's security administrator .
When contacted , the administrator reportedly said the toy should be confiscated and returned to the boy 's parents , however no other punishment would be necessary .
" It 's crazy , " the boy 's mother , Laura Timoney , told the paper .
" He 's missing class time , all for silly toys .
The boys are just trying to relax .
If there 's a real threat , why not call the Police Department ? "
She noted that another child had brought an action figure that was carrying an ax , but only her son was punished .
" When are we going to take responsibility for common sense and logic ? "
In 2007 , a New Jersey 7 - year - old was suspended when he drew a picture of gun .
( CNN ) -- Federal authorities plan to unseal charges Monday against several people arrested in a series of weekend raids in Michigan , Ohio and Indiana , prosecutors in Detroit said Sunday .
At least seven people were arrested on charges that were under seal over the weekend , a law enforcement source said Sunday .
Gina Balaya , spokeswoman for the U.S attorney 's office in Detroit , said those charges will be revealed during a federal court hearing Monday .
Mike Lackomar , a county leader for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia , said the target of the raid was a Christian militia group called the Hutaree .
The group proclaims on a Web site that it is " preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive . "
The FBI would disclose no details of the raids .
The law enforcement source told CNN the arrests were unrelated to any terrorist plot .
The source would not confirm Hutaree members were among those arrested , but said the suspects were not planning attacks against government targets and the raids were unrelated to recent threats against members of Congress .
At least two arrests were made in Huron and Sandusky , Ohio , but the case is being handled out of Detroit , said Scott Wilson , an FBI spokesman in Cleveland .
Lackomar , who cited the FBI for his information , said several Hutaree members were arrested at a wake for one of the group .
He said the Hutaree group trained with his organization " on a couple of occasions in years past , " but his group stopped about a year ago , after the Hutaree had an " issue " with federal firearms regulators .
He did not elaborate .
Lackomar called the Hutaree a " religious militant group " with about a dozen members , who scattered as news of the raids spread over the weekend .
He told CNN his own group is aimed at " aiding the community in times of emergency " and had nothing to do with the raids .
CNN 's Carol Cratty , Pat St. Claire and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .
Lately , the authorities seem to have singled out two groups in particular : journalists , including political and cultural reporters and editors , and women ’s rights activists , who have years of experience in organizing and maintaining a movement in the face of a hostile government .

Iran ’s leadership says it is determined to maintain control of the streets on the anniversary of the revolution , one of the most emotionally charged days in the Iranian calendar .
In this smoldering political conflict , the opposition and the government have both tried to claim the mantle of the true heir to the revolution .
Iranian officials often rely on large crowds of people  many of them paid by the government , the opposition charges  to prove the government ’s legitimacy , and on Thursday the streets are likely to be filled with the state ’s supporters as well as its opponents .
The pace of arrests , which soared in the summer , picked up again at year ’s end after tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets around the country during the national observance of Ashura , a religious day of mourning observed by Shiite Muslims .
At least 10 people were killed when government forces opened fire on unarmed protesters .
But in scenes circulated around the world on the Internet , protesters were seen fighting back , chasing after government gunmen , blocking roads and burning government vehicles .
With those images clearly in mind , the government has moved aggressively to try to prevent a repeat .
Experts say the officials have reason to be nervous .
Even without calls from the principal opposition leaders , enormous crowds filled the streets on Ashura .
This time those leaders , Mr. Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi , have both issued calls to people to pour into the streets .
“ There are signs of an exceedingly nervous security apparatus that is deeply concerned about the outcome , ” said Hamid Dabashi , professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University .
The government response has been to try to intimidate , Iran experts and opposition leaders said .
That has included imposing the death penalty on 11 prisoners , and hanging two .
Five more death penalty cases are currently being prosecuted .
In the most recent crackdown , the government has rounded up scores of journalists , and not just those of the opposition .
Reporters working for the semiofficial news agencies Mehr and ISNA have also been detained .
The list of those arrested is a virtual Who ’s Who of Iranian journalism , among them : Akbar Montajabi , political editor of the newspaper Etemad-e Melli ; Ahmad Jalali - Farahani , the social affairs editor of Mehr ; and Zeinab Kazemkhah , an arts and culture writer for ISNA .
Other journalists , like Ahmad Zeydabadi and Masoud Bastani , arrested shortly after the election , have been sentenced to long prison terms in secret court proceedings .
Red - shirted protesters have hurled plastic bags filled with their own blood into the residential compound of the Thai prime minister , hoping their shock tactics will bring down his government .
A number of protesters later marshalled in front of the US embassy in a demonstration leaders said would be aimed at exposing the government 's alleged illegitimacy to the international community .
Seeking new ways to dramatise their cause , a small group of protesters were allowed by police to approach Abhisit Vejjajiva 's walled compound in a ritzy Bangkok neighbourhood and unleash a barrage of bags that smeared the walls , roof and grounds with red .
Earlier , a standoff between protesters and riot police had blocked all approaches to the home of Abhisit , whom the Red Shirt movement hopes to topple by calling for new elections .
After negotiations , three dozen demonstrators were allowed to squeeze through the police cordon carrying about six five - litre plastic water bottles filled with blood , which was poured into small plastic bags and then hurled at the home .
The incident in the Sukhumvit Road area , home to many wealthy Thais and expatriates , followed similar " blood sacrifices " a day earlier at Abhisit 's office and the headquarters of his Democrat party .
The dramatic acts grabbed attention but put the protest movement no closer to its goal of forcing new elections .
The protesters ' march and police cordons , thrown up after the government invoked an emergency decree , halted traffic in one direction on Sukhumvit Road , a major thoroughfare , paralysing parts of the neighbourhood .
Restaurants closed their doors and residents of luxury buildings were prevented from driving out of the area of Abhisit 's house .
Abhisit himself has been sleeping at an army headquarters and taking trips out of the city since the demonstrations began .
" We heard they were coming so I stayed in .
Sure enough we 're blocked in now , " said John Bujnosh , a Texas oil driller who lives on the same street as Abhisit .
More than 100,000 demonstrators from all over the country gathered in Bangkok on Sunday vowing to continue their protest until victory .
Abhisit has rejected their demands to dissolve parliament , saying only that he will listen to the protesters and leaving the situation in a stalemate .
Reporters asked one of the protest leaders , Veera Musikapong , what their next move would be .
He replied : " I want to know that myself . "
He said the group made up strategy on a day - by - day basis .
The protesters consist of supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted by a 2006 military coup for alleged corruption , and pro-democracy activists who opposed the army takeover .
They argue Abhisit came to power illegitimately with the connivance of the military and other parts of the traditional ruling class .
On Tuesday thousands of Red Shirts formed long lines to have their blood drawn by nurses to spill at Government House , the prime minister 's office .
Leaders claimed to have collected 300 litres .
A few teaspoons of blood were drawn from each volunteer and then transferred into dozens of large plastic water jugs that were passed overhead through the crowd of cheering protesters before being delivered to Government House .
Riot police allowed protest leaders to approach the front gate and pour out the blood , which oozed under the gate as national television broadcast the images live .
A purported Brahmin priest in ceremonial robes performed an unorthodox black magic ritual on the Red Shirts ' behalf .
" The blood of the common people is mixing together to fight for democracy , " a Red Shirt leader , Natthawut Saikua , told cheering supporters .
" When Abhisit works in his office he will be reminded that he is sitting on the people 's blood . "
Abhisit has not entered his office at Government House since preliminary protests started on Friday .
Minutes afterwards a government medical cleanup team in white coats , face masks and rubber gloves hosed down the site .
Health authorities had warned that the protest risked spreading disease if infected blood splashed bystanders .
Hundreds of protesters then marched and rode pickup trucks and motorcycles to the nearby ruling Democrat party headquarters and splashed several more jugs of blood on the pavement outside .
Surat Horachaikul , a political scientist at Bangkok 's Chulalongkorn University , said he believed the protest organisers lacked plans for their next step and that the protests might end in a few days .
" If nothing comes out of this rally the government is likely going to become more stable , " he said .
Despite continued anxiety over possible violence , the stock exchange of Thailand and Thai baht currency have remained stable .
Many Bangkok residents , even those sympathetic to the Red Shirt cause , say they are simply tired of the years of turmoil that have hurt the economy .
" I want the protest to stop as soon as possible .
My business would be better , I hope , " said Suwan Pana - ngham , a downtown food vendor .
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S THEORETICALLY very simple : the architecture of a plan -- you know , that written thing that 's supposed to help guide your activity .
It does n't matter if we 're creating a plan to manage a project or a plan to reinvent an institution , the architecture of it ought to be pretty much the same .
In its most basic , stripped - down state , a plan is a hierarchy of information , built up in layers like the foundation of a house .
The " house " , which the foundation supports , is the result the planner is seeking to achieve .
For the project manager it 's completing an activity on time and on / under budget .
For the institutional re-inventor it's about articulating and achieving a new vision or a renewed mission .
I typically use three different kinds of informational layers in building a plan : 1 ) broad overarching goals shaped by mission and understandings of external needs and realities ; 2 ) sets of focused activities that , over the life of the plan , will achieve goals ; and 3 ) specific individualized action steps , or tasks , to accomplish activities .
These three layers go by a number of names , but the key is that they form a hierarchy of information -- broad ---> focused ---> specific and individualized -- that I believe is critical to building a foundation strong enough to hold the house we envision .
For many people this is a tough hierarchy to understand , let alone master .
Countless organizations consider a list of tasks , untethered to goals or a mission , as a plan .
But a list of tasks is nothing more than a " to do " list , which can lead an individual or organization in any direction if not informed or kept in check by the informational layers above it .
Here 's an example of one organization 's " goals " for a five - year period :
develop a website
develop job descriptions
review personnel policies
clean out the basement
organize filing system
collect email addresses of members
Are these really goals ?
They are so specific , so obviously boundaried in scope , that they clearly support some larger -- although not articulated -- directions or overarching mission that they really belong in the third layer of information .
It 's a lot easier for people to get their heads around tasks , it seems -- and why not ? -- many of us live out our daily lives in the form of " to do " lists .
But , if we are ever to accomplish the meaningful stuff of personal or institutional life , we must have the " house " and at least the first layer of information clearly in our sights .
So , here 's a thought -- a relatively painless , low - tech , and maybe even fun way to review the construction of your plan : gather a group together ( ideally board members and staff ) , give them a bunch of colored index cards ( one color for goals , one for sets of focused activities , one for tasks ) and ask them to dissect your current plan according to those three layers of information .
When everyone is finished , sort the cards by color on a big table .
What emerges ?
Will you be changing the colors of some of the information ?
After you 've done that , what information gaps are you facing ?
How will you fill them ?
Big lag in test scores for blacks , Hispanics
Despite a seventh straight year of improved test scores statewide , results released today show California schools failed to make a significant dent in a historically immovable achievement gap - one that leaves black and Hispanic students lagging well behind their white and Asian peers .
Based on the rate of improvement from 2003 to 2009 , it would take up to 105 years to close the white / Hispanic achievement gap and at least 189 years to close the white / black gap , which has failed to narrow by even a point in English since 2003 , according to scores released today .
It would take even longer for Hispanic and black students to perform on the standardized tests on par with Asian students , who post the highest scores in the state in both math and English .
State Superintendent Jack O'Connell called the gap a civil rights issue that cannot be blamed on economics alone .
Wealthier black students score well below their white and Asian counterparts , including those who are from low - income families .
Different starting points
" These results do not suggest students can't learn , " O'Connell said .
" The reality is the starting line is not the same for all our students . "
O'Connell noted that many children do n't start kindergarten with the advantage of a quality preschool program , and others do n't have enough medical care to keep them healthy enough to learn .
Across the state , 50 percent of children were proficient or above in English , up from 46 percent the year before .
In Math , 46 percent were at least proficient , a gain of three points .
Yet statewide , only 37 percent of African American and Hispanic students were proficient or above in English - 31 points behind white students and 36 points behind Asian students .
" The lack of progress in truly closing these gaps is appalling , " said Linda Murray , acting executive director of the Education Trust - West , an Oakland nonprofit agency promoting educational equity in a statement .
The state administers the tests to students in grades two through 11 in math and English , with high school students also tested in history and science .
For years , even decades , educators and policymakers have vowed to conquer the achievement gap and they have spent billions of dollars trying to do so - money spent on class - size reduction , teacher training , summer school , after - school programs , mentoring , tutoring and technology , among a long spending list .
O'Connell has renewed efforts to tackle the most vexing problem in public education , with task forces and research aimed at finding the answers .
Cultural challenges
Education officials have sat down with the directors of university education programs in an effort to get the system to churn out new teachers who understand the challenges and cultural issues that low - performing students bring when they get to school .
The state is highlighting districts and local programs that have showed promise , hoping to replicate the ideas where applicable .
San Francisco is among the districts showing some measure of success in closing the gap - a small dent , but progress nonetheless .
" We have cause to celebrate .
Our whole district made significant gains and our African - American and Latino students made even greater gains than their peers , " said Superintendent Carlos Garcia .
" We still have a long way to go but this shows it can be done . "
O'Connell , Garcia and other education officials , however , cautioned that the situation could get worse in the coming year as the state 's budget crisis is felt in the schools .
Already summer school was reduced or eliminated across the state , class sizes in many schools will go up when school starts while the academic year will be shorter and teachers will likely have little help in finding new ways to teach struggling children .
" This is all going to contribute to a greater challenge for education , " O'Connell said .
" I 'm really concerned for next year 's test scores . "
99.99 % of our photography falls within a certain acceptable range of exposure — one filled with color and detail .
Last week 's Shooting Challenge was dedicated to the rare .01 % that 's blinded by the light .
The resulting shots are incredible .

Flyers going after Sergei Bobrovsky ( Photo © metallurg - nk.ru )
After the reported interest in Evgeny Bodrov , the Philadelphia Flyers seems to be going after young goalie Sergei Bobrovsky of Metallurg Novokuznetsk , as per Sport - Express .
Bobrovsky , 21 , spent his entire career with Metallurg Novokuznetsk and is the team ’s starter goalie for the past three seasons and he always had a saves percentage of more than .900 .
Playing for one of the weakest KHL teams he faced every night a good amount of shots and showed that he can deal well with pressure .
In his career Bobrovsky represented Russia at the 2008 WJC and at the 2007 Super Series against Canada .
His contract will run out in April and the Flyers will have to work hard to secure him as surely most of the top KHL teams are going to offer him good deals .
SKA St. Petersburg were among them .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Motorists under the influence of drugs are a growing threat on U.S. roads , while the number who drink and drive has fallen thanks to education and law enforcement , a top U.S. drug control official said on Tuesday .

The United States is calling for discussions at United Nations level to tackle “ drugged driving ” and says it wants to collect data to gauge the scale of the problem among public sector drivers and commercial truckers .
“ If you think about driving on an American road on a Friday or Saturday evening about 16 percent of the vehicles - one in six of the cars - ( the driver ) will be under the influence of an illicit or licit drug , ” Gil Kerlikowske , director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy , said .
“ Drugged driving is a significant problem . ” he told reporters at a week - long U.N. drug policy review meeting .
Kerlikowske , a former Seattle police chief , said figures showed one of the main problems was with people using marijuana and then getting behind the wheel .
But he said in a statement to the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs ( CND ) meeting in Vienna that both illicit drugs and prescription or other pharmaceutical drugs could cause severe problems on the road .
He described the way in which “ drugged driving ” hampered judgment , reaction time , driving skills and memory and called for the issue to be debated as an official topic at the next CND meeting in 2011 .
He also said the United States ’ new drug control strategy , to be published in several weeks , will focus more efforts on prevention and treatment of drug abuse while continuing to clamp down on drug trafficking domestically and internationally .
In a separate briefing Kerlikowske ’s Russian counterpart praised bilateral anti-drug efforts under the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama , particularly in Afghanistan .
“ We can say ( joint ) activity has been intensified ( now ) , ” Victor Ivanov , head of the Russian Anti-Narcotics Service told journalists .
Russia is the world ’s largest heroin consumer .
He said the two countries had agreed to conduct operations on certain facilities in Afghanistan , producer of over 90 percent of the world ’s opium , which fuels a $ 65 billion illegal market and helps fund the insurgent Taliban .
Ivanov said Russian and U.S. authorities had also exchanged names of people working in the drug trade in Afghanistan that they wanted to target .

It is unclear whether China is selling US Treasuries after cutting its holdings for three months in a row , or what its motive may be .
There are concerns that Beijing may be sending a coded message before the US Treasury rules next month on whether China is a " currency manipulator " , though experts say China is clearly still buying dollar assets because it is holding down the yuan against the greenback .
Some investors may be selling Treasuries as a precaution against a trade spat .
There are millions of websites out there .
Many of them are unique , either in small ways or in large ones .
But the individual impact of any particular site on the overall Internet is generally negligible , if there ’s any impact at all .
Not so with the fifteen sites here .
These sites changed the Internet , mostly for good , in substantial ways .
Included here is everything from Geocities ( which could probably be blamed entirely , either directly or indirectly , for every ugly web design “ trend ” that ’s ever been ) to Wikipedia ( which has made information almost universally accessible ) to Google ( which has changed or influenced virtually everything online ) .
1. Wikipedia
Changed the way we find information .
BeforeWikipedia , most online encyclopedias were either sorely lacking in knowledge , or required you to have a paid subscription to access their content .
Wikipedia changed all that by not only allowing anyone to view the content for free but also by allowing individual users to review and update content , making it more complete and accurate overall .
Wikipedia also brought crowdsourcing and user - generated content to the mainstream online , making both much more viable and valuable .
2. Amazon.com
Changed the way we shop .
Prior to Amazon.com , online shopping was n’t much different than shopping out of a mail - order catalog , except it was n’t nearly as popular .
While Amazon started out selling just books and related items , it has expanded to sell virtually anything you can think of , either directly or through partner sites large and small .
Amazon also made free shipping a standard on orders over a certain dollar value , which has impacted the shipping rates and policies of many other online retailers .
3. Hotmail
Changed the way we use email .
Before Hotmail came along , email was basically tethered to a single computer .
When you checked your email , it was pulled and deleted from the remote server , meaning the only place you could view it was at your computer .
Need an email at home that you received at work ?
Too bad .
There was no way to access it unless you went back to the office .
Hotmail changed all that by providing webmail that could be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection .
Now , web - based email is widely used and provided by a huge variety of providers .
Even though Hotmail is no longer the primary provider of webmail ( and is now owned by Microsoft ) , they were still pioneers in the technology .
4. Facebook
Changed the way friends connected
While Facebook was n’t the first social network , it has definitely become the most popular and has really changed the way friends interact with one another .
Sure , people use FB to talk online , but they ’re also increasingly using it as a way to plan get - togethers offline .
They ’re using it to follow and interact with their favorite bands , actors , and other personalities .
People use it to keep in touch with business contacts , friends , family , and acquaintances .
Facebook has made social networking mainstream , across a variety of demographics and virtually worldwide .
5. Project Gutenberg
Changed the way we read
Project Gutenberg has a much longer history than most people realize .
They created the first ebooks , and gave them away for free .
You can now read virtually every major book in the public domain , sometimes in multiple languages on their site .
Without the pioneering steps the founders of Project Gutenberg took , ebooks would not be where they are today .
6. Twitter
Changed the way we communicate
Twitterhas made one of the most significant impacts on the Internet in recent memory .
The idea that 140 - character messages , broadcast publicly ( for the most part ) , would change the way people communicate with one another would have been hard to believe ten years ago .
But Twitter has become not just a powerhouse in the way individuals communicate with one another , but also in the way businesses communicate with their customers .
Complaining about poor customer service on Twitter can often result in almost instant messages from the company in question , and often results in a satisfactory resolution .
Twitter has also made celebrities more accessible , with hundreds of celebs now using the service to interact with their fans .
7. Pandora
Changed the way we find new music
BeforePandora , if you wanted to listen to music online , you usually turned to a streaming radio station with pre-programmed content .
Sure , you might get lucky and find a station that had mostly music you liked , but maybe it was n’t diverse enough , or it still kept playing that one song you HATED .
Pandora changed all that .
Now , you can program your radio station by just entering the name of a song or artist and then giving the thumbs up or down to the music played .
With a minimal amount of user input , Pandora has gotten surprisingly good at creating playlists that reflect one ’s musical taste .
The bonus is that songs or artists you might not have heard of are often thrown into the mix , based on what you already like .
8. Apple
Made minimalist web design cool
Apple had one of the first corporate websites designed with a minimalist aesthetic .
As far back as the late 90s , Apple was starting to show a more minimalist take on web design than many other corporate sites , and by early 2000 , they ’d adopted the white and gray color scheme and top navigation they still employ today .
9. YouTube
Changed entertainment
Before YouTube , there were n’t many options if you wanted to watch a video online .
You could sometimes find a video here or there , but with bandwidth costs , they were few and far between .
Website owners just did n’t want to pay the extra costs associated with video content
Then YouTube came along and made it free to post any video you wanted ( as long as it was n’t copyrighted or over ten minutes long ) .
Web users now had a centralized place to go to watch video online .
And because of YouTube ’s pioneering effort , online video is now enjoyed by millions every day .
10 . Craigslist
Changed classifieds
Online classified sites used to be nearly unusable .
Between the huge number of spam postings and the fact there were few if any local listings in most areas , there was n’t much point in using them .
But then Craigslist caught on and suddenly there was an online classifieds site that rivaled most local newspaper classifieds .
Now you can use Craigslist to find almost anything , no matter where you live .
11 . The Drudge Report
Changed the stature of online news
When the Monica Lewinsky / President Clinton story broke in 1998 , it was n’t a mainstream news source that first reported it .
Instead , The Drudge Report held those honors , forever changing the standing of online news sources .
Now , online news sources break stories on a regular basis , and are considered by most to be just as reliable as television or print news sources .
12 . GeoCities
Made the web more accessible
In the early days of the Internet , the only people online ( for the most part ) were scientists , academics , and those involved in technology .
It was n’t a very exciting place .
Then came GeoCities , and suddenly anyone could set up their own webpage for free .
Sure , GeoCities spawned a legion of horrifically ugly websites , but it also got a lot of regular people involved in the Internet for the first time and was likely the first design experience of many early web designers .
13 . Digg
Changed the way we find and share news
Digg was originally set up as an experiment , but it has completely changed the way many people find news online .
The idea of users determining which news was important , relevant , and interesting rather than editors or executives at big news organizations was revolutionary .
Now , user - generated news sites are all over the place , both for mainstream news and for individual industries and niches .
14 . LiveJournal
Hooked millions on blogging
Blogging was n’t invented by LiveJournal , but they were the first site to offer free blogs to their members .
Millions now use LiveJournal , and tens of millions more blog elsewhere , either through other blog hosts or on their own websites .
If it were n’t for LiveJournal and similar free blogs hosts that came later , blogging might not have caught on as the global phenomenon it has become .
15 . Google
Changed everything
This one might seem a bit dramatic , but it really is true .
Google has invaded virtually every aspect of the Internet .
No matter what you do online , you probably interact with one Google service or another multiple times every day .
And most people use at least one Google product or service one a regular basis personally .
Whether it ’s a Blogger blog , a Picasa photo album , a Google search , or even a YouTube video ( or any of the dozens of other services Google owns ) , Google - controlled sites are everywhere .

Have designs on a career creating video games ?
Now there 's a cheat sheet to help you find the best schools .
Head west , to the University of Southern California 's Interactive Media Division , for the top undergraduate education in game design .
That 's the finding of a new listing from test - prep company The Princeton Review , known for its annual college " best " lists , including Best - Value Colleges ( BestValueColleges.usatoday.com ) — and , let 's be honest , its best party school list as well .
THE RANKINGS : Top 50 game design schools
Seven other top schools are sprinkled along the East and West coasts :
• No . 2 : DigiPen Institute of Technology , Redmond , Wash .
( Graduate Kim Swift developed award - winning game Portal . )
• No . 3 : Drexel University , Philadelphia .
( Alums include creators of Alien Hominid and composer for Myst III and IV . )
• No . 4 : Becker College , Worcester , Mass .
• No . 5 : Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Troy , N.Y. ( Graduate Kathrik Bala is CEO of Vicarious Visions , maker of Guitar Hero games for the Wii . )
• No .
6 : The Art Institute of Vancouver , British Columbia .
• No . 7 : Worcester ( Mass . ) Polytechnic Institute .
( Grad Mike Gesner is lead designer on virtual world Second Life . )
• No . 8 : Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge .
" Our core mission is providing parents and students with good admission advice , " says David Soto , director of content development at The Princeton Review .
" We 're hoping this can add legitimacy to an emerging market . "
After The Princeton Review collaborated two years ago with game developer Ubisoft on its own My SAT Coach game for the Nintendo DS and subsequently released test - prep apps for the iPhone , " we got the idea that this seemed to be an emerging field , " Soto says .
In all , The Princeton Review surveyed 500 schools before arriving at its top 50 with game design studies .
( See the full list at gamehunters.usatoday.com . )
Programs were evaluated on four main criteria : academics ( courses and skills fostered ) , faculty ( especially the percentage who had worked in the industry ) , infrastructure ( technology and game laboratories ) and career ( internships , job placement ) .
" The schools that scored exceptionally well , the top eight , were really top - notch when it came to all four , " he says .
GamePro magazine is publishing the list in its April issue , on sale next week .
" Anyone who considers themselves a hard - core gamer , pretty much their dream job is to get into the industry , " says editor in chief John Davison .
" We wanted to look at finding something to arm ( readers ) with the knowledge and information to do that . "
Top school USC makes good use of its proximity to game studios located in and near Hollywood .
For instance , Electronic Arts has donated $ 8 million to the university 's interactive entertainment program and an endowed faculty chair , currently held by Tracy Fullerton .
Graduates Kellee Santiago and Jenova Chen have created games such as flOw and Flower for the PlayStation Network , and The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom , recently released on Xbox Live , was a thesis project for students Matt Korba and Paul Bellezza .
" People are beginning to understand it really is a career , " says Elizabeth Daley , dean of the USC School of Cinematic Arts , which houses the Interactive Media Division .
She cautions parents who overly fret about their children 's obsessions with video games .
" This is a growth industry , a big growth industry , " she says .
" And I think we are going to see wonderful things happen that we have n't even imagined yet . "
For the first time in 10 years , teen pregnancy is on the rise and no one is sure what 's to blame .
Is it the media ?
Politics ?
Education or lack thereof ?
Check out some of the reasons why people think there 's been an uptick and tell us what you think is the cause .
Adventures in Sex City
Adventures in Sex City was developed in collaboration with Mind Your Mind , an internationally acclaimed , London - based youth mental health website and support program .
Together we recruited a group of youth advisors aged 16 - 20 to come up with ideas about how to make sexual health information fun and interesting .
Everything in Adventures in Sex City has been directly influenced by the creativity of the youth advisors .
Without them none of this would have been possible .
In Adventures in Sex City Part 1 , you can test your knowledge of safe sex and the facts about sexually transmitted infections .
In Part 2 , you can test your knowledge and learn the facts about substance misuse .
So go ahead and play !
Apple has lashed out at HTC with a lawsuit alleging 20 different patent infringements related to the iPhone 's user interface , underlying architecture and hardware .
The violated patents center on touch and gesture features , including finger - swipe unlocking mechanisms , power conservation , touch - screen scrolling , and accelerometer capabilities .
Apple seeks to ban the sale of HTC phones running Google 's Android operating system as it allegedly copies iPhone functionality .
Windows Mobile is also accused of stealing iPhone hardware decoders .
HTC manufactures the most popular Android handsets , including the first G1 and the Nexus One .
Other phones singled out in the suit are the Touch Pro , Touch Diamond , Touch Pro2 , Tilt II , Pure , Imagio , Dream , myTough 3G , Hero , HD2 and Droid Eris .
According to Apple , HTC has repeatedly cribbed from the iPhone design .
" We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it .
We 've decided to do something about it .
We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours , " Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs said in a statement .
The lawsuit was filed with the US International Trade Commission and the US District Court in Delaware .
" HTC values patent rights and their enforcement but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations .
Until we have had this opportunity , we are unable to comment on the validity of the claims being made against HTC , " an HTC spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times .
Microsoft declined to comment .
You can check out the full Apple complaint here .
A few of the specific patent infringements :
Unlocking A Device By Performing Gestures On An Unlock Image
System And Method For Managing Power Conditions Within A Digital Camera Device
Automated Response To And Sensing Of User Activity In Portable Devices
So what 's Apple seeking ?
" A permanent injunction , which would bar HTC from importing or selling phones here that use these patents , along with triple damages with maximum interest . "
That last part means a big bail of cash ; Apple is clearly not messing around .
Some industry experts believe the suit is an indirect shot at Google , whose Android OS does indeed use multitouch liberally .
If all this sounds familiar , it is .
Last year Apple sued Nokia for similar reasons .
Apple COO
Tim Cook made a statement that is pretty much a replica of Jobs ' : " We 're very , very comfortable with where we are competitively …we like competition , as long as they do n't rip off our [ intellectual property ] … and if they do , we 'll go after them . "
There were also grumblings about Apple suing Palm that have n't yet come to fruition .

Steve Jobs ate his hat when he announced the iBook application for the tablet , but the iBook portends a bright future for web designers too .
Wait , what ?
Books and web designers , how are they even related ?
One word : EPUB .
EPUB is a publishing standard designed for reflowable content which means the book can be viewed on devices of multiple dimensions .
It does this by using XHTML / CSS for rendering the book and a set of standards on top of that to store metadata that can be extracted by E - Book readers to render a table of contents and other details .
EPUB is a collection of 3 specifications :
Open Publication Structure ( OPS ) 2.0 , defines what formats are allowed to be used for the content ( e.g. XHTML 1.1 and CSS 2 ) .
Open Packaging Format ( OPF ) 2.0 , describes metadata , and structure of the .epub file in XML
OEBPS Container Format ( OCF ) 1. , specifies the directory structure of the EPUB ZIP archive .
EPUB has most recently found an advocate in Apple , but is also supported by many stand - alone Book readers like Stanza , Adobe Digital Editions , Bookworm , Sony Reader , and more .
Officially , Kindle does not support EPUB , but Savory is an application you can download to Kindle , which converts EPUB to Kindle format on the fly .
What is in it for you , Web Designer ?
Authors are attempting to self - publish e-books , and realise they need HTML expertise to do so .
With your superior HTML knowledge you would have a great opportunity to win authors as clients .
Kindle sales are one of the driving factors of Amazon ’s 71 % increase in profit since the last financial year .
Most e-books today are created by automated tools which are , at best , tag soup generators with no concern for design .
My guess is publishers who consistently output great e-book designs would do much better in the marketplace .
How do I get started ?
What about HTML5 & CSS3 ?
I know it is cool to talk about HTML5 and CSS3 , but you can not use any of that in an EPUB book .
EPUB is an open format but no new version of the specifications have been released since 2007 ( one of them is dated 2006 ) .
XHTML format has , since then , become extinct too .
There is no public roadmap , nor are the mailing list archives open to non-members ( you need to pay USD1000 / year to be a member ) .
From the Bug Tracker , it seems like there will be a new version sometime in the future .
Open Publication Structure officially requires EPUB readers to support SVG , but only Adobe Digital Editions supports it .
EPUB also supports embedded fonts ( preferably OTF ) using the CSS2 definition of the @font - face rule .
Open Publication Structure does not talk about displaying HTML5 Videos or Flash animations and most EPUB readers do not support them .
Internationalization
< p>Open Publication Structure < a href= " http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops/OPS_2.0_final_spec.html#Section1.3.6 " title = " Open Publication Structure ( OPS ) 2.0 v1.0 " > spectacularly fails to make the case for internationalization < /a > , and most popular EPUB readers do not support non-western glyphs .
The only way you can get around it is by embedding the font required to display international characters within the EPUB archive .
</ p> < p>Fortunately , < a href= " http://www.infibeam.com/Pi " title= " Infibeam.com Pi - India 's First eBook Reader " >EPUB readers sold in India and China < / a > seem to have out - of - the box support for non-western fonts .
</ p> < p > You have even < a href = " http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/epub-needs-support-vertical-directionality-writing " title= " EPUB needs support for vertical directionality in writing | EPUB Maintenance " > worse luck trying to render languages with vertical script </ a> ( and most historical texts in Asia are written in them ) .
</ p> < p
>
There is a way to get around it using < a href = " http://blogs.adobe.com/digitaleditions/2007/08/bidirectional_text_and_mathml.html " title= " Digital Editions : Bidirectional text and MathML " >SVG in Adobe Digital Editions </a >.
But , as the comments note , this is not good enough .
That article was written in 2007 , and there is still no sign of internationalization in Adobe Digital Editions .
</p>
How do I keep track of this in case it becomes as cool as HTML5 ?
Hopefully this post will spur you to become an E - Book designer .
You know where to send royalty cheques in case you become a world - famous one !
New Austerity Measures Athens Turns Screws on Civil Servants as EU Hints at Help
In response to European Union pressure , Greece on Wednesday announced a further round of savings measures worth 4.8 billion euros .
The plan calls for tax hikes and a 30 percent reduction in vacation bonuses for civil servants .
Berlin has welcomed the move but says no direct aid to Athens will be forthcoming .

In an unprecedented turn of events Rhino poaching has reached a new level .
It is without a doubt that the war on poaching and wildlife crimes has escalated to such a point where organized crime syndicates are getting involved .
These are not your typical locals using machine guns , snares and spears .
They are highly organized , highly trained individuals from crime syndicates using high - tech weaponry and vehicles .
They have systematically planned missions to go in , kill , and take what they need and leave without a trace .
On Monday 8 March 2010 two female Rhinos were illegally killed on the Rietvlei Nature Reserve in South Africa .
From the evidence collected at the crime scene it is apparent that the perpetrators used a dart gun to kill the animals and that they were in a helicopter .
The rhinos were overdosed with tranquilizers and killed .
The poachers cut off the horns and left the crime scene by helicopter .
The carcasses of the two animals were discovered by Nature Conservation staff of the City of Tshwane .

Background -----------
In order to multitask with threads , a critical part of the Python interpreter implementation concerns the behavior of I / O operations such as read , write , send , and receive .
Specifically , whenever an I/ O operation is carried out , the interpreter releases the GIL so that other threads can run while the program waits for the I/O operation to complete .
Observed Behavior of I / O Operations
------------------------------------
The release of the GIL for I/O is a critical aspect of making sure the interpreter does n't make all threads hang while waiting .
However , the release of the GIL also assumes a worst - case scenario .
In practice , a large number of I/O requests actually complete immediately with no actual blocking .
For example , if a program is sending on a socket , send ( ) operations will typically complete immediately if buffer space is available to accept the data .
Likewise , read ( ) and recv( ) operations may return immediately if data is already available in the operating system .
For system calls that complete immediately , a thread quickly releases and then almost immediately reacquires the GIL to continue running .
However , given that the I/ O operation did n't block , the release of the GIL was technically unnecessary in this case .
Behavior of the new GIL
-----------------------
A feature of the new Python GIL implementation is that the interpreter no longer periodically signals waiting threads ( e.g. , the check interval ) .
Instead , thread switching is based on a timed wait on a condition variable .
Should a timeout occur , a thread will indicate that it wants the GIL and the currently running thread will be forced to give it up .
Although this scheme solves the problem of CPU - bound threads thrashing , it introduces a highly pronounced " convoy effect " when CPU - bound threads and I / O bound threads get mixed together .
A major part of the problem is caused by the bahvior of I/O as described above .
Specifically , when an I/O bound thread executes an I/O call , it always releases the GIL .
Since the GIL is released , a CPU bound thread is now free to acquire the GIL and run .
However , if the I/O call completes immediately ( which is common ) , the I/O bound thread immediately stalls upon return from the system call .
To get the GIL back , it now has to go through the timeout process to force the CPU - bound thread to release the GIL again .
It should be noted that the behavior described also occurs in Python 2 , but due to the small check interval , an I/ O bound thread that wants the GIL back will tend to get it without having to wait very long .
Example -------
Here is a very simple example that illustrates the problem .
In this example , there is one CPU - bound thread that hammers the CPU and there is an I/ O bound thread that handles some network communication ( an echo server ) : # iotest.py import time import threading from socket import * # CPU - bound thread ( just hammers the CPU ) def spin ( ) : while True : pass # I / O - bound thread ( an echo TCP server ) def echo_server ( ) : s = socket ( AF_INET , SOCK_STREAM ) s.setsockopt( SOL_SOCKET , SO_REUSEADDR,1 ) s.bind ( ( " " ,15000 ) ) s.listen ( 1 ) while True : c , a = s.accept ( ) while True : data = c.recv ( 8192 ) if not data : break c.sendall( data ) c.close ( ) s.close ( ) # Launch the CPU - bound thread t1 = threading .
Thread ( target=spin ) t1.daemon=True t1.start ( ) # Run the I/O server echo_server ( )
Here is a benchmark program that runs as a client for the echo_server ( ) thread defined above .
It sends a sequence of messages and reads the response back .
It then reports some timings at the end .
# echoclient.py from socket import * import time CHUNKSIZE = 16384 NUMMESSAGES = 640 # Total of 10MB # Dummy message msg = b " x " * CHUNKSIZE # Connect and send messages s = socket ( AF_INET , SOCK_STREAM ) s.connect ( ( " " , 15000 ) ) start = time .
time ( ) for n in range ( NUMMESSAGES ) : s.sendall(msg ) bytes_recv = len ( msg ) #
Get the response back while bytes_recv > 0 : data = s.recv( bytes_recv ) bytes_recv -= len( data ) s.close ( ) end = time .
time ( ) print ( " %0.3 f seconds ( %0.3 f bytes /sec ) " % ( end-start , ( CHUNKSIZE * NUMMESSAGES ) / ( end - start ) ) ) Performance Results
-------------------
These results are from running the above programs on a dual - core MacBook running OS -X Snow Leopard .
I also get similar behavior on a quad - core desktop machine .
If you run the iotest .py program using Python 2.6.4 and execute the client , you get this result : bash % python echoclient.py 1.064 seconds ( 9854148.739 bytes/sec )
If you switch the iotest.py to Python 3.2 and rerun , you get this result : bash % python echoclient .py 12.340 seconds ( 849726.150 bytes/sec )
Notice that there is a factor 12 performance difference .
Modify the iotest .py program so that there are 2 CPU - bound threads spinning .
Just add this extra code : t2 = threading .
Thread ( target=spin ) t2.daemon t2.start ()
Now , repeat the above tests .
For Python 2.6.4 , you get this : bash - 3.2 $ python echoclient.py 0.358 seconds ( 29319821.410 bytes/sec )
( Yes the performance actually improves !
That 's left as an exercise for the reader to figure out why )
Now , switch the iotest .py server to Python 3.2 and retry : base - 3 $ python echoclient.py 59.545 seconds ( 176098.609 bytes/sec )
Notice how the addition of one CPU - bound thread made the time go up by more than a factor 4 !
Now , disable all but one of the CPU cores and try the test again in Python 3.2 : bash - 3.2 $ python echoclient.py 0.120 seconds ( 87246036.201 bytes/sec )
Here , you see that it runs about 500 times faster than with two cores ( yikes ! )
What 's causing this behavior ?
-----------------------------
In the iotest .py program , there is an inner loop that looks like this : while True : data = c.recv ( 8192 ) if not data : break c.sendall ( data )
The I /O operations recv( ) and sendall ( ) always release the GIL when they execute .
However , when this happens , CPU bound threads jump in and start running again .
The problem gets worse as the number of CPU - bound threads increases -- CPU bound threads might cycle round - robin before the I/O bound thread runs again .
The problem is more pronounced on multiple CPU cores because when the GIL is released , one of the cores will typically go handle the system call while the other core wakes up the waiting CPU - bound thread ( which then almost immediately steals the GIL ) .
Is it worth fixing ?
-------------------
I claim yes .
There are many applications , such as those carried out with the multiprocessing library , that will operate by trying to overlap computation and I/ O in some manner ( for example , receiving the next chunk of data to work on while carrying out calculations on the currently received data ) .
In heavily loaded I/ O bound applications such as servers with hundreds of simultaneously connected clients , the release of the GIL on short I / O operations may cause a lot of unintended thrashing as threads cycle amongst themselves .
This would most likely manifest itself as an increased turnaround time for requests .
How to fix ?
-----------
Modify all I/O operations in the interpreter to not release the GIL if they wo n't block .
Either that or maybe there 's some sort of really sneaky easy solution ( unknown ) .
The effect can be minimized by setting the switch interval to a really small value using sys.setswitchinterval ( ) .
However , doing this greatly increases the amount of thread context - switching -- something that 's also undesirable .

Would the idea of priority - GIL requests that Antoine had in his original patch solve this issue ?
msg99459 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2010-02-17 03:00
Just a quick test under Linux ( on a dual quad core machine ) : - with iotest.py and echo_client .py both running Python 2.7 : 25.562 seconds ( 410212.450 bytes/sec ) - with iotest.py and echo_client.py both running Python 3.2 : 28.160 seconds ( 372362.459 bytes/sec )
As already said , the " spinning endlessly " loop is a best case for thread switching latency in 2.x , because the opcodes are very short .
If each opcode in the loop has an average duration of 20 ns , and with the default check interval of 100 , the GIL gets speculatively released every 2 us ( yes , microseconds ) .
That 's why I suggested trying more " realistic " workloads , as in ccbench .
Also , as I told you , there might also be interactions with the various timing heuristics the TCP stack of the kernel applies .
It would be nice to test with UDP .
That said , the observations are interesting .
msg99461 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-02-17 04:01
The comment on the CPU - bound workload is valid -- it is definitely true that Python 2.6 results will degrade as the workload of each tick is increased .
Maybe a better way to interpreter those results is as a baseline of what kind of I/ O performance is possible if there is a quick I /O response time .
However , ignoring that and the comparison between Python 2.6 and 3.2 , there is still a serious performance issue with I/O in 3.2 .
For example , the dramatic decrease in I / O performance as there are more CPU bound threads competing and the fact that there is a huge performance gain when all but one CPU core is disabled .
I tried the test using UDP packets and get virtually the exact same behavior described .
For instance , echoing 10 MB ( sent in 8 k UDP packets ) takes about 0.6s in Python 2.6 and 12.0s in Python - 3.2 .
The time shoots up to more than 40s if there are two CPU - bound threads .
The problem being described really does n't have anything to do with TCP vs. UDP or any part of the network stack .
It has everything to do with how the operating system buffers I/O requests and how I/O operations such as sends and receives complete immediately without blocking depending on system buffer characteristics ( e.g. , if there is space in the send buffer , a send will return immediately without blocking ) .
The fact that the GIL is released when it 's not necessary in these cases is really the source of the problem .
msg99477 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2010-02-17 18:41
We could try not to release the GIL when socket methods are called on a non-blocking socket .
Regardless , I 've re-run the tests under the Linux machine , with two spinning threads : * python 2.7 : 25.580 seconds ( 409914.612 bytes/sec ) * python 3.2 : 32.216 seconds ( 325485.029 bytes/sec ) ( and as someone mentioned , the " priority requests " mechanism which was in the original new GIL patch might improve things .
It 's not an ideal time for me to test , right now :-) )

I 'm attaching Dave 's new UDP - based benchmarks , which eliminate the dependency on the TCP stack 's behaviour .

And here is an experimental patch which enables the " priority requests " mechanism which was in the original new GIL patch .
" Experimental " because it only enables them on a couple of socket methods ( enough to affect the benchmarks ) .
Here are the UDP benchmark results ( with 2 background threads ) : * 2.x trunk ( old GIL ) : 11.379 seconds ( 921515.168 bytes/sec ) * vanilla py3 k ( new GIL ) : 27.400 seconds ( 382689.529 bytes/sec ) * patched py3 k ( new GIL + priority requests ) : 1.828 seconds ( 5737130.676 bytes/sec )
And here 's patched py3 k with 8 background threads : 3.058 seconds ( 3429136.193 bytes/sec ) ( benchmarks run on a 8 - core Linux machine )

I posted some details about the priority GIL modifications I showed during my PyCON open - space session here : http://www.dabeaz.com/blog/2010/02/revisiting-thread-priorities-and-new.html
I am attaching the .tar.gz file with modifications if anyone wants to look at them .
Note : I would not consider this to be solid enough to be any kind of official patch .
People should only look at it for the purposes of experimentation and for coming up with something better .

Here is another patch based on a slightly different approach .
Instead of being explicitly triggered in I/O methods , priority requests are decided based on the computed " interactiveness " of a thread .
Interactiveness itself is a simple saturated counter ( incremented when the GIL is dropped without request , decremented when the GIL is dropped after a request ) .
Benchmark numbers are basically the same as with gilprio2 . patch .

The UDP benchmarks look even better on Windows .
These are results of the attached scripts when running on an Intel Xeon ( quad- core ) 2.33GHz running Windows Server 2003 x64 .

Here 's a short benchmark for everyone who thinks that my original benchmark was somehow related to TCP behavior .
This one does n't even involve sockets : from threading import Thread import time def writenums ( f , n ) : start = time .
time ( ) for x in range ( n ) : f.write ( "
%d
" % x ) end = time .
time ( ) print ( end - start ) def spin ( ) : while True : pass # Uncomment to add a thread # t1 = Thread ( target=spin ) # t1.daemon=True # t1.start( ) writenums ( open ( " / tmp/nums " , " w " ) ,1000000 )
If I run this on my Macbook with no threads , it takes about 1.05 seconds .
If the one spinning thread is turned on , the time jumps to about 4.5 seconds .
What you 're seeing is that the spinning thread unfairly hogs the CPU .
If I use my own patched version ( new GIL with priorities ) , the threaded version drops back down to about 1.10 seconds .
I have not tried it with Antoine 's latest patch , but would expect similar results as he is also using priorities .
Just to be clear , this issue is not specific to sockets or TCP .

On some platforms the difference is not so important .
I ran it in Debian Lenny AMD64 " Core2 Duo P9600 @ 2.66GHz " .
# Python 3.2a0 ( py3k:78982M , Mar 15 2010 , 15:40:42 ) # [ GCC 4.3.4 ] on linux2 0.67s without thread 0.84s with spinning thread

With line buffering , I see the issue .
* 6 s without thread * 115 s with the spinning thread ( varying : 60 s , 98 s ) * 16 s with the spinning thread and the last " gilinter. patch " # Modified version of the test case , with bufsize=1 from threading import Thread import time def writenums ( f , n ) : start = time .
time ( ) for x in range ( n ) : f.write ( "
%d
" % x ) end = time .
time ( ) print ( end - start ) def spin ( ) : while True : pass t1 = Thread ( target=spin ) t1.daemon=True # Uncomment to add a thread # t1.start ( ) # With line buffering writenums ( open ( " ./ nums " , " w " , 1 ) , 1000000 )
msg101125 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-03-15 16:38
Whoa , that 's pretty diabolically evil with bufsize=1 .
On my machine , doing that just absolutely kills the performance ( 13 seconds without the spinning thread versus 557 seconds with the thread ! ) .
Or , put another way , the writing performance drops from about 0.5 Mbyte / sec down to 12 Kbytes / sec with the thread .
With my priority GIL , the time is about 29 seconds with the thread ( consistent with your experiment using the gilinter patch ) .
One thing to think about with this example is the proper priority of I/O handling generally .
What if , instead of a file , this example code was writing on a pipe to another process ?
For that , you would probably want that I / O thread to be able to blast its data to the receiver as fast as it reasonably can so that it can be done with it and get back to other work .
In terms of practical relevance , this test again represents a simple situation where computation is overlapped with I /O processing .
Perhaps the program has just computed a big result which is now being streamed somewhere else by a background thread .
In the meantime , the program is now working on computing the next result ( the spinning thread ) .
Think queues , actors , or any number of similar things --- there are programs that try to operate like this .
msg101127 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-03-15 16:53
Almost forgot -- if I turn off one of the CPU cores , the time drops from 557 seconds to 32 seconds .
Gotta love it !

We should be careful with statements such as " you want probably want [... ] " .
There may be situations where you want such a thing ; others where you do n't really want ( or care about ) it .
While IO responsiveness and throughput can be an important measure of performance , it is not the only one and depending on the situation it actually may not matter at all .
msg101142 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-03-16 01:13
Oh the situation definitely matters .
Although , in the big picture , most programmers would probably prefer to have fast I /O performance over slow I /O performance :-) .

Yes , of course .
But that 's not the point .
We could try to improve GIL behaviour in every thinkable situation , at the expense of code complexity .
But we do n't want to make the code too complex and delicate to maintain , and that 's why I 've asked for advice on python - dev .
msg101146 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-03-16 02:06
I absolutely agree 100 % that it is not worth trying to fix the GIL for every conceivable situation ( although if you could , I would n't complain ) .
To me , there are really only two scenarios worth worrying about : 1 . Get rid of all of that multicore lock thrashing that happens if there are multiple CPU - bound threads competing .
Python programmers should know that intentionally using threads like this wo n't offer a performance boost .
However , it would still be nice to avoid all of that needless overhead when it happens by design or by accident ( the new GIL already addresses this ) .
2 . Make sure that you can get reasonable I/O performance when there is * one* CPU - bound thread competing with some background I /O processing .
This covers the use case of overlapped I/O and computation as well as almost every practical problem related to communicating processes , multiprocessing , queuing , etc .
As for everything else , it 's probably not worth worrying about so much .
If someone is only doing I/O ( e.g. , a web server ) , their code is going to behave about the same as before ( although maybe slightly better under heavy load if there 's less GIL contention ) .
Situations where someone intentionally tries to set up multiple long - running CPU - bound threads seems pretty unlikely --- the very presence of the GIL would n't make that kind of programming model attractive in the first place , so why would they do it ?
msg101148 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-03-16 02:36
You know , I almost wonder whether this whole issue could be fixed by just adding a user - callable function to optionally set a thread priority number .
For example : sys.setpriority(n )
Modify the new GIL code so that it checks the priority of the currently running thread against the priority of the thread that wants the GIL .
If the running thread has lower priority , it immediately drops the GIL .
Other than having this added preemption , do nothing else --- just throw it all back to the user to come up with the proper " priorities . "
If there was something like this , it would completely fix the overlapped compute and I /O problem I mentioned .
I 'd just set a higher priority on the background I / O threads and be done with it .

I tried Florent 's modification to the write test and did not see the effect on my machine with an updated revision of Python32 .
I am running Ubuntu Karmic 64 bit. 7s - no background threads .
20s - one background thread .
According to the following documentation the libc condition is using scheduling policy when waking a thread and not FIFO order :
The following documentation suggests ordering in Linux is not FIFO : http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html#tag_03_518_08_06
I upload a quick and dirty patch ( linux - 7946.patch ) to the new GIL just to reflect this by avoiding the timed waits .
On my machine it behaves reasonably both with the TCP server and with the write test , but so does unpatched Python 3.2 .
I noticed high context switching rate with dave 's priority GIL - with both tests it goes above 40 K /s context switches .

I updated the patch with a small fix and increased the ticks countdown - to - release considerably .
This seems to help the OS classify CPU bound threads as such and actually improves IO performance .

I upload bfs.patch
To apply the patch use the following commands on updated python 3.2 : $ patch - fp1 < bfs.patch $ ./ configure
The patch replaces the GIL with a scheduler .
The scheduler is a simplified implementation of the recent kernel Brain F**k Scheduler by the Linux hacker Con Kolivas : http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/bfs/sched-BFS.txt
" The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler , referred to as BFS from here on , is to completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design .
The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to understand , impossible to model and predict the effect of , and when tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another . "
Con Kolivas is the hacker whose work inspired the current CFS scheduler of the Linux Kernel .
On my core 2 duo laptop it performs as follows compared to the other patches : 1 ) Florent 's writenums ( ) test : ~ same 2 ) UDP test : x6 faster 3 ) cpued test : works as expected , while the other patches starve the pure python threads .
cpued test spins 3 threads , 2 of them pure python and the 3rd does time . sleep ( 0 ) every ~ 1 ms : import threading import time def foo( n ) : while n > 0 : 'y ' in ' x ' * n n -= 1 def bar ( sleep , name ) : for i in range ( 100 ) : print ( name , i , sleep ) for j in range ( 300 ) : foo( 1500 ) if sleep : time.sleep (0 ) t0 = threading .
Thread ( target=bar , args = ( False , ' t0 ' ) ) t1 = threading .
Thread ( target=bar , args = ( False , ' t1 ' ) ) t2 = threading .
Thread ( target=bar , args = ( True , ' t2 - interactive ' ) ) list ( map ( threading .
Thread.start , [ t0 , t1 , t2 ] ) ) list ( map ( threading .
Thread.join , [ t0 , t1 , t2 ] ) )
The patch is still work in progress .
In particular : 1 ) I still need to add support for Windows .
2 ) It currently requires Posix clock_gettime ( ) and assumes good timer resolution .
3 ) I only verified it builds on Ubuntu Karmic 64 bit .
4 ) I still need to optimize it and address cleanup .
The scheduler is very simple , straight forward and flexible , and it addresses the tuning problems discussed recently .
I think it can be a good replacement to the GIL , since Python really needs a scheduler , not a lock .

Wall clock can not help with that .
>

To my understanding it controls the CPU load ( ~6 ) beyond which threads tend to expire .
Since expired threads are handled in FIFO order , IO threads do not preempt them ( IO threads are chronically expired ) .
So beyond that load IO threads become less responsive . >

Ouch .
CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
is not a required part of the standard .

Right , however the man page at kernel.org says the following on CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID : " Sufficiently recent versions of glibc and the Linux kernel support the following clocks " http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/clock_getres.2.html
The same statement shows up as early as 2003 : http://www.tin.org/bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=clock_gettime
However , if this is indeed a problem on some systems ( none Linux ? ) , then a fall back could be attempted for them .
There could also be a problem on systems where the counter exists but has low resolution 10 ms +

But , looking at the patch again , the reason is obvious : # define CHECK_SLICE_DEPLETION( tstate ) ( bfs_check_depleted || ( tstate -> tick_counter % 1000 == 0 ) ) `tstate -> tick_counter % 1000` is replicating the behaviour of the old GIL , which based its speculative operation on the number of elapsed opcodes ( and which also gave bad latency numbers on the regex workload ) .

The flag_check_depleted is there to work around this problem .
It is raised by waiters which timeout .
What distribution and version of GNU / Linux are you using ?
As for the CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clock , support was added to FreeBSD recently in version 7.1 , which I guess is not good enough : http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.1R/relnotes.html
I did not find yet anything on Solaris .

Well , on initial check the scheduler seems to work well with regular gettimeofday ( ) wall clock instead of clock_gettime ( ) . :) /*
Return thread running time in seconds ( with nsec precision ) .
*/ static inline long double get_thread_timestamp( void ) { return get_timestamp ( ) ; // wall clock via gettimeofday ( ) /* struct timespec ts ; clock_gettime ( CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID , &ts ) ; return ( long double ) ts.tv_sec + ts.tv_nsec * 0.000000001 ;*/ }

This was the motivation for using clock_gettime ( ) .
I tried the wall clock version under load ( including on single core system ) and it seems to behave .

Uploaded an update .
A couple remarks on BFS - based patch : - nothing guarantees that you 'll get a msec resolution - gettimeofday returns you wall clock time : if a process that modifies time is running , e.g. ntpd , you 'll likely to run into trouble .
the value returned is _not_ monotonic , but clock_gettime ( CLOCK_MONOTONIC ) is - inline functions are used , but it's not ANSI - static inline long double get_timestamp ( void ) { struct timeval tv ; GETTIMEOFDAY ( &tv ) ; return ( long double ) tv.tv_sec + tv.tv_usec * 0.000001 ; } the product is computed as double , and then promoted as ( long double ) .
- the code uses a lot of floating point calculation , which is slower than integer Otherwise : "- You know , I almost wonder whether this whole issue could be fixed by just adding a user - callable function to optionally set a thread priority number .
For example : sys.setpriority(n )
Modify the new GIL code so that it checks the priority of the currently running thread against the priority of the thread that wants the GIL .
If the running thread has lower priority , it immediately drops the GIL . "
The problem with this type of fixed - priority is starvation .
And it should n't be up to the user to set the priorities .
And some threads can mix I/O and CPU intensive tasks . >
It 's a dual - core Linux x86 - 64 system .
But , looking at the patch again , the reason is obvious : > > # define CHECK_SLICE_DEPLETION( tstate ) ( bfs_check_depleted || ( tstate > > tick_counter % 1000 == 0 ) ) > > `tstate -> tick_counter % 1000` is replicating the behaviour of the old GIL , which based its speculative operation on the number of elapsed opcodes ( and which also gave bad latency numbers on the regex workload ) .
I find this suspicous too .
I have n't looked at the patch in detail , but what does the number of elapsed opcodes offers you over the timesplice expiration approach ?
Some more remarks : - COND_TIMED_WAIT
macro modifies timeout_result when pthread_cond_timewait expires .
But timeout_result is not an int pointer , just an int .
So it is never updated , and as a result , bfs_check_depleted is never set after a thread has waited for the current running thread to schedule it in vain ( in _bfs_timed_wait ) .
- the scheduling function bfs_find_task returns the first task that has an expired deadline .
since an expired deadline probably means that the scheduler has n't run for a while , it might be worth it to look for the thread with the oldest deadline and serve it first , instead of stopping at the first one - calls to COND_WAIT / COND_TIMED_WAIT should be run in loops checking for the predicate , since it might be false even after these call return ( spurious wakeups , etc ) : " In general , whenever a condition wait returns , the thread has to re-evaluate the predicate associated with the condition wait to determine whether it can safely proceed , should wait again , or should declare a timeout .
A return from the wait does not imply that the associated predicate is either true or false .
It is thus recommended that a condition wait be enclosed in the equivalent of a " while loop " that checks the predicate . "
Please disregard my remark on COND_TIMED_WAIT not updating timeout_result , it 's wrong ( it 's really a macro , not a function ... )

I uploaded an update to bfs. patch which improves behavior in particular on non-Linux multi-core ( 4+ ) machines .
Hi Charles - Francois ,
Thanks for taking the time to review this patch ! > - nothing guarantees that you 'll get a msec resolution Right , the code should behave well with low precision clocks as long as short ( sub - tick ) tasks are not synchronized with the slice interval .
There is a related discussion of this problem in schedulers in the section on sub - tick accounting in : http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/bfs/sched-BFS.txt
On which target systems can we expect not to have high precision clock ? > - gettimeofday returns you wall clock time : if a process that modifies time is running , e.g. ntpd , you 'll likely to run into trouble .

timestamp is used for waiting and therefore I think the source should be either CLOCK_REALTIME or gettimeofday ( ) .

More accurate yielding .

This is by design of BFS as I understand it .
Next thread to run is either first expired or oldest deadline : http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/bfs/sched-BFS.txt
" Once a task is descheduled , it is put back on the queue , and an O ( n ) lookup of all queued - but - not - running tasks is done to determine which has the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next .
The one caveat to this is that if a deadline has already passed ( jiffies is greater than the deadline ) , the tasks are chosen in FIFO ( first in first out ) order as the deadlines are old and their absolute value becomes decreasingly relevant apart from being a flag that they have been asleep and deserve CPU time ahead of all later deadlines .

The attached patch makes two simple refinements to the new GIL implemented in Python 3.2 .
Each is briefly described below .
1 . Changed mechanism for thread time expiration
In the current implementation , threads perform a timed - wait on a condition variable .
If time expires and no thread switches have occurred , the currently running thread is forced to drop the GIL .
In the patch , timeouts are now performed by a special " GIL monitor " thread .
This thread runs independently of Python and simply handles time expiration .
Basically , it records the number of thread switches , sleeps for a specified interval ( 5 ms ) , and then looks at the number of thread switches again .
If no switches occurred , it forces the currently running thread to drop the GIL .
With this monitor thread , it is no longer necessary to perform any timed condition variable waits .
This approach has a few subtle benefits .
First , threads no longer sit in a wait / timeout cycle when trying to get the GIL ( so , there is less overhead ) .
Second , you get FIFO scheduling of threads .
When time expires , the thread that has been waiting the longest on the condition variable runs next .
Generally , you want this .
2 . A very simple two - level priority mechanism A new attribute ' cpu_bound ' is added to the PyThreadState structure .
If a thread is ever forced to drop the GIL , this attribute is simply set True ( 1 ) .
If a thread gives up the GIL voluntarily , it is set back to False ( 0 ) .
This attribute is used to set up simple scheduling ( described next ) .
There are now two separate condition variables ( gil_cpu_cond ) and ( gil_io_cond ) that separate waiting threads according to their cpu_bound attribute setting .
CPU - bound threads wait on gil_cpu_cond whereas I /O - bound threads wait on gil_io_cond .
Using the two condition variables , the following scheduling rules are enforced : - If there are any waiting I / O bound threads , they are always signaled first , before any CPU - bound threads .
-
If an I/ O bound thread wants the GIL , but a CPU - bound thread is running , the CPU - bound thread is immediately forced to drop the GIL .
-
If a CPU - bound thread wants the GIL , but another CPU - bound thread is running , the running thread is immediately forced to drop the GIL if its time period has already expired .
Results -------
This patch gives excellent results for both the ccbench test and all of my previous I /O bound tests .

--------------
This patch does not involve any complicated libraries , platform specific functionality , low - level lock twiddling , or mathematically complex priority scheduling algorithms .
Emphasize :
The code is simple .
Negative Aspects
----------------
This modification might introduce a starvation effect where CPU - bound threads never get to run if there is an extremely heavy load of I /O - bound threads competing for the GIL .
Comparison to BFS
-----------------
Still need to test .
Would be curious .

One comment on that patch I just submitted .
Basically , it 's an attempt to make an extremely simple tweak to the GIL that fixes most of the problems discussed here in an extremely simple manner .
I do n't have any special religious attachment to it though .

Nice dabeaz .
One potential concern with " dabeaz_gil.patch 2010-04-25 21:13 " is that it appears to always leave the gil_monitor thread running .
This is bad on mobile / embedded platforms where waking up at regular intervals prevents advanced sleep states and wastes power / battery .
( practical example : the OLPC project has run into this issue in other code in the past )
Could this be modified so that gil_monitor stops looping ( blocks ) so long as there are only IO bound Python threads running or while no python thread owns the GIL ?
In that situation a multithreaded python process that has either reverted to one thread or has all threads blocked in IO would be truly idle rather than leaving the gil_monitor polling .

A problem , as far as I can see , is that these timeout sleeps run periodically , regardless of the actual times at which thread switching takes place .
I 'm not sure it 's really an issue but it's a bit of a departure from the " ideal " behaviour of the switching interval . >

Ok , so it 's not very different , at least in principle , from what gilinter .
patch does , right ?
( and actually , the benchmark results look very similar )

Greg , I like the idea of the monitor suspending if no thread owns the GIL .
Let me work on that .
Good point on embedded systems .
Antoine ,
Yes , the gil monitor is completely independent and simply ticks along every 5 ms .
A worst case scenario is that an I/ O bound thread is scheduled shortly after the 5ms tick and then becomes CPU - bound afterwards .
In that case , the monitor might let it run up to about 10 ms before switching it .
Hard to say if it's a real problem though --- the normal timeslice on many systems is 10 ms so it does n't seem out of line .
As for the priority part , this patch should have similar behavior to the glinter patch except for very subtle differences in thread scheduling due to the use of the GIL monitor .
For instance , since threads never time out on the condition variable anymore , they tend to cycle execution in a purely round - robin fashion .
msg104233 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-04-26 13:21
I 've updated the GIL patch to reflect concerns about the monitor thread running forever .
This version has a suspension mechanism where the monitor goes to sleep if nothing is going on for awhile .
It gets resumed if threads try to acquire the GIL , but timeout for some reason .
msg104234 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-04-26 13:31
I 've also attached a new file schedtest .py that illustrates a subtle difference between having the GIL monitor thread and not having the monitor .
Without the monitor , every thread is responsible for its own scheduling .
If you have a lot of threads running , you may have a lot of threads all performing a timed wait and then waking up only to find that the GIL is locked and that they have to go back to waiting .
One side effect is that certain threads have a tendency to starve .
For example , if you run the schedtest.py with the original GIL , you get a trace where three CPU - bound threads run like this : Thread - 3 16632 Thread - 2 16517 Thread - 1 31669 Thread - 2 16610 Thread - 1 16256 Thread - 2 16445 Thread - 1 16643 Thread - 2 16331 Thread - 1 16494 Thread - 3 16399 Thread - 1 17090 Thread - 1 20860 Thread - 3 16306 Thread - 1 19684 Thread - 3 16258 Thread - 1 16669 Thread - 3 16515 Thread - 1 16381 Thread - 3 16600 Thread - 1 16477 Thread - 3 16507 Thread - 1 16740 Thread - 3 16626 Thread - 1 16564 Thread - 3 15954 Thread - 2 16727 ...
You will observe that Threads 1 and 2 alternate , but Thread 3 starves .
Then at some point , Threads 1 and 3 alternate , but Thread 2 starves .
By having a separate GIL monitor , threads are no longer responsible for making scheduling decisions concerning timeouts .
Instead , the monitor is what times out and yanks threads off the GIL .
If you run the same test with the GIL monitor , you get scheduling like this : Thread - 1 33278 Thread - 2 32278 Thread - 3 31981 Thread - 1 33760 Thread - 2 32385 Thread - 3 32019 Thread - 1 32700 Thread - 2 32085 Thread - 3 32248 Thread - 1 31630 Thread - 2 32200 Thread - 3 32054 Thread - 1 32721 Thread - 2 32659 Thread - 3 34150
Threads nicely cycle round - robin .
There also appears to be about half as much thread switching ( for reasons I do n't quite understand ) .

New version of patch that will probably fix Windows - XP problems .
Was doing something stupid in the monitor ( not sure how it worked on Unix ) .
@dabeaz
I 'm getting random segfaults with your patch ( even with the last one ) , pretty much everywhere malloc or free is called .
Ater skimming through the code , I think the problem is due to gil_last_holder :
In drop_gil and take_gil , you dereference gil_last_holder -> cpu_bound , but it might very well happen that gil_last_holder points to a thread that has been deleted ( through tstate_delete_common ) .
Dereferencing is not risky , because there 's a high chance that the address is still valid , but in drop_gil , you do this : /*
Make the thread as CPU - bound or not depending on whether it was forced off */ gil_last_holder -> cpu_bound = gil_drop_request ;
Here , if the thread has been deleted in meantine , you end up writting to a random location on the heap , and probably corrupting malloc administration data , which would explain why I get segfaults sometimes later on unrelated malloc ( ) or free ( ) calls .
I looked at it really quickly though , so please forgive me if I missed something obvious ;-) @nirai I have some more remarks on your patch : - /*
Diff timestamp capping results to protect against clock differences * between cores . */ _ LOCAL ( long double ) _bfs_diff_ts ( long double ts1 , long double ts0 ) {
I 'm not sure I understand .
You can have problem with multiple cores when reading directly the TSC register , but that does n't affect gettimeofday .
gettimeofday should be reliable and accurate ( unless the OS is broken of course ) , the only issue is that since it's wall clock time , if a process like ntpd is running , then you 'll run into problem - pretty much all your variables are declared as volatile , but volatile was never meant as a thread - synchronization primitive .
Since your variables are protected by mutexes , you already have all necessary memory barriers and synchronization , so volatile just prevents optimization - you use some funtions just to perform a comparison or substraction , maybe it would be better to just remove those functions and perform the substractions / comparisons inline ( you declared the functions inline but there 's no garantee that the compiler will honor it ) .
- did you experiment with the time slice ?
I tried some higher values and got better results , without penalizing the latency .
Maybe it could be interesting to look at it in more detail ( and on various platforms ) .

Added extra pointer check to avoid possible segfault .
I do n't see segfaults anymore , but there 's still an unsafe dereference of gil_last_holder inside take_gil : /*
Wait on the appropriate GIL depending on thread 's classification */ if ( !tstate -> cpu_bound ) { /*
We are I /O bound .
If the current thread is CPU - bound , force it off now ! */ if ( gil_last_holder ->cpu_bound ) { SET_GIL_DROP_REQUEST ( ) ; } You 're still accessing a location that may have been free ( ) 'd previously : while it will work most of the time ( that 's why I said it 's not as risky ) , if the page gets unmapped between the time the current thread is deleted and the next thread takes over , you 'll get a segfault .
And that 's undefined behaviour anyway ;-)
msg104317 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-04-27 12:44
That second access of gil_last_holder -> cpu_bound is safe because that block of code is never entered unless some other thread currently holds the GIL .
If a thread holds the GIL , then gil_last_holder is guaranteed to have a valid value .
Did n't have much sleep last night , so please forgive me if I say something stupid , but : Python / pystate.c : void PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent ( ) { PyThreadState * tstate = _PyThreadState_Current ; if ( tstate == NULL ) Py_FatalError( " PyThreadState_DeleteCurrent : no current tstate " ) ; _PyThreadState_Current = NULL ; tstate_delete_common(tstate ) ; if ( autoTLSkey && PyThread_get_key_value(autoTLSkey ) == tstate ) PyThread_delete_key_value(autoTLSkey ) ; PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) ; } the current tstate is deleted and freed before releasing the GIL , so if another thread calls take_gil after the current thread has called tstate_delete_common but before it calls PyEval_ReleaseLock ( which calls drop_gil and set gil_locked to 0 ) , then it will enter this section and dereference gil_last_holder .
I just checked with valgrind , and he also reports an illegal dereference at this precise line .
msg104320 - ( view ) Author : David Beazley ( dabeaz ) Date : 2010-04-27 13:44
I stand corrected .
However , I 'm going to have to think of a completely different approach for carrying out that functionality as I do n't know how the take_gil ( ) function is able to determine whether gil_last_holder has been deleted or not .
Will think about it and post an updated patch later .
Do you have any examples or insight you can provide about how these segfaults have shown up in Python code ?
I 'm not able to observe any such behavior on OS - X or Linux .
Is this happening while running the ccbench program ?
Some other program ?

If you 're talking about the first issue ( segfaults due to writting to gil_last_holder -> cpu_bound ) , it was occuring quite often during ccbench ( pretty much anywhere malloc / free was called ) .
I 'm running a regular dual - core Linux box , nothing special .
For the second one , I did n't observe any segfault , I just figured this out reading the code and confirmed it with valgrind , but it 's much less likely because the race window is very short and it also requires that the page is unmmaped in between .
If someone really wanted to get segfaults , I guess a good start would be : - get a fast machine , multi-core is a bonus - use a kernel with full preemption - use a lot of threads ( - n option with ccbench ) - use purify or valgrind -- free - fill option so that you 're sure to jump to noland if you dereference a previously - free 'd pointer

In Windows the high - precision counter might return different results on different cores in some hardware configurations ( older multi- core processors ) .
I attempted to alleviate these problems by using capping and by using a " python time " counter constructed from accumulated slices , with the assumption that IO bound threads are unlikely to get migrated often between cores while running .
I will add references to the patch docs .

Can you post more details on your findings ?
It is possible that by using a bigger slice , you helped the OS classify CPU bound threads as such and improved " synchronization " between BFS and the OS scheduler .

Please note take_gil ( ) currently does n't depend on the validity of the pointer .
gil_last_holder is just used as an opaque value , equivalent to a thread id .

More specifically : some older multi-core processors where the HAL implements QueryPerformanceCounter using the TSC from the CPU , and the HAL does n't keep the cores in sync and QPC does n't otherwise account for it .
This is rare ; frequently QPC is implemented using another source of time .
But it 's true : QPC is not 100 % reliable .
QPC can unfortunately jump backwards ( when using TSC and you switch cores ) , jump forwards ( when using TSC and you switch cores , or when using the PCI bus timer on P3 - era machines with a specific buggy PCI south bridge controller ) , speed up or slow down ( when using TSC and not accounting for changing CPU speed via SpeedStep &c ) .
The simple solution : give up QPC and use timeGetTime ( ) with timeBeginPeriod ( 1 ) , which is totally reliable but only has millisecond accuracy at best .

It is preferable to use a high precision clock and I think the code addresses the multi-core time skew problem ( pending testing ) .

Dave ,
The behavior of your patch on Windows XP / 2003 ( and earlier ) might be related to the way Windows boosts thread priority when it is signaled .
Try to increase priority of monitor thread and slice size .
Another thing to look at is how to prevent Python CPU bound threads from ( starving ) messing up scheduling of threads of other processes .
Maybe increasing slice significantly can help in this too ( 50 m s ++ ? ) .
XP/NT /CE scheduling and thread boosting affect all patches and the current GIL undesirably ( in different ways ) .
Maybe it is possible to make your patch work nicely on these systems :
http://www.sriramkrishnan.com/blog/2006/08/tale-of-two-schedulers-win_115489794858863433.html
Vista and Windows 7 involve CPU cycle counting which results in more sensible scheduling : http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.02.vistakernel.aspx

I updated bfs. patch with improvements on Windows XP .
The update disables priority boosts associated with the scheduler condition on Windows for CPU bound threads .

Duck , here comes another update to bfs.
patch .
This one with some cleanups which simplify the code and improve behavior ( on Windows XP ) , shutdown code , comments , and " experimental " use of TSC for timestamps , which eliminates timestamp reading overhead .
TSC ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter) is a fast way to get high precision timing read .
On some systems this is what gettimeofday ( ) uses under the hood while on other systems it will use HPET or another source which is slower , typically ~ 1usec , but can be higher ( e.g. my core 2 duo laptop occasionally goes into a few hours of charging 3usec per HPET gettimeofday ( ) call - god knows why )
This overhead is incurred twice for every GIL release / acquire pair and can be eliminated with : 1 ) Hack the scheduler not to call gettimeofday ( ) when no other threads are waiting to run , or 2 ) Use TSC on platforms it is available ( the Linux BFS scheduler uses TSC ) .
I took cycle.h pointed by the Wikipedia article on TSC for a spin and it works well on my boxes .
It is BSD , ( un ) maintained ? and includes implementation for a gazillion of platforms ( I did not yet modify configure .
in as it recommends ) .
If it breaks on your system please ping with details .

Thanks for all your work Nir !
I personally think the BFS approach is the best we 've seen yet for this problem !
Having read the thread you linked to in full ( ignoring the tagents bikeshedding and mudslinging that went on there ) , it sounds like the general consensus is that we should take thread scheduling changes slowly and let the existing new implementation bake in the 3.2 release .
That puts this issue as a possibility for 3.3 if users demonstrate real world application problems in 3.2 .
( personally I 'd say it is already obvious that there are problems an wde should go ahead with your BFS based approach but realistically the we 're still better off in 3.2 than we were in 3.1 and 2.x as is )

The patch is complex and the issue has n't proved to be significant in production code .
Do you have a ( real - world ) workload where this shows up ?

Celery 5 is going async and in order to isolate the main event loop from task execution , the tasks are going to be executed in a different thread with it 's own event loop .
This thread may or may not be CPU bound .
The main thread is I /O bound .
This patch should help a lot .
I like Nir 's approach a lot ( although I have n't looked into the patch itself yet ) .
It 's pretty novel .
David 's patch is also very interesting .
I 'm willing to help .

Note that PyPy has implemented a GIL which does not suffer from this problem , possibly using a simpler approach than the patches here do .

I suggest : ( 1 ) turning one of the patches ( probably the last BFS one ? ) into a PR against the github master branch ( 3.9 ) and , ( 2 ) if none of the existing pyperformance workloads already demonstrates the problems with the existing GIL implementation , adopt one of the benchmarks here into an additional pyperformance workload .
( 3 ) demonstrate pyperformance results ( overall and targeted tests ) before and after the change .
Simultaneously , it'd also be interesting to see someone create an alternate PR using a PyPy inspired GIL implementation as that could prove to be a lot easier to maintain .
Lets make a data driven decision here .
People lost interest in actually landing a fix to this issue in the past because it was n't impacting their daily lives or applications ( or if it was , they already adopted a workaround ) .
Someone being interested enough to do the work to justify it going in is all it should take to move forward .

Fox News had their best year of all time in 2009 .
Now that we ’ve finished the first quarter of 2010 , it ’s clear FNC is showing no signs of letting up – they just finished their best quarter ever , in total day total viewers .
It was also the second highest rated quarter ever in prime time total viewers .
More details and analysis after the jump .
While Fox News continues to see record ratings , their cable news competitors are dropping off even more year - to - year .
In the A25 - 54 demographic during prime time , FNC was up 16 % , while CNN dropped 42 % , MSNBC was down 22 % and HLN was down 40 % .
In total viewers prime time , FNC was up 3 % while the rest declined as well ( CNN – 39 % , MSNBC – 15 % , HLN – 24 % ) .
We ’re now one month away from Fox News becoming the # 1 cable news channel for the 100th consecutive month based on total viewers , and this quarter FNC expanded its reach into the cable market as a whole – finishing 2nd in prime time on all of cable , behind just USA Network .
It also had the top 13 programs on cable news in both total viewers and the demo .
As for the programs , their two main news shows saw their best quarters ever .
Special Report with Bret Baier and FOX Report with Shepard Smith at 6 and 7 pmET respectively .
Of course , the entire line - up was up – in demo , Glenn Beck was up the most ( 50 % ) .
While CNN continues to decline in prime time ( as detailed today in the New York Times ) and MSNBC ’s signature programs fall off as well ( post coming ) , Fox News remains unaffected .
In fact , with health care passing , there ’s no reason to doubt the second quarter of 2010 will be any different .
With midterm elections just around the corner , Fox News could conceivably be headed for another year of stronger ratings than the one before .
Whether you ’re a fan of the ‘ fair and balanced ’ or not , it ’s an amazing feat .

BERLIN , Germany —
The government of the state of Bavaria has said it will soon request that Germany 's highest courts ban the country 's largest far - right party , the National Democratic Party ( NPD ) , for subverting the tenets of the national constitution .
It 's a policy that is popular among most of the public , and has earned backing from both of the country 's major parties .
But it 's also a course of action that most political elites acknowledge has little chance of success .
“ There 's very little chance of the courts accepting this argument , ” said Wolfgang Hoffmann - Riem , a former justice on Germany 's Constitutional Court .
This is not the first time the German government has considered how to position itself toward the crimes of the country 's past .
Indeed , the history of post - World War II Germany is fraught with morally dubious decisions toward the legacy of Nazism — from Konrad Adenauer 's choice in the 1950s to avoid a thorough de-Nazification of his government , to the Red Army Fraction 's campaign in the 1970s to purify West Germany of its Nazi -era sins by means of terrorism and murder .
Nonetheless , the contemporary German state has mostly tried in good faith to feel its way toward an ad hoc accomodation of its Nazi past , one that acknowledges the unique scourge of the Third Reich , while protecting the core freedoms of a liberal democracy .
Symbols from the Nazi-era , such as the swastika or the “ Heil Hitler ” salute , are illegal in Germany , but far - right political groups have also been granted equal right to hold demonstrations to air their views .
Holocaust denial is punishable by imprisonment , but neo - Nazi parties have been tolerated as long as they draw no explicit links with the Nazi regime .
The policies might sometimes may seem contradictory , but they are meant to hang together as a carefully managed compromise , one that pays respect both to the tragic origins and the decades - long success of the modern , democratic German state .
But , when it comes to the NPD , the country 's largest far - right party , many Germans insist that the government redraw the boundaries between freedom of expression and historical deference .
Indeed , the calls for action against the NPD have gotten louder in recent years , a development coincident with the party 's increasing successes , especially in eastern Germany .
The party has earned seats in a number of state legislatures by winning more than 5 percent in several state - wide elections , which has also given it the right to receive government campaign financing .
Charlotte Knoblauch , head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , supports the renewed effort to ban the party , insisting that it 's unacceptable that the party receives tax money to spread its “ racist propoganda . ”
However personally sympathetic German judges may be to such pleas , they say they can't do anything about the party unless the state can conclusively prove that it is explicitly subverting the German constitution .
That sets the bar very high : Party leaders would have to be documented laying out plans to install a dictatorship , or belittling the victims of totalitarianism .
Gathering such evidence in the public sphere is a madenning process , as NPD lawyers carefully monitor party rhetoric so that it tiptoes up to , without crossing , the legal boundaries .
The German government has tried other methods to gain damning evidence against the NPD , but those have only led to other legal difficulties .
Indeed , an attempt by the federal government in 2003 to ban the party relied heavily on evidence gathered by government agents who operated as undercover spies within the NPD organization .
The Constitutional Court claimed it could n't distinguish between the government agents ' observations of the NPD activities , and their own participation and possible instigation of those activities .
Legal experts , including former justice Hoffmann - Riem , have suggested that the very fact that undercover government agents are still in force in the NPD organization means that any legal case against the party would be weakened from the get - go .
Interestingly , it 's primarily politicians from eastern Germany , where the NPD is strongest , who have most strongly resisted calls to ban the party .
They argue that the only sustainable way to combat neo -Nazi radicalism is through the normal channels of the liberal state — namely , open debate and argument .
“ Even if you banned the NPD party , they would just rename themselves and come back the next week , ” said Andreas Adammer , a resident of Potsdam in the state of Brandenburg , where the NPD has enjoyed success in past elections .
Of course , the contrasting strategies for dealing with the NPD can and will most likely be pursued in parallel .
Indeed , while Bavaria pursues its case against the NPD , some 8000 neo -Nazis are expected to gather in Dresden Saturday to mark the 65th anniversary of the Allied bombing of that city in the final year of World War II .
A police presence will be on hand to ensure that the Nazi sympathizers have the opportunity to air their slogans , which compare Allied firebombing to Nazi atrocities .
But , they are also expected to be met by a group of counter - protesters whose numbers will double their own .
The schedule for this day is currently unavailable
My entire adult life I ’ve felt the injustices imposed upon honest , hard - working individuals in our society : frivolous traffic tickets , lying politicians , extorted taxes for things we neither want nor need , abusive law enforcement and the like .
I ’ve always been passionate about these injustices but not actively so .
After spending nearly a decade abroad living and working in Europe I found myself returning to a country I did n’t recognize .
I found it difficult to acclimate and integrate into this politically correct , socially abusive , statist society ; a society that seemed to be desensitized to police abuse of all magnitudes .
The prevailing attitude seems to be : if the cops have someone in custody then they must deserve it .
Almost immediately I was confronted with the abusive nature of the new state order : driving to get a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning in Syracuse , NY , I was pulled over for talking on my cell phone .
Having only been in Syracuse for 3 months I had no reason to believe that such a law existed .
Regardless the doughnut feeder pulled me from my car , patted me down in the street , and put me in his car while he ran my license and wrote out the citation .
It was humiliating and I felt like a common criminal .
I was determined to fight the citation , but my contract ended and I left Syracuse .
Eventually I paid the $ 100 fine .
Just recently I moved to Princeton , NJ , to begin a new short - term contract .
This past Saturday evening I rode my bicycle to the Princeton University campus where there are a number of pubs and restaurants .
My intent was to get Chinese takeout and go back to my room off campus .
As I rode down the sidewalk on famed Nassau Street on this clear , cool March evening , myself and others were startled by a Mercer county patrol car blazing its siren and lights and darting into the sidewalk ahead of me .
My first thought , of course , was : what could be going on ?
It was n’t more than a few seconds until I got the answer to that question .
The short , well - armed female officer exited her cruiser and with a firm right hand , outstretched arm and condescending look in her eyes , she looked dead in my eyes as I approached her and exclaimed : " Stop ! " I kid you not .
Of course , this is one of those situations where anyone still in possession of a fully functional frontal lobe thinks to themselves : what could I possibly have done ?
The responsible answer is , of course : nothing .
Reason and responsibility , unfortunately , rarely seem to figure into a tax - feeder ’s thought process .
As it turns out , it is illegal to ride your bicycle on the sidewalk .
Even more ridiculous is the fact that it ’s only illegal in a 4 — 5 block section of Nassau street AND only on my side of the street .
At least that ’s what she told me .
Given my survival training learned from LRC and other sites , I immediately knew how to handle the situation .
The first thing I said was : I do not consent to any searches of my person .
Of course , this riled her ; she immediately replied : " why , do you have something to hide ?
When you say that you seem suspicious . "
Of course this would be her response since in her mind , as she sees herself as anointed by God herself , and anyone not wanting to cooperate with a servant of the almighty must be immoral and hiding something .
Actually , I saw myself as being accosted by a total stranger imposing on my freedom of movement , and was no more willing to consent to an invasion of privacy by her anymore than I would any other stranger accosting me on the street .
I told her that I did n’t trust her and was simply exercising my constitutional rights .
That made her even angrier .
Cops hate it when mundanes say things like that .
I could n’t help but think that this whole situation could have been avoided if only her father had loved her more .
But I digress .
Continuing with her irresponsible and abusive activities , she called for backup .
Backup for a guy riding his bicycle .
When she did that it instantly became clear to me that we were on the other side of the looking glass and tea was about to be served .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
When her colleague arrived , he approached me and said that the law was the law and they were just doing their job .
Of course at that point my first instinct was to pull his underwear up over his head and smack him for being stupid .
But I did n’t .
Instead I pointed out how the German officers at the Nuremberg trials also used the defense that they were just doing what they were told to which he rolled his eyes as if to say : where did this nut - job come from ?
As the female cop completed the citation , I made a point of letting all folks passing by know that the situation was because I was riding my bike on the sidewalk .
The first baby - boomer couple to pass by commented : that ’s a shame .
The sidewalk is the safest place for a cyclist to ride .
Of course I agreed .
Obviously this is just another example of abusive law enforcement in an effort to extort yet more and more money out of the productive people in our society in these hard economic times , in order to keep the non-working class in business .
I have a court date on March 23rd at which time I will plead not guilty and I imagine I ’ll receive another court date to plead my case .
My position on this issue is simple : I cannot condone this sort of socially irresponsible behavior on the part of the state .
It ’s been made clear to me that I have no say in anything the state does , so I am forced into a corner from which I shall fight my way out .
I wo n’t contend that I am not guilty of breaking the law but rather that the law itself is immoral and to cite me abusive , period .
I certainly cannot take the position of : let me just pay the citation and go along to get along .
By doing so I would be condoning these sorts of reprehensible practices , which I do not .
This particular issue is so clearly unjust that I have no problem " going to the mattresses " in fighting it .
I ca n’t think of anything more insulting to me as an American as this sort of affront to my God - given rights of existence .
Those police officers ought to be ashamed of themselves , but I know they are not .
Like so many in America — myself included — they no doubt believe in their righteousness .
But one has to ask : do you really feel free anymore ?
Do you find yourself in public constantly wondering if you can cross the street here or there ?
Whether you can ride your bike on a sidewalk ?
The shoulder of the road ?
When you see a cop car in your rearview mirror , do you feel safer or do you get a short shot of adrenaline and start wondering what he could pull you over for ?
What ’s your speed and what ’s the speed limit ?
Did you signal when you changed lanes ?
I think we all know the answer to that question .
I ’ve already arranged for bail on the 23rd when things go badly .
Remember , always do what you know is right , even if the government says it ’s wrong .
And the government will always say it ’s wrong .
That ’s how you can know it ’s the right thing to do .

A BBC TV drama was just one adaptation of Treasure Island A sequel to the adventure story Treasure Island is being written by the former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion .
Robert Louis Stevenson originally wrote his tale of pirates , including Long John Silver , for his stepson in 1883 .
Sir Andrew says it is one of his favourite books and that he wants to create a tale " packed with its own adventure , excitement and pathos " .
Return to Treasure Island , which is due to be published in 2012 , will return to the story a generation later .
' Cries of delight '
Treasure Island ends with several pirates still marooned on the island , Long John Silver survives , and most of the loot remains in situ .
In Return to Treasure Island , Jim Hawkins lives with his son , Jim Junior , in a pub on the Thames outside London .
Jim Junior is visited by a woman who turns out to be Long John Silver 's daughter .
HAVE YOUR SAY I 'd quite like to see a sequel to John Christopher 's The Tripods Trilogy PaulRichard2
She convinces Jim Junior to steal the original map of Treasure Island from his father and go on a trip organised by Silver so they can find the rest of the treasure .
Sir Andrew said : " Treasure Island is itself a treasure trove , and has long been a particular favourite .
" In my own book I want to create a world that is sympathetic to the original , but packed with its own adventure , excitement and pathos . "
Dan Franklin , publisher at Jonathan Cape , said Motion 's sequel was a work of " literary ventriloquism " .
" Anyone who loved Stevenson 's original will fall on this book with cries of delight .
Indeed , I do n't think I have seen such enthusiasm for a book proposal from every department of the company . "
There have already been several prequels and sequels to a story Stevenson originally wrote for his stepson Lloyd in 1883 .
These include AD Howden Smith 's Porto Bello Gold in 1924 and Francis Bryan 's Curse of Treasure Island in 2001 .
Treasure Island has also been adapted for the screen and stage on numerous occasions .
Although he is best known as the former Poet Laureate , Sir Andrew has written three previous novels and several biographies .
He was appointed Poet Laureate in 1999 and Carol Ann Duffy was named his successor in 2009 .

A new study , led by researchers at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center , demonstrates that acupuncture may be an effective therapy for joint pain and stiffness in breast cancer patients who are being treated with commonly used hormonal therapies .
Results were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology .
Joint pain and stiffness are common side effects of aromatase inhibitor therapy , in which the synthesis of estrogen is blocked .
The therapy , which is a common and effective treatment for early - stage , hormone - receptor - positive breast cancer in post - menopausal women , has been shown in previous research to cause some joint pain and stiffness in half of women being treated .
" Since aromatase inhibitors have become an increasingly popular treatment option for some breast cancer patients , we aimed to find a non -drug option to manage the joint issues they often create , thereby improving quality of life and reducing the likelihood that patients would discontinue this potentially life - saving treatment , " said Dawn Hershman , M.D , M.S. , senior author of the paper , and co-director of the breast cancer program at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center , and an assistant professor of medicine ( hematology / oncology ) and epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center .
To explore the effects of acupuncture on aromatase inhibitor - associated joint pain , the research team randomly assigned 43 women to receive either true acupuncture or sham acupuncture twice a week for six weeks .
Sham acupuncture , which was used to control for a potential placebo effect , involved superficial needle insertion at body points not recognized as true acupuncture points .
All participants were receiving an aromatase inhibitor for early breast cancer , and all had reported musculoskeletal pain .
Among the women treated with true acupuncture , findings demonstrated that they experienced significant improvement in joint pain and stiffness over the course of the study .
Pain severity declined , and overall physical well - being improved .
Additionally , 20 percent of the patients who had reported taking pain relief medications reported that they no longer needed to take these medications following acupuncture treatment .
No such improvements were reported by the women who were treated with the sham acupuncture .
" This study suggests that acupuncture may help women manage the joint pain and stiffness that can accompany aromatase inhibitor treatment , " said Katherine D. Crew , M.D. , M.S. , first author of the paper , and the Florence Irving Assistant Professor of Medicine ( hematology / oncology ) and Epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center and a hematological oncologist at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center .
" To our knowledge , this is the first randomized , placebo - controlled trial establishing that acupuncture may be an effective method to relieve joint problems caused by these medications .
However , results still need to be confirmed in larger , multicenter studies . "

Also 2 times 2 equals 4 . 2 is the only number that gives the same result added to itself or multiplied by itself .

The Swede - who led England to the quarter - finals of the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and the last eight of Euro 2004 - takes over having left League 2 Notts County in February , where he had been director of football .
Former Russia and Chelsea coach Guus Hiddink had been strongly linked with the position before he becomes Turkey boss in August .
Ex -Blackburn and Manchester City manager Mark Hughes and former Real Madrid chief Bernd Schuster were also reportedly in the running for the Elephants ' job .
" Eriksson signed a contract in London on Sunday , " said Outtara Hego , secretary general at the Ivory Coast football federation .
" As most people know , Guus Hiddink was our first choice .
When that did not happen , Eriksson was the best alternative .
He has the necessary experience . "
The FIF said it had considered several candidates since Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic was sacked in February after failing to lead the team to the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals .
" The executive committee analysed the profile of several candidates before choosing Sven - Goran Eriksson , " FIF said .
" His mission will be to guide our team during the World Cup and to make sure it fares honourably , which will be difficult in a competition featuring the world 's best 32 sides . "
Ivory Coast have been drawn in World Cup Group G along with Brazil , Portugal and North Korea .

And Senator Susan Collins of Maine , a moderate Republican colleague of the conservative Mr. Bunning , joined Democrats in trying to force the measure through , calculating that perhaps a plea from a fellow Republican would get him to change his position .
“ When I was home this weekend , I talked to constituents who expressed their utter bafflement that Congress could not proceed on something that has widespread support , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ While trying to blame Democrats for mishandling the entire matter , other Republicans also distanced themselves from Mr. Bunning , whom Democrats were holding up as the embodiment of what they say has been a maddening pattern of Republican obstruction in the Senate .
“ This is one senator , ” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas , a chief political strategist for Senate Republicans .
“ This does not represent the position of the caucus . ”
Other party officials said that while the Bunning fight was not helpful , it probably would not do serious damage as long as it ended rapidly .
Republicans were not just unhappy that the back - and - forth was allowing Democrats and editorial writers around the country to portray them as heartless curmudgeons , denying jobless aid to struggling Americans while Mr. Bunning complained that late - night debate was preventing him from watching a college basketball game .
The attention to the impasse was also cutting into Republican efforts to focus on the evolving Democratic strategy on the health care overhaul , which Republicans are trying to portray as an end - run around Senate rules .
Instead , Democrats were having a field day citing Mr. Bunning ’s repeated objections as evidence of how Republicans abuse the rules to delay needed legislation , helping them build a case in favor of using any available tools to overcome such opposition .
A village on the western fringes of Hampshire is well on the way to becoming the first in England to defy the power of the supermarkets by achieving communal self - sufficiency in food .
The parish of Martin lies on good agricultural land beneath the chalk downs of Cranborne Chase .
In past centuries , its 164 households would have been sustained by the output of local farms and dairies .
But , over the last 60 years , the dairies closed and the farmers directed their harvests towards the vast hoppers of agro-industry .
The people of Martin continued to be surrounded by fields growing food , but none of it reached their plates .
And after the village shop closed in 1982 , they had to travel to buy provisions .
Nick Snelgar , who earns a living from growing herbs and shrubs near his home in Martin , thought it was crazy that he could not eat local produce .
" It would be fresher , tastier and more nutritious than anything from the supermarket and I thought it could be cheaper too if we organised to cut out the middlemen , " he says .
" Farmers ' markets tend to be expensive niche providers for the few .
I wanted a system to provide local food for the many . "
He organised a meeting in the village social club in 2003 , and from it came the nucleus of enthusiasts who have organised the producer co-operative that is now feeding most of Martin 's residents .
Futurefarms grows 45 types of vegetables in two fields in the village .
Within the fields , two acres are set aside for rearing free - range pigs .
Chicken runs are moved regularly across the bigger field and the rest of the land is grazed by sheep .
Chickens , lamb and pork are sold alongside vegetables at a Saturday morning market in the village hall throughout the year .
In the early years , the food was produced entirely by voluntary labour , and Martin remains a village full of people on rotas for various horticultural and stock - rearing tasks .
But Futurefarms , which is a not - for - profit growers ' co-operative , now has an annual turnover of £ 36,000 and can afford to employ four part - time staff .
Snelgar says 60 % of the households in Martin use the co-op to supply at least some of their food .
It is not trying to expand production to sell elsewhere because that would miss the point .
" We are not interested in the wholesale market .
We are only interested in the Martin market , " he says .
So far the co-op has signed up 126 of the village 's families as members .
They pay £ 5 a year , but can escape the charge by volunteering for seven hours ' work .
They make no commitment to buy the produce , so the co-op has to remain competitive on quality and price .
Snelgar 's dream is for each village to combine co-operatively to employ a food grower with as much status as the local teacher or doctor .
He says : " I do n't want to kill off supermarkets .
They should continue to do what they do best : provide toilet rolls and manufactured products that do not deteriorate when transported . "
The Futurefarms operation avoids the use of chemical sprays and artificial fertilisers , but it cannot claim to be organic .
Its main 15 - acre field is on former set - aside land that was regularly doused in weedkiller by a previous owner .
Yet the Soil Association , which polices organic values , regards the co-op as an inspiring example of how a small community can combine to produce food locally .
The association 's annual conference , opening in Birmingham today , will seek to challenge the hi-tech vision of British farming espoused by John Beddington , the government 's chief scientist .
Beddington has called for increased production to counter a " perfect storm " of food shortages that could become a global threat by 2030 .
Bonnie Hewson , the Soil Association 's projects director , says the global scale of the problem should not deter people from making a valuable local contribution .
" The Futurefarms experiment is an inspiring example of how a small group without much funding can do its own thing in a small corner of England , and do it well .
" People are sick of being told to worry about food .
They need to feel empowered .
We know of lots of alternative local food systems that are sustainable , resilient , viable and principled .
They may not be able to solve the global problem , but they can say : ' Nothing we are doing will stand people in worse stead . ' "
Gold award
Across Britain , scores of local food projects are supported by the Soil Association , often in coalition with other groups .
In Dorset , the Local Food Links scheme is providing hot lunches to 23 primary schools in Bridport and Blandford .
It was the first catering company to win the association 's gold award for sourcing at least 50 % of the ingredients locally and using at least 30 % organic produce .
The school meals venture was triggered by the Jamie Oliver television series that led the government to order all schools to serve hot meals by September 2008 .
This posed a problem for Dorset county council , which had decommissioned all its primary school kitchens in the 1980s .
It contracted a factory in Nottingham to supply cheap frozen readymeals that were trucked to Dorset and reheated .
Tim Crabtree set up the Local Food Links scheme in Bridport to provide a healthier , local alternative .
It is now supplying similar meals to four care homes for older people and a day centre .
Crabtree admits he relies on charitable grants to break even on school meals at £ 2 a head .
The care homes will pay £ 4 and that should be enough to make the operation sustainable , financially and ecologically .
Crabtree started one of Britain 's first farmers ' markets .
He expected producers and consumers to share the benefits of shortening the supply chain .
" But most of the gains were captured by the producers , " he says .
" We have seen a polarisation in food .
There are niche organic outlets for those who can afford it , but most people end up with food at low cost and low nutritional value .
We think we can do something about that in institutions serving people who need high - quality food . "
This might come as an unpleasant surprise for the fast - food industry , but when people can read how many calories there are in their fast food , they do cut back .
In a study of millions of transactions at several hundred Starbucks outlets , economists from Stanford University found that consumers in New York City responded to required calorie postings by cutting almost 15 calories off their average purchases , a calorie reduction of 6 percent .
Drinks were mostly unaffected .
Customers instead bought less food with their drinks and , to a lesser extent , bought lower - calorie items .
The policy was particularly effective with heavier eaters .
A separate analysis of purchases by Starbucks cardholders found that customers who consumed at least 250 calories per purchase cut their intake by 26 percent after the postings appeared .
This research seems to contradict the findings of an earlier study that found that calorie postings at 14 outlets of McDonald ’s , Wendy ’s , Burger King and KFC in low - income New York City neighborhoods had no discernible impact on customers ’ purchases in subsequent weeks .
The research at Starbucks relied on many more transactions and outlets over more than a year , so it is more precise .
And despite the discrepancy , both studies seem to suggest similar conclusions : calorie counts will be most effective in higher - income neighborhoods , where consumers are better educated .
And they will work better when consumers have a choice of places  with lower - calorie alternatives  to eat .

Ten sites on the seabed off the north coast of Scotland have been leased out to power companies in an effort to generate wave and tidal energy .
In the first project of its kind in the world , areas in the Pentland Firth and around Orkney have been leased to seven companies by the Crown Estate .
The companies are to push forward plans to generate enough electricity to supply 750,000 homes by 2020 .
Scotland 's First Minister Alex Salmond said it was a " major milestone " .
He said the waters had been described as the " Saudi Arabia of marine power " due to their " rich natural resources " .
The Crown Estate , which owns the seabed around the UK , has awarded the leases after inviting bids from developers .
Wave and tidal power represent an energy and jobs bonanza for Scotland
Dr Richard Dixon
The aim is to generate 1.2 gigawatts ( GW ) of electricity from the sites off Orkney and the Caithness and Sutherland coasts .
Six sites have been allocated for wave energy developments potentially generating 600 megawatts ( MW ) of power and four for tidal projects , also generating 600 MW .
Wave schemes will be developed by SSE Renewables Developments off Costa Head and also jointly with Aquamarine Power off Brough Head , both on Orkney .
ScottishPower Renewables have the lease for Marwick Head , Orkney .
Leases for wave projects have also been awarded to E.ON for sites designated West Orkney South and West Orkney Middle South and to Pelamis Wave Power for the Armadale site in the Pentland Firth off Sutherland .
THE WINNERS Aquamarine Power E.ON Marine Current Turbines OpenHydro Site Development Pelamis Wave Power ScottishPower Renewables SSE Renewables Developments
Wave and tidal developers profiled Tidal schemes will be developed by SSE Renewables Developments off Westray South and jointly with OpenHydro Site Developments off Cantick Head , both Orkney .
Marine Current Turbines have been leased the Brough Ness site on Orkney and ScottishPower Renewables will install devices in the Pentland Firth off Ness of Duncansby in Caithness .
The Crown Estate has been working with the Scottish Government , Highlands and Islands Enterprise ( HIE ) , Orkney Islands Council and Highland Council on the project .
The names of the successful bidders were announced at a ceremony in Edinburgh .
THE SITES
Six sites have been identified for wave devices and four for tidal Wave : Costa Head , Brough Head , Marwick Head , West Orkney South and West Orkney Middle South and Armadale in Sutherland Tidal : Westray South , Cantick Head and Brough Ness , Orkney , and Ness of Duncansby in Caithness First Minister Alex Salmond said it marked a " major milestone " in efforts to create a low carbon future .
He said : " These waters have been described as the Saudi Arabia of marine power and the wave and tidal projects unveiled today - exceeding the initial 700 MW target capacity - underline the rich natural resources of the waters off Scotland . "
Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said it was an exciting time for the renewables industry .
He said : " Scotland is naturally placed to make the most of this green revolution and we will continue to work with others to ensure the potential of Scottish waters , alongside wind power , is fully met . "
Wildlife conservation organisation , WWF Scotland , said that with careful planning wave and tidal energy could be harnessed without harming the marine environment .
Director Dr Richard Dixon said : " Wave and tidal power represent an energy and jobs bonanza for Scotland .
" There is a massive amount of power in the seas around Scotland and we are currently the world leaders in developing the technologies to turn that potential into clean , green electricity . "

The strange case of the man who took 40,000 ecstasy pills in nine years
The Guardian ( UK ) ^ | April 4 , 2006 | by David McCandless
Posted on by aculeus
Doctors from London University have revealed details of what they believe is the largest amount of ecstasy ever consumed by a single person .
Consultants from the addiction centre at St George 's Medical School , London , have published a case report of a British man estimated to have taken around 40,000 pills of MDMA , the active ingredient in ecstasy , over nine years .
The heaviest previous lifetime intake on record is 2,000 pills .
Though the man , who is now 37 , stopped taking the drug seven years ago , he still suffers from severe physical and mental health side - effects , including extreme memory problems , paranoia , hallucinations and depression .
He also suffers from painful muscle rigidity around his neck and jaw which often prevents him from opening his mouth .
The doctors believe many of these symptoms may be permanent .
The man , known as Mr A in the report in the scientific journal Psychosomatics , started using ecstasy at 21 .
For the first two years his use was an average of five pills per weekend .
Gradually this escalated until he was taking around three and a half pills a day .
At the peak , the man was taking an estimated 25 pills every day for four years .
After several severe collapses at parties , Mr A decided to stop taking ecstasy .
For several months , he still felt he was under the influence of the drug , despite being bedridden .
Hallucinations
His condition deteriorated and he began to experience recurrent tunnel vision and other problems including hallucinations , paranoia and muscle rigidity .
" He came to us after deciding that he could n't go on any more , " said Dr Christos Kouimtsidis , the consultant psychiatrist at St George 's Medical School in Tooting who treated him for five months .
" He was having trouble functioning in everyday life . "

JavaScript has been used for a number of unusual projects in the past few years .
We ’ve had NES emulators , Spectrum emulators , and even Amiga emulators .
But a Flash player ?…
What ’s the point of emulating a browser plugin within a browser ?
It ’s not as bizarre as it sounds .
There is one very good reason for a JavaScript - based player : the Flash plugin is n’t available on all platforms .
Most notably , you ca n’t run Flash on a iPhone or Apple ’s new iPad .
“ Gordon ” is a cleverly - named project by Tobias Schneider which hopes to rectify the situation .
It translates Flash SWF files to Scalable Vector Graphics which are supported on the iPhone .
The project runs on most modern browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer ( which does n’t offer native SVG support … yet ) .
Gordon currently supports the SWF 1.0 format and SWF 2.0 is in development .
There are several demonstrations available and , although they ’re simple , they work well and show the potential .
Of course , all this work might be in vain if the real Flash plugin appears on the iPhone .
But that seems fairly unlikely — Steve Jobs has little regard for Flash and states that it runs too slowly on the device .
It ’s also a competitor to the standard iPhone / iPad applications platform .
However , Gordon has been tested on the iPhone and it runs fast enough even though it ’s built on interpreted JavaScript code .
If the project becomes a success , the human centipede rapidshare , there will be nothing Apple can do to prevent Flash running on the device .
Could that provide developers with another reason to desert iPhone applications ?
Have you tried Gordon ?
Could it ever be a viable alternative to the Flash plugin on unsupported browsers ?
Should Adobe hire the developer immediately ?!
stop clearing your dalvik - cache
Code : mount -a
NOTE : COMMANDS ARE CASE sensitive in LINUX and as such ANDROID !!!!!!
ALL OFF THESE COMMANDS ARE IN lower case .
SO
Turn off your Auto - Caps options in your keyboard options .
These command assume you downloaded the script using your the web browser on your G1 / Magic whatever phone and the file is located in / sdcard / download ( the default location for web browser downloads ) .
Code : su mount -o rw , remount / system cp /sdcard/ download/86dalvik-cache-fix.txt /system/etc/init.d/86dalvik-cache-fix chown 0:2000 /system/etc/init.d/86dalvik-cache-fix chmod 755 /system/etc/init.d/86dalvik-cache-fix sync reboot
WARNING :
replacing the build .
prop may cause problems
Hello ....use your head here ... the VMLIBS .ZIP is for Motorola DROIDS , why would you put the build .
prop file for a DROID on your G1 and expect your apps or ROM to work afterwards ?
you need 1 file , it 's called libdvm.so
/ system / lib a file by the same name already exists there
FYI :
dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:fast in the /system/ build.prop
changed to dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:jit
dalvikvm -h
1 st bootup is slow and I recommend you let it sit even when desktops are up for a couple of minutes and then reboot it , 2nd and 3rd bootups are faster and smoother response overall even for long durations , days .
FIX YOUR FILE SYSTEM FIRST
Code : #e2fsck - fcpDC0 /dev/block/mmcblk0p2 #reboot recovery
For the lazy fingers # e2fsck - fcpDC0 /*/*/*0p2 #reboot recovery
Code : $ su #mount -o rw , remount auto / sdcard #cd / sdcard / dusted - donuts #sh backup #sh install #sync #reboot
Code : $ su #dalvikvm -h
Code : # mount -o rw , remount auto / sdcard #cd / sdcard / dusted - donuts #sh restore #sync #reboot
prefer to use VMLIBS .ZIP from t3hSteve ?
This is how you can install using that .
Required :
1. Android 1.6 ROMS with a bit Eclair stuff in the Kernel and framework such as Cyanogen ROM 4.2.x , Super D 1.8 - 19.2 , WG Y2.6 , FastTest , KingKlick Eclair and more ..
This libdvm . so works on Android 2.1 as well as it seems it should ..
How to install : ( easier to go in recovery mode but can be done through terminal )
1. Download the VMLIBS.ZIP from t3hSteve of allroid.com http://alldroid.org/download/file.php?id=1374
2 . You only need the libdvm .
so file of which appears to be JIT enabled by default .
3 . Backup the original libdvm .
so # cp / system/lib/libdvm.so /sdcard/libdvm.so
4 . Copy the JIT enabled libdvm .
so # cp -f /sdcard/vmlibs/libdvm.so /system/lib/libdvm.so
5 . Set permissions on the file #chmod 644 / system/lib/libdvm.so
Optional for disabling : ( easier to do vi through recovery console , since the back key escapes out of terminal )
To disable JIT MODE but want to keep the libdvm .
so create a local .
prop in /data and add dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:fast
#vi /data/local.prop
press the i key to enter vi interactive mode
type dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:fast
press back key to exit vi interactive mode
to write the file out and quit vi type :wq
or
restore your backed libdvm .
so file from the sdcard .

An alert was raised March 11 when Japanese amateur astronomers announced what might have been the discovery of a new 8th magnitude nova in the constellation of Cygnus .
It was soon realized that this eruption was not what it appeared to be .
It was actually the unexpected nova - like erruption of a known variable star , V407 Cygni .
Typically varying between 12th and 14th magnitude , V407 Cyg is a rather mundane variable star .
So what caused this well - behaved star to suddenly go ballistic ?
V407 Cyg is a symbiotic variable .
These are close , interacting binary pairs usually containing a red giant and a hotter , smaller white dwarf .
They orbit a common center of gravity inside a shared nebulosity .
A typical symbiotic variable consists of an M type giant transferring matter to a hot white dwarf via its stellar wind .
This wind is ionized by the white dwarf , giving rise to the symbiotic nebula .
Symbiotic variables are complex systems with many sources of variability .
They can vary periodically due to the binary motion , the red giant can vary due to pulsation , the stars may be obscured by circumstellar dust , or the light emitted my change due to the formation of giant star spots .
The white dwarf component may glow more or less constantly as it accretes material from the red giant and heats it up at a steady rate , or the material may form an accretion disk around the white dwarf , like in dwarf novae .
Mass accreted onto the white dwarf can result in flickering and quasi-periodic oscillations .
If there is a sudden increase in the rate of accretion , or the material in the accretion disk reaches a point of instability and crashes down onto the surface of the white dwarf the symbiotic system may undergo a nova - like eruption .
About 20 % of symbiotics consist of a Mira - type variable as the giant of the pair .
These binaries reside in much dustier envelopes .
V407 Cyg is one of these dusty , Mira - type symbiotics .
Its typical variation of a few magnitudes is due mainly to the pulsation of the Mira component of the system .
Astronomers had never before witnessed a nova - like outburst of this interacting binary .
You can imagine their surprise when Japanese amateurs , searching for novae along the galactic plane , suddenly detected this mild mannered , dusty Mira , symbiotic variable glowing nearly 100 times brighter than ever before .
That was just the beginning of the story .
The first new spectra taken of the system , on March 13th , was different from any ever recorded for this star or any other symbiotic Mira variable in outburst .
The normal absorption spectra of the Mira star was completely overwhelmed by the blue continuum of the outbursting white dwarf .
The characteristics of the emission spectra revealed two distinct types of activity .
One was the relatively slow ionized wind of the Mira star .
The other looked like the fast expanding ejecta of a nova outburst .
In fact , the spectrum looked remarkably similar to the symbiotic recurrent novae , RS Ophiuchi .
Typical outbursts of known symbiotic binaries , and symbiotic Miras in particular , usually exhibit a very slow rise to maximum , taking months , and no real significant mass ejection .
This appears to be a much more quickly evolving and violent event , more like the eruptions of the recurrent novae RS Oph and T CrB.
V407 Cyg may join this rare class of symbiotic recurrent novae .
As if that were n’t enough , another twist was added to the story on March 19th , when the Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) , on board the Fermi Gamma - ray Space Telescope detected the star in gamma-rays , something never observed in a symbiotic system before .
The gamma-rays could be caused by shock driven acceleration of the ejected material , and its capture by strong magnetic fields within the system .
Like many novae and recurrent novae outbursts , this eruption may last for weeks or months and the variation in light output could be quite complex and interesting .
Because the giant secondary is losing mass , the system is likely to have a large amount of circumstellar material .
The ejected shell from the nova explosion on the white dwarf will interact with this material as the shell propagates outward , and will likely produce a wide variety of variable phenomena .
V407 Cyg has our attention now , and professional and amateur astronomers will be keeping a close eye on it from now on .
Gynaecologist 's three - year ordeal ends as ' fantasist with excessive libido ' drops her case
A woman who accused her gynaecologist of giving her ‘ leg buckling orgasms ’ on the consulting couch has dramatically withdrawn her case .
Bibi Giles ’s harassment claim against consultant Angus Thomson was effectively torpedoed when another doctor – a GP – threatened to tell the court that she had pestered him for sex in the past .
Mrs Giles withdrew the case yesterday morning and agreed to pay £ 30,000 in legal costs for Mr Thomson .
Claims : Bibi and Peter Giles arriving at Worcester County Court yesterday
Last night the former model , 50 , was branded an ‘ attention - seeking fantasist ’ with an ‘ excessive libido ’ .
Mr Thomson , 40 , who has been supported by his GP wife Lucy throughout the five - day trial , broke down as he described how the allegations turned his life upside down and threatened to destroy his career and his marriage .
He said the ‘ horrible , false ’ claims had threatened to ‘ ruin ’ his career and marriage .
Father of three Mr Thomson said : ‘ The last three years have been a horrible ordeal and this week in court has been unspeakably stressful especially for my wife , our families and for me .
I ’ve always tried to conduct myself in an entirely professional manner .
‘ The allegations Mrs Giles made , which are completely untrue , are some of the most serious that a doctor can be accused of and threatened to ruin my career and reputation .
‘ I am therefore enormously relieved and delighted that this case has been concluded with my complete exoneration of these false allegations and that I am able to return to work on Monday with my professional reputation intact . ’
Guyana - born Mrs Giles had sued her private consultant for £ 50,000 at Worcester County Court for triggering two intense orgasms within 90 seconds during an internal examination in 2006 while a nurse stood just feet away .
She claimed he then sexually harassed her over a six - month period and pressured her to have an affair .
Mr Thomson claimed that Mrs Giles was an ‘ infatuated ’ patient who lied and bombarded him with phone calls .
He continued to take the ‘ bizarre ’ calls because he wanted to continue his duty of care , he said .
Mrs Giles had waived her right to anonymity in an attempt to flush out more of his ‘ victims ’ , she claimed .
Ironically , this brought the case to the attention of her former GP Dr William Dowley .
On Thursday Dr Dowley , 45 , came forward to give evidence about his patient ’s ‘ pestering ’ behaviour between 2002 and
2004 .
But before he took the witness stand , Mrs Giles agreed to drop the case .
Christina Lambert , QC , for Mr Thomson , told the court : ‘ There is a history of what I ’m going to describe as boundary issues .
‘ There is reference to the patient reporting to a practitioner that she has an excessive libido .
But for the doctor / patient relationship , she would wish to have a personal relationship with him . ’
Harassed : Gynaecologist Angus Thomson arrives at the court yesterday with his GP wife , Lucy .
He told the court Mrs Giles had become ' obsessed ' with him
Judge Pearce - Higgins added : ‘ The client ’s case was there had never been a difficulty with a GP in the past – an incident of this sort had never occurred .
She has got form .
She has pestered a doctor in the past . ’
He accepted the settlement , saying : ‘ This fully exonerates Mr Thomson and leaves his professional reputation intact .
He has no doubt learned that there are limits to compassion and professional concern that he can volunteer to his patients . ’
Mrs Giles and her husband Peter , 65 , refused to comment .
But a worker at the Money Box shop near the court described how Mrs Giles told him that doctors had ‘ ganged up ’ on her .
She told him she was concerned that her 15 - year - old daughter would be bullied at her private school because of the graphic nature of the case .
Mrs Giles , who modelled in the U.S. , has met Princess Anne and the Guyanese president at functions .
A source close to the couple last night described her as a ‘ fantasist ’ and questioned why she chose to pursue the claims in a civil court instead of reporting them to the police .
The source said : ‘ I always thought Bibi was living in a fantasy world as she would often come out with these bizarre stories or statements that seemed to have little basis in truth .
Evidence : Dr William Dowley , a GP who revealed details about Mrs Giles ' past to the court , forcing the case to be adjourned .
She later dropped her claims against her former gynaecologist , Mr Thomson
‘ She said she was a hairdresser to Hollywood stars in Los Angeles like Oprah Winfrey and Janet Jackson and to begin with we believed her , but then it began to seem a little fanciful .
She seems to be a fantasist , an attention seeker and a drama queen .
‘ But her lies have finally caught up with her in this court case . ’
Mrs Giles had claimed that Mr Thomson rhythmically rubbed her during an internal examination at Droitwich Spa Hospital in Worcestershire , where he runs a private weekly clinic , after surgery for a prolapse .
But the consultant said that Mrs Giles became ‘ obsessed ’ and propositioned him .
Telephone records showed that she called his personal mobile up to three times a day and sent a message referring to his ‘ Angus beef sausage ’ .
The case is expected to cost her £ 50,000 , including her own legal fees .

Palin Strikes Out Bitterly at Obama Only to Hit Herself
The half - term governor of Alaska who quit mid-term due to an inability to get her agenda passed and indeed , even her own Attorney General confirmed ( a first in Alaska ) , strikes out at Obama , calling him “ inexperienced ” and unable to get a bi-partisan bill due to his “ lack of management experience . ”
Sarah is concerned that Obama is in “ over his head ” on health care reform .
Advertisements
Oh , wow .
This from the woman who was forced to quit after tearing Alaska apart with her lies about her ethics violations , failed fiscal policies , numerous shady dealings , and an inability to even get her own Attorney General confirmed ( a first in Alaskan history ) .
A woman so cankerous , inexperienced , and unaware of the legislative process and law that she was charged with over 21 ethics violations during her self - aborted first term .
A woman so divisive that her own party turned against her in Alaska , with previous top supporters calling her a “ sociopath ” “ narcissist ” and “ snake in the grass ” .
Yes , this from the woman whose own team members turned on her .
One of them is writing a book right now .
Her own campaign managers turned on her during her failed 2008 bid , publicly calling her a fabricator and suggesting in no uncertain terms that she has mental issues .
A woman whose own campaign managers decided that if McCain won , they would have to force him to change the VP role so as not to inflict Palin on America because she was “ dangerous ” .
This woman is chastising her President on his inability to get bi-partisan legislation passed ?
Does she realize that all of America , save for a few thousand desperate teabaggers , can see through her venomous attacks of pure projection and jealousy ?
In spite of Palin ’s confidence to the contrary , Obama is going to get it passed because his own party supports him .
And that party is the one the American people trust more than they trust Sarah ’s party .
That ’s why the Democrats are the majority right now .
See , this is how it works in Real America .
People vote and then someone wins .
And then the winner gets to pass their agenda if they ’re good at their job and they ’re not faced with a obstructionist party which puts power above country .
Hmmmm ….
And guess what ?
Obama ’s people are not writing tell - all books about him , going on Primetime TV to warn Americans about mental instability , or charging him with ethics violations .
His own party did n’t have to hire a city manager because he was a failure at his job as mayor of a small town of 6000 people .
Does that ring any bells , Palinistas ?
Obama ’s wife is n’t cc’d on all of his executive emails because he is actually capable of making decisions without being managed by another person .
And while I ’m at it , this might be a good time to let Sarah in on the fact that the founding fathers did not write the pledge of allegiance , and they most certainly did not write the part about God .
It was , in fact , written by a Christian socialist .
You know , one of those people who believe in the teachings of Jesus , unlike Sarah and her cult of Dominionist , end - times seeking , science denying social - Darwinists .
Such a Christian socialist would have been FOR this healthcare bill , not against it .
Sarah could n’t even rally her own party behind her choices .
And that ’s truly the sign of a failed leader .
Furthermore , her party ’s failure to come to the table with a solution to the healthcare crisis is no reflection upon the President or his promise to work with both sides of the aisle .
Instead , it is a reflection of the Republican allegiance to the corporate insurance industry and nothing more .
It is a reflection of their unwillingness to solve the largest fiscal crisis facing this country right now .
And that ’s something Sarah knows a lot about , having quit when the going got tough fiscally in Alaska .
Is Sarah really this blind to her own record and reality ?
How can she go on national TV and spew her Orwellian distortions without ever feeling a twinge of guilt ?
Exactly what makes up this “ person ” we call Sarah Palin ?
What does she stand for , other than self - promotion , greed , lies , and bitterness ?
See , Obama is a constitutional lawyer , a community organizer , and indeed , Sarah ’s President .
Which is sort of like being a failed mayor and a half - term governor besmirched by guilty charges on ethics violations , only with real knowledge about the law and an ability to lead .
Watch out , Sarah , because your bitterness and your jealousy of President Obama is clouding what little patriotism you ever possessed .

Linda Greenhouse on the Supreme Court and the law .
Which of these assertions is the less plausible ?
1. Representative Randy Neugebauer of Texas was n’t aiming at Representative Bart Stupak when he interrupted Mr. Stupak ’s floor speech during the closing hours of the health care debate by yelling “ baby killer . ”
( Mr. Neugebauer said his target was the bill , not his colleague from Michigan , who had accepted a fig leaf of a compromise on the bill ’s anti-abortion stance . )
2. The Supreme Court will find the new health care legislation unconstitutional .
In my book , these two propositions are running neck and neck into the realm of fantasy .
Fourteen state attorneys general — 13 in a coalition led by Bill McCollum of Florida and one , Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II of Virginia , going it alone — filed lawsuits this week asking federal judges to declare the new Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act unconstitutional .
The plaintiffs do not exactly mince words .
The new law violates “ the core constitutional principle of federalism upon which this nation was founded , ” the Florida complaint declares .
It is “ contrary to the foundational assumptions of the constitutional compact , ” Virginia claims .
The Web is filled with commentary and debate over the merits of the states ’ arguments that the new law exceeds Congress ’s authority to regulate interstate commerce and violates the 10th Amendment ’s protection for state sovereignty .
Interesting theoretical questions , to be sure .
But the only real question is whether any of these arguments will find a warm reception from at least five Supreme Court justices .
The answer , almost certainly , is no .
The challengers invoke and seek to build upon the Rehnquist court ’s “ federalism revolution ” that flowered briefly during the 1990’s .
In a series of 5 - to - 4 rulings , the court took a view of Congressional authority that was narrower than at any time since the early New Deal .
The court struck down a federal law that barred guns near schools , on the ground that possession of a gun near a school was not the type of activity that the Constitution ’s Commerce Clause authorized Congress to regulate .
It ruled that Congress could not require states to give their employees the protections of the federal laws against discrimination on the basis of age or disability .
It ruled that the federal government could n’t “ commandeer ” state officials to perform federal functions like federally mandated background checks of gun purchasers .
So is n’t it reasonable to suppose that the constitutional attack on the health - insurance mandate , which states must facilitate by setting up insurance exchanges , will resonate with today ’s majority ?
It ’s a fair question — to which my answer is , “ That was then , this is now . ”
John Roberts is an acutely image - conscious chief justice , as watchful and protective of the Supreme Court ’s image as he is of his own .
The architects of the Rehnquist federalism revolution were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his fellow Arizonan , Justice Sandra Day O’Connor ( Chief Justice Rehnquist was actually from Milwaukee , but he decided during his Army service in North Africa that he liked the air of the desert rather than the cold and damp of the Great Lakes . )
They were Westerners to whom the notion of states ’ rights came naturally .
But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is not William Rehnquist , and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. is not Sandra Day O’Connor .
John Roberts has made his career inside the Beltway ever since coming to Washington to clerk for Rehnquist .
As for Sam Alito , I do n’t believe that apart from a brief part - time gig as an adjunct law professor , this former federal prosecutor , Justice Department lawyer and federal judge has cashed a paycheck in his adult life that was n’t issued by the federal government .
Nothing in their backgrounds or in their jurisprudence so far indicates that they are about to sign up with either the Sagebrush Rebellion or the Tea Party .
Chief Justice Roberts appears particularly in tune with the exercise of national power .
One of his handful of major dissenting opinions came in the 2007 case of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency , in which the court ordered the federal agency to regulate global warming or give a science - based explanation for its refusal to do so .
That case was brought by a group of coastal states , which argued that climate change was lapping at their borders .
Chief Justice Roberts objected that the states should not have been accorded standing to pursue their lawsuit .
He denounced the “ special solicitude ” that the court ’s majority showed the state plaintiffs .
An early Roberts dissenting vote , just months into his first term , came in Gonzales v. Oregon , a 6 - to - 3 decision rejecting the United States attorney general ’s effort to prevent doctors in Oregon from cooperating with that state ’s assisted - suicide law .
Students of Rehnquist - style federalism will recall that the master himself blinked when his revolution got too close to the core of issues that people really care about .
After all , hardly anyone had ever heard of the Gun - Free School Zones Act , the law the court invalidated in United States v. Lopez as beyond Congress ’s commerce power .
But plenty of people cared about the Family and Medical Leave Act , the law at issue in a 2003 case , Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs .
Chief Justice Rehnquist surprised almost everyone in that case , not only voting to uphold the law ’s application to state employees , but also writing a majority opinion displaying so much sympathy for the aims of the law it could have been ghost - written for him by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
And with that decision seven years ago , the federalism revolution sputtered to an end .
John Roberts is an acutely image - conscious chief justice , as watchful and protective of the Supreme Court ’s image as he is of his own .
I find it almost impossible to believe that this careful student of history would place his court in the same position as the court that has been rewarded with history ’s negative judgment for thwarting the early New Deal .
Midweek polls showed the public already rallying around the new health care law .
That trend is likely to accelerate as people realize that the law ’s benefits belie the scare stories — just around that time that the state challenges are likely to reach the Supreme Court .
It wo n’t require a summa cum laude in history from Harvard to be able to tell history ’s wrong side from its right .

Palin for Paul
There 's always been a real overlap between tea parties , the Ron Paul movement and Sarah Palin 's conservative grass roots , and the alliance makes itself felt a bit today in Palin 's endorsement of the Kentucky Senate bid by Paul 's son , Rand .
Rand Paul 's statement on the endorsement and " generous contribution " :
Sarah Palin has clearly seen that Rand Paul supports smaller , constitutional government and is taking the fight to the career politicians and will shake up the tax and spend crowd in Washington D.C. “ Governor Palin is providing tremendous leadership as the Tea Party movement and constitutional conservatives strive to take our country back , ” Rand said .
It seems to me that for all the talk of a GOP being torn apart by factions , this represents a kind of alliance that Ron Paul was n't about to enter into in 2008 .
UPDATE : Paul is claiming the endorsement , but worth noting that we have n't had a statement from Palin yet .
UPDATE : Paul seems to be basing the endorsement claim on the check .

For years , Marcia Merrick began her day making lunches for her two children .
Her kids are grown up now , but Ms. Merrick still makes lunches every morning – 400 of them .
Each decorated paper bag contains a peanut butter - and - jelly sandwich or a bean burrito , chips , fruit , and two homemade cookies .
She also includes a note of encouragement – and then distributes them to the homeless of Kansas City , Mo .
Dubbed the “ mother of the streets , ” Merrick starts every day ( Christmas and other holidays included ) at 4:30 a.m. so she can finish her preparations and make the 15 - minute drive to downtown Kansas City by 6 a.m. , the time when most homeless shelters close and their overnight guests are turned out .
She also makes stops at homeless encampments tucked away in secluded spots around the fringes of the city , under bridges and highway overpasses , and along the banks of the Missouri River .
Each day is a little different .
She gives out half of the 400 lunches in the morning and the rest during a similar afternoon run , before the shelters open again at 4 p.m .
The time in between is taken up with other tasks , such as driving someone to a social services office or to court or a health clinic .
She also gives away items like clothing and bedding based on individual needs .
In addition , Merrick and the volunteers who work with her help some 370 homeless families a year .
Merrick does n’t just feed and clothe the homeless .
She talks with them , learns their names , listens to their stories , and gives them hugs and encouraging words .
As a result , she ’s well known on the streets of Kansas City and has the trust of many of the city ’s homeless .
“ Really , the food and clothing I give them is just a way to get into their hearts , ” she says .
“ A lot of them want to change , but they do n’t have ... the knowledge and the emotional support to do that .
Some have been on the streets so long they do n’t even know where to start . ”
What keeps her going , she says , is the success she has had in helping destitute individuals and families turn their lives around .
Kim and Wayne Hill are one such case .
The self - employed house painters found their work all but evaporated when the economy began to sour a few years ago .
In time they lost their house and found themselves living with their young son in a family shelter .
That ’s where they met Merrick .
She was able to do many things to help them reclaim a normal life , including helping Mr. Hill receive much needed dental work .
She even found painting jobs for the couple .
“ I ca n’t begin to tell you everything Marcia did for us , ” says Mrs .
Hill , whose family now lives in an apartment in a large complex , where her husband is the staff painter .
“ She ’s so compassionate .
She ’s good at finding that place in your heart that ’s lacking – any heartache or sadness – and then filling that void .
She ’s the ultimate mother . ”
Merrick works not only to meet the basic needs of the homeless , but to uphold their dignity and self - respect .
Gloria Brown is the kitchen manager for the City Union Mission Family Center , which provides long - term shelter for homeless families .
One Saturday a month , Merrick and a group of volunteers bring food and prepare and serve a breakfast to the residents , who number as many as 120 .
Ms. Brown says that instead of having the residents line up and receive their food at the serving window , as is customary , Merrick puts out place mats , silverware , and a small vase of flowers on each table .
She and her helpers then take the residents ’ orders .
“ They wait on them like they are in a restaurant , ” Brown says .
“ She just likes to treat them with respect and let them know that somebody cares about them . ”
“ Marcia serves , ” says Gary Blakeman , a retiree and volunteer who has worked with Merrick for seven years .
“ She does n’t just dole out food .
She actually serves the homeless .
And she does what she does with love .
She ’s truly concerned with their welfare . ”
Merrick says her work of providing care and hope for society ’s disadvantaged began when she was in high school in Wichita , Kan .
She made several church mission trips , one for an entire summer , where she first encountered large numbers of needy people .
“ I realized what a difference it makes in how I felt , caring for other people , ” she says .
“ I did n’t know it then , but I think I was developing a heart for people who had been shunted aside by society . ”
Her charitable work took a back seat to her own family for a time .
But 10 years ago , when her daughter was 15 , Merrick felt the need to resume her caring activities .
At first , she matched up friends and acquaintances who had items they were willing to give away with people in need .
The recipients were not just the homeless , but also victims of domestic violence , the unemployed , the recently divorced – pretty much anyone she knew of who had a need .
“ It kind of snowballed from there , ” she says .
In 2001 , as her activity increased and donors asked for tax write - offs , she started a nonprofit , Reaching Out Inc .
Today , about 80 percent of her work is for the homeless .
Her organization works with an area church , which provides her with storage space for food , furniture , and supplies .
An ever - changing roster of volunteers – school groups , church groups , friends , and acquaintances – help with decorating the bags , putting together hygiene bags ( toothbrush , toothpaste , shampoo , clean pair of socks , and the like ) , baking cookies , and organizing food and clothing drives .
Occasionally , volunteers go out with her on her rounds .
Merrick herself gets by modestly on alimony and a small pension .
Circumstances may compel her to return to the paid workforce sometime this summer , which would necessitate an adjustment to her current grueling volunteer schedule .
Regardless of what the future holds , she says , she will continue to work on behalf of the homeless in one way or another .
“ I truly believe we can make a difference in their lives , and I do n’t want anybody to ever think that somebody does n’t care , ” she says .
“ They ’re homeless , but they ’re still human . ”

As promised , here ’s a bonus Kim Stanley Robinson video from the Polygraph / FHI event the night before the “ Science , Religion , Ideology ” talk .
( I ’m very sorry I could n’t put up more , but I found this event was actually rather difficult to excerpt , and that much of what is excerptable is echoed in the later talk anyway .
It was a great conversation — but a lengthy and somewhat twisting one . )
He talks here about a claim he ’s made elsewhere , that science fiction is the realism of our time .
A brief transcript of the first part of his reply follows the video .
KSR : I think it ’s very true that we are living in a science fiction novel that we all collaborate on , and it ’s because everything that science fiction was about through its historical named period , the twentieth century , has kind of come true .
And also we live in a world that is so intensely structured by science and technology that we ca n’t get out of it .
If we were to get out of it would still be a science fiction move , the retreat to the farm .
So it ’s hegemonic , you ca n’t escape it , we ’re in that world created by science and technology .
And also there ’s this intense sense of futurity , in that if you opened up your newspaper or laptop tomorrow and it said , “ They ’ve cloned six South Koreans successfully and they ’re all named Kim , ” you would believe it , there would be no surprise there .
Anything could happen .
You could say , well , we just got a signal from Alpha Centauri , there are intelligent aliens there , they sent us the code for pi and the Pythagorean theorem .
There ’s no reason to disbelieve that , either .
So we live in this world of anticipation of strangeness , of change , rapidly accelerating change .
I came through the Atlanta airport today , and you know those speedwalkers that are underneath the various terminals ?
When I was young there was this famous bestseller , Future Shock , by Alvin Toffler .
Future shock : we do n’t talk about that anymore because none of you are shocked .
And that ’s because the shock comes at the moment you step on the walkway and you feel the drag between one acceleration and another .
At the moment you ’re being accelerated to a new speed there ’s a little gravity drag on your body , and that ’s the moment of “ future shock ” — 1972 or ‘ 3 — and when you ’re walking with the walkway that ’s moving at a different speed there ’s no shock there .
You simply are moving at that speed .
So now we ’re moving a new historical speed that ’s faster than the historical speed was when I was a kid .
That moment was marked by this book Future Shock , and it ’s an archaic term , obsolete , because there ’s nothing in our experience now …
I do n’t think there ’s anything that could happen that would shock us , because we ’re moving at such a fast speed now , and because we ’re conditioned by science fiction .
GC : What about the other end of the runway ?
KSR : When you slow down ?
Well , that ’s another — you feel that too .
This is like when your connection to the Internet goes out for three days , or your phone line , or when your cell phone dies — these moments when you ’re suddenly not having the sixth sense of the cloud …
A short time ago , in the fantasies of the far , far right , the evil lord Darth Obama tried to take over health care .
The Republicans vowed to defeat Darth Obama , but they could not stop his Commie - socialist plot to impose death panels , kill grandma , and make health care available to all Americans .
Update ( 10:23AM ) : From Twitter --
" There 's hope for Vader 's asthma now . "
For years , we 've heard complaints about using the term " piracy " to describe the online copyright infringement — but most have come from Big Content 's critics .
As noted copyright scholar William Patry argued in his most recent book , " To say that X is a pirate is a metaphoric heuristic , intended to persuade a policymaker that the in - depth analysis can be skipped and the desired result immediately attained ...
Claims of piracy are rhetorical nonsense . "
That may well be true , but copyright holders have long preferred the term , with its suggestions of theft , destruction , and violence .
The " pirates " have now co-opted the term , adopting it with gusto and hoisting the Jolly Roger across the Internet ( The Pirate Bay being the most famous example ) .
Some of those concerned about online copyright infringement now realize that they may have created a monster by using the term " piracy . "
This week , at the unveiling of a new study for the International Chamber of Commerce which argued that 1.2 million jobs could be lost in Europe as a result of copyright infringement by 2015 , the head of the International Actors ' Federation lamented the term .
" We should change the word piracy , " she said at a press conference .
" To me , piracy is something adventurous , it makes you think about Johnny Depp .
We all want to be a bit like Johnny Depp .
But we 're talking about a criminal act .
We 're talking about making it impossible to make a living from what you do . "
Translation : we should have chosen a less - sexy term .
Speaking at a very different event in Abu Dhabi last week , Rupert Murdoch 's son James did his part to redefine the sexy " pirates " as common thieves and nothing more .
" There is no difference with going into a store and stealing Pringles or a handbag and taking this stuff , " he said .
" It 's a basic condition for investment and economic growth and there should be the same level of property rights whether it's a house or a movie .
The idea that there 's a new consumer class and you have to be consumer - friendly when they 're stealing stuff .
No .
There should be the same level of sanctity as there is around property .
Content is no different .
They 're not crazy kids .
No. Punish them . "
Yikes .
" Piracy " has certainly had negative effects on many sectors of the content industry , but some of the sturm und drang coming from people like Murdoch is just ridiculous .
As Patry and writers like Steve Knopper point out , the disaggregation of the album has been one of the key drivers of lower music revenues — and movies are doing pretty well .
In fact , theaters are setting box office records .
As departing MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman said in a speech to theater owners recently ( PDF ) , " What a year !
As John said , a 10 percent lift for the box office here at home ... a 30 percent jump globally since 2005 .
Reversing a two - year trend , we have more people going to the movies ... and more folks going more often ... with a hard - core of movie fans — the 10 percent who go once or more a month — accounting for half of all ticket sales . "
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan , Feb. 8 ( UPI ) --
There are more private security contractors from Xe , formerly Blackwater , operating in Islamabad than capital police , a religious leader said .
Maulana Fazal - ur - Rahman , the leader of Jamiat Ulema-e - Islam , a Deobandi political party in Pakistan , said there were as many as 9,000 Xe contractors working in Islamabad , compared with just 7,000 capital police , Pakistan 's News International reports .

The Pakistani Taliban last week said attacks in the Lower Dir District of Pakistan 's North - West Frontier province killed U.S. personnel , claiming the attack was an act of revenge against Xe contractors operating in the region .
Richard Holbrooke , the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , confirmed the deaths were U.S. military personnel but described the Taliban claims as propaganda .
Their deaths are the first known U.S. military fatalities in Pakistan .
Fazal blamed foreign contractors for instability in the country , saying they undermined an already weak democratic government .
He equated Xe contractors with the insurgent Taliban .
Washington linked stability in Pakistan to the success of its counterinsurgency battle in neighboring Afghanistan , encouraging Islamabad to step up domestic security measures .
Pakistan in October launched its own offensive in the volatile tribal regions near the Afghan border .
Fazal during a weekend meeting with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said an immediate halt to military activity in the tribal areas would bring normalcy to the region .
Most of us remember Windows System Restore as a lame - duck feature from Windows XP ; when it seemed we might benefit from using it , it never quite worked how we expected .
That 's no longer the case .
Advertisement
Windows System Restore is an awesome system recovery tool , and it's included with Windows for free .
It 's the ideal solution for rolling back bad drivers , fixing when buggy software breaks your PC , or simply rolling you back to a previous point in time .
If you 've still got a bad taste in your mouth from the lackluster XP version of System Restore , it 's time to take a look at it again if you 've upgraded to Windows 7 or Vista .
System Restore in Windows 7
Is Better than XP
If you 've ever tried the XP variety of System Restore , the uselessness of it probably left a bad taste in your mouth .
Setting a system restore point was often agonizingly slow , and when it came time to actually attempt a system restore , it rarely did what you wanted it to do .
But if you 've upgraded to Vista or Windows 7 , you should really give System Restore another chance .
Advertisement
Back in the XP days , system restore simply used a file filter and copied files around , but since Vista , it uses the Shadow Copy features built into Windows — essentially , Windows can create a snapshot of your drive as of a certain point in time , which can then be used later to restore your PC should anything go wrong .
The Shadow Copy feature is also used by backup software to take snapshots of files even while they are in use , and it powers the Previous Versions feature built into the Professional and Ultimate version of Windows .
Using Shadow Copy instead of simple file copying makes System Restore much more effective and comprehensive — while the XP version could only really roll back from certain Windows changes and generally did n't work that well , System Restore in Vista or Windows 7 can actually roll back to a previous version of an installed application .

System Restore snapshots are automatically created on a periodic basis using a Task Scheduler job , triggered at system startup and at midnight each day .
Before you start to think it 's a contributing factor to your system boot speeds , the Conditions tab specifies that it wo n't actually start until the PC has been idle for more than 10 minutes — and if you do n't like the schedule , you can tweak the Task Scheduler job to run more ( or less ) often .
When you install ( or uninstall ) a piece of software , a new System Restore point is also triggered , or snapshots can be created manually if you 're about to make a change and want to be sure that you can roll back .
Create a Manual System Restore Snapshot
Advertisement
If you 're going to be making changes to your system , like upgrading drivers or tweaking settings , you should create a snapshot before you do anything , so if it all goes horribly awry , you can roll it back to normal .
If you 're using Windows 7 , just use the System Protection tab in the System Properties window — or you can search for " create restore point " to get there directly .
Once you 're there , click the Create button , type in a descriptive name for the restore point , and then let it run — it should n't take longer than a few seconds .
If you 're a fan of the step - by - step walk - through , we 've written up a quick guide to manually creating a System Restore point over at How - To Geek .
If the manual method is too many steps for you , you can make a shortcut that creates a system restore snapshot in a single step without having to go through any other steps .
Regardless of the method you choose , you should make a point of creating system restore snapshots before you start doing any major tweaking on your PC .

Restoring from a System Restore Snapshot
Advertisement
All these snapshots do n't do you much good if you do n't know how to restore your PC using them , and it 's just as easy as creating a snapshot .
While you can restore from a snapshot by simply finding the System Restore screen in Control Panel , you 're not going to have a lot of luck actually using the snapshot unless you 've restarted your PC into Safe Mode .
Normally , you can just restart your PC and hit the F8 key really quickly right when Windows is starting up , which will show you the boot menu and allow you to choose to boot into Safe Mode , but if you have problems triggering this , I 've previously written up a guide to force Windows to boot into Safe Mode using the msconfig utility .
Advertisement
Once you 're in Safe Mode , head into System Properties –>
System Restore or just search through the Control Panel to pull up the wizard , choose the restore point that you 'd like to roll back to , and then choose Next to start the restore process .
If you 're not sure which one to choose , however , you can select a restore point and click the Scan for Affected Programs button , which will analyze the restore point to figure out what applications will be rolled back if you choose that restore point .
You should note that System Restore is n't going to roll back your documents , it 's just going to operate on internal operating system files , program files , and system settings .
If you had a document on your desktop , it should n't be removed , but if you roll back to before you install an application , the shortcut to that application would probably go away .

If your PC wo n't even boot , you should also note that you can access the System Restore features from the Windows installation disc , which can be very helpful when you 've completely broken your PC .
There 's No Performance Drain From System Restore
Advertisement
One of the most common performance - tweaking myths that you 'll find on all the amateur tweaking sites says that you should disable System Restore for maximum performance , but that 's just ridiculous .
We 've already shown you that System Restore only kicks in once a day , and only runs when the system is idle — so the only drain on your resources is a little bit of extra drive space being used , not to mention that snapshots take virtually no time to create .

As a tech writer , one of my biggest pet peeves is the plethora of bad advice …

If you 're really worried about the use of your drive space , you can easily tweak System Restore to use less space in Windows 7 — just head into System Properties –> System Protection –>
Configure and drag the slider to choose exactly how much space you want to use .
For Windows Vista , it 's a lot more difficult — you 'll need to use a command - line hack to force Windows Vista to use less space .
The much better solution , however , is to simply clear out all restore points but the most frequent one whenever you 're in need of some extra drive space using the Disk Cleanup utility .
Just run it as administrator by right - clicking on the utility in the start menu and choosing the Run as Administrator option , or you can open it normally and click the " Clean up system files " button — once you 've done so , you can choose the More Options tab where you 'll find a Clean up button to remove all the old restore points except for the most recent one .
This keeps you safe just in case you need to restore , but does n't keep the older , more unnecessary restore points around .

At this point hopefully you can see the benefit and learn to love how System Restore can fix your PC easily , but if you really insist , you can disable System Restore easily from the System Protection tab .
What about you ?

PC Gamer have experienced the controversial new Ubisoft DRM first - hand , in the PC build of Assassin ’s Creed 2 .
We already thought the paranoid new copy protection was pretty bad , requiring as it did an online check everytime you played and giving you a hard time if you tried to launch it offline .
What we did n’t think – what we did n’t believe they ’d be mad enough to do – was that it ’d kick you out of the game if your net connection dropped for any reason .
Or , as PCG ’s Tom Francis rightly observes , even if Ubi ’s servers happen to have a funny turn .
( A troubling precedent for which has already been set by EA – Alec experienced something similar yesterday , when Bioware / EA ’s servers suffering extended maintenance meant all his Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 DLC was deemed unauthorised , which in turn prevented him from loading any savegames which used that DLC .
The point being : do n’t punish your customers because you ’ve screwed up ) .
Incredibly , the worst is indeed true in Assassin ’s Creed 2 – and , it appears , will be for Settlers 7 too .
No matter what you ’re doing , no matter what the reason , the game will refuse to let you continue playing if it decides you ’re not online .
You ’re dumped right back to a menu , losing any progress made since the last checkpoint .
If you do n’t have a constant , uninterrupted internet connection , you ca n’t play .
Let ’s list some of the reasons you might drop your net connection , shall we ?
Router crash , ISP problems , cat playing with the cable , microwave muddling your wi-fi connection , train going into a tunnel when you ’re on 3G , Windows having a networking befuddlement , someone else in the house torrenting the bandwidth dry …
Incredible .
In - cred - i- ble .
It ’s like someone taking away your food mid-meal because your napkin ’s fallen on the floor .
It makes us want to pull an expression we ’re not physically capable of , like this .
It ’s also worth noting this is a day on which EA have turned off multiplayer servers for games that are only a year old – so it ’s hard to have faith that Ubi ’s activation servers will be around for many years hence .
Hopefully they would n’t turn them off without first releasing an offline mode patch – but , given how unforgiving this system currently is , we ’re hardly going to leap to such positive presumptions .
While we ’ve not always gone full - pelt protest against excessive DRM , this is open contempt for paying customers , and , quite frankly , it ’s the most valid reason yet for PC gamers to call a massed boycott .
We ’ll certainly be ignoring it with all the passion we can muster .

The trailer for the flick makes it look like a cross between a Stuart Gordon movie and Fanboys - which could be awesome .
Recent history has seen players like Cooke and May and Bertuzzi in Vancouver colours and now there is the pest Burrows and hard rocks like Bieksa and Ohlund and at the head of the line , Kesler , who plays with nothing but malice in his heart .
Goddamn him for it but I want him on my club .
-- Pat , Black Dog Hates Skunks
Pat says what I 've been thinking for two years now , and he brings such poetry to the words .
I hate Ryan Kesler .
I hate that he 's a big center .
I hate that he was taken with the pick directly after Marc Pouliot .
I hate that he's an effective penalty killer .
I hate that he 's a defensive force .
I hate that he 's a pest .
I hate that he 's an agitator .
I hate that he 's a Vancouver Canuck .
I hate Ryan Kesler almost as much as a I hate Alexandre Burrows , but I do n't respect Burrows whatsoever .
He 's gutless and he whines .
He 's the worst kind of diver - he 's perfect for the Vancouver Canucks .
But not Kesler .
I respect Kesler because he 's the kind of guy that demands respect with his game .
Both Scott and Tyler have written excellent posts on Kesler 's stats and his worth , so I wo n't go into that .
Read Scott 's " On the Kesler Deal " and Tyler 's " Canucks Sign Kesler " , they are both wonderful pieces .
" I hate them "
-- Ryan Kesler , on Team Canada
That is Ryan Kesler .
On the eve of meeting the tournament 's heavy favorite , he came out and said he hates them .
In an era where the underdog is always trying to cast themselves in a role against the world in a constant search for some twisted version of " respect " , Kesler took the opposite tact - he said he hated the favorites and did so while standing in their country .
Malice , indeed .
I hate Ryan Kesler because he has a big mouth , but he backs it up with his play on the ice .
He talks , oh he never stops talking .
The ice - level cameras show the venom and bile that spew forth every time he's on the ice and any time he 's near the opposing bench .
That motormouth can make a television viewer grit his teeth - imagine the effect on the ice !
I hate Ryan Kesler because the Oilers have n't had a player of Kesler 's ilk for a very long time .
He combines the stout own - zone play of Mike Grier with the agitation of Adam Graves with the penalty - killing ability of Todd Marchant and the offense of Jason Arnott .
He gives the Oilers that which they have not had since Esa Tikkanen and I 'm jealous of that .
I hate Ryan Kesler because he 's a Canuck , and Canucks fans do not deserve him .
They are an arrogant and fair - weather bunch , showing up for games to be seen , yammering away on their cell phones and screaming out " Looooooooooooo " on every routine save , and crying about the no-call on Burrows ' latest dive .
I hate Ryan Kesler because he is a modern - day Ken Linseman , an infuriating player that will step into any role and beat his opponent just because he can and he 'll make sure that his opponent knows he 's being beaten the entire time .
I hate Ryan Kesler for signing this new contract , an affordable deal that keeps him in the Northwest for way too long .
Most of all , I hate Ryan Kesler because he's on the wrong team .
Though I hate Ryan Kesler , I want him to be an Edmonton Oiler .
I walked up to a girl recently and very calmly and politely said to her …
“ I ’d like a McDouble , a small fries and a medium coffee with cream and sugar . ”
That may not sound like much of an opening line , but she did the open mouth thing and briefly pushed her hair back a little .
I just smiled at her , repeated my order and raised my brows a little and the blush was spectacular .
You see it ’s not what you say , it ’s how you say it .
The trick is quite simple to the delivery of such an everyday line creating such instant gina tingle …
… I have a New Zealand accent .
It ’s so good it should be illegal .
( come see the majestic fjords )
If you ’re a long time reader you ’ll know that I was born and lived in New Zealand for the first 24 years of my life before moving to the United States to be married to Jennifer .
I ’ve been living here fore 15 years now .
For those playing the home game and not math challenged , I am easily worked out to be 39 .
My accent has definitely softened over the years , I used to have trouble ordering in restaurants etc ( the solution was to order in an American accent ) but now speak smoothly enough that I rarely have trouble with that .
But the Kiwi accent remains as a firm undertone to the way I talk .
Jennifer naturally just does n’t hear it anymore unless I purposely turn the Kiwi up and concentrate on it .
( ride the cable car in the beautiful capital city )
But to other American women it ’s like catnip .
Since I started being really aware of it and how women react to it , it ’s actually started being amusing watching the gina tingle just kick in with basic conversations .
I ’m not even trying to hit on someone and I get the hips turning towards me , the hair twirls and easy laughter .
I seriously cannot shut the damn thing off .
( come see the lovely sheep )
A couple examples …
At one of my kids parent teacher nights , the young married teacher basically completely ignored me and talked quite directly to my wife as I sat quietly and let the conversation go between them .
Then I opened my mouth and asked a question ( I forget what it was ) and it was like a switch was thrown and Mrs.
Teach ’s face lit up like a Christmas Tree .
After that my wife was all but ignored for the rest of the meeting and I got a full hair taken down display from Mrs.
Teach , easy laughter , a sudden jump up and sashay across the room to get some random piece my kid had done and a sashay back .
All with my wife sitting next to me the whole time .
( see the worlds biggest syringe and bungee jump off it )
It ’s really helpful as a male nurse getting a little extra help from female doctors once in a while .
Especially if they only get to talk to me on the phone .
I ’m not ugly by any means , but I know I sound sexier than I look .
I ’ve rarely gotten the magical hotlines to male doctors , but get the secret extension to female ones far more frequently .
“ Oh Athol call me for anything ” .
Funny , all I heard was a subtle invitation to a game of Doctors and Nurses .
But maybe that ’s just me and my overconfidence with women kicking in , baby .
( enjoy the fine sports events )
My favorite female co-worker playfully told me off today that “ I have too many women in my life ” , and right after that I got a call from a hospital discharge planner who just dove into the “ that ’s an amazing accent where are you from … ” and we had a mildly flirty conversation while I held up a piece of paper saying “ Too many women LOL ” for my co-worker to read .
And yes I admit I was doing that on purpose to frak with her a little too .
Anyway …
Now I know this all sounds like I ’m full of myself , but I understand this effect really is n’t because I ’m extra special , I ’m just foreign .
I ’ve seen exactly the same thing happen with Americans going to New Zealand .
They may look like they are blending in , but as soon as they open their mouths , opposite sex heads start swiveling en mass and focusing on the source of the accent .
It ’s the ultimate in verbal peacocking .
( a typical Kiwi girl )
My hunch is that something keys us into a foreign accent denoting that you are in fact a walking meat sack of non-local DNA , and a great source of new DNA to be mixed into the local gene pool .
This makes you seem sexier than you in fact “ really are ” .
In New Zealand I might be a pretty decent 7 or 8 , over here I ’m 8 pushing 9 .
Again , it ’s not something I am trying to do , I ’m just non-local .
And non-local is sexy .
I ’ve been in America for 15 years and not once , seriously , not even a single time has a male said to me “ wow I like your accent ” .
On meeting a new female though , roughly one in three women will very obviously express “ oh I love your accent .. where are you from ? ” with a very obvious display of interest .
( also prostitution is legal in New Zealand , so everyone goes home a winner )
The global system is undergoing profound change .
Three powers — Germany , China and Iran — face challenges forcing them to refashion the way they interact with their regions and the world .
We are exploring each of these three states in detail in three geopolitical weeklies , highlighting how STRATFOR ’s assessments of these states are evolving .
First we examined Germany .
We now examine China .
U.S. - Chinese relations have become tenser in recent months , with the United States threatening to impose tariffs unless China agrees to revalue its currency and , ideally , allow it to become convertible like the yen or euro .
China now follows Japan and Germany as one of the three major economies after the United States .
Unlike the other two , it controls its currency ’s value , allowing it to decrease the price of its exports and giving it an advantage not only over other exporters to the United States but also over domestic American manufacturers .
The same is true in other regions that receive Chinese exports , such as Europe .
What Washington considered tolerable in a small developing economy is intolerable in one of the top five economies .
The demand that Beijing raise the value of the yuan , however , poses dramatic challenges for the Chinese , as the ability to control their currency helps drive their exports .
The issue is why China insists on controlling its currency , something embedded in the nature of the Chinese economy .
A collision with the United States now seems inevitable .
It is therefore important to understand the forces driving China , and it is time for STRATFOR to review its analysis of China .
An Inherently Unstable Economic System
China has had an extraordinary run since 1980 .
But like Japan and Southeast Asia before it , dramatic growth rates cannot maintain themselves in perpetuity .
Japan and non-Chinese East Asia did n’t collapse and disappear , but the crises of the 1990s did change the way the region worked .
The driving force behind both the 1990 Japanese Crisis and the 1997 East Asian Crisis was that the countries involved did not maintain free capital markets .
Those states managed capital to keep costs artificially low , giving them tremendous advantages over countries where capital was rationally priced .
Of course , one cannot maintain irrational capital prices in perpetuity ( as the United States is learning after its financial crisis ) ; doing so eventually catches up .
And this is what is happening in China now .
STRATFOR thus sees the Chinese economic system as inherently unstable .
The primary reason why China ’s growth has been so impressive is that throughout the period of economic liberalization that has led to rising incomes , the Chinese government has maintained near - total savings capture of its households and businesses .
It funnels these massive deposits via state - run banks to state - linked firms at below - market rates .
It ’s amazing the growth rate a country can achieve and the number of citizens it can employ with a vast supply of 0 percent , relatively consequence - free loans provided from the savings of nearly a billion workers .
It ’s also amazing how unprofitable such a country can be .
The Chinese system , like the Japanese system before it , works on bulk , churn , maximum employment and market share .
The U.S. system of attempting to maximize return on investment through efficiency and profit stands in contrast .
The American result is sufficient economic stability to be able to suffer through recessions and emerge stronger .
The Chinese result is social stability that wobbles precipitously when exposed to economic hardship .
The Chinese people rebel when work is not available and conditions reach extremes .
It must be remembered that of China ’s 1.3 billion people , more than 600 million urban citizens live on an average of about $ 7 a day , while 700 million rural people live on an average of $ 2 a day , and that is according to Beijing ’s own well - scrubbed statistics .
Moreover , the Chinese system breeds a flock of other unintended side effects .
There is , of course , the issue of inefficient capital use :
When you have an unlimited number of no -consequence loans , you tend to invest in a lot of no -consequence projects for political reasons or just to speculate .
In addition to the overall inefficiency of the Chinese system , another result is a large number of property bubbles .
Yes , China is a country with a massive need for housing for its citizens , but even so , local governments and property developers collude to build luxury dwellings instead of anything more affordable in urban areas .
This puts China in the odd position of having both a glut and a shortage in housing , as well as an outright glut in commercial real estate , where vacancy rates are notoriously high .
There is also the issue of regional disparity .
Most of this lending occurs in a handful of coastal regions , transforming them into global powerhouses , while most of the interior — and thereby most of the population — lives in abject poverty .
There is also the issue of consumption .
Chinese statistics have always been dodgy , but according to Beijing ’s own figures , China has a tiny consumer base .
This base is not much larger than that of France , a country with roughly one twentieth China ’s population and just over half its gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
China ’s economic system is obviously geared toward exports , not expanding consumer credit .
Which brings us to the issue of dependence .
Since China cannot absorb its own goods , it must export them to keep afloat .
The strategy only works when there is endless demand for the goods it makes .
For the most part , this demand comes from the United States .
But the recent global recession cut Chinese exports by nearly one fifth , and there were no buyers elsewhere to pick up the slack .
Meanwhile , to boost household consumption China provided subsidies to Chinese citizens who had little need for — and in some cases little ability to use — a number of big - ticket products .
The Chinese now openly fear that exports will not make a sustainable return to previous levels until 2012 .
And that is a lot of production — and consumption — to subsidize in the meantime .
Most countries have another word for this : waste .
This waste can be broken down into two main categories .
First , the government roughly tripled the amount of cash it normally directs the state banks to lend to sustain economic activity during the recession .
The new loans added up to roughly a third of GDP in a single year .
Remember , with no -consequence loans , profitability or even selling goods is not an issue ; one must merely continue employing people .
Even if China boasted the best loan - quality programs in history , a dramatic increase in lending of that scale is sure to generate mountains of loans that will go bad .
Second , not everyone taking out those loans even intends to invest prudently : Chinese estimates indicate that about one - fourth of this lending surge was used to play China ’s stock and property markets .
It is not that the Chinese are foolish ; that is hardly the case .
Given their history and geographical constraints , we would be hard - pressed to come up with a better plan were we to be selected as Party general secretary for a day .
Beijing is well aware of all these problems and more and is attempting to mitigate the damage and repair the system .
For example , it is considering legalizing portions of what it calls the shadow - lending sector .
Think of this as a sort of community bank or credit union that services small businesses .
In the past , China wanted total savings capture and centralization to better direct economic efforts , but Beijing is realizing that these smaller entities are more efficient lenders — and that over time they may actually employ more people without subsidization .
But the bottom line is that this sort of repair work is experimental and at the margins , and it does n’t address the core damage that the financial model continuously inflicts .
The Chinese fear their economic strategy has taken them about as far as they can go .
STRATFOR used to think that these sorts of internal weaknesses would eventually doom the Chinese system as it did the Japanese system ( upon which it is modeled ) .
Now , we ’re not so sure .
Since its economic opening in 1978 , China has taken advantage of a remarkably friendly economic and political environment .
In the 1980s , Washington did n’t obsess overmuch about China , given its focus on the “ Evil Empire . ”
In the 1990s , it was easy for China to pass inconspicuously in global markets , as China was still a relatively small player .
Moreover , with all the commodities from the former Soviet Union hitting the global market , prices for everything from oil to copper neared historic lows .
No one seemed to fight against China ’s booming demand for commodities or rising exports .
The 2000s looked like they would be more turbulent , and early in the administration of George W. Bush the EP - 3 incident landed the Chinese in Washington ’s crosshairs , but then the Sept. 11 attacks happened and U.S. efforts were redirected toward the Islamic world .
Believe it or not , the above are coincidental developments .
In fact , there is a structural factor in the global economy that has protected the Chinese system for the past 30 years that is a core tenet of U.S. foreign policy : Bretton Woods .
Rethinking Bretton Woods
Bretton Woods is one of the most misunderstood landmarks in modern history .
Most think of it as the formation of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , and the beginning of the dominance of the U.S. dollar in the international system .
It is that , but it is much , much more .
In the aftermath of World War II , Germany and Japan had been crushed , and nearly all of Western Europe lay destitute .
Bretton Woods at its core was an agreement between the United States and the Western allies that the allies would be able to export at near - duty - free rates to the U.S. market in order to boost their economies .
In exchange , the Americans would be granted wide latitude in determining the security and foreign policy stances of the rebuilding states .
In essence , the Americans took what they saw as a minor economic hit in exchange for being able to rewrite first regional , and in time global , economic and military rules of engagement .
For the Europeans , Bretton Woods provided the stability , financing and security backbone Europe used first to recover , and in time to thrive .
For the Americans , it provided the ability to preserve much of the World War II alliance network into the next era in order to compete with the Soviet Union .
The strategy proved so successful with the Western allies that it was quickly extended to World War II foes Germany and Japan , and shortly thereafter to Korea , Taiwan , Singapore and others .
Militarily and economically , it became the bedrock of the anti-Soviet containment strategy .
The United States began with substantial trade surpluses with all of these states , simply because they had no productive capacity due to the devastation of war .
After a generation of favorable trade practices , surpluses turned into deficits , but the net benefits were so favorable to the Americans that the policies were continued despite the increasing economic hits .
The alliance continued to hold , and one result ( of many ) was the eventual economic destruction of the Soviet Union .
Applying this little history lesson to the question at hand , Bretton Woods is the ultimate reason why the Chinese have succeeded economically for the last generation .
As part of Bretton Woods , the United States opens its markets , eschewing protectionist policies in general and mercantilist policies in particular .
Eventually the United States extended this privilege to China to turn the tables on the Soviet Union .
All China has to do is produce — it does n’t matter how — and it will have a market to sell to .
But this may be changing .
Under President Barack Obama , the United States is considering fundamental changes to the Bretton Woods arrangements .
Ostensibly , this is to update the global financial system and reduce the chances of future financial crises .
But out of what we have seen so far , the National Export Initiative ( NEI ) the White House is promulgating is much more mercantilist .
It espouses doubling U.S. exports in five years , specifically by targeting additional sales to large developing states , with China at the top of the list .
STRATFOR finds that goal overoptimistic , and the NEI is maddeningly vague as to how it will achieve this goal .
But this sort of rhetoric has not come out of the White House since pre-World War II days .
Since then , international economic policy in Washington has served as a tool of political and military policy ; it has not been a beast unto itself .
In other words , the shift in tone in U.S. trade policy is itself enough to suggest big changes , beginning with the idea that the United States actually will compete with the rest of the world in exports .
If — and we must emphasize if — there will be force behind this policy shift , the Chinese are in serious trouble .
As we noted before , the Chinese financial system is largely based on the Japanese model , and Japan is a wonderful case study for how this could go down .
In the 1980s , the United States was unhappy with the level of Japanese imports .
Washington found it quite easy to force the Japanese both to appreciate their currency and accept more exports .
Opening the closed Japanese system to even limited foreign competition gutted Japanese banks ’ international positions , starting a chain reaction that culminated in the 1990 collapse .
Japan has not really recovered since , and as of 2010 , total Japanese GDP is only marginally higher than it was 20 years ago .
China ’s Limited Options
China , which unlike Japan is not a U.S. ally , would have an even harder time resisting should Washington pressure Beijing to buy more U.S. goods .
Dependence upon a certain foreign market means that market can easily force changes in the exporter ’s trade policies .
Refusal to cooperate means losing access , shutting the exports down .
To be sure , the U.S. export initiative does not explicitly call for creating more trade barriers to Chinese goods .
But Washington is already brandishing this tool against China anyway , and it will certainly enter China ’s calculations about whether to resist the U.S. export policy .
Japan ’s economy , in 1990 and now , only depended upon international trade for approximately 15 percent of its GDP .
For China , that figure is 36 percent , and that is after suffering the hit to exports from the global recession .
China ’s only recourse would be to stop purchasing U.S. government debt ( Beijing ca n’t simply dump the debt it already holds without taking a monumental loss , because for every seller there must be a buyer ) , but even this would be a hollow threat .
First , Chinese currency reserves exist because Beijing does not want to invest its income in China .
Underdeveloped capital markets cannot absorb such an investment , and the reserves represent the government ’s piggybank .
Getting a 2 percent return on a rock - solid asset is good enough in China ’s eyes .
Second , those bond purchases largely fuel U.S. consumers ’ ability to purchase Chinese goods .
In the event the United States targets Chinese exports , the last thing China would want is to compound the damage .
Third , a cold stop in bond purchases would encourage the U.S. administration — and the American economy overall — to balance its budgets .
However painful such a transition may be , it would not be much as far as retaliation measures go : “ forcing ” a competitor to become economically efficient and financially responsible is not a winning strategy .
Granted , interest rates would rise in the United States due to the reduction in available capital — the Chinese internal estimate is by 0.75 percentage points — and that could pinch a great many sectors , but that is nothing compared to the tsunami of pain that the Chinese would be feeling .
For Beijing , few alternatives exist to American consumption should Washington limit export access ; the United States has more disposable income than all of China ’s other markets combined .
To dissuade the Americans , China could dangle the carrot of cooperation on sanctions against Iran before Washington , but the United States may already be moving beyond any use for that .
Meanwhile , China would strengthen domestic security to protect against the ramifications of U.S. pressure .
Beijing perceives the spat with Google and Obama ’s meeting with the Dalai Lama as direct attacks by the United States , and it is already bracing for a rockier relationship .
While such measures do not help the Chinese economy , they may be Beijing ’s only options for preserving internal stability .
In China , fears of this coming storm are becoming palpable — and by no means limited to concerns over the proposed U.S. export strategy .
With the Democratic Party in the United States ( historically the more protectionist of the two mainstream U.S. political parties ) both in charge and worried about major electoral losses , the Chinese fear that midterm U.S. elections will be all about targeting Chinese trade issues .
Specifically , they are waiting for April 15 , when the U.S. Treasury Department is expected to rule whether China is a currency manipulator — a ruling Beijing fears could unleash a torrent of protectionist moves by the U.S. Congress .
Beijing already is deliberating on the extent to which it should seek to defuse American anger .
But the Chinese probably are missing the point .
If there has already been a decision in Washington to break with Bretton Woods , no number of token changes will make any difference .
Such a shift in the U.S. trade posture will see the Americans going for China ’s throat ( no matter whether by design or unintentionally ) .
And the United States can do so with disturbing ease .
The Americans do n’t need a public works program or a job - training program or an export - boosting program .
They do n’t even have to make better — much less cheaper — goods .
They just need to limit Chinese market access , something that can be done with the flick of a pen and manageable pain on the U.S. side .
STRATFOR sees a race on , but it is n’t a race between the Chinese and the Americans or even China and the world .
It ’s a race to see what will smash China first , its own internal imbalances or the U.S. decision to take a more mercantilist approach to international trade .

Environmental groups are concerned the Canadian government may have persuaded the European Union to backtrack on a proposed fuel policy that would have targeted Alberta 's oilsands .
" Canada seems to have been lobbying hard and they may have succeeded , " said Susan Casey - Lefkowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington , D.C .
She was referring to talks taking place within the 27 - nation EU trading bloc with respect to fuel standards .
The EU is trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging the use of low - carbon fuels .
Last fall , the EU released draft guidelines that distinguished between the carbon footprint of fuels derived from the oilsands and those that come from conventional crude .
That distinction would have allowed regulators to penalize users of oilsands - derived fuel or reward those who did n't .
The distinction has been erased in the most recent draft of regulations .
According to an EU discussion paper obtained by The Canadian Press , only one figure for greenhouse gas emissions will be used for oil no matter what its source .
" One default value per fuel or energy and feedstock type , " says the document , which was sent to the EU 's member states for consideration .
" Values for the extraction portion of the life cycle were adjusted to be more consistent with values calculated in other regions of the world . "
The shift comes after heavy lobbying from the federal government .
Letters from Canadian diplomats have been obtained by various environmental groups and released to reporters .
" Mainstream crude oil sources , from light to heavy , including oilsands crude , all have similar life cycle ( greenhouse gas ) intensity , " says a letter from a Natural Resources Canada official to the head of the EU 's environment unit .
The letter says once it is used in a vehicle , fuel from oilsands emits only 5 to 15 per cent more carbon dioxide than conventional crudes .
" Given the small difference in life - cycle emissions among different crude oil pathways ... it is recommended default carbon intensities be assigned independent of their sources of pathways .
This would prevent any unjustified discrimination ( against ) oilsands crude . "
Ross Hornby , Canada 's ambassador to the EU , argued in a letter to the group 's director - general of environment that distinguishing oilsands fuel from other fuels would be difficult and expensive .
" Such a system would be extremely difficult to implement and monitor and would in itself create barriers to trade , particularly in light of the integrated nature of the North American oil industry , " he wrote .
Environmentalists argue that oilsands crude releases about three times as much carbon dioxide as conventional crude when the difference between extracting and refining the two fuels is measured .
Between 75 and 80 per cent of the carbon in any barrel of oil is released when it is used .
Groups such as the Sierra Club promise to fight the draft guidelines and get the distinction for oilsands crude reinstated .
" The powerful oil lobby has the Canadian government doing its dirty work again , " said Sierra Club head John Bennett .
" It is bad enough that our government has absolutely no policies on climate change or to curb pollution , now they are interfering in foreign governments ' environmental policies . "
A letter , signed by 12 environmental groups , has been sent to the EU asking for the oilsands distinction to be restored .

A few weeks ago , EFF published its first draft of a Buyer 's Guide to E - Book Privacy , which summarized and commented on the privacy - related policies and behaviors of several e-readers .
In that first draft we incorporated the actual language of the privacy policies as much as possible , which unfortunately created some confusion since companies generally use different language to address similar issues .
We also did a few other things clumsily .
Since then , thanks to the feedback and corrections we 've received , we 've made some updates and corrections to the guide which we hope will make it more useful .
First , we 've re-written many of the questions and answers to provide more clarity about the behavior of each e-reader .
Second , we 've tried point out where companies ' privacy policies themselves are unclear on particular issues .
And finally , we 've made the whole thing easier to read by changing its visual layout .
This guide continues to be a work in progress .
So , please continue to let us know whether it 's helpful and what additions you 'd like to see .

I do n't know how to best sum up Infinitec 's new " flash drive " in a headline — which is obvious at this point .
But what it can do is pretty unique , once you wrap your head around it .
Advertisement
Infinitec has created a USB stick that contains an 802.11n module capable of creating an ad hoc network through any device 's USB port .
But on the receiving end , it appears as nothing more complicated than a flash drive .
In other words , you can stream media to devices that are n't necessarily so thrilled with you streaming media .
Placed in a DVD player , for instance , you need not worry about the player 's supported network standards or your PC 's sharing settings .
Just set the Infinitec stick to anywhere from 1GB to 1TB + ( depending on how much storage you expect your player to support ) , then load MPEG4s right from the stick ... streamed from your PC loaded with accompanying software .

I could see several uses for Infinitec 's little device — namely , adding a media extender to any room that has a TV with a USB port .
That is , if the price is right whenever it eventually comes out .

The US Department of Justice this week released slides from a presentation deck titled Obtaining and Using Evidence from Social Networking Sites .
The document was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
The DoJ presentation describes Facebook as much more co-operative with law enforcement requests for user information than Twitter and MySpace are .
It also explains to officers what the advantages of going undercover on social networking sites are .
The EFF posted IRS training documents for using various internet tools as well , including Google Street View , but those were much tamer than the Justice file .
Highlights from the deck include :
On " getting info from Facebook " - options include photos , contact info , group contact info and IP logs .
" HOWEVER , Facebook has other data available . "
The deck notes that Facebook is " often cooperative with emergency requests . "
MySpace and Twitter , on the other hand , are described differently .
MySpace " requires a search warrant for private messages / bulletins less than 181 days old . "
Twitter " will not preserve data without legal process , " has a " stated policy of producing data only in response to legal process " and has no Law Enforcement Guide ( or spying manual , as some parties call such documents ) .
Would n't you like your social network to say no before it says yes and require a warrant before handing over information to law enforcement ?
We reached out to Facebook this evening about the government claim that it was unusually co-operative but have not yet received a response .
Funny :
As social networks go , LinkedIn's " use for criminal communications appears limited " the document says .
You do n't say .
Linked
In can be useful in finding expert witnesses , however .
" Why go undercover on Facebook , MySpace , etc ? " the document asks .
Three reasons are offered : 1 . Communicate with suspects / targets .
2 . Gain access to non-public info .
3 . Map social relationships / networks .
" If agents violate terms of service , " the document asks , " is that ' otherwise illegal activity ' ? "
No answer is offered in the text .
" Many witnesses have social - networking pages , " the presentation notes .
Those pages can be a " valuable source of info on defense witnesses " and " potential pitfalls for government witnesses . "
Also funny : DoJ prosectors are urged to " use caution in ' friending ' judges , defense counsel . "
We expect the Electronic Frontier Foundation to offer further analysis in coming days .

MARJAH , Afghanistan —
It is hard to know whether Monday was a very bad day or a very good day for Lance Cpl. Andrew Koenig .
On the one hand , he was shot in the head .
On the other , the bullet bounced off him .
In one of those rare battlefield miracles , an insurgent sniper hit Lance Cpl. Koenig dead on in the front of his helmet , and he walked ...
Mr. Obama , I am disappointed in you .
After all of the hope that surrounded your campaign , to see that you , and Education Secretary Arne Duncan , supported such a hopeless decision as the mass firing of all the teachers in the Central Falls , R.I. , high school was truly disheartening .
I am a teacher working in a high - need subject ( math ) in a struggling school in a struggling district just outside of Boston .
I go to work every day 45 minutes before I am supposed to arrive .
After working an already extended school day ( the kids are there for eight hours ) I stay another two hours longer than I am required .
I spend this time writing lessons , helping students , grading student work and taking care of the assorted administrative tasks that make education run .
Sometimes I also do this work at home on the weekends .
As a recent graduate of the education school at Harvard , and an active participant in district professional development , I utilize every applicable current teaching strategy in my practice .
I manage my classroom very closely so that , at least while they are with me , my students participate and engage with the material .
And still I have students who do not succeed – because so much of education is more than the teacher , or collective of teachers , who work with students each day .
Much of educational success is home life and whether education is reinforced at home .
Another significant factor is class size and student load for individual teachers – I am responsible for 142 .
The more students a teacher has the more individual needs he or she must get to know and manage ; too many students can inhibit the success of even the best teacher .
Some of it depends on the model used to measure educational success ( and whether that model is fair or plays to a student ’s strengths or weaknesses ) .
Some of it is other factors entirely .
I would hate to think that all of my effort could be cast aside by my district all because the statistics of some standardized test or some other incomplete measurement suggested that I was not doing a good job .
And what of the impact of this sort of decision on the students involved ?
There are quite a few students with whom , by mid-February , the time of this decision , I had developed some close relationships .
What would be the impact on these students if I was suddenly removed from their lives ?
What lesson would they take from seeing someone they respect , trust and look to as a source of guidance removed from her position because of how they performed on standardized tests ?
Is that truly the message that should be sent to children in already troublesome situations ?
Additionally troubling is that much of the reason your campaign was so successful was the support of teachers ’ unions and educational workers who saw your presidency as an opportunity to do some real good .
To support a unilateral decision against teachers and their union is to throw that support back into the faces of every education professional who has stood with you .
It undermines our efforts and our collective bargaining rights in a way that can really hurt public education in our country .
Please consider the impact of your support of this decision .
As your administration turns its attention toward education legislation , please consider the true needs of struggling schools and districts .
Continue the hopeful message so prevalent in your campaign .
Do not succumb to the top - down , reactionary , status quo established by your predecessor .
If you truly wish to have a positive impact on education in America , accept teachers as allies in the movement rather than scapegoating us and punishing our students with reduced resources .
Ask us , and our students , what we need in order to improve educational results .
Fund struggling schools ( all of them , not just the ones that win a contest ) with as much money as you can manage from the federal budget .
Utilize your administration ’s brainpower to devise a plan to reach out to families and find ways to truly include them in the educational process .
Do whatever is necessary to make education reform a positive experience for all .

At least nine people have been killed and 57 others injured in a bomb attack at a restaurant in India 's western city of Pune , officials say .
The explosion tore through the German Bakery , which is popular with tourists , in Koregaon Park .
The bombing is the first major strike of its kind in India since the deadly Mumbai attacks in November 2008 .
Reports that one of the dead is a foreign national have not yet been confirmed by the Indian authorities .
Several foreigners were said to be among the injured .
All the evidence points to a deliberate plot
P Chidambaram ,
Home minister
Pune in shock at bombing
In pictures : India restaurant blast
The explosion at the restaurant , on North Main Road , happened at about 1900 ( 1330 GMT ) , when it was packed with diners .
" It appears that an unattended package was noticed in the bakery by one of the waiters who apparently attempted to open the package when the blast took place , " Indian Home Secretary GK Pillai was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
" We heard a big noise and we all rushed out .
The impact was so great that there were body parts everywhere , " Vinod Dhale , who works at the restaurant , told Reuters .
' High alert ' Anti-terror squad officers have gone to the scene .
AT THE SCENE Prachi Pinglay
BBC News , Pune The German Bakery , on the ground floor of a corner building in a plush area of Pune , has been reduced to rubble .
The rest of the building is still intact and anti-terrorist squads from Mumbai have gone in to try to determine the type of explosive used in the blast .
The street has been cordoned off and the area is very quiet now .
Whenever I have visited this bakery in the past - last time was a few months ago - it has always been very crowded .
It was a very quaint , old place , the limited seating areas full of students and foreign visitors from the nearby Osho Ashram eating Western food .
A security alert was issued for Chabad House , a Jewish centre for learning in the vicinity of the German Bakery , in October 2009 , India 's Home Office said .
But the German Bakery was not deemed to be at risk at the time .
Nearby shops were badly damaged and reported to have been splattered with blood .
" I came running to the bakery after hearing the explosion .
I found people lying all over the place " , local resident Abba More told AP .
Initial reports had suggested the explosion was caused by a gas cylinder .
The German Bakery is near the Osho Ashram , a mystic centre popular with visitors to Pune .
The Chabad centre , run by the Jewish Orthodox Chabad - Lubavitch movement , is also in the vicinity .
Members of the Chabad - Lubavitch were targeted in the 2008 Mumbai attacks , and in October 2009 the home ministry issued a security alert for the Chabad centre in Pune .
No-one has yet said they carried out the latest attack .
However Home Minister P Chidambaram described it as " a significant terrorist incident " .
" All the evidence points to a deliberate plot , " he told AFP .
The bomb blast comes a day after India and Pakistan agreed to meet for talks in Delhi on February 25 .
The talks will be their first formal negotiations since the Mumbai attacks .
No conclusions could be drawn yet as to who was responsible for the blast , Mr Pillai said .
" Forensic investigations have just begun .
Till they are completed , we will not know who is [ involved ] " , he told AP .
The home ministry has issued an advisory to all state governments to be on high alert .

A casting call for Disney 's upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean 4 specifies that women with artificially enhanced breasts will not be considered for a role .
According to the New York Post , interested parties will even be subject to a " jiggle " test to ensure their assets are real .
What does Disney have against silicone ?
This sound enlightened , but likely is n't :
We love the idea of blacklisting plastic - surgery addicts , says Donna Kaufman in iVillage .
However , " we suspect that Disney 's motives are less idealistic and more practical . "
Perhaps they " do n't want the extras looking more voluptuous " than the film 's small - busted star , Keira Knightly ?
" When we see a casting notice that specifies ' no Botox ' ... that 's when we 'll celebrate progress . "
" Disney bans breast implants for new Pirates movie "
Disney is begging for a lawsuit :
This alleged " jiggle " test sounds cheesily pornographic , says Maureen O'Connor in Gawker .
One wonders :
Is there any way to " prove veracity of breasts " without " sexually harassing " their owner ?
The whole thing sounds like a waste of time , and a commercial misstep .
After all , Americans appear to love breast implants .
" Disney bans fake boobs from Pirates "
This is business as usual in Hollywood : " Ridiculous " though it sounds , says Nicole Sperling in Entertainment Weekly , a silicon - breast ban is " not that uncommon . "
It 's " actually standard practice " to require a natural figure — particularly for " period work " such as the Pirates movies .
The same rule sometimes applies to guys with " ripped abs " or " bulging biceps " that would ring false in a pre-personal - trainer setting .
" Pirates 4 and the search for natural breasts : Standard practice for period projects "
this week was the name .
( I could have sworn " Buzz " was .)
No , Google knows we are all spending a huge amount of time using social networking applications and that we are using them for everything from sharing baby pictures to making sales contacts .
If Google wants to stay in the business of selling our eyeballs ( i.e. advertising ) , it has to keep us on their sites .
The surprising thing for me is that Google genuinely believes Buzz will make social networking simpler .
Not bloody likely .
" It 's increasingly becoming harder and harder to make sense and find the signal in the noise , " explained Google VP Bradley Horowitz .
I certainly agree with that .
Although , to be fair , no one made me set up a personal blog , Tumblr page , Twitter feed , Linked In profile , plus Picasa and Flickr Albums .
( I also sometimes write for PCMag.com . )
That is on me .
But Google 's solution ?
Another networking service .
Of course !
First the good news , it does work with other sites sort of .
As long as they are listed in your Google Profile you can quickly share updates to these services with your Buzz followers .
I also like the fact that you can restrict who sees the updates .
Baby pictures , for example , are really just for friends and family .
If Buzz can consolidate multiple content streams and give users more control over their public / private settings , it will be a huge win .
Plus , by building Buzz directly into Gmail , the service has an instant audience .
It is hard to start a social network from scratch , which is why Orkut however successful overseas never made a dent the U.S. Buzz functionality will just appear on millions of Gmail accounts , and users will figure out how to use it over time .
What is the biggest risk to Buzz ?
Wave .
Google Wave , that IM/e-mail/ collaboration / scripting / sharing/doanythingyouwantittodo application , is a brilliant piece of engineering .
And there are 50 , maybe 100 people in the world who know how to use it .
( And half of them are on the development team . )
Buzz has to be the opposite of Wave : so simple it is effortless .
This seamless simplicity is precisely why Google Search and to a lesser degree Gmail , Google Chat , Google Calendar , Google Voice and other services works so well .
Unfortunately , I am afraid Buzz will turn out more like Wave .
I have only been testing Buzz for a short while , but the interface seems cluttered .
I have never been a huge fan of threading as the primary tool for managing large streams of information .
I vastly prefer the list and search model .
So far , it seems like Buzz is trying to do a lot , but it is n't really doing anything that other sites do n't do already do better : photo sharing , status updates , professional networking .
The real opportunity here is for a service that increases signal and decreases noise that does less , not more .
Unfortunately , that usually is n't how most software works these days .
" We are just drowning in possibility with this product , " Horowitz said at the launch event .
My thoughts exactly .
Death is n't a topic often approached without apprehension , but it ranks up there with love when it comes to motifs ripe for the picking among artists , poets , musicians and just about anyone else with the sense to consider their mortality .
Los Angeles artists Marco Rios and Kara Tanaka plumb the subject with incisiveness and mordant humor in their collaborative show , " Death 's Boutique . "
" When you approach someone else to do a show about death ... some people might giggle and shy away , " Tanaka says , " but for us , this was a perfect subject to work on . "
The exhibition - which includes sculpture , large - scale photography , video and printed matter - stems from both a personal and artistic interest in the psychological and pragmatic aspects of death , as well as research generated from the duo's travels together .
Rios says he 's been intrigued with death since he was a child " raised by a protective single mother .
... I was hyperaware of my own mortality , and even now , there is n't a day that goes by that I do n't think about it , either jokingly or for real . "
Tanaka 's interest lies in a fascination with religious history and the manner in which mortality " comes into play when we think of the liminal spaces between life and death ... people 's attempts at getting outside the very things that make us mortal . "
The pair 's travels included treks to Lithuania - a country graced with the world 's highest suicide rate - and Sweden , where they learned about the eco-friendly Promessa burial method , which enables bodies to crumble into an odorless , fine , biodegradable powder that becomes compost within months .
Tanaka 's exhibited work includes a sculptural history of death practices in the United States going back to 1876 , when modern cremation was adopted .
The work includes a cremation oven that goes from the outside of the gallery to the inside , as well as molded forms of faux Promessa powder that are roughly the size of what a body would become after undergoing this burial process .
Rios , who channels elements of desire , gothic horror and romanticism , presents a series of wonderfully macabre sculptures that are essentially " death instruments , " drawing inspiration from storefront tableaux and kitchenware .
For instance , Rios ' " Heart Extractor " is a cheekily scaled - up and modified version of the kind of apparatus that extracts juice from a fruit .
" These are pieces that are supposed to be metaphorical and literal instruments of death , " he says .
Amid all the funereal sentiments , the show affords a ray of hope , Tanaka says .
" It 's a subject that everyone can relate to in some way , " she says .
" We all have to deal with our mortality eventually , but the work is also about living for something beyond the self ... so the way we approach death can be heroic . "

A successful University of Nevada , Reno renewable energy research project is moving from the lab to the real world in a demonstration - scale system to turn wastewater sludge into electricity .
The new patent - pending , low - cost , energy - efficient technology is scheduled to be set up in the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility next month following the recent signing of an interlocal agreement with the cities of Reno and Sparks .
“ Our plan is to test the unit by about May 15 , ” Chuck Coronella , principle investigator for the research project and an associate professor of chemical engineering , said .
“ We ’re designing , building and assembling a continuous - feed system that will ultimately be used to generate electricity .
We ’ll run experiments throughout the summer , creating a usable dried product from the sludge . ”
The experimental carbon - neutral system will process 20 pounds of sludge per hour , drying it at modest temperatures into solid fuel that will be analyzed for its suitability to be used for fuel through gasification and , in a commercial operation , ultimately converted to electricity .
The refrigerator - size demonstration unit will help researchers determine the optimum conditions for a commercial - sized operation .
“ The beauty of this process is that it ’s designed to be all on site , saving trucking costs and disposal fees for the sludge , ” Victor Vasquez , a University faculty member in chemical engineering said .
“ It uses waste heat from the process to drive the electrical generation .
It also keeps the sludge out of the landfill . ”
Estimates , which will be further refined through the research , show that a full - scale system could potentially generate 14,000 kilowatt - hours per day to help power the local reclamation facility .
The demonstration - scale project is a collaboration with the cities of Reno and Sparks , operators of the wastewater plant .
The city councils signed an interlocal agreement recently to allow the research to integrate into their operation , providing space for the experiments , the dewatered sludge and other resources to help make the project a success .
“ Economically , this makes sense , ” Coronella said .
“ Treatment plants have to get rid of the sludge , and what better way than to process it onsite and use the renewable energy to lower operating costs . ”
Coronella added , “ This demonstration gives the University an opportunity to involve students in development of waste - to - energy technology , which ultimately will benefit the community .
It ’s a win - win for everyone involved . ”
Installation of the system will begin in April , and the system will be tested mid-May .
The project will last until fall 2010 .
The University ’s Technology Transfer Office , with assistance from the College of Business , is supporting the project with plans to make the system available to hundreds of communities around the country that operate water treatment plants .
For example , there are approximately 700,000 metric tons of dried sludge produced annually in California municipalities , which could sustainably generate as much as 10 million kilowatt - hours per day .
The project is funded through the Energy Innovations Small Grant Program , the California Energy Commission and the Department of Energy .
This phase of the project was selected for funding by the Tech Transfer Office under a DOE grant to support transferring technologies from the lab to practical application .

[ In addition to blogging , I am also now using Twitter for quick updates and to share links .
Follow me at : twitter.com/scottgu ]
This afternoon we made available the VS 2010 and .NET 4 release candidates .
You can find download links here .
Right now the downloads are available only to MSDN subscribers .
Starting Wednesday ( Feb 10th ) everyone will be able to download them ( regardless of whether you are a MSDN subscriber or not ) .
Background on the Release Candidate
I blogged about us deciding to ship a public VS 2010 release candidate last December .
The primary motivation behind releasing a public RC was to ensure that we could get broad testing and feedback on the performance and stability work we ’ve been doing since the last public VS 2010 Beta 2 release .
Over the last few months we ’ve been releasing interim builds to a small set of folks who have been helping us validate fixes and measure very large projects and solutions .
The feedback from them has been extremely positive the last few weeks – which is why we are now opening up today ’s build to a much wider set of people to people to try out .
The RC has only been out a few hours so far – but the feedback so far on Twitter has been nice to see :
@DanWahlin :
The performance improvements with Visual Studio 2010 RC compared to previous builds are huge .
Really happy with what I 'm seeing so far .
@peterbromberg : VS2010 RC : I must admit , I am impressed .
Major speed and performance improvements .
They are obvious immediately !
@ Nick_Craver : RC performance is ridiculously faster , can't wait to switch over full time !
@Rlz2cool : Just tried VS2010 RC .
One word incredible .
Super fast , great build with things I saw in earlier releases fixed .
So awesome .
@ddotterer : Trying out VS2010 RC : Snappier UI , much faster intellisense , significant build time reduction , etc. Overall : AWESOME JOB
@tomkirbygreen :
Oh my goodness , VS2010 RC is much , much faster .
Kudos to the VS perf team and everyone else .
Uninstalling Visual Studio 2008 :-)
@JoshODBrown
The developers on the Visual Studio 2010 RC must have had their usual beverages replaced with unicorn tears or something .
# VS2010 #awesome
#awesome @jbristowe : Holy Butterball !
VS 2010 RC is crazy fast .
It makes me feel like this : http://bit.ly/cPaOvE
Reporting Issues
Our goal with releasing the public RC build today is to get a lot of eyes on the product helping to find and report the remaining bugs we need to fix .
If you do find an issue , please submit a bug report via the Visual Studio Connect site and also please send me an email directly ( scottgu@microsoft.com ) with details about it .
I can then route your email to someone to investigate and follow - up directly ( which can help expedite the investigation ) .
If you do install and use the VS 2010 RC we ’d also really appreciate if you would fill out this survey about your experiences .
Answers to a few questions and known issues
Here are a few answers to some questions / known issues :
If you have previously installed VS 2010 Beta 2 on your computer you should use Add / Remove Programs ( within Windows Control Panel ) to remove VS 2010 Beta2 and .NET 4 Beta2 before installing the VS 2010 RC .
Note that VS 2010 RC can be installed on the same machine side - by - side with VS 2008 and VS 2005 .
Silverlight 3 projects are supported with today ’s VS 2010 RC build – however Silverlight 4 projects are not yet supported .
We will be adding VS 2010 RC support for SL4 with the next public Silverlight 4 drop .
If you are doing active Silverlight 4 development today we recommend staying with the VS10 Beta 2 build for now .
We recently identified a crashing bug that can impact systems that have multi- touch and some screen - readers enabled .
We are working on a patch for people who are impacted by it .
We recently found an issue where project upgrades from VS 2008 can take a long time to complete if the project has .xsd files within them .
If you think VS is taking a long time on a project upgrade give it a few more minutes to complete before assuming it has hung – you might be running into this slow upgrade issue .
Note that once the project is upgraded the performance should return to normal .
We are working to fix this with the final release .
Hope this helps ,

The UK advertising industry has bravely decided it can continue to accept millions of pounds from the state to create alarming climate advertisements , despite inaccuracies and a storm of complaints from parents .
The principled decision , from the admen 's self - regulatory body the ASA , follows 939 complaints about the UK energy ministry DECC's " Drowning Dog " prime time TV and cinema ad ( aka " Bedtime Story " ) , which cost £ 6 m , and four related posters .
Critics are n't happy , and point out that the chair of the ASA , Lord Chris Smith of Finsbury , also chairs the Environment Agency , and is currently working closely with DECC .
The ASA dismissed complaints against the TV ad , although it upheld complaints against two of the related poster advertisements , and has requested they not be run again .
On the charge that the campaign was political , ASA deferred to OFCOM , which is continuing to investigate the advertisements , and has not yet made a decision .
The TV and cinema ad predicted " awful heat waves " and " terrible storms and floods " for the future , claiming that life would be " very different in 26 years " if people failed to make decisions such as living in colder houses , or using less transportation .
The ASA examined ' Drowning Dog ' on the grounds it was misleading , was not based on objective evidence , and caused unnecessary personal distress .
In its defence , DECC cited reports from the UN's IPCC panel , and the ASA agreed there was an " overwhelming consensus in the global community of climate scientists " backing this particular climate theory .
The ASA believed the IPCC to be objective and independent , and concluded there was " not a significant division of opinion " amongst scientists on the theory .
Therefore , the ASA found that " the level of discomfort was proportionate to the risk " .
It also noted that as the child 's ( cartoon ) dog drowned , " the child showed wonder rather than fear or distress " .
An appeal to fear is justified in the CAP Code 's marketing guidelines , said the ASA .
The ASA panel said that to reflect the computer models from which the predictions originated , but said they were justified .
Surprisingly the ASA even supported the ad's claim that 40 per cent of CO 2 in the atmosphere came from humans doing " ordinary every day things " .
In fact , human CO 2 emissions are a much smaller proportion ( 3.5 per cent ) of total CO 2 emissions .
Here 's how the ASA squared the circle :
Because the claim " over 40 % of the C02 was coming from ordinary every day things like keeping houses warm and driving cars " was preceded by those qualifications and was accompanied by images of human activity in a typical UK town , such as cars driving along streets and lighting in houses , we considered it would be clear to most viewers that the ad was discussing increasing levels of C02 and that the claim " over 40 % of the C02 was coming from ordinary every day things like keeping houses warm and driving cars " referred not to total C02 in the global atmosphere , but to C02 produced by human activities in the UK .
Posters produced by the Energy ministry did n't fare so well .

Hospital patients were left " sobbing and humiliated " by uncaring staff , an investigation into one of the worst NHS scandals in history has found .
The independent inquiry claimed the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust had become driven by targets and cost-cutting .
The report - the latest in a long line of critical reviews - said the distress and suffering had been " unimaginable " .
Last year it was reported there were at least 400 more deaths than expected at the trust from 2005 to 2008 .
But the relatives of patients treated there said many questions still remained unanswered .
In particular , they want a public inquiry into how the scandal could have happened , including the role of the wider NHS in the case .
ANALYSIS BBC health reporter Nick Triggle
It may be uncomfortable for ministers , but there are still major questions that need to be answered about the Stafford Hospital scandal .
The poor treatment patients received is now well documented .
But what remains unclear is why it was not picked up earlier .
The hospital would have been monitored by a primary care trust , strategic health authority and host of patient safety agencies , but none picked up the problems .
In fact , the SHA even dismissed concerns about high death rates at one point .
At the same time , the trust which runs the hospital was able to climb the NHS ratings system and was approved for foundation trust status during the period .
In the end , it took a private research group , Dr Foster , to flag up concerns which helped prompt the regulator to look into the issue and publish its findings last year .
The trust had been climbing the NHS ratings ladder during the period in question and was even given elite foundation trust status .
The Tories have said they would back a public inquiry , but ministers have so far resisted .
Instead , they set up this inquiry , led by Robert Francis QC , which has been held in private and mainly focused on what happened inside the trust and in particular Stafford Hospital , one of two run by the organisation .
Following publication of the inquiry report , the government said Mr Francis would now be allowed to look into the regulation and monitoring issues .
Stafford Hospital hit the headlines last year when a report was published by the Healthcare Commission claiming patients had been " dying needlessly " and put the number of excess deaths at more than 400 .
It reported a catalogue of shocking examples , including cases where unqualified receptionists assessed people as they arrived at A&E .
The findings were then followed by two government reviews .
' Routinely neglected '
This latest report also outlines instances where patients were " routinely neglected " .
It documents cases where patients were left in soiled sheets which relatives were forced to wash .
And it highlights examples where patients were left alone , leading to falls - some fatal , which were not reported .
And one woman , who gave evidence , told the inquiry : " My Mum was in absolute agony , I can hear her screams now , as I walked into the ward . "
Half of the patients and relatives who gave evidence also cited problems getting enough food and drink .
The report criticised the " ineffective " management which was too often concerned with hitting targets , particularly in A&E , as well as the " lack of compassion " and " uncaring attitude " of staff .
But staffing levels were also said to be too low because the trust was trying to slash costs by £ 10 m .
STAFFORD HOSPITAL TIMELINE November 2007 - Campaign group ,
Cure the NHS , set up amid concerns about care March 2009 - Healthcare Commission report published , revealing " appalling " standards of care and at least 400 excess deaths April 2009 - Two Department of Health reviews published , showing standards improving May 2009 - The hospital says a report into the role of the chief executive , Martin Yeates , in the scandal will not be published July 2009 - Ministers announce an independent inquiry into case , but stop short of a full public inquiry as demanded by campaigners July 2009 - Inspectors say hospital care is safe , but they still have concerns about staffing .
Warning repeated in subsequent checks
October 2009 -
The trust is given the worst grade , weak , in the annual NHS ratings system February 2010 - Independent inquiry published , describing patients left " sobbing and humiliated "
Julie Bailey , whose mother died at the hospital and the founder of the victims ' campaign group Cure the NHS , said the handling of the scandal had been " disgraceful and unacceptable " - and reiterated her call for a public inquiry .
" It is time that the public were told the truth about the very large number of excess deaths of patients in NHS care and the very large number of avoidable but deadly errors that occur in NHS hospitals every day . "
Since the original Healthcare Commission report , inspectors have been carrying out regular checks and have said care is now safe , although some problems persist over staffing and equipment .
The chief executive and chairman in charge during the period in question have been replaced and the General Medical Council and Nursing and Midwifery Council are investigating some of the staff involved .
Sir Stephen Moss , the new chairman of the trust , said : " I would like to apologise unreservedly for the harm and distress that people suffered during that time and thank those who spoke to the Inquiry .
" Their courage in coming forward has helped us learn from the errors of the past and to make changes that have already improved our services " .

Health Secretary Andy Burnham said there could be " no excuses " for the failings .
But he added : " This was ultimately a local failure , but it is vital that we learn the lessons nationally to ensure that it wo n't happen again - we expect everyone in the NHS to read the report and act on it . "
But Patients Association president Claire Rayner said : " The scale of problems at Stafford might have been unique but failures in essential nursing care are not . "

Fans who still miss the futuristic Gotham ( and teenaged Dark Knight ) seen in the dearly - departed Batman Beyond got the news they 've been waiting a long time for .
The cartoon is finally becoming a comic .
Advertisement
Comics ( Teen Titans , Hench ) and animation ( Batman : The Brave And The Bold ) writer Adam Beechen and artist Ryan Benjamin are the creators on the newly - announced six issue series that returns to the possible future for Bruce Wayne and new Batman Terry McGuinness .
Beechen told Comic Book Resources about his approach to the series :
The full range of Terry 's world will be on display in the mini series , but center stage will be occupied by Bruce and Terry .
Terry and Dana are not married during this series , which takes place closer to the end of the animated series than to the character 's appearance at the end of " Justice League Unlimited . "
[ T ] his miniseries does tie the animated series closer to the DCU proper , but whether or not it becomes considered the canonical version of Batman 's future remains to be seen .
And decided .
Advertisement
This is n't the first time the cartoon has crossed mediums ; there have been two earlier tie - in comics , published during the cartoon 's run , and the character has made cameo appearances in mainstream DC series Superman / Batman and Countdown To Final Crisis , both of which placed him on a parallel earth to the " regular " Batman .
The first issue of the series will be released in June .
Beechen on ' Batman Beyond ' [ Comic Book Resources ]
Dr Steve Hinshelwood , physics teacher at Parkside and Coleridge community colleges , said : " There has been a buzz around the school and students have been asking me questions about pressure in space and whether the teddy bears would have been freezing .
They were wearing layers of foam and foil - and one of the suits was made from recycled materials .
She added : “ This is causing stress on our marriage .
We are n’t doing it as much as we used to because it ’s not exactly relaxing knowing that everyone is listening for you to make a noise .
We are n’t even sleeping together every night because I have been in a hostel for so long that I ’ve got used to sleeping alone . ”
At the time , the American military had sent advisers to Uganda to help plan an attack on the headquarters of the Lord ’s Resistance Army in Garamba National Park , in northeastern Congo .
Ugandan helicopters strafed the camp , narrowly missing Joseph Kony , the group ’s leader , who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on crimes against humanity .
Afterward , the fighters scattered and vented their outrage on nearby villagers .
This time , the L.R.A. seemed to have had a different strategy .
Instead of storming into villages and burning down huts ( as it did in 2008 and early 2009 ) , the group sent in relatively clean - cut soldiers dressed in proper military fatigues .
“ They came in saying they were the national army and they wanted to know where were the churches and schools , so they could protect them , ” said the Rev. Joseph Nzala , a priest in Tapili .
Eastern Congo has been a dumping ground for various armed groups for years , so it is not surprising that the villagers might have been confused .
But as soon as they gathered , the roughly two dozen fighters roped them up at gunpoint and took them away .
The band repeated the ruse in village after village , steadily expanding but eliminating hundreds along the way .
There were no peacekeepers or real government soldiers around , and when the killing started Dec. 14 , all the people could do was run .
Several men who escaped said the fighters must have had their own secretive selection process because there was no way of knowing who was about to die .
“ Was it someone walking slow or someone old ?
No , ” said Charles Emabe , who managed to slip away one night .

BBC pit -lane reporter
Ted Kravitz gives his inside line on the Bahrain Grand Prix , bringing you the stories behind the headlines from the opening race of the Formula 1 season .
RED BULL
The Red Bull pit wall , post- race , resembled a betting shop where eight smartly - dressed men had all lost equally large amounts of money on the same horse .
I 've never seen teeth gritted so firmly as when team principal Christian Horner said " well done " to Stefano Domenicali , his opposite number at Ferrari .
Vettel had to settle for fourth place in Bahrain last weekend
It 's understandable - Sebastian Vettel 's Red Bull had the race under control , only for another engine problem to rob him of victory .
The same Renault engine Horner spent much of last year trying to replace .
The team say the problem was traced to a spark plug , after initially blaming an exhaust problem .
But there must have been some hot exhaust gasses leaking somewhere to explain the amount of bodywork missing from the back of the car in parc ferme .
While Red Bull will be annoyed about the engine , they cannot criticise it too much - Renault has gone a long way to improving the power before homologation took place on 1 March , while remaining the most fuel - efficient engine on the grid .
Williams technical director Sam Michael confirmed the Renault as best in this area , followed by Mercedes and Cosworth , with Ferrari the thirstiest .
That means the Red Bulls started the race with 10kg less fuel than the Ferraris .
That would have been worth nearly 0.4 seconds a lap in the early stages of the race around the extended Bahrain track .
Averaging out at 0.2secs per lap , reckoned Michael , Renault 's fuel efficiency would have given Red Bull a 9.8 - second advantage on Ferrari over the whole race distance .
No wonder eventual winner Fernando Alonso was waiting until the last 10 laps to mount an attack .
At any other stage of the race , it would not have been a fair fight , as Vettel would have been significantly lighter on fuel .
We should bear this in mind in the inevitable debates about the first race being boring .
Had Vettel not had his problem , we would likely have enjoyed a fight for the lead between Alonso , who had been nursing his tyres throughout the race , and Vettel , with his rear tyres starting to fade .
The fuel would have equalised , so performance would have been similar .
It would have been rather exciting .
FERRARI
As it was , Red Bull 's unreliability made it an easy one - two for Ferrari , who were ecstatic to put the boot in with maximum points at the first race in what promises to be a season - long title fight with Red Bull .
606 : DEBATE Alonso was definitely faster than Vettel ...
Vettel did however have EVERYTHING 100 % under control
Jamie De Freitas
Alonso took first blood in what promises to be an epic battle with team - mate Felipe Massa , but the Brazilian wo n't let Alonso off so lightly in future .
Massa just wanted to finish .
He has a thing about the first race of the season - his previous best finish in the opening round had been sixth place in 2007 .
It 's been an unlucky charm for him , almost as if he expects not to do well in the first race .
In this context it is understandable that Massa did not want to fight Alonso too hard at the second corner , and jeopardise a solid podium finish .
As Eddie Jordan pointed out in the F1 Forum , Massa will not be that generous every race .
McLAREN
I understand McLaren have kept their fuel rigs in serviceable condition in storage at the factory , so sure are they that refuelling will be brought back next season .
As it was , they probably gained the most from the new rules banning it during the race , especially the way all the pit stops now happen together as teams react to each other in a panicked few laps .
Lewis Hamilton passed Nico Rosberg in the pits because Mercedes had to hold Rosberg in his box when Mark Webber 's Red Bull and Jenson Button 's McLaren came past to make their stops .
Button passed Webber in the pits because Red Bull had a slow stop .
The front left tyre would n't come off cleanly , which resulted in the Australian 's stop being nearly two seconds slower than Jenson's .
Button will want to improve on his race debut for McLaren Even with this good fortune , third and seventh was a disappointment .
Button in particular was uncomfortable in the car and posted only the ninth fastest race lap .
Team principal Martin Whitmarsh hit the nail on the head when he said that the team under-reacted to the problems Jenson was having with the bump in Turn Six .
Button had complained about this when we interviewed him on Friday .
Rather than hit the bump at full speed , he ended up having to come off the power , coast over it to settle the car , and then get back on the throttle the other side .
This , along with the car 's general lack of downforce , explains their poor second sector time - the McLaren was a second slower than the Ferrari in the twisty middle sector .
Where they picked that up was on the straight .
Thanks to their clever system that ' stalls ' the rear wing at speed - thereby reducing drag on the straights - both McLarens topped the straight - line speed trap .
In a nutshell , a snorkel on top of the chassis in front of the cockpit channels air up into the engine airbox , which then vents out of the back of the engine cover .
The driver is believed to operate the system with his left knee , allowing extra air in on the straights , which increases the airflow to a point where the rear wing stalls .
In the race , Hamilton was 5.5 mph quicker than Webber 's Red Bull on the main straight .
This puts into context Whitmarsh 's comments that he believed , in retrospect , that his cars ran too little downforce .
We 'll see in future races if McLaren can crank on some wing to be quick in the corners while using their stalling device to maintain good straight - line speed .
MERCEDES
Compared to 2009 , there was a very different and slightly strange atmosphere around the ex-Brawn team at the weekend , caused by lots of new things changing their routine .
Firstly , the team are in a goldfish bowl with much more scrutiny than they 're used to .
Schumacher speaks to the media during the Bahrain race weekend
The arrival of Michael Schumacher has meant that the Mercedes garage is now the focus for photographers , TV cameramen and reporters , so much so that Domenicali could not get anywhere near the front of the garage when he stopped by to say hello to Schumacher at the start of Friday practice .
Then there is the Mercedes influence .
Small things , like the catering and hospitality staff who had been there for years , since the BAR days , and who were friends of the engineers and mechanics .
They 're gone , replaced by a more German outfit .
Then there are the big things , like the weight of expectation and the pressure to succeed from the corporate owners .
The chairman of Daimler and head of Mercedes - Benz , Dr Dieter Zetsche , was a large presence with his trademark white bushy moustache on Saturday and Sunday , as if to remind team bosses Ross Brawn and Nick Fry who is in charge and what they expect .
In that respect , it 's a very different team than the privateer , light - on - its - feet , self - determining , Brawn Grand Prix .
And it feels it .
The car has mechanical issues with the suspension that are hurting tyre management and losing the drivers lap time .
Rosberg can handle the resulting understeer , but Schumacher is further compromising the car 's set - up as he tries to tailor the car to the way he likes it , with immense front - end grip .
This team is going to take a bit of time to settle in .
Trouble is , the championship might have a couple of runaway leaders by then .
FORCE INDIA A remarkable performance from Force India went un-noticed in Bahrain .
Had he not spun on the first lap , Adrian Sutil would have been well inside the top eight , and might have done better , as he was on an opposite tyre strategy to the top four teams , going hard , then soft .
His pace on the soft tyre at the end of the race was very good - he set the second - quickest race lap on the final tour .
Tonio Liuzzi deserved his two points for ninth as he set the seventh fastest race lap , better than Button , Rosberg and Schumacher .
RENAULT
A quick final word for Russian Vitaly Petrov , who did a better job on his debut than Romain Grosjean or Nelson Piquet , his predecessors in the second Renault , managed most weekends in the previous two years .
Petrov was forced to retire after 13 laps at the Sakhir circuit Easily into second qualifying , Petrov was up to 11th on the first lap and was just as fast as Rubens Barrichello 's Williams in the race ( albeit on a bad weekend for Williams ) .
Petrov 's reason for retirement was unusual :
He rode the kerbs too aggressively , which damaged the front suspension .
He was very apologetic after the race , feeling it was his fault , before engineers reassured him that it was a car failure , and that the suspension should have stood up to any punishment as a result of riding a few kerbs .
With team - mate Robert Kubica unable to show his true pace after a spin on the first lap , and the same 10kg weight advantage as Red Bull at the start due to their fuel - efficient engine , we can expect a strong season for Renault .

Shelley 's two second knock out of Orr is total dominance .
Also , both men have fought Godard and Koci this season .
Orr got a draw in both and Shelley got a draw with Godard but a win against Koci .
Shelley and Orr both have four wins in their hockeyfights.com record this season but Orr has 7 losses and Shelley only 3 .
Please keep that in mind when you read all of the Toronto fans writing in that Shelley got lucky or landed a lucky punch .
One other note :
In games where the Sharks have two or more fights this season , they are 13 - 0 - 0 ( That 's win / loss record not fight record ) .
1. Short cigarette ( 117 b )
2. Origami bird
3. Coffee shop C ( " diner " )

Is this where you get the demo code ?
Quantic Dream 's highly anticipated murder mystery Heavy Rain hits the shelves on February 24th , and the demo is set for release on PSN on the 11th .
But hey , why wait ?
As part of its Four Days Challenge promo , Sony has released a Heavy Rain " alternate reality game . "
Those who took part in the promo and successfully discovered the four pieces of evidence can surf on over to the Precinct 52 website and enter the answers they acquired to receive the demo code .
However , if you did n't take part in the promo ( or did but could n't solve the puzzles ) , you can still play the alternate reality game and unlock the code .
That , or we can just give you the four pieces of evidence to enter at Precinct 52 right now : Redeem the demo code and you 'll unlock two playable sequences .
Sorry , you 'll have to buy the full game to play those much blogged - about shower scenes .
It appears the biggest mystery you 'll have to solve is how to get into Precinct 52 .
The site has been swamped since news of the early demo hit the tubes .
How It ’s Done in Colorado
With all of the complicated liquor laws in place , how does a new brewery make a go of it ?
In the State of Colorado , we are blessed , as a brewery , to have the ability to have a wholesale liquor license ( in addition to our manufacturers liquor license ) which permits us to self - distribute .
This means that we can buy a van , knock on doors of independently - owned liquor stores , have them sample what we have to offer , and let them decide to stock their shelves with our products . . . or not .
This is opposed to the very common “ Three Tier ” system in many states which mandate that there is a brewery , there is a distributor , and there is a retailer .
Brewery and retailer never meet .
This past Wednesday , I had the privilege of joining the Colorado Brewer ’s Guild , Left Hand Brewing , Oskar Blues Brewery , and Dry Dock Brewing to give testimony to oppose House Bill 1186 which would allow full strength beer to be served in convenience stores in Colorado .
Why would the brewers of Colorado oppose such a bill ?
Would n’t it just be more outlets in which to sell their beer ?
There are many reasons why we oppose this .
Let me cite two .
Our to - date success is primarily a result of our independently - owned liquor stores that carry our products .
Many of these stores are located near , or next to convenience stores and grocery stores ( Did I mention that House Bill 1279 which would allow grocery stores to stock full - strength beer is soon to be introduced ? ) .
While grocery stores and convenience stores are able to carry a wide variety of products , liquor stores can carry three things : beer , wine , and liquor .
Most liquor stores rely on about 50 % of their sales as beer .
Netting it out :
You kill the indepenently - owned Colorado liquor store , you kill the Colorado craft beer culture that gives us the variety we love in our great state .
Reason # 2 : Convenience stores and grocery stores will not carry the variety of craft beer that you currently enjoy in liquor stores .
Picture this :
You are a new brewery in Colorado .
You want to sell your beer .
You knock on the door of the local convenience store or grocery store ( because all of the independently - owned liquor stores are out of business ) .
They say , “ Well , we do n’t make those kinds of decisions here .
You ’ll have to talk to our corporate office in Tempe , Arizona ” .
So you need to get in line , and maybe someday you ’ll get a call back with that “ no thanks ” that you needed to be a “ sure , OK ” in order to get your product to market .
Access to free market is squashed .
The state that produces more beer than any state in the nation , the home of 114 breweries , the Brewer ’s Association , the Colorado Brewer ’s Guild , and the Great American Beer Festival is under siege by this proposed legislation .
The rules in place work .
The rules in place have fostered arguably the best state in the nation for craft beer .
If you want to continue to enjoy great beer in Colorado , please give a shout out to your State Representatives .
I did it for the first time this past week .
So can you .
Without craft beer enthusiasts voicing their concerns , you just may be looking at one of the last new breweries in Colorado .

LAS VEGAS — A host of video services on the web enable you to watch your favorite TV programs and movies anytime you wish , and Boxee is an open platform striving to weave them all into one neat interface .
To get the Boxee experience onto a TV , D - Link has launched a set - top box dedicated to the open video platform , along with a special remote .
The Boxee box is pretty simple .
Video outputs through an HDMI connector .
For audio , you can plug in through an optical digital audio - out jack or regular composite audio .
An SD card slot and two USB ports allow you to expand storage .
For internet connectivity , the box supports 802.11n Wi -Fi and ethernet .
Boxee was previously a piece of open source software that you ’d download to view media on your computer .
Most users would download
Boxee onto their notebook , which they ’d then hook up to a TV .
The box eliminates that need , and it ’s also compatible with a new remote that just launched at the Consumer Electronics Show .
The remote sports a full QWERTY keyboard for typing in search queries .
On the back of it there are three buttons for hitting Enter , accessing the main Boxee menu and playing or pausing video .
We ’ve been fans of Boxee for some time :
The menu is beautiful and intuitive , and it ’s really zippy with loading multimedia files with thumbnails .
The remote does indeed make the experience more enjoyable .
It ’s sturdy , smooth and comfortable , and the keys feel high quality .
Boxee ’s primary purpose was to streamline video entertainment , but since it ’s an open platform , it can do a lot more .
There ’s a Boxee app store for downloading third - party apps provided by developers .
The main menu has buttons to access music and photos , too .
Think of the Boxee as a restriction - free Apple TV .
The Boxee box and remote are shipping the second quarter of 2010 .
Pricing has not been announced , but Boxee estimates $ 200 .
For a detailed look at the Boxee platform , see Epicenter ’s coverage of the Boxee box launch .

There 's been lots of excitement in the blogosphere and beyond over the news that , following the recent furore over the IPCC reports , the United Nations has been forced into yet another embarrassing reinvestigation of its data .
This time it 's the turn of the highly influential report called Livestock 's Long Shadow , which was published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) in 2006 .
Its headline conclusion was that global meat production was responsible for 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions , which was slightly more than all of the world 's cars , trains , and planes combined .
This astonishing fact has been cited ever since by environmentalists and , in particular , vegetarian advocacy groups as a good reason in itself to reduce meat consumption .
I myself have mentioned the report when writing about this subject .
This is how the latest revelation has been reported over the past couple of days :
Boffin rubbishes Paul McCartney lentil - noshing plan - The Register .
Veggies are wrong and eating less meat will NOT save planet The Daily Mail .
Save the planet , eat less meat ... right ?
That 's what the UN said , anyway , but one scientist has a grade A beef with that claim - Fox News .
Forget all that indecorous talk of animal flatulence , cow burps , vegetarianism and global warming .
Welcome to Cowgate - The Washington Times .
The glee from the usual suspects is palpable , but not exactly surprising .
The reinvestigation was triggered by the claims of Frank Mitloehner , the associate professor and cooperative extension specialist – air quality , at the department of animal science at the University of California , Davis .
He presented a paper earlier this week at an American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco arguing that the FAO 's comparison with the transport sector was flawed .
The paper , called Clearing the Air : Livestock 's Contributions to Climate Change , was first published last October in the journal Advances in Agronomy .
In it , Mitloehner argued that while full lifecycle analysis was used to calculate the emissions for the meat sector , this was n't the case for the transport sector , where only the fossil fuels burned by the vehicles was included , not the emissions resulting from manufacturing the vehicles .
" This lopsided ' analysis ' is a classical apples - and - oranges analogy that truly confused the issue , " Mitloehner told the meeting .
The BBC's Richard Black has since contacted the FAO 's livestock policy officer , Pierre Gerber , and asked him for his reaction .
" I must say honestly that he [ Mitloehner ] has a point - we factored in everything for meat emissions , and we did n't do the same thing with transport , " he told Black .
" But on the rest of the report , I do n't think it was really challenged . "
Fair enough .
On this evidence , it certainly seems worth examining this apparent mismatch between the methodologies used to calculate the emissions of each sector .
I have no problem with that at all .
What does seem odd , though , is that none of the reports that I have seen so far have thought to mention who funded the original report .
Just a cursory check online is all it takes to reveal the source of the funding .
After all , it was mentioned in the original press release put out by the university last December :
Clearing the Air is a synthesis of research by the UC Davis authors and many other institutions , including the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , US Environmental Protection Agency , US Department of Agriculture , California Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board .
Writing the synthesis was supported by a $ 26,000 research grant from the Beef Checkoff Program , which funds research and other activities , including promotion and consumer education , through fees on beef producers in the US .
Since 2002 , Mitloehner has received $ 5 m in research funding , with 5 % of the total from agricultural commodities groups , such as beef producers .
Well , that 's a rather interesting paragraph , is n't it ?
It 's funny how none of this information made it into those gleeful reports .
First , let 's learn some more about the Beef Checkoff Program .
It appears to be an initiative of the Cattlemen 's Beef Board , which , according to its website , " consists of 106 members , including domestic beef , dairy and veal producers , as well as importers of beef and beef products " .
The checkoff is a producer - funded marketing and research program designed to increase domestic and / or international demand for beef .
This can be done through promotion , research and new product development , and a variety of other marketing tools .
The Cattlemen 's Beef Board and USDA [ US Department of Agriculture ] oversee the collection and spending of checkoff funds .
And what about the " $ 5 m in research funding " that Mitloehner has received since 2002 ?
As is right and proper , Mitloehner freely publishes all the details on his website as a pdf document .
Here we learn that , over this period , he has received $ 40,000 from the National Pork Board , as well as sizeable grants from the US Department of Agriculture and something called the Agriculture Air Research Council ( AARC ) , which , according to the Pork Checkoff website , is " an independent , non-profit organisation … formed to oversee and manage the air emissions research .
The AARC board of directors has two representatives from each participating livestock sector , including one member from the National Pork Board and one from the National Pork Producers Council . "
In other words , Mitloehner 's research over the past eight years has been significantly funded by representatives of the US livestock industry and the government department charged with overseeing this multi-billion dollar industry .
Let me make this perfectly clear : I 'm not saying that Mitloehner is a bought - off scientist in the pocket of Big Beef .
As I said earlier , I actually think his claims are worthy of further investigation and I 'm pleased this now appears to be taking place .
It 's not like he 's trying to hide this information – it's just a click away on his website .
My beef is that this funding information has not been deemed worthy of inclusion in the reports and blogs that have been so quick to leap on Mitloehner 's findings as , in their eyes , further proof that environmentalists are just a bunch of unscientific cranks .
Spin it on its head for one moment : remember how climate sceptics were punching the air over the revelation that the so - called " HimalayaGate " error in the IPPC 's fourth assessment report had resulted from a WWF document ?
For some sceptics , this fact alone immediately invalidated the whole report .
I think everyone agrees that transparency is a worthy goal so maybe in the future all sides of this debate can aim to include information such as this as a basic principle ?
Just a thought .
PRINCETON , NJ --
For the first time since 1991 , more than 6 in 10 Americans -- 63 % -- say their sympathies in the Middle East situation lie more with the Israelis than with the Palestinians .
Fifteen percent side more with the Palestinians , down slightly from recent years , while a combined 23 % favor both sides , favor neither side , or have no opinion .
The 63 % sympathizing with Israel today is statistically unchanged from the 58 % to 59 % seen from 2006 to 2009 ; however , it is considerably higher than most of the previous readings on this Gallup measure since 1993 .
The trend includes two 38 % readings in 1996 and 1997 .
Only in January 1991 -- shortly after Israel was hit by Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War -- did U.S. support for Israel register as high as it does today .
" Americans ' attitudes about the prospects for peace are little changed from last year , but are among the more pessimistic Gallup has found since initiating the question in 1997 . "
Over the last five years , support for Israel has increased slightly among Republicans ( rising from about 77 % for each of the past several years to 85 % today ) and independents , but has stayed roughly the same among Democrats .
Since 2001 , however , there has been a more dramatic shift in partisan attitudes : a 25 - point increase in sympathy for Israel among Republicans and an 18 - point increase among independents .
Even on this longer - term basis , support for Israel among Democrats has been relatively flat .
The latest findings come from Gallup 's annual World Affairs survey , updated Feb. 1 - 3 , 2010 .
In the same poll , Americans were asked to give their opinions of 20 countries , including Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Israel 's 67 % favorable rating ranks among the highest and the Palestinian Authority 's 20 % among the lowest .
However , current favorability toward Israel is similar to where it has been for the last several years , and favorability toward the Palestinians is on the high end of the range since 2000 .
Outlook for Peace
Additionally , the poll asked Americans about the chances that peace will eventually come to the Middle East .
Currently , 30 % think " there will come a time " when " Israel and the Arab nations will be able to settle their differences and live in peace " ; 67 % are doubtful .
Americans ' attitudes about the prospects for peace are little changed from last year , but are among the more pessimistic Gallup has found since initiating the question in 1997 .
The only time fewer Americans were optimistic about Arab - Israeli peace ( 27 % ) was in July 2006 , during the Israeli - Hezbollah war in southern Lebanon .
While public optimism has since remained low , it has shown longer - term variations , and has a history of rebounding -- particularly after U.S. - brokered peace talks in 1999 , 2003 , and 2005 .
With 39 % of Democrats saying peace will come about , this group is more optimistic than either Republicans ( 25 % ) or independents ( 26 % ) are about Arab - Israeli peace .
This has been the general pattern for the past decade ; however , the gap between Democrats and others has expanded in recent years .
Independents have become significantly less optimistic about the chances of peace since President Obama took office : the percentage believing peace will come about fell from 41 % during the last year of the Bush administration ( in February 2008 ) to 30 % in May 2009 , and stands at 26 % today .
Optimism among Republicans fell below 30 % in 2007 and has since remained low .
Democrats ' views have been fairly steady since 2001 , except for a brief spurt of optimism in 2005 -- seen among all three party groups ( a major Israeli - Palestinian peace summit that resulted in a truce agreement was underway at the time of that survey ) .
Bottom Line
In the ongoing Israel - Palestinian conflict , a striking 63 % of Americans currently say their sympathies lie more with the Israelis , the highest level in nearly 20 years .
Support for the Palestinians , at 15 % , is about average for the same period .
At the same time , Gallup finds Americans ' fundamental views of Israel no more favorable than they have been for the past several years .
Israel does continue to enjoy a substantial advantage over the Palestinian Authority in its general image , a fact that clearly colors the ways Americans view the conflict .
Americans are no more optimistic today than they were last year that peace can be reached between Israel and the Palestinians -- and they are , in fact , less optimistic than they were toward the end of the Bush administration .
This is largely owing to a drop in optimism among independents .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,025 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 1 - 3 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
HarperCollins Children 's Books has announced thefall 2011 release of a collection of never - before published Shel Silversteinpoems and illustrations .
Not yet titled , the book will share the same format asthe late author 's previous poetry collections ,
Where the Sidewalk Ends , ALight in the Attic , and Falling Up .
These and other children 's books by Silverstein , who died in 1999 , have soldmore than 25 million hardcover copies in the U.S. alone and have been translatedinto more than 30 languages .
Senior executive editor Antonia Markiet beganworking with the author in the 1970s , after his editor Edite Kroll , who nowhandles foreign rights for Silverstein 's estate , left the company ( then Harper& Row ) .
Kroll had become Silverstein 's editor when Ursula Nordstrom , whoinitially discovered his work in Playboy , retired in 1973 .
Markiet , who edited 2005 's RunnyBabbit , Silverstein 's first posthumously published book , is currentlyworking with Silverstein 's family to select poetry and artwork for the newcollection , which she says " will contain between 120 and 130 poems , in linewith Shel 's previous three poetry collections . "
Given the author 's creativity and output , thereis no dearth of material .
" Every time Shel did a collection , he had more materialthan could fit in one book , so he'd put aside the extra material and take itout when he began another book , and would again end up with more than he couldpossibly use , " Markiet recalls .
Twelve previously unpublished poems wereincluded in HarperCollins ' 2004 30th - anniversary edition of Where the Sidewalk Ends , and another 12in A Light in the Attic Special Edition , released last fall .
" There is a wealth of material in the archives , and so many fans still write to us and to Shel 's family saying how importanthis work is to them , that the family decided it was the right time to consideranother book from that material , " says Markiet of the new anthology .
Sheexplains that the Silverstein family is carefully considering all the work inthe poet 's archives to compile the collection , along with members of the HarperCollins staff .
" We 've just started the process , so this is verynew , " she says .
" We 're talking about the poems , and reading them aloud to eachother .
And we 're looking at visuals .
Shel had already created boards for somespreads , so our direction is clear .
We 're all enjoying it immensely and arevery excited to be able to have this opportunity . "
And the new project has obviously stirred upfond memories of working with Silverstein decades ago .
" When I began workingwith Shel , I was quite young and shy , and he was always very kind to me , " Markietrecalls .
" That man was such a perfectionist — in the best way possible .
He workedso hard , changing a line here , trying a different word there .
It always had tobe exactly right .
He knew that a poem had to work in two ways : when childrenread it to themselves and when it was read aloud .
I learned a lot from him . "
Marine Heavy Gunner Fn’a !
January 21 , 2010
So … I worked on this six years ago .
If I see one now & then in a bargin bin I usually pay the $ 5 for it & pass it off on one of my friends as a reminder to myself about the boat times …
I have a real love / hate relationship with the games industry .
I have n’t worked on anything famous , but I have worked on low budget up to 14 million dollar titles .
THE SAGA OF HEAVY GUNNER .
After telling us we were going to be able to pitch our ideas and do our own title ( I wanted to do a game about auto - gyros with chain guns nee : appleseed ) after we had already done a ‘ market driven ’ title for WalMart , the publisher comes back and says make us a $ 20 budget Call of Duty with bigger guns … in six months .
Marine Sharpshooter is a big hit , we are going to do it again with bigger guns … in VIETNAM ! ( in six months ) !
I understand more now , but at the time I was pretty pissed , but living the dream , so hey !
We DID do it with six people in six months ( really 4 of actual development , month lead in , month Q/ A & bug fixing on the end ) .
It was translated in Eight languages and released internationally .
I challenge any dev team to beat that time .
We basically lived through a year ( including the previous title ) of back to back continuous crunch time and I left the industry for a year after that .
That and no one there wanted to make my SPEEDBOAT combat game , which I was ALL about .
Everyone on the team has gone on to very successful careers in the game industry , some even working on the Bioshock franchise and so on .
I like to do hobby games now collected here : headshrinker !
What most people do n’t know , is I wrote as a B - movie style romp through Vietnam .
It is blatantly racist against all creeds of mankind , over the top , seldom makes sense , is basically a shooting gallery with humans & uses every cliche in the book .
Maybe I ’m wrong in the head .
I guess objectively Vietnam is n’t funny .
None of the reviewers picked up that it was a parody either .
C’mon people , you are writers , and heard some of that dialog & you took it serious ?
“ Half of these jokers were doing the backstroke six feet under and had no idea , trying out for the swim team of the soon to be dead ”
I know cuz I wrote it .
Aaaaaaaaand voiced the main character ‘ Grant ’ .
Aaaaaaaaand if you open the box , that first marine from the left is wearing my face .
Ew !
Originally , I wrote a completely insane ( killing puppies / eating babies ) script on purpose , they pulled all that & I got to keep what I wanted .
At the time it came out I ’m pretty sure it was the swearing - est game ever made .
The real kicker is at the end of the game , after committing all the atrocities , the bad guy makes a deal with the CIA and gets off scott free .
Everything you did was for nothing .
I wrote a pointless ending to make people feel helpless and futile .
LULZ .
I was really surprised no one ever asked me or commented on that on the team , or in any review or any of that .
I suspect , not so secretly that no one ever finished it .
hahahah .
TECHNICAL NOTES
If you found a legal $ 5 or less copy ->
The game itself wo n’t install under VISTA ( even with compatibility mode ) as we had to put shitty starforce DRM in it , which only caused install problems and it was hacked on the internet four hours after it ’s release anyway ..
If you found the torrent ->
The game still wo n’t install under VISTA ( even with compatibility mode ) as the crack only ever displays the demo screen .

REVIEWS here .
I learned a lot about game reviews that day .
Your six person , six month , $ 200,000 .
budget game is reviewed THE SAME as a three year , three hundred person studio game that had a budget of ten million dollars .
nice .
Selected quotes
“ ” The voice acting is of the so - bad - it ’s - good variety .
Whoever did the voice work is a master of dialects , but is evidently incapable of maintaining the same dialect for two lines in a row .
Some characters switch from being Southern to British to Indian within the span of a few sentences .
Coupled with the terrible dialogue and the nonstop swearing , you may start to look forward to every speaking part .
Especially noteworthy is the vicious taunting you ’ll receive from the Vietcong , who repeatedly scream things like “ F* you Uncle Sam , ” “ F you Yankee pig , ” and the truly unforgettable , “ F** you American blue jean ! ” ” – GameSpot
All true .
Unfortunately they forgot “ Go Fuck your mamma Cowboy !!!“ .
“ On the audio front , MHG : Vietnam does a pretty good job of bringing the action close to home .
Every gunshot , explosion , and Vietcong death sounds great with every step toward the infiltration of their territory .
In fact , even though the voice acting is a bit on the cheesy side ( especially the seemingly - forced cursing ) , it is better than most games on the market .
The only problem is that the characters do n’t move their mouths , which takes a lot away from the cinematic storyline . ”
Game Vortex
On the no mouth movement thing , we were n’t green - lighted for the $ 400 plug in to animate the mouths .
sigh .
“ I would recommend not using a Canadian to voice a guy from Jersey .
Watch out for that guy on the ootcropping ! ”
That one kills me , because he WAS an American voice actor , that could ONLY DO ONE VOICE , the Jersey voice .
Drove me insane in the studio , but I was n’t allowed to fire him because he was somebody ’s friend .
“ While the sound is only slightly below average , the voice acting is hysterically dreadful .
While the main character , Grant , sounds like Max Payne reincarnated circa late 1960 ’s , all of the game ’s voiceovers were undoubtedly performed by friends of the developers .
Couple this with the fact that they often spout out dialogue completely inapplicable to the action taking place on screen , and you ’ve got yourself a fine mess .
The only saving grace is the tolerable music that often manages to accurately reflect the current scenario and some appropriately throaty sound effects for the heavier caliber weapons . ”
Voiceovers WERE the developers + one guy that works at LucasArts now .
And yes I look like Max Payne from the 60’s .
Another interesting note , we DID have ragdoll physics .
But what happened was when you killed a Vietcong their body would shrink down to the size of a child and seizure on the ground flailing and screaming .
Needless to say we were NOT allowed to keep that in the game .
After a firefight it looked like you had wiped out an entire orphanage .
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING A REAL GRITTY GAME LIKE HOW IT REALLY WAS !
“ From the get go MHG seemed to have a decent storyline that had me getting ready for a good game .
Unfortunately the storyline is about the best thing about the game , and it ’s not all that wonderful . ”
“ the most realistic part of the game is the language .
It carries a mature rating for a reason .
So if offensive language bothers you , stay clear of this one .
This is just like a war movie with an R rating . ”
Well anyway that ’s all that .

They are smart , industrious and marginalised , huddling together for comfort .
Hordes of China ’s underemployed or underpaid university graduates have formed squalid enclaves on the fringes of the country ’s big cities , earning themselves the label yi zu or ‘ ant tribe ’ .
As their ranks swell , some observers have warned of the dangers that a mass of young and frustrated people – doing jobs they are overqualified for – might pose to social stability .
Last month , several delegates at Beijing ’s annual parliamentary session urged the government to build better housing for these graduates and to do more to help them find jobs .
There are a million ‘ ants ’ massed around major cities , with about 100,000 in Beijing alone , estimates sociologist Lian Si , who led a two - year study that was published in a book last September .
A typical ‘ ant ’ hails from rural China , is a graduate of a non -brand - name university aged between 22 and 29 , and earns no more than 2,000 yuan ( S $ 414 ) a month working long hours as an insurance salesman , computer technician or waiter .
WASHINGTON — Under pressure from the White House , health insurance companies said Tuesday that they would comply with rules to be issued soon by the Obama administration requiring them to cover children with pre-existing medical problems .
“ Health plans recognize the significant hardship that a family faces when they are unable to obtain coverage for a child with a pre-existing condition , ” said Karen M. Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , a trade group .
Accordingly , she said , “ we await and will fully comply with ” the rules .
Ms. Ignagni made the commitment in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , who had said she feared that some insurers might exploit a possible ambiguity in the new health care law to deny coverage to some sick children .
The White House immediately claimed victory .
In a Twitter message , Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , scored the tug of war as “ Kids 1 , insurance 0 . ”
Like plenty of hale and hearty young Irishmen , Chris knows just how to unwind after a tough day at the office :
He reaches for his bath salts .
He gets the water ready -- but in a glass , not the tub .
Then , despite a warning on the box that it ’s “ not for human consumption , ” he pops a capsule in his mouth and downs it with a swig .
For the next few hours , he ’s happy and hopped up , full of energy for an evening of clubbing , without a hangover lying in wait .
“ I find it much less debilitating ” than alcohol , confides the 29 - year - old bookkeeper , who can pop two or three capsules a night .
He asked that his full name not be used .
Such “ bath salts ” are popular these days throughout Ireland , not for a relaxing soak at home but because many contain a party drug known as mephedrone .
They ’re part of the literally dizzying array of products being sold in stores offering customers cheap and legal highs , stuff marketed as bath salts or incense but designed to be smoked , snorted or swallowed .
The new - wave head shops are fast becoming a fixture in this island nation , multiplying with astonishing speed from just a few several years ago to as many as 100 today .
Much of the growth has occurred in the last 12 months , even as the rest of the Irish economy underwent a painful contraction .
Authorities are increasingly concerned about the potential effect of head shops and their products on crime and the nation ’s health .
Parents , too , are worried about their children ’s exposure to substances that mimic the effects of outlawed drugs such as cocaine and marijuana .
Officials are groping for ways to limit , regulate or ban head shops , which operate with so little restriction that many stay open till 4 a.m. , supplying eager clubbers through metal hatches in their doors , like shady pharmaceutical take - aways .
By contrast , the sale of alcohol is far more regulated .
That the head shops are n’t subject to heavier control is due in large part to clever packaging .
By peddling products advertised , however misleadingly , for other uses , the stores avoid strict food and drug safety regulations and receive virtually the same treatment as retailers that sell clothes , books , home furnishings or other “ harmless ” consumer goods .
The charade fools no one , of course , least of all the manufacturers , who indulge in some sly descriptions on their labels .
The makers of Snow “ bath salts , ” for instance , inform buyers that adding their “ fine white powder ” to the bath will make them chatty and peppy , but warn against the presence of heavy machinery in the bathroom .
“ They ’re labeled as ‘ not for human consumption , ’ but when you go into the shop , you ’re told how to consume it , how to inject it , ” lawmaker Joe Costello said .
“ We have a range of substances that are sold that really are not regulated , that nobody knows precisely what ’s in them , nobody knows the quantities that are being sold or taken . ”
Some insalubrious consequences are already beginning to emerge .
Hospitals have reported an increase in the number of emergency room patients suffering from hallucinations , panic attacks and delirium brought on by mind - altering products such as Ivory Wave , which is sold as bath salts .
Here in the Irish capital , residents and businesses were alarmed last month by fires believed to be arson at two head shops , possibly set by drug dealers angry about the competition .
Even so , Costello is leery of banning the shops , which many fear would drive up the illegal drug trade and open the door wider to gangs and organized crime .
The government decided this month to outlaw a range of substances found in head shops , including mephedrone , which mimics the effect of ecstasy ; the ban will take effect in June .
But targeting specific substances can also be an exercise in frustration , triggering an endless cat - and - mouse game in which manufacturers keep tweaking their products to stay one step ahead of the law .
Costello has settled on a softer approach :
He ’s pushing a bill in the Dail , the lower house of parliament , that would subject head shops to more planning controls , which could at least help limit where they can open -- for example , not too close to schools .
Shane O’Connor , director of a chain of head shops , sees some sense in that .
In fact , O’Connor says he ’s open to stricter guidelines on window displays and a ban on sales to anyone younger than 18 .
It ’s the idea of closing down the shops that he finds absurd .
“ Prohibition does n’t remove demand , ” he said .
“ The only way to remove demand for illegal drugs is to offer safer legal alternatives . ”
In many ways , today ’s head shop craze is merely an extension of a wave of drug use that has swept Ireland since the 1970s .
Heroin and other hard drugs were popular in the beginning .
Then cocaine and crack started making inroads , especially during Ireland ’s economic boom of the last 20 years , which transformed the Emerald Isle into the Celtic Tiger .
Now recreational users have an expanded menu of drugs to choose from , at much lower , recession - friendly prices .
“ It ’s a lot easier now , ” said Thomas , 19 , a slightly scruffy college student who declined to give his last name .
“ It ’s all legal at the moment . ”
He had just bought a packet of Ice Gold , an “ aromatherapy resin extract ” by a company engaged in “ botanical research . ”
Two grams cost about $ 35 .
Thomas buys a packet a week to take home and smoke ; he no longer has to badger friends for pot .
( Online discussions say Ice Gold contains resin from cannabis , but shop workers insist that it “ has no cannabinoids . ” )
Nothing on the box , though , says exactly what ’s in Ice Gold or how to use it safely .
There ’s only an effusive , but not particularly helpful , description of how such plant extracts “ have for millennia been used in shamanic rituals . ”
That lack of information upsets Christopher Luke , a vocal critic of head shops in the southern city of Cork , where a store called the Funky Skunk sits on one of the main shopping drags .
An emergency room doctor , Luke has seen some of the ugly outcomes of unregulated drug use .
“ The consequences of head shop products are sometimes spectacular in terms of psychosis , delirium and what they need in terms of treatment , ” he said .
His hospital admits a head shop case every week to 10 days , adding to the strain on Ireland ’s overburdened healthcare system , Luke said .
“ Head shop drugs are in every village and town of this island , ” he said .
“ Even if 1 % of consumers come to harm , it could be very , very difficult . ”
Like others ,
Luke counsels against rushing through inadequate or ill - thought - out legislation to deal with the situation .
But Costello , the lawmaker , said some stopgap measure needs to be taken now , especially if Ireland wants to avoid turning into a destination for the legally blissed - out .
“ We leave that type of tourism , ” he said , “ to Amsterdam . ”

Julie Klausner 's I Don't Care About Your Band is the anti-Marry Him — a celebration of self - love in the face of laughably bad dudes .
Advertisement
The book is largely a chronicle of Klausner 's shitty dating experiences , recounted with broad and relatively inoffensive humor .
On a guy who wanted to " share a cock " with Klausner , she writes : " like anybody 's cock is so big that you'd be like , ' I ca n't finish this !
Let 's split it . ' "
And on an immature post - college boyfriend :
I did n't hear back from Rob that day , but in the wake of all the soot and emotional debris of , um , 9/11 , I did manage to get him to invite me over to his apartment .
It turns out that Rob felt vulnerable enough , by then , to extend an invitation for me to come over .
So maybe the attacks were worth it !
Right , ladies ?

There are n't that many belly laughs , at least for me , but reading I Don't Care is like spending time with that friend who makes you feel like everything is going to Be Okay .
Not because you 're about to embark on some betterment program or strategy ( for instance , Klausner detests The Rules ) , but because you 're already awesome .
Klausner writes ,
Follow what it is that you love and makes you want to be better , always .
But do n't get yourself tied up with any kind of rock star — musician or not — who makes you feel like you 're not made of star stuff .
Because of course you are .
Give me a break .

It 's cheesy , yes , and it 's nothing we have n't heard before , but it 's nice to get this kind of message not from , say , a ladymag that will go back to undermining us on the next page , but from a smart writer who 's also a pretty astute social critic .
Klausner recently shared her analysis of the Muppets with Salon , but her take on The Office , and especially Pam 's character , feels even more relevant .
Klausner writes ,
There 's nothing scary about Pam , because there 's no mystery : she 's just like the boys who like her ; mousy and shy .
The ultimate emo -boy fantasy is to meet a nerdt , cute girl just like him , and nobody else will realize she 's pretty .

While she has what seems to me a slightly restrictive definition of what it means to be a man ( it involves " a hearty handshake " ) , Klausner has identified a particular type of Nice Guy ( TM ) — one who wants a woman who never upstages him , even with her beauty .
She continues :
Fear can be the result of admiration , or it can be a symptom of contempt .
When I see squeamish guys passing over qualified women when they 're hiring for a job , or becoming tongue - tied when a girl crashes their all - boy conversation at a party , I do n't credit them for being awestruck .
They 're reacting to the intimidating female as an intruder , an alien , and somebody they can't relate to .
It 's not a compliment to be made invisible .

Klausner understands that not all misogynists are blustery types who think they 're better than women .
Male insecurity , too , can breed misogyny — often a subtle kind that forces women out of the spotlight with sheer diffidence .
According to Klausner , we should n't cater to this insecurity by being more nurturing — we should just not fucking stand for it .
Dispatches from dating hell can feel depressing , like everyone in the world is an asshole and there 's no hope for anybody .
I Don't Care , by contrast , is uplifting even when Klausner is , say , having sex with an unattractive jerk with a mysterious wound on his thigh .
Every time she leaves a bad guy , there 's a sense of relief , even joy — perhaps because she seems to genuinely like herself and realize she 's better off .
In this context , her reassurances feel less like empty you - go - girl - ism and more like a prescription for a happy life : if you believe you 're great , there 's only so much an asshole can take away from you .
Lori Gottlieb tells women not to feel too good about themselves , lest they pass up so - so guys and " end up alone . "
Klausner 's message , if she has one , is the opposite : feel great about yourself , and neither loneliness nor a so - so guy will destroy you .
I know which one I prefer .

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating why two children were allowed to direct air traffic at John F. Kennedy airport , one of the busiest airports in the country .
The FAA says a controller brought children to work on two occasions last month -- on Feb .
16th and 17th -- and allowed them to talk to pilots .
The controller and a supervisor have since been suspended .
" Pending the outcome of our investigation , the employees involved in this incident are not controlling air traffic , " the FAA said in a statement .
" This behavior is not acceptable and does not demonstrate the kind of professionalism expected from all FAA employees . "
The agency declined to comment beyond the statement .
The recordings — made during a weeklong winter break for many New York schoolchildren — were posted last month on a Web site for air traffic control - listening aficionados .
In audio recordings captured by www.liveatc.net, the young kid could be heard clearing planes for take off and landing .
At one point the child even has fun with an Air Mexico flight , saying , " Adios . " ( listen to the entire exchange above or here )
The adult controller accompanying the child , and the controller 's supervisor have both been suspended while authorities investigate .
Neither employee has been identified and the child 's age has not been revealed .
Below is a transcript of an excerpt of the audio recordings as the child talks to different pilots :
Child : " 171 cleared for take off . "
Pilot : " Clear for take off JetBlue 171 "
Child : " Let 's see your Air Mexico 403 Kennedy , runway through left position and hold . "
Pilot : " Going to hold Air Mexico 403 . "
Unknown : " This is what you get guys when the kids are out of school . "
Unknown : " Wish I could bring my kid to work . "
Child : " JetBlue 171 contact departure . "
Unknown : " Over to departure JetBlue 171 , awesome job . "
Child : " 03 clear for take off . "
Early this morning , Dough Church with the Air Traffic Controllers ' National Union released a statement saying , " We do not condone this type of behavior in any way .
It is not indicative of the highest professional standards that controllers set for themselves and exceed each and every day in the advancement of aviation safety . "
A survey of 200 sites in 20 countries around the world has found that bisphenol A , a synthetic compound that mimics estrogen and is linked to developmental disorders , is ubiquitous in Earth 's oceans .
Bisphenol A , or BPA , is found mostly in shatter - proof plastics and epoxy resins .
Most people have trace amounts in their bodies , likely absorbed from food containers .
Its hormone - mimicking properties make it a potent endocrine system disruptor .
In recent years , scientists have moved from studying BPA 's damaging effects in laboratory animals to linking it to heart disease , sterility and altered childhood development in humans .
Many questions still remain about dosage effects and the full nature of those links , but in January the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that " recent studies provide reason for some concern about the potential effects of BPA on the brain , behavior , and prostate gland of fetuses , infants and children . ”
The oceanic BPA survey , presented March 23 at an American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco , was conducted by Nihon University chemists Katsuhiko Saido and Hideto Sato .
At an ACS meeting last year , they described how soft plastic in seawater does n't just float or sink intact , but can break down rapidly , releasing toxins .
In their new findings , they showed that BPA - containing hard plastics can break down too , and found BPA in ocean water and sand at concentrations ranging from .01 to .50 parts per million .
As for what those numbers mean for public and environmental health , it 's hard to say .
BPA can cause reproductive disorders in shellfish and crustaceans , and doses below a single part per trillion can have cell - level effects , but the path from water and sand to ocean animals needs to be studied .
One disturbing possibility is that BPA could bioaccumulate , with animals eating BPA - tainted animals that have eaten BPA - tainted animals , finally reaching high concentrations in top - level ocean predators and the humans who eat them .
For that to happen , BPA would have to be stored in fatty tissue , rather than passing quickly through the body .
" That 's a really difficult , unsettled question , " said Shanna Swan , a University of Rochester environmental medicine specialist who was n't involved in the survey .
In a 2009 Environmental Health Perspectives study of BPA concentrations in people who had recently fasted , Swan found that BPA levels remained high longer than expected .
It 's possible that BPA indeed accumulated in their fat , said Swan .
They could also have picked up BPA from as - yet - unappreciated non-dietary sources , such as household dust or leaching from PVC water pipes .
Or both scenarios may be true .
The BPA contamination found by Saido and Sato likely comes from a mix of boat paint and plastic .
About three million tons of BPA - containing plastics are produced each year .
The United Nations estimates that the average square mile of ocean contains 46,000 pieces of plastic trash .
" Marine debris plastic in the ocean will certainly constitute a new global ocean contamination for long into the future , " wrote Saido and Sato in their presentation .

Celebrities like Mia Farrow and George Clooney may have done more to prolong the suffering of Darfur than resolve the crisis in Sudan 's war - torn region , a new book argues .
" The Save Darfur movement with its celebrity supporters came down very clearly on one particular side of the debate , " says Rob Crilly , author of Saving Darfur , Everyone 's Favourite African War .
" This very simple straight - forward narrative which demanded our intervention was the only view being heard , " he told the BBC .
Crilly arrived in East Africa as a foreign correspondent for the London - based Times newspaper in 2004 , a year after the insurgency in Darfur began .
His brief was to cover all of the region 's brutal conflicts - Somalia , the Democratic Republic of Congo and the end of the civil war in south Sudan .
' Sexy conflict '
" But it became very clear very quickly there was only one conflict that my editors wanted me to cover , " he says .
" As soon as I arrived I was getting calls asking me to go to Darfur - there was something very different about Darfur , something that was sexy and people were interested in . "
It was a very simple , clear war to understand - of good guys against bad guys .
Rob Crilly Compared with other conflicts in Africa , Darfur seemed simple :
In September 2004 , then - US Secretary of State Colin Powell used the word " genocide " .
Crilly says the conflict was portrayed as " An evil government intent on destroying the rebels and their supporters .
" They 'd unleashed this fearsome Arab militia , the Janjaweed on a scorched - earth campaign against villagers who were supporting the rebels , so it was a very simple , clear war to understand - of good guys against bad guys .
" You compare that with Somalia , where there are countless warlords and Islamist militias all fighting against each other , or the Democratic Republic of Congo which has been rumbling on for 10 years and anyone who understands those wars frankly is just boasting . "
But the longer he reported on the conflict , the more Crilly understood that there was nothing simple about Darfur and what he was witnessing was a tragic , complicated conflict , rather than a simplistic genocide .
Unsurprisingly , Mia Farrow says she disagrees with Crilly 's analysis but does commend the book for providing " a solid journalistic account of his first - hand experiences in Darfur " .
Aid boom
The book charts his understanding of the conflict 's complexities from his arrival , learning from his resourceful fixer and driver al - Siir the patience to wait for travel permits over sweet glasses of tea , discovering Darfur has some green valleys and orange groves on the bony back of a donkey and learning the legacy of Khartoum 's use of proxy armies when he comes face - to - face with Joseph Kony , the notorious Ugandan rebel leader who still terrorises areas of Southern Sudan .
He notes how Darfur changed over seven years - the region 's cities now have booming economies on the back of UN and aid money and one can now pick up an iPod in el - Fasher market , but the circling Antonov bombers still bring fear to the countryside .
He meets rape victims and rebel leaders , Arab militia who have joined the rebels and Arab fighters who have lost trade routes , former librarians and oil workers who have have given up their careers to fight for what they see as the survival of their communities .
" The war is no longer a conventional war in the sense we 'd understand - that there 's one side against another , " says Crilly .
" It 's banditry , it 's insecurity , it 's fractures within the Arab tribes - they 've turned on each other , there are issues of grazing routes , there are issues of water desertification , " he says .
' Pointless '
It is these nuances that have been ignored by the Save Darfur lobbyists , Crilly says , and led to George Clooney 's impassioned appeal to the UN Security Council in 2006 for the intervention of peacekeepers to save hundreds of thousands of lives .
" A line where peacekeepers could have intervened between two sides has completely broken down into a system of lawlessness resembling something almost like Somalia where the intervention of peacekeepers is pointless , " says Crilly .
Some of the rebel leaders were very much emboldened by the support of this lobby
Rob Crilly
Even many aid workers on the ground and diplomats disagree with the advocacy group 's line .
" There were other organisations talking about other types of solutions but they were basically forced into silence because of their complex relationship with Khartoum . "
But it is not the publicity that celebrities bring that is the problem , he says , rather their agenda .
" My concern is when they get too involved in proposing solutions and they become too wedded to one way of doing things .
" I think that 's a lesson for future coalitions and future advocacy campaigns - we 've already starting to see coalitions for Haiti .
" I think [ it ] is wonderful that people want to have concerts to raise awareness , raise money - but I think they should n't get too bogged down in policy prescriptions because they can run into trouble . "
He blames the Save Darfur Coalition in part for the failure of the 2006 Darfur peace agreement , which only one of the many rebel factions signed up to .
" Some of the rebel leaders were very much emboldened by the support of this lobby and they still believe that the Save Darfur movement can deliver them much greater benefits . "
The rebel groups , for example , want the International Criminal Court to indict Sudan 's Omar al - Bashir on genocide charges - something a diplomat quoted in the book says " would be like arresting Martin McGuinness during the Good Friday negotiations " in Northern Ireland .
Too often the rebels are seen as the only player against Khartoum .
A gathering of all the different communities to discuss their grievances - while it may sound boring - would have the best hope of finding a solution , he says .
" If you understand it as a black and white war between rebels and the government then all these other players are left out of the negotiations and you can't really have peace in Darfur . "

Two suspected poachers have been arrested and a third is believed to have been killed by a lion in the Kruger National Park ( KNP ) last week .
According to the two that got caught , the trio went into the park on the night of March 12 to set up snares to catch animals , KNP spokesman William Mabasa said in a statement on Tuesday .
“ They returned on the night of the 13th to see if they caught anything .
On their way back they came across some hippos , which charged them and they ran in different directions . ”
Two of them got out of the park safely , but got worried when their friend did n’t return by Tuesday .
The two men were arrested in Mkhuhlu village , where they lived , near Hazyview .
They took the police to the spot where they had last seen their accomplice .
“ Some blood and torn clothing were found . ”
Rangers found a human skull in the Pretoriuskop section of the park on Saturday .
It was believed the third man had been caught and eaten by a lion .

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger criticized fellow Republicans on Sunday as being hypocritical when they trash the federal stimulus program , and he dismissed the “ tea party ” movement as “ just an expression of anger and dissatisfaction . ”
Schwarzenegger spoke on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” on which he appeared with Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , a Democrat .
Host Terry Moran played a clip of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2008 , attacking President Obama and saying the stimulus had n’t created any private - sector jobs .
“ I find it interesting that you have a lot of the Republicans running around and pushing back on the stimulus money and saying this does n’t create any new jobs , ” said Schwarzenegger , who has frequently criticized national Republicans , often on Sunday talk shows .
“ And then they go out and they do the photo ops and they are posing with the big check and they say , ‘ Is n’t this great ?
Look what kind of money I provide here for the state .’ . . .
It does n’t match up . ”
Obama made similar comments about the GOP last week .
Schwarzenegger , in Washington for the National Governors Assn. conference , has a private meeting scheduled with Obama on Monday , in which he is expected to seek more federal aid for California .
He urged his party to work with the Democratic president .
“ I do n’t want to beat up on my Republican colleagues , but I think it ’s kind of politics rather than thinking about only one thing , and this is , how do we support the president ? ” he said .
“ How do we support him and do everything we can in order to stimulate the economy ? ”
When Moran asked if the GOP was “ the party of no , ” Schwarzenegger said Republican opposition to Obama was driven by the party ’s desire to win elections .
“ They have to do everything they can in order to win in November , so they are going to say no to everything , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ They are going to say it is not good what Obama is doing .
It is natural . ”
At the same time , he said , Republicans are tapping into voter anger , which is embodied by tea party groups that oppose taxes , illegal immigration and a host of other issues .
But Schwarzenegger suggested the movement is unproductive .
“ The tea party is not going to go anywhere .
I think the tea party is all about just an expression of anger and dissatisfaction , ” he said .
“ And I see it in California when people come up to me and say , ‘ You know I am angry that you guys do n’t get along in Sacramento , I am angry that they are not getting along in Washington , I am angry that nothing gets done , I am angry that I am unemployed , I am angry that people are losing homes , I am angry that businesses are losing their businesses and all of those kind of things and the economy is down . ’ ”

Roach , however , cautioned that hiring may not come that quickly as businesses are still nervous about demand prospects .
" The idea that we can get some spontaneous revival in employment and capex when the consumer is under serious trouble , to me , is really missing a key analytical point to take away from this tough post - crisis climate . "
There is a lot of slack still in the U.S. labor market which puts enormous pressure and uncertainty and fear into American consumers , Roach said .
" The American consumer is in serious trouble given the unemployment , the debt , the low savings , and the lack of income growth , " he added , highlighting that the consumer makes up 71 percent of GDP .
" That 's a key reason to look for a double - dip , " he said , reiterating his view of a 40 percent chance of a double - dip in the next couple of years .
" The demand side is going to be very impaired by the U.S. consumer and there 's no other consumer that is going to fill the void , " Roach continued .
While China and India make up nearly 40 percent of the world 's population , Roach noted that the two countries will not be able to pick - up the slack in U.S. demand collectively , as their consumption adds up to $ 2.5 trillion , which is equivalent to 25 percent of total demand in the United States .
" I think it reflects the extraordinary amount of stimulus that was injected into the equation in the depths of a crisis .
And congratulations to policymakers -- they 've put a bottom on the crisis in the global economy , but again . "
How old is our kernel ?

April 2005 was a bit of a tense time in the kernel development community .
The BitKeeper tool which had done so much to improve the development process had suddenly become unavailable , and it was n't clear what would replace it .
Then Linus appeared with a new system called git ; the current epoch of kernel development can arguably be dated from then .
The opening event of that epoch was commit 1da177e4 , the changelog of which reads :
Initial git repository build .
I 'm not bothering with the full history , even though we have it .
We can create a separate " historical " git archive of that later if we want to , and in the meantime it 's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated , when we do n't have a lot of good infrastructure for it .
Let it rip !
The community did , indeed , let it rip ; some 180,000 changesets have been added to the repository since then .
Typically hundreds of thousands of lines of code are changed with each three - month development cycle .
A while back , your editor began to wonder how much of the kernel had actually been changed , and how much of our 2.6.33 - to - be kernel dates back to 2.6.12 - rc2 , which was tagged at the opening of the git era ?
Was there anything left of the kernel we were building in early 2005 ?
Answering this question is a simple matter of bashing out some ugly scripts and dedicating many hours of processing time .
In essence , the " git blame " command can be used to generate an annotated version of a file which lists the last commit to change each line of code .
Those commit IDs can be summed , then associated with major version releases .
At the end of the process , one has a simple table showing the percentage of the current kernel code base which was created for each major release since 2.6.12 .
Here 's what it looks like :
In summary : just over 41 % 31 % of the kernel tree dates back to 2.6.12 , and has not been modified since then .
Our kernel may be changing quickly , but parts of it have not changed at all for nearly five years .
Since then , we see a steady stream of changes , with more recent kernels being more strongly represented than the older ones .
That curve will partly be a result of the general increase in the rate of change over time ; 2.6.13 had fewer than 4,000 commits , while 2.6.33 will have almost 11,000 .
Still , one has to wonder what happened with 2.6.20 ( 5,000 commits ) to cause that release to represent less than 2 % of the total code base .
Much of the really old material is interspersed with newer lines in many files ; comments and copyright notices , in particular , can go unchanged for a very long time .
The 2.6.12 top - level makefile set VERSION=2 and PATCHLEVEL=6 , and those lines have not changed since ; the next line ( SUBLEVEL=33 ) was changed in December .
There are interesting conclusions to be found at the upper end of the graph as well .
Using this yardstick , 2.6.33 is the smallest development cycle we have seen in the last year , even though this cycle will have replaced some code added during the previous cycles .
4.2 % of the code in 2.6.33 was last touched in the 2.6.33 cycle , while each of the previous four kernels ( 2.6.29 through 2.6.32 ) still represents more than 5.5 % of the code to be shipped in 2.6.33 .
Another interesting exercise is to look for entire files which have not been touched in five years .
Given the amount of general churn and API change which has happened over that time , files which have not changed at all have a good chance of being entirely unused .
Here is a full list of files which are untouched since 2.6.12 - all 1062 of them .
Some conclusions :
Every kernel tarball carries around drivers / char / ChangeLog , which is mostly dedicated to documenting the mid-90's TTY exploits of Ted Ts'o .
There is only one change since 1998 , and that was in 2001 .
Files like this may be interesting from a historical point of view , but they have little relevance to current kernels .
Unsurprisingly , the documentation directory contains a great deal of material which has not been updated in a long time .
Much of it need not change ; the means by which one configures an ISA Sound Blaster card is pretty much as it always was - assuming one can find such a card and an ISA bus to plug it into .
Similarly , Klingon language support ( Documentation /unicode.txt ) , Netwinder support , and such have not seen much development activity recently , so the documentation can be deemed to be current , if not particularly useful .
All told , 41 % of the documentation directory dates back to 2.6.12 .
There was a big surge of documentation work in 2.6.32 ; without that , a larger percentage of this subtree would look quite old .
Some old interfaces have n't changed in a long time , resulting in a lot of static files in include / . < linux / sort.h> declares sort ( ) , which is used in a number of places .
< include/fcdevice.h > declares alloc_fcdev( ) , and includes a warning that " This file will get merged with others RSN . " Much of the sunrpc interface has remained static for a long time as well .
. declares , which is used in a number of places .
declares , and includes a warning that " " Much of the sunrpc interface has remained static for a long time as well .
Ancient code abounds in the driver tree , though , perhaps unsurprisingly , old header files are much more common than old C files .
The ISDN driver tree has been quite static .
Much of sound / oss has not been touched for a long time and must be nicely filled with cobwebs by now ; there has n't been much of a reason to touch the OSS code for some time .
has not been touched for a long time and must be nicely filled with cobwebs by now ; there has n't been much of a reason to touch the OSS code for some time .
net / decnet /TODO
contains a " quick list of things that need finishing off " ; it , too , has n't been changed in the git era .
One wonders how the DECnet hackers are doing on that list ...
So which subsystem is the oldest ?
This plot looks at the kernel subsystems ( as defined by top - level directories ) and gives the percentage of 2.6.12 code in each :
The youngest subsystem , unsurprisingly , is tools / , which did not exist prior to 2.6.29 .
Among subsystems which did exist in 2.6.12 , the core kernel , with about 13 % code dating from that release , is the newest .
At the other end , the sound subsystem is more than 45 % 2.6.12 code - the highest in the kernel .
For those who are curious about the age distribution in specific subsystems , this page contains a chart for each .
In summary : even in a code base which is evolving as rapidly as the kernel , there is a lot of code which has not been touched - even by coding style or white space fixes - in the last five years .
Code stays around for a long time .
( For those who would like to play with this kind of data , the scripts used have been folded into the gitdm repository at git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git ) .
Note : this article has been edited to fix an error which overstated the amount of 2.6.12 code remaining in the full kernel .
If the president 's speech seemed full of vague generalities and not the inspirational partisan battle cry you might have wanted , that 's because the speech was n't really aimed at us , but at independents .
And in that light , it was a resounding success .
From Democracy Corps , a Democratic polling firm :
Democracy Corps conducted dial testing of the speech with 50 independent and weak partisan voters in Nevada , followed by focus group discussions with voters who shifted toward approval of Obama ’s performance in office .
This difficult audience for Obama was a heavily Republican - leaning group ( 46 percent Republican , 20 percent Democratic ) that split their votes in 2008 ( 52 percent Obama , 46 percent McCain ) but had moved away from him over the past year , with majorities expressing disapproval with his job performance and unfavorable views of him on a personal level .
Obama saw a substantial , but not overwhelming , spike in his overall numbers with his personal favorability rating and job approval both increasing by 16 points .
But his speech drove much bigger shifts among these initially skeptical swing voters on several key issues .
Most important , Obama managed to decisively reverse the view that he was too close to Wall Street .
In a Democracy Corps survey from just before the Massachusetts election , we found that a 49 to 41 percent plurality said Obama and Democrats were more concerned with bailouts for Wall Street than creating jobs for regular Americans .
Entering the evening , swing voters in this group agreed with a 48 to 16 percent plurality saying Obama “ puts Wall Street ahead of the middle class . ”
But after the speech , the number disagreeing with that statement jumped a remarkable 50 points , to 66 percent .
Moreover , Obama saw a 38 - point increase in support for his banking reform plan and a 40 - point increase in the percent saying that he “ stands up to special interests . ”
Obama ’s strong words for the banks clearly resonated and generated some of the strongest scores on our dials of the night from Democrats , Republicans and independents .
[...]
For these voters whose attitudes shifted from disapproval to approval of Obama ’s performance as president , one consistent question remained : can he deliver ?
Unlike most attributes that shifted during the speech , “ promises things that sound good but wo n’t be able get them done ” remained very high ( 78 percent pre-speech to 74 percent post - speech ) .
The “ shifters ” in these post - speech focus groups are waiting for results , and they pointed specifically to passing health care reform and job creation initiatives as critical reforms that must be delivered .
While they see the Republicans as obstructing every Obama initiative , they nonetheless expect Democrats to pass major legislation with their large majorities .
AP
A WEEK ago , Americans were told that their economy had expanded for a second consecutive quarter , and rapidly at that : output grew at an annual rate of 5.7 % .
This week , they are reminded that a return to growth has yet to benefit the jobless .
The economy lost 20,000 jobs in January , a decline driven by the loss of 75,000 jobs in the construction sector .
Economists had forecast an increase in employment of around 15,000 .
The unemployment rate , based on household rather than establishment data , showed a slight improvement , dropping from 10 % to 9.7 % , but nearly 15 m Americans remain unemployed .
As Larry Summers put it in Davos last week , the American economy is experiencing “ a statistical recovery and a human recession ” .
Several positive trends continued in January .
Firms added 52,000 temporary workers and increased hours , just as they did in December , hinting at growing if cautious optimism .
Employment rose in health , education and professional services , and retail employment grew by 42,000 in January , on a seasonally adjusted basis , after declining in December .
Manufacturing employment also grew , by 11,000 , the first increase since the beginning of recession .
Analysts point out that the adjustment of the data is tricky around the holiday season , and actual underlying employment may have grown in January .
But many economists may view this release as more disappointing than the previous month 's figure .
The Labour Department published the results of its annual benchmark revision of previous employment data .
Through the 12 months to March 2009 , the American economy lost 930,000 more jobs than had been previously estimated .
It now appears that over 700,000 jobs were lost in each of the first three months of last year , a significantly worse performance than originally thought .
Meanwhile , data for the last two months of 2009 were revised to show a larger increase in employment in November , but a larger decline in December , for a net drop of 5,000 jobs relative to previous reports .
And while the employment - population ratio increased slightly from December to January , and off record lows , the problem of the long - term unemployed continues to grow .
Just over 41 % of all unemployed workers , over 6.3 m workers , have been out of work for 27 weeks or more .
Most troubling of all is the continued failure of economic growth to benefit the labour market .
Employment fell by over 300,000 jobs during the last three months of 2009 , despite strong expansion in GDP .
The first quarter of 2010 is unlikely to show as big an output gain , suggesting that the pace of improvement in employment may be slowing , even as regular job growth has yet to return .
And the situation may be more dire still ; initial jobless claims have grown in recent weeks , indicating that what momentum there was in labour markets has been lost .
The January data will increase the pressure on the Senate to pass a jobs bill .
The House of Representatives assented in December to a measure designed to boost hiring , worth $ 154 billion , and the president outlined a number of policies to encourage employers to hire in his state - of - the - union address and budget proposal .
At the centre of the package is a $ 33 billion tax credit , available to firms that add employees or increase hours or wages .
The policy may be just the kick firms need to take on new help .
In the fourth quarter , labour productivity rose by 6.2 % as businesses expanded output while maintaining lean payrolls .
The government will hope to provide an incentive to begin handling rising orders with new workers , who will then use their earnings to shore up consumption and the recovery as a whole .
But with the revelation that labour markets early last year were far weaker than expected and the growing indications that the recovery will be jobless , the country 's leaders may be wishing they had done more to boost the economy sooner .
The longer it takes to achieve steady job creation , the more uncertain recovery will become .
Roundabouts are n't great for high - volume locations .
This new design , called the " Vortex Junction , " handles a plethora of intersections and many , many plethora of cars in a simple , ingenious layout .
The future of grandma - and - Griswold - confusing intersections , below .
Advertisement
Roundabouts work great in low traffic volume areas because the number of vehicles in the intersection at one time is low .
They eliminate traffic stops like signs or lights and allow traffic to move smoothly .
When they 're installed in high traffic areas , roundabouts can become a nightmare .
The trouble with roundabouts , especially big ones , is drivers are always jockeying for position along the outside lane since there are always vehicles entering into , in the intersection and attempting to exit along the outer diameter .
This is a problem the Vortex Junction solves .
Advertisement
In the Vortex , traffic entering the intersection uses the outside lane , then transitions to the inside exit lane , which then transition to an off ramp and either goes over or under the circular lane .
It eliminates the trouble of entering motorists fighting exiting motorists for position , and vice versa .
It has several benefits , first , it can efficiently handle many incoming roadways from any approach angle , it cuts down on the number and size of stacked spaghetti- type intersection bridges while keeping most of the infrastructure on the ground , plus , relative to the big monstrosities in some freeway intersections , it 's relatively cheap .
Another happy benefit is a use - able center section which could be prime places for things like sports stadiums or convention centers which generate spikes in traffic .
As far as we know , there are no plans to build any of these intersections at this point , but the designs Japanese creators are shopping it around to cities and countries trying to license the Vortex .
We 'd be interested to test over - and understeer on those decreasing radii . [ Yet2 ]
China Internet Network Information Center accepted as a Mozilla root CA
[ Security ] Posted Feb 2 , 2010 15:24 UTC ( Tue ) by corbet
Those who are concerned about the security of Mozilla 's SSL certificate validation might want to take a look at this bugzilla entry .
It seems that , at the end of October , Mozilla approved the addition of the China Internet Network Information Center ( CNNIC ) as a root certification authority , meaning that Firefox will accept CNNIC - signed certificates as valid and fully trusted .
CNNIC is said to be controlled by the Chinese government and is alleged to be heavily involved in spying on Chinese citizens ; numerous people are concerned that it will use its root CA position to facilitate man - in - the - middle attacks .
Unfortunately , most of these concerns were not raised during the discussion period , making the removal of CNNIC - if warranted - harder .

On his radio show today , the unstable Glenn Beck was discussing health care reform with bat poop crazy Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) and they both came to the interesting conclusion that health care reform is an affront to the conservative sensibilities of God , because the vote may be held on Sunday .
Beck said , “ Here is a group of people that have so perverted our faith and our hope and our charity , that is a this is an affront to God . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
King said , “ They intend to vote on the Sabbath during Lent to take away the liberty that we have right from God . ”
Beck then went off , “ Steve , you are a religious man ?
Thank you for pointing this out .
I thought of this the other day because I have been saying faith , hope , and charity .
Faith has been perverted , and our hope , they are trying to sell this hope that we ’ll have faith in the government that they ’ll be charitable , and I thought they are going to vote this damn thing on a Sunday , which is the Sabbath , during Lent .
You could n’t have said it better .
Here is a group of people that have so perverted our faith and our hope and our charity , that is a , this is an affront to God .
And I honestly , I do n’t think anybody is like , “ yes , and now what we ’ll do is we ’ll vote on the Sabbath . ”
But I think it ’s absolutely appropriate that these people are trying to put the nail in the coffin on our country on a Sunday — something our founders would have never , ever , ever done .
Out of respect for God . ”
It so pathetic that the only defense that King and Beck can mount is that they are upset because the vote might be held on a Sunday .
If that is n’t a huge admission of defeat , then I do n’t know what is .
It is n’t like Republicans have ever passed any bills on Sundays .
As Think Progress pointed out , it was on Palm Sunday in 2005 when the Republican controlled Senate passed the bill that allowed the federal court to intervene in the Terri Schiavo , which one could argue was a true affront to God .
Once again , Beck implied that the Founding Fathers all held the same views and Christian beliefs that he does .
This is not true .
It is sad to watch these right wingers try to exploit the religious views of so many Americans for their own political gain .
Would it still be an affront to God if the House passed a bill relating to school prayer on a Sunday ?
I do n’t think Beck would be outraged about that .
This is GOP 101 .
When all else fails call in the religious right and hope that they will save the day , but this time not even the God freaks can keep the House from doing what is right .

The year is 1975 .
Gerald Ford is in the White House , South Vietnam falls , Muhammad Ali defeats Joe Frazier in the “ Thrilla in Manila ” world championship boxing match , the late - night comedy show NBC ’s Saturday Night ( later called Saturday Night Live ) debuts , One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest sweeps the Oscars , and Captain & Tennille ’s “ Love Will Keep Us Together ” and Glenn Campbell ’s “ Rhinestone Cowboy ” top the music charts .
And in Albuquerque , N.M. , Harvard dropout Bill Gates and his high school friend Paul Allen set up a tiny business to write software for a new microcomputer called the Altair 8800 .
Their first product is the Altair BASIC language .
At some point during that year , the company is called Micro - soft , and then MicroSoft , before it is ultimately named Microsoft .
From those modest beginnings , that company went on to help give birth to an entire industry , change the way we live and work , and become one of the largest software companies on the planet , creating countless millionaires — and several billionaires — along the way .
As Microsoft celebrates its 35th anniversary , I ’ve decided to take an idiosyncratic and opinionated look at the best , worst and most notable moments , technologies , products , decisions and people in the company ’s history .
A lot has happened in that time , so if you think I ’ve left anything out or disagree with my choices , share your thoughts in the article comments .
Now , step into the Wayback Machine and read on .
Savviest business deal
In November 1980 , Microsoft signed an agreement with IBM to provide an operating system for the still - secret IBM Personal Computer , to be released in 1981 .
The operating system would ultimately be called PC - DOS , a rebranding of Microsoft ’s MS - DOS .
Microsoft did n’t actually write MS - DOS ; instead it paid to have Seattle Computer rewrite its own QDOS ( Quick - and - Dirty Operating System ) for the purpose , without telling Seattle Computer to whom the operating system would be sold .
( Microsoft signed the contract with Seattle Computer one day after signing the contract with IBM . )
QDOS was largely based on the CP / M operating system , owned by Digital Research .
Ironically , IBM had originally turned to Digital Research for an operating system for the IBM PC , but the two companies ’ negotiations broke down .
Too bad for Digital Research ; Microsoft went on to use its relationship with IBM as a springboard to develop its worldwide dominance in business operating systems .
Smartest acquisition
In July 1987 , Microsoft bought Forethought Inc. for $ 14 million in cash .
Forethought had developed a presentation program for the Macintosh , initially called Presenter , which it renamed PowerPoint for trademark reasons .
PowerPoint later became one of the core programs of Microsoft Office , which for many years has been the dominant office productivity suite .
Prickliest partnership
In August 1985 , Microsoft and IBM signed a deal to partner in the development of an advanced operating system called OS / 2 .
The operating system never achieved the widespread popularity of DOS — or , later on , Windows — and became a bone of contention between Microsoft and IBM .
Microsoft devoted most of its development resources to Windows and Windows NT , rather than OS / 2 , and ultimately abandoned OS / 2 to IBM , which eventually abandoned it as well .
Most surprising investment
In August 1997 , longtime Microsoft rival Apple Computer was teetering on the brink of disaster and in desperate need of cash .
Microsoft rode to the rescue , buying $ 150 million in nonvoting Apple stock .
As part of the deal , Microsoft agreed to continue to develop Microsoft Office for the Mac , and Apple agreed to bundle Internet Explorer with the Mac OS operating system as the default browser .
Both parts of the agreement have since fallen by the wayside : IE for the Mac is gone , and although Microsoft continues to update Office for the Mac ( usually some time after the Windows version is updated ) , it is n’t required to do so .
Most prophetic memo
In February 1976 , Gates issued a public letter berating people who were freely distributing tapes of the version of BASIC he and Paul Allen wrote for the Altair , without paying Microsoft for them .
Here are excerpts from Gates ’
“ An Open Letter to Hobbyists , ” sent to the Homebrew Computer Club :
The amount of royalties we have received from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent of Altair BASIC worth less than $ 2 an hour .
As the majority of hobbyists must be aware , most of you steal your software … .
Who cares if the people who work on it get paid ?
Who can afford to do professional work for nothing ?
What hobbyist can put 3 man years into programming , finding all bugs , documenting his product and distribute for free ?
Although the term open source had n’t been coined at the time , this letter set the stage for Gates ’ career - long battle with open - source and free software advocates .
Most beloved OS
Two operating systems stand out in Microsoft ’s long history as having more than their share of fans : MS - DOS 5 and Windows XP .
Released in 1991 , MS - DOS 5 was stable , fixed the worst problems of its notoriously buggy predecessor , MS - DOS 4 , and for the first time broke the 640 K memory barrier for DOS , allowing memory beyond that to be used for programs , drivers and so - called Terminate and Stay Resident ( TSR ) programs .
With 2001 ’s Windows XP , Microsoft finally merged its consumer and business lines of Windows , essentially building a consumer - oriented operating system on top of the stable Windows NT kernel .
It also finally stopped using DOS as the base operating system , making Windows XP far more stable and reliable than previous versions of Windows .
Some people believe XP was too much of a success , because Microsoft has had a hard time getting people to give it up for newer Windows versions .
Which is the most beloved ?
I ’ll give the nod to Windows XP .
MS - DOS 5 , as good as it was , ultimately led to a dead end — it was the best operating system in a line that eventually died out .
Windows XP , in contrast , lives on not only on many people ’s computers , but in the heart of Windows 7 , which still retains its predecessor ’s merged business and consumer lines .
Most reviled OS
Here you ’ve got to choose among an unholy trifecta of MS - DOS 4 , Windows Me and Windows Vista .
Released in 1988 , MS - DOS 4 was notoriously buggy , and many applications refused to run on it .
Users commonly reverted to MS - DOS 3.3 or jumped ship to Digital Research ’s DR - DOS 3.41 to avoid MS - DOS 4 , Microsoft ’s first serious misstep in operating systems .
Windows
Me , released in 2000 , was buggy as well , and plagued by installation problems and a plethora of hardware and software incompatibilities .
But I give the “ most reviled ” crown to 2006 ’s Windows Vista , which proved to be far more of a fiasco than Windows Me or MS - DOS 4 .
The five - year gap between the release of XP and Vista was the longest gap between versions of Windows ever , so people had high expectations for Vista .
Unfortunately , it was bedeviled by hardware incompatibilities at launch , it would n’t run on older hardware , and many people disliked its resource - hungry user interface .
Making matters worse , many PCs that were tagged as “ Vista Capable ” could n’t run the full version of the operating system — a situation that led to a class - action lawsuit against Microsoft .
Best follow - up OS
Again we ’ve got a toss - up here , between DOS 5 , which fixed DOS 4 ’s many problems , and Windows 7 , which cured Vista’s .
I ’ll choose Windows 7 , which is the OS that many people believe Windows Vista should have been .
It is faster than Vista , does not have the same hardware incompatibilities , dumps some useless applications , and delivers some nice tweaks , including an innovative , much - improved taskbar .
The proof is in the pudding : Both businesses and consumers are finally beginning to let go of nine - year - old XP and make the jump to Windows 7 .
Furthest - reaching OS
In July 1993 , Microsoft launched Windows NT .
Designed for businesses rather than consumers , NT was constructed from the ground up , not built on top of DOS as previous versions of Windows had been .
More stable and more secure than Windows 3.1 , NT was the first completely 32 - bit version of Windows .
Its first release
Excel fun fact
When Excel was first developed , Microsoft already had a spreadsheet called MultiPlan , but it was not selling well on the MS - DOS platform .
The company decided it needed a much better offering to compete against Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , the best - selling spreadsheet program at the time .
Thus , Excel was originally code - named “ Odyssey ” because it was intended to eat Lotus .
( In Homer ’s The Odyssey , Odysseus ’ crew members ate the narcotic lotus plant in the Land of the Lotus . )
Microsoft ’s bundling of Word , Excel and PowerPoint into the Office suite emphasized the company ’s commitment to business desktop computing .
It proved to be a huge success , ultimately leading to the downfall of onetime market - leading applications Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 ( spreadsheet ) , WordPerfect ( word processor ) and Harvard Graphics ( presentation program ) — and to a near - monopoly for Microsoft Office in the business world .
Sneakiest software bundling
I ’ll give the award for sneakiest software bundling , hands - down , to Windows Genuine Advantage ( WGA ) , Microsoft ’s antipiracy software .
WGA warns people when they do not have a paid - for and registered version of Windows , and certain updates ca n’t be installed unless WGA is installed and has verified that the copy of Windows is genuine .
In mid-2006 , Microsoft began sending WGA to users ’ computers along with security updates via Windows Update ; the company even labeled the WGA download as “ high - priority . ”
Unbeknownst to users , though , the update had nothing to do with security or stability — it was WGA , sneaking onto their hard disks .
As Computerworld ‘s own Scot Finnie wrote in July of 2006 , “ Microsoft is preying upon people ’s ignorance — and their strong desire to install security updates .
It ’s clearly wrong for Microsoft to use its security updating channel to install software that has no security benefit , and no benefit at all to its customers . ”
Users were frustrated enough that a lawsuit was filed , although the suit was recently dismissed in federal court .
Worst server glitch
As if users were n’t annoyed enough about Windows Genuine Advantage , from Aug. 24 to 25 , 2007 , the antipiracy validation system accused thousands of paying Windows XP and Vista customers of being software pirates .
According to Microsoft , the WGA servers went on the fritz , and users were tagged as running non-genuine versions of Windows .
Even worse , Vista systems were stripped of important features , such as the Aero interface .
The meltdown lasted for 19 hours .
Most embarrassing product glitch
When you use formulas in Excel , you expect them to do the math correctly — after all , what is a spreadsheet for ?
But in September 2007 , an Excel 2007 bug had Microsoft execs red-faced with embarrassment because of an apparent inability to do simple multiplication .
In some specific cases , if a formula resulted in the number 65,535 or 65,536 , Excel would instead display the result 100,000 .
The problem , according to Microsoft , was not that Excel flunked math ; it was a display issue .
Excel actually performed and stored the calculation properly , the company claimed , but displayed the wrong results .
Microsoft fixed the bug , and Excel has known its multiplication tables — and how to display them — ever since .
Smallest annual revenue
In 1975 , its first year in business , Microsoft recorded a total income of $ 16,005 , all from the BASIC program it wrote for the MITS Altair 8800 computer .
The total did not include US $ 14,405 that Microsoft was still owed for the final quarter of 1975 .
Largest annual revenue
In its 2008 fiscal year , Microsoft raked in US $ 60.42 billion in revenue , a whopping 18 per cent increase over what it had earned the previous year .
Worst year - over - year performance
Microsoft has turned a profit every year since its founding , and it enjoyed year - over - year increases in revenue and profits every year … until 2009 .
For its 2009 fiscal year , which ended June 30 , 2009 , the company reported revenue of US $ 58.44 billion , a three per cent decline from fiscal year 2008 .
Its operating income was US $ 20.36 billion , down nine per cent from 2008 ; net income was US $ 14.57 billion , down 18 per cent ; and earnings per share was YS $ 1.62 , down 13 per cent .
Most annoying productivity tool
In November 1996 , Microsoft launched Office 97 , which featured the Office Assistant , an animated character in the form of a paper clip nicknamed Clippy .
( There were other characters as well , but Clippy was the default and the most annoying . )
The Office Assistant was supposed to help people get work done more easily by popping onto the screen and offering tips from the application ’s Help system related to the task being performed .
It was intrusive , intensely annoying and widely reviled .
Even people within Microsoft hated Clippy .
Steven Sinofsky , now president of the Windows and Windows Live Division , wrote this in his blog : “ the Office Assistant was famously named TFC during development .
The ‘ C ’ stood for clown .
I will let your active imagination figure out what the TF stood for . ”
In fact , Microsoft used the widespread hatred of Clippy to its advantage by launching an anti-Clippy Web site as a way to promote Office 97 ’s successor , Office XP , because Office XP had the Office Assistant turned off by default .
The site received some 22 million page views , according to USA Today , and allowed users to do things such as shoot rubber bands at the hated animated character .
Best productivity booster
In March 2006 , Microsoft released Office 2007 , which featured a brand new interface .
Gone were the familiar menus and toolbars , replaced by the Ribbon , which put the most commonly used commands on a series of tabbed panels .
Although some people hate the Ribbon , many users ( including some Computerworld editors ) find it easier to use than the old interface once they ’ve gotten used to it .
Microsoft claims that research shows that the ribbon is a productivity booster — so much so that the company has decided to incorporate elements of it throughout its entire product line , including the Windows operating system itself .
Most inexplicable advertising campaign
Microsoft has spent untold millions of dollars on advertising through the years , but one campaign stands out above them all for its sheer incomprehensibility — the series of ads in which the odd couple of Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld do mundane things such as search for cheap shoes at a bargain basement discount store and annoy a family for no apparent reason .
Launched in September 2008 , these ads were widely criticized in the advertising and tech worlds .
They lasted only a brief time ; Microsoft was smart enough to can them quickly .
Most effective advertising campaign
Microsoft clearly learned from the Seinfeld ad fiasco , because the company in early 2009 followed that campaign with what may have been its most effective series of ads — the Laptop Hunter commercials .
The ads portrayed attractive , personable young people searching for laptops and buying Windows - based machines because they found them to be more powerful and less expensive than Macs .
The ads hit Apple where it hurt , on price , at a time when the economy was tanking .
The image - measuring firm BrandIndex found that the campaign raised Microsoft ’s ranking of value perception among 18 - to - 34 - year - olds from zero to 46.2 in a few months , while Apple ’s plummeted from 70 to 12.4 in the same time period .
( The highest possible value was 100 . )
Most underwhelming product launch
Windows 1.0 ’s release registered as barely a blip on the computing world ’s radar .
Begun in 1981 and initially dubbed “ Interface Manager , ” Microsoft ’s first graphical operating system was announced in 1983 but not released until 1985 .
It did n’t run as a stand - alone operating system ; instead , users had to launch it from within DOS .
And by the
Worst interface
Go to any list of the worst software ever written , and 1995 ’s Microsoft Bob will be on it .
Designed for Windows 3.1 and later Windows 95 , it was supposed to be a user - friendly interface to help non-techies use computers .
Instead , it was so cloyingly cute that , in comparison , photos of big - eyed puppies appear to be deep and meaningful .
( As Harry McCracken wrote in a PC World review , “ It seems to be aimed at a six - year - old who has personal finances to manage . ” )
Bob was also confusing to navigate ; sucked up system resources , reducing computers to a crawl ; and was widely derided in the general and tech press .
Users stayed away in droves .
Microsoft Bob was overseen for a time by Melinda French , who was Bill Gates ’ girlfriend at the time and later became his wife .
Smartest market targeting
Microsoft ’s earliest products were for individual users , rather than for IT departments , but the company knew that ultimately it would have to sell products aimed at enterprises if it wanted to thrive .
On June 11 , 1996 , the company launched Microsoft Exchange Server , which was originally written to handle Microsoft ’s internal e-mail .
( Previously the company used a Xenix - based e-mail system . )
Exchange Server was first released as Version 4.0 , apparently to continue the numbering convention of the earlier Microsoft Mail product , which was at Version 3.5 .
Exchange has since expanded to include other communications functions such as mobile device syncing and e-mail / voice - mail consolidation , and it has become a cornerstone of corporate IT departments .
Best hire
Love him or loathe him , there is no doubt that Steve Ballmer ’s hard - driving , relentless style and laser focus through the years have helped Microsoft become the world ’s most successful software company .
Ballmer , who knew Gates from their Harvard days , came to Microsoft in June 1980 as one of the young company ’s few employees with real - world business experience .
He had worked for Procter & Gamble after graduation and had attended Stanford Business School for one year before joining Microsoft .
Worst waste of visionary talent
Ray Ozzie is one of the technology industry ’s true visionaries .
He worked on the first spreadsheet , VisiCalc , and developed the Lotus Symphony office suite .
And that was only the prelude :
He launched Iris Associates , which developed the software that would become Lotus Notes , and later Groove Networks , which developed the collaboration software Groove Virtual Office ( now called Microsoft Office Groove ) .
In April of 2005 , Microsoft bought Groove and Ozzie became Microsoft ’s chief technical officer .
In June 2006 , he was promoted to chief software architect , a title previously held by Bill Gates .
Many industry watchers had high hopes for Ozzie ’s influence at Microsoft , but he has done little to change the company ’s direction , software or culture , particularly when it comes to his specialty , collaboration .
Beyond adding Groove to the Office suite , Microsoft has done little to develop it , sell it or make it central to the company ’s strategy .
The upcoming version of Office for the Web does n’t even have basic synchronization features , and the “ Live ” brand is a mess , consisting of an odd mishmash of downloadable software and Web - based services , with no real connection between them .
Why has n’t Ozzie made his mark ?
Some people ( including yours truly ) postulate that there ’s a dog - eat - dog culture at Microsoft , with too many people protecting too much turf , and he ’s never managed to adapt .
Weirdest company spokesperson
Most companies like their public faces to be sober , measured and thoughtful — but then , most companies do n’t have Steve Ballmer at the helm .
Although he ’s been a boon for the company overall , Ballmer has also been prone to public fits of behavior that at times appear to channel Pee Wee Herman on acid .
The most well - known of these is the infamous “ Monkey Boy dance ” in which , center stage at a conference , Ballmer danced , howled , screamed and generally acted the madman to show his enthusiasm for Microsoft .
Another YouTube favorite is the “ Developers ” video , which captured him soaked with sweat , screaming “ Developers , developers , developers , developers … ” until his voice gave out .
Best company spokesperson
Bill Gates — his geekiness and intelligence eventually won over the press , and he became a near - ubiquitous magazine cover boy before his retirement in June 2008 .
Worst PR disaster
In February 2008 , extremely embarrassing internal documents were released in what ’s known as the Vista “ junk PC ” lawsuit .
The class - action suit against Microsoft charged that the company misled consumers into buying Windows XP computers that were marked “ Windows Vista Capable ” — even though those PCs could n’t run the most important features of the then - new operating system .
Over several months , internal Microsoft documents became part of the suit , including one from an unnamed employee , who wrote in an e-mail , “ Even a piece of junk will qualify ” to be called Windows Vista - capable .
And in another e-mail message , Mike Nash , who is now a corporate vice - president for Windows product strategy , wrote , “ I PERSONALLY got burnt … .
Are we seeing this from a lot of customers ?…
I now have a US $ 2,100 e-mail machine . ”
Jim Allchin , who at the time of the Vista - capable PC push was the co-president of Microsoft ’s Platforms and Services Division , wrote in an e-mail , “ We really botched this … .
You guys have to do a better job with our customers . ”
Later e-mails revealed that Microsoft may have launched the marketing scheme in order to help Intel sell low - end chips that were not capable of running the full version of Vista .
Most stunning court decision
On April 3 , 2000 , a U.S. federal court ordered that Microsoft be split up .
As a result of an antitrust suit filed in 1998 by the U.S. Justice Department , Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered that Microsoft be broken up into two companies : one that would develop and sell operating systems , and another that would handle other types of software .
This followed Jackson ’s Nov. 5 , 1999 , findings of fact in which he declared Microsoft a monopoly that used its power to attempt to destroy perceived threats from competing companies , including Netscape , Apple , Sun , Lotus and others .
The court ’s breakup order ultimately did not stand .
Most favorable court decision
This one ’s a toss - up between two very big decisions .
First up is a US $ 5.5 billion suit filed in 1988 by Apple against Microsoft and Hewlett - Packard alleging that Windows violated the “ look and feel ” of the Mac operating system .
Over the years , the lawsuit was whittled down by a variety of courts , and on June 1 , 1993 , Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker issued a summary judgment against Apple and in Microsoft ’s favor .
That was certainly a significant decision , but it ultimately would not have affected the way in which Microsoft did business —
Microsoft could have simply paid Apple royalties and continued on its merry way .
An even more important decision for Microsoft happened on June 28 , 2001 , when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ’s 2000 order to break up Microsoft .
Despite the overturning of Jackson ’s ruling , his findings of fact remained intact , and the case against Microsoft continued dragging on through the courts until 2002 .
Biggest relief
On Nov. 1 , 2002 , the Department of Justice and Microsoft settled the antitrust case against Microsoft .
The complex agreement required that Microsoft share its application programming interfaces ( API ) with other companies and take a variety of other steps to curb anticompetitive behavior .
However , Microsoft was allowed to stay intact as a single company .
Worst moment in international relations

Decline in 2009 personal income reveals impoverishment of US population
By David Walsh
27 March 2010
Figures released by the US Commerce Department Thursday highlight the continuing decline in living standards for wide layers of the population , suffering from the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression .
The Commerce Department ’s Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) reported earlier this month that personal income in the US declined 1.7 percent in 2009 .
The Associated Press noted that this was “ the weakest showing since the Great Depression year of 1938 , when incomes had fallen 7.7 percent . ”
The decline in personal income is the first in the US since 1949 .
The Commerce Department statistics issued Thursday focused on state - by - state conditions .
The average decline in state personal income was also 1.7 percent , ranging from a decline in Nevada of 4.8 percent , to a gain in West Virginia of 2.1 percent .
In total , the populations of 42 American states suffered personal income losses in 2009 , while two states experienced no change and six , plus the District of Columbia , enjoyed gains .
California , once a beacon of economic and social progress , is undergoing a startling transformation .
Personal income in the state fell 2.5 percent in 2009 , the first decline since the Depression .
As the San Francisco Chronicle commented , “ State income plunged even more sharply in 2009 than the similar , historic drop that occurred on a national basis , a notable reversal given that California generally has beaten the national averages throughout the 80 - year history of this report . ”
The drop in statewide personal income , reports the Chronicle , “ works out to $ 1,527 fewer dollars for every man , woman and child in California . ”
The newspaper notes that prior to 2009 , personal income in the state had only fallen five times since 1929 , when such records were first kept .
In the 80 years covered by federal records , personal income in California has increased by an average of 7.3 percent .
Economic analyst Jon Haveman with Beacon Economics in San Rafael , California , told the San Francisco daily that “ the figures confirm that this has been the worst downturn since the 1930s . ”
The pain has been widely felt , he noted , adding , “ What we ’re seeing is a decline in income among the middle and lower classes . ”
This decline in income of the working population is taking place across the US .
As the BEA observes , the personal income decline in a given state in 2009 corresponded to its distinctive economy .
In Nevada , which experienced “ the second largest decline among states since 1969 , ” the drop - off is most accounted for by a decline in construction and the accommodations industry ( including casino hotels ) .
“ The biggest contributors to Wyoming ’s 3.9 percent personal income decline , ” explains the Bureau , “ were mining ( including oil and gas extraction ) and construction .
In New York , where personal income fell 3.4 percent , the earnings losses were primarily concentrated in the finance industry .
The biggest earnings decline in Connecticut was also in the finance industry , but manufacturing and construction declined almost as much .
Michigan ’s 3.0 percent personal income decline reflected large losses in durable goods manufacturing . ”
If personal income in Michigan fell at a slightly lower rate than some of the worst - hit states , it is only because the sharp decline in personal income began years ago .
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy points out that “ Michigan ’s per capita GDP fell from 19th to 41st between 2000 and 2008 — a precipitous drop from one of the 20 most productive states to one of the 10 least productive in less than a decade . ”
Overall , Michigan , which once had the highest industrial wages in the US , is currently ranked 37th in per capita personal income .
Transfer payments , largely consisting of social assistance programs , miserly as they are , “ now account for 22 percent of all income in the state .
Without them , Michigan drops to 41st among the states in per capita personal income . ”
Per capita income in industrial Ohio fell 1.4 percent in 2009 , a loss of $ 508 per resident , and personal income in the state declined $ 19.8 billion , writes the Toledo Blade , “ as the recession wreaked havoc on the economies of the Great Lakes states . ”
In Illinois , another Great Lakes state , personal income fell 2.1 percent , “ with durable goods and construction showing the biggest losses , ” according to one news report .
Tennessee residents experienced a decline in personal income “ for the first time in 60 years , ” according to the Tennessean.com website .
“ ‘ Until last year , personal income had grown in Tennessee and nationally every year since 1949 , ’ said Kathy Albetski , chief of the analysis bureau ’s Regional Economic Information System .
“ ‘ People are not working , they ’re working fewer hours , people are taking jobs with lesser income — it ’s a combination of those things , ’ Albetski said . ”
Floridians lost 2.7 percent of their personal income in 2009 , or some $ 20 billion , from the year before , and the once - booming state was ranked near the bottom nationally in income growth ; the state rated last in the southeast and 43rd in the country .
Sharp declines in construction and manufacturing were primarily responsible .
Responding to the news that Alabama residents saw a 1 percent decline in personal income last year , Keivan Deravi , an Auburn University - Montgomery economist , told the Mobile Press - Register that “ 2009 was the first decline in personal income that he could find in at least 25 years , and he ’s unsure whether projected gains this year can make up the lost ground .
‘ The trough in 2009 was so deep , ’ Deravi said .
‘ We need to be bouncing pretty good in 2010 just to get back to the trend line . ’ ”
In Oklahoma , personal income fell 0.8 percent , of $ 1.1 billion .
The Tulsa World cited the comments of David Lenze , an economist with the US Commerce Department : “ The story for most states is one of decline , and when I look at Oklahoma the big thing is mining and reflecting the fact that prices were falling last year … .
But even bigger was the decline in manufacturing . ”
So the story goes , state by state .
In South Dakota , “ [ P]ersonal income dropped 3.5 percent in 2009 , more than twice the nationwide average decline of 1.7 percent , according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis , with farmers taking the brunt of that slide . ”
Meanwhile , the financial and corporate elite continue to plunder the economy , becoming ever wealthier .
Income inequality is at its highest point in decades , and the US is now home to 403 billionaires , according to Forbes magazine , who between them control 8 percent of the national wealth , while representing 0.00014 percent of the nation ’s population .

19 Dogs Can Feel Both Simple and Complex Emotions 20 Dogs Exhibit Behavior Linked to Ancient Nesting Instincts 21 Dog Facts – Facts about Dogs Summary
Dogs Are Smarter than You Think Dog facts reveal that dogs are highly intelligent !
They are able to understand up to around 250 spoken words , and can understand mathematical calculations .
Some stray Russian dogs were even observed to have figured out the subway system , working out how to get to places with food they could scavenge !
Dogs have a certain degree of emotional intelligence too and can pick up on their owners ’ moods .
Some people even believe that their dogs can detect weather patterns .
The average dog is believed to have the intelligence of a 2 - year - old child .
There Are Hundreds of Types of Dogs
There are hundreds of different kinds of dog breeds in the world and even more hybrids of different breeds .
Each breed has its own distinctive traits and personality .
An Afghan Hound , for example , is supposed to be intelligent , loyal and just a little bit aloof , while a Norfolk Terrier is friendly , sociable and loves to have fun .
While most breeds are domesticated , dog facts teach us that some canines are used for herding ( like the Australian Shepherd ) and others , like the English Setter , are used for sports .
Dogs Can Be More Mature than Humans
We all know that dogs age faster than us – but did you know that a 1 - year - old dog is as mature as a 15 - year - old human ?
In general , dog aging mimics the stages of a human ’s development .
Puppies are fun-loving and a bit crazy , while adolescent dogs are prone to being moody and unpredictable .
Adult dogs tend to be quite confident , while older dogs get tired more easily and enjoy naps .
Smaller dogs mature faster than larger dogs and they also live longer .

Dogs Can Run at Speeds of up to 45 mph Greyhounds win the prize for being the fastest dogs on Earth : they are able to run at speeds up to 45 miles per hour .
Interestingly , there are indications in tombs that Greyhounds were kept by the Ancient Egyptians .
Other speedy dog breeds include the Hungarian Vizsla , the Doberman Pinscher and , perhaps more surprisingly , the Jack Russell Terrier .
When it comes to other activities dogs excel at , Newfoundlands are great swimmers – they even have webbed feet designed to make them faster in water , a bit like ducks .
Every Dog Has a Unique Nose Print
If you think many dogs look the same , think again .
One of the most fascinating dog facts reveals that a dog ’s nose print is as unique a pattern as a human ’s fingerprint .
If you take a magnifying glass and look closely at a dog ’s nose , you will see a series of bumps and ridges that are completely different than any other pet .
Cats also display this unique characteristic .
You could try taking a paper print of this special nose print if your pet will let you !
Dogs Really Are a Man ’s Best Friend
There is a special relationship between human beings and their dogs , perhaps unlike that of any other pet .
Humans have kept dogs as pets for over 12,000 years .
Many people talk to their dogs ; some people are entirely dependent on them for company and love .
A third of pet owners admit to talking to their furry friends on the phone and leaving them messages on the answering machine .
About 70 % of people sign their pets ’ names alongside theirs in Christmas and birthday cards , and over half include their pet in significant family photos .
And did you know that dogs are the number one beneficiary in over 1,000,000 US owners ’ wills ?
Dogs Come in an Incredible Variety of Sizes
The largest breed of dog is the Irish Wolfhound which can grow to almost one meter in height and can weigh up to 120 lbs – similar to a small human .
The smallest breed , on the other hand , is the Chihuahua , which is closer to the size of a cuddly toy .
This breed is around 20 cm tall and weighs 2 - 6 lbs at the most .
A more average - sized dog , like the English Cocker Spaniel , grows to 40 cm tall and weighs around 30 lbs .
Dogs Are Descended from A 15 - Million - Year - Old Species
It is thought that all the different types of dogs on Earth are descended from a strange species called Tomarctus that lived a cool 15 million years ago .
The oldest known specific breed was called Saluki .
These dogs were pets belonging to the Ancient Egyptians .
The earliest dogs are thought to have emerged at around the same time as human hunter gatherers , and more modern dogs are also descended from wolves .
A Dog Was One of the First Space Travelers
One of our saddest dog facts concerns the Soviet Union sending the first dog into space in 1957 .
Laika was the first animal to be launched into space by satellite .
The mission was designed to test the safety of space travel , but for Laika it was a suicide mission as the testing did not include the return trip .
She was found later to have died hours after takeoff from a combination of panic and intense heat .
Worldwide media coverage of the events , criticizing the use of the dog , forced the Soviets to defend themselves and release a statement saying that the experiment was to benefit humanity .

The Scientific Name for a Dog Is ‘ Friendly Dog Wolf ’
One of our more obscure dog facts regards this animal ’s scientific name : Canis Lupis Familiaris , which means friendly dog wolf .
This makes reference to the fact that dogs are actually descended from wolves .
The split between the two types of animal occurred between 10,000 and 100,000 years ago .
It is not really possible to domesticate wolves in the same way as dogs , though .
Typically , wolves are much more aggressive and unpredictable .
Wolves require a lot more space than dogs and avoid socialization .
Lord Byron , Prevented From Bringing His Dog to Cambridge , Brought a Bear Instead !
A leading figure in the Romantic movement , Lord Byron was famous for his great poetry , his travels and fighting in Greece , and an eccentric lifestyle which included mounting up huge debts , enjoying great love affairs and living in self - imposed exile .
He caused some controversy when he was not allowed to bring his pet dog , Boatswain , a Newfoundland , to live with him in halls in Cambridge University .
After carefully checking through the rules , he decided to bring a pet bear instead .
He later commissioned a large marble gravestone for Boatswain after his beloved pet ’s death , despite being deeply in debt at the time .
Former Beatle Paul McCartney Recorded Music for Dogs Former Beatle Paul McCartney recorded a special high pitched sound at the end of ‘ A Day in the Life ’ – the last song on the Sergeant Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album – that would be audible only to dogs at 15 kilohertz .
Dogs are able to detect frequencies of sound that are inaudible to the human ear .
Paul McCartney is a dog lover and animal activist ; this was a fun prank to make dogs really pay attention to the album !
Dogs Were Used as Suicide Bombers During WWII During WWII the Russians trained a group of dogs to go on missions of death with mines fixed to their bodies .
The dogs were taught to associate the underside of tanks with food , so they would crawl underneath the tank , where the bomb would detonate and explode , blowing up the tank and unfortunately killing the dog , too .
However , as they had been trained using Soviet tanks , the dogs were more inclined to crawl under these than the German equivalents .
Today ’s Dogs Are Getting Fatter and Fatter
The number one health problem that is emerging in the dog population interestingly parallels a growing problem for humans and is no doubt caused by overly enthusiastic owners .
That ’s right – obesity .
Obesity occurs when dogs are over nourished and not given enough exercise .
It occurs most commonly in middle aged dogs and can lead to health issues in all of the organs of the body and even lead to early death .
Chocolate Has a Chemical in It that Can Kill Dogs
Be careful what you feed your dog .
Chocolate has a substance in it , a bit like caffeine , that can kill dogs or at least make them very sick .
It is the number cause of dog poisoning .
Usually a dog will vomit , but may need to be given hydrogen peroxide to induce this .
The stimulants in chocolate can cause dogs to have extreme thirst , start pacing , have seizures , or have too much energy that can lead to shaking , panting and diarrhea .

There Are Many Famous Dogs in Mythology Cerberus , the well - known three - headed ferocious dog from Greek mythology , guarded the gates of the underworld .
He is best known for his part in one of Hercules ’ labors , where Hercules had to drag him without aid to the surface of the Earth .
Dogs are also prevalent in Chinese myths , appearing as heroes , being magical , or enabling harvests .
The eleventh symbol in the cycle of the Zodiac in South East Asia is the dog , and people born in the year of the dog are supposed to have similar qualities to dogs – such as loyalty and energy .
The Labrador Is the USA ’s Most Popular Pet Dog The Labrador has long been the most popular dog among American owners .
Perhaps this is because these canines are aesthetically pleasing as well as good natured and quite fluffy .
They have had some stiff competition over the decades , though .
Poodles enjoyed great popularity from 1960 - 1982 .
The Beagle and the Cocker Spaniel have also enjoyed periods of popularity .
The American Kennel Club announces statistics on the most popular dogs every year , based on owners who register their pets .
Dogs Love the Smell of Poop !
We all know that dogs love to roll in poop – their own or someone else ’s’ , they ’re not very fussy .
But the reason for this , according to dog facts , is that they have a very different sense of smell to humans .
While we are reaching for a sick bag , they are having a great time because to a dog the smell of poop is fantastic !
Their sense of smell is very pronounced which is why they can even track humans through our footprints .
Dogs Can Feel Both Simple and Complex Emotions
Dogs have the capacity to feel a range of emotions .
Some emotions – like happiness or anger – are known as primary , while others are more complex and require greater cognitive ability .
Dogs can feel both , including even the complicated feeling of jealousy .
When they see their owner petting some other dog , this can kick in and often leads to dog fights !
An experiment at the University of Vienna verified this .
Groups of dogs were taught to perform tricks , like shaking hands , with rewards being given to only one dog .
Without a reward , the others soon stopped participating .
Dogs Exhibit Behavior Linked to Ancient Nesting Instincts
If you see your dog spinning around in circles before settling down for a nap , do n’t worry about his sanity .
This is actually a nesting instinct that is passed down from his ancient ancestors .
Dog facts reveal that these animals exhibit a number of strange behaviors that link to this instinct , like furious digging , marking territory , shredding items of material or pawing at things .
Giving them a bed of their own , perhaps with loose cedar chips to play with , will allow them to do this in a domesticated environment .
Dog Facts – Facts about Dogs Summary
Dog facts include this animal ’s history , revealing that dogs are descended from an ancient species and have been friends of man since at least the time of the Ancient Egyptians .
They enjoy a long history of mutual affection with humans , perhaps more than any other domesticated pet .
They are intelligent beings , both rationally and emotionally , and can be trained to detect things , take care of the blind and understand language .
Their sense perceptions are vastly superior to those of humans .
There are hundreds of different breeds of dog , and even more mixed breeds , ranging from the tiny handbag varieties to the super - speedy and massive .
Wretched peace has plagued New Eden for months , and if we are lucky that will soon come to an end .
Spring is upon us , and with that a new crop of wars are just beginning to blossom across the galaxy .
There was some mild chaos ( and implosions , of course ) amongst the major powers in EVE in the recent past , but since the end of the last Great War ( more than a year ago ) the prospect for a massive clash of the powerblocs was dim .
Not for lack of trying ; there was probably going to be a new Great War between IT and Goonswarm , except that Goonswarm set itself on fire and imploded before any serious war began .
Whoops .
So we find ourselves in April , nearly a year since the last time more than a few tens of thousands of players squared off against each other in a grudge match .
Let 's examine the hotspots and see what may come of them .

The Demise of CVA
Space Junkie 's recent article on the early stages of the CVA / - A- conflict is an extremely cogent analysis which I wo n't attempt to out - do .
Since its publication , Atlas and - A- have hit the pause button on their offensive .
Providence has ~ 50 stations , the process of taking all that space is a tremendous amount of effort .
However , the initial core of CVA resistance has been broken .
Perhaps unsurprisingly for those who watched the first Great War closely , Paxton Federation ( A micro-alliance which somehow held off the combined might of the BoB bloc in one system in Providence for weeks in GW I ) has offered some of the toughest resistance to the invaders .
My take on the situation is that CVA illustrates a pair of critical flaws in a post -Dominion alliance .
First , with a completely obscene amount of stations and jump bridges , the coming of Dominion not only made CVA 's space attractive for the first time ( being a trash region pre-patch , and upgradable post - patch ) but the new infrastructure costs of holding all those stations , keeping them jammed , and maintaining a bridge network scald the conscience .
In this , they were even worse in adapting than Goonswarm , who had a similarly bloated infrastructure network in Delve / Querious .
Also , remember that for CVA , as a roleplaying alliance , having their space suddenly becoming more valuable is a bad thing , because it made them a worthwhile target for the first time in their history .
Pre -Dominion , CVA was not unlike the Pyrenees in Europe : easily defensible while simultaneously not worth invading .
Stripped of all the excess sovereignty upgrades , Providence looks mighty fine for a few small alliances backed up by a Great Power .

Closer to my heart , CVA has always been obsessed with a form of e-honor which I find particularly nauseating .
They refuse to engage in any kind of espionage , or the more ruthless sorts of diplomatic negotiations which allows a nullsec alliance to survive .
For many years they have been able to get away with this , simply by virtue of how irrelevant their space was ; however , they did not see that correlation .
Judging by the statements of CVA 's leader at a recent EVE - meet , their leadership seemed to believe that their ' success ' of not having territory worth invading pre-Dominion was proof of the superiority of their honorable , anti-metagame stance .
It 's been rather endearing to see these ' noble roleplayers ' violently disabused of the notion that espionage in EVE is irrelevant .
Implosions Continue : the SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSO [ LODRA ]
Saga
And you thought that merely forgetting to pay their sov bills , abandoning the most valuable region in the game , and then having their CEO steal all their isk and disband their alliance was enough drama for goons .
You thought wrong !
Nothing is quite as sexy as civil war .
Darius JOHNSON , CEO of Goonwaffe , crankily demanded that ElitistOps , the independent Black Ops / Recon subgroup of SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSO [ LODRA ] , formally join the alliance .
Not appreciating his tone , ElitistOps refused and split in two , with some pilots joining Goonwaffe and some going rogue and hunting their former goon brothers .
Drama reached a fever pitch when ElitistOps made contact with Karttoon , the previous CEO of Goonfleet who had disbanded the Goonswarm alliance ; Karttoon , who controls the ' Band of Brothers ' alliance , added Elitist Ops into BoB .
Not content to simply have a splinter with extra helpings of irony , several member corporations in SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSO [ LODRA ] seized upon the ElitistOps drama as an opportunity to form their own alliance , ' Here There Be Dragons ' .
They planned in secret to arrange the schism , but had their plans foiled when they quietly informed Goonwaffe member Bu Jinkan , the most dangerous troll on goonfleet.com , of their intentions .
Bu , being
Bu , immediately took their secret plans and splattered them loudly across various EVE - related forums , all the while denouncing the idea as doomed to fail .
This caused the most important of the schismatic corporations ( Merch Industrial , the Penny Arcade corp ) to reconcile with the SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSO [ LODRA ] leadership , cutting the legs out from under the rebellion before it began .
There 's a ton of other hilarious drama going on with this , and it may or may not reach the pitch of a war between the loyal goons and the schismatics .
Either way , this alliance of 3000 + people is lurching about like a drunk on a highway in a stolen Ferrari ; at one point last week we were about to move 8 regions away and attack - A - while basing out of Curse , then two days later our course was changed again .
All the while , the infighting intensifies .
Good times .

MAX DAMAGE 2.0
The big news is that the most poorly concealed secret in nullsec is finally out !
Sir Molle , leader of IT Alliance , has announced that ( gasp ) IT and - A - will be invading the Northern Coalition in hopes of breaking that most venerable of powerblocs up .
In the process , IT will be setting blue the entirety of the rest of EVE , no doubt complaining about ' blobs ' all the while .
I wish I was exaggerating about this , but if this war goes as planned , every major powerbloc in the game which is n't blue to the Northern Coalition will be actively attacking it in different sections of its space simultaneously .
On the one hand , this is great news - if it goes as advertised , we 're back in the land of the Great Wars , where 30 k + players face off against each other on each side .
On the other hand , if you listen to the recording , the ' plan ' sounds suspiciously similar to the failed Band of Brothers ' Max Damage ' campaign , the last time they attempted to invade the NC .
Just like in Max Damage , the plan involves ' not taking stations ' and ' not focusing on moons or conquest ' but ' doing damage ' ... and if that requires taking stations and moons , so be it .
In short , it 's a contradictory muddle .
Which , while that might not be so effective on the battlefield , will result in some amusing chaos when things begin to go awry .
Speaking of awry , the biggest worry about the outbreak of a new Great War is the lag .
Since Dominion we 've been sent back to the dark ages of Apocrypha-era lag , where fleet battles of even 300 people bring the servers to a crashing halt .
In the midst of the drunken haze of the GDC a few weeks ago , I ran across the CCP developer in charge of ' Core Technology ' - for some reason he cringed when I proceeded to repeatedly and loudly refer to him as the ' Lag Dev ' .
Regardless , he reassured me that he has entire teams of people working on the lag issue , that CCP is well aware of it , etc etc .
We have n't had anything close to a Great War level of player conflict since Dominion was released , so this is going to be a real test for the Lag Dev and his intrepid team of code monkeys .
Wish them luck !

Now , while it is my opinion that all males are rapists , I also think the focus of many liberal white feminists on “ date rape ” is extremely self - serving .
It is certainly true that girls and women have most to fear from males they trust , but extending unwarranted trust to “ dates ” is an altogether different thing than the trust that little girls have in male relatives , for example .
Little girls have little choice in the matter of their guardians , whether temporary or permanent , while heterosexual women do have some choice when it comes to “ dates . ”
Rather than acknowledge , though , that all “ date ” rapes could be prevented by refusing to cloister oneself alone with males in a “ romantic ” context , most liberal white feminists focus their energies on begging males to honor the trust women have in them .
This completely invisibilizes the fact that trust means different things depending on the specific relationship a rapist has to his victim (s ) .
The trust that girls , mentally or physically disabled women , female prison inmates , and even female worshipers ( in certain environments ) must have for their wards or guardians is not voluntary .
Girls and women in these situations are dependent upon male relatives , male nurses and orderlies , male guards , and male clergy in ways that heterosexual women are decidedly not dependent upon male “ dates . ”
Because of this dependency , girls and women who are raped under these circumstances have even less recourse than do women who choose to consort with rapists ( under the flimsy auspices of never having suspected the male in question to be capable of rape , despite his possessing all the equipment necessary to do so ) .
Why is it that these women can , on the one hand , see that a woman is most at risk of rape in the company of men who are known to her , while on the other hand , limiting the scope of “ men who are known to her ” to potential “ dates ” ?
They beg the well - to - do , “ polite , ” white males they ’d like to marry not to rape them , but they scoff at the notion that these same males ought not be let anywhere near girl - children or female patients , etc .
If a woman is most likely to be raped by the males known to her , the simple solution for those who do have a choice is to limit one ’s interactions with males .
Feminist energies should be spent on preventing male access to girls and women who do n’t have a choice .
A wave of reports is coming in from the town of Euclid , Ohio , from folks there who are seeing a mysterious light hovering over Lake Erie and Cleveland .
The light , they say , is very bright , lasts for a couple of hours , stays near the horizon , changes colors , and keeps coming back to the same spot night after night .
Here 's an MSNBC report about it : Could it be an alien visitor from another world ?
No , I do n't think so .
In fact , I think it is another world .
Venus , to be specific .
A Fort Wayne , Indiana website has an interview with one of the witnesses on video , and includes some still shots .
Everything in his description , including the photographs , makes me think he and the others are seeing Venus .
Right now , Venus can be seen in the west -- the direction to Lake Erie and Cleveland as seen in Euclid -- shining brightly just after sunset .
It is so bright it can be seen while the sky is still light ( I 've seen Venus in the middle of the day ) .
It appears to hover .
Changing atmospheric conditions can affect its color , especially when it's low to the horizon .
It can be seen night after night , in the same spot in the sky .
Sound familiar ?
I 'm not saying what these people are seeing is in fact Venus , but it sure fits everything I 've heard in the news reports ( sometimes the witnesses describe multiple lights , but when looking to the horizon , especially over a big city , it 's not too unlikely to see planes flying around ) .
In the MSNBC report they talked to the FAA , the military , and others ( including a UFO guy from England ) , but never talked to an astronomer .
Hmmph .
And note that in these news articles , Venus is never mentioned !
That 's mighty peculiar , given how spectacular it is in the west after sunset .
It 's really hard to miss .
A likely explanation is that it's not mentioned because it is , in fact , the culprit here .
I 'm getting a kick out of just how positive so many people are that this is a flying saucer of some kind .
I wonder how many of these folks actually are familiar with the night sky , and would recognize Venus when they see it ?
That 's why I think very few astronomers ( pro or amateur ) report UFOs : astronomers tend to know what they 're looking at in the sky .
The next time you hear a report like this , do n't jump to the conclusion that some interplanetary object is making a close encounter ... because it may very well be interplanetary , but the encounter may not be terribly close .
Tip o' the probe to Patrick Kent .
Eavesdropping on police radio will soon be a thing of the past in Toronto as the force moves to launch a $ 35 million encrypted system that blocks out the public – including tow - truck drivers , reporters and others with a burning desire to know what 's happening out there .
Though new to many cities , radio encryption has been employed for decades around the globe , spurred on by post - 9/11 security concerns .
It 's used by the U.S. Secret Service , CIA and Department of Homeland Security , as well as some state and local forces , though not by New York City police .
Although officials acknowledge encryption is coming to Toronto – as soon as the G20 summit in June – nobody wants to discuss specifics , citing " security concerns . "
" It 's about public safety , officer safety , operational security and integrity , " explains Mark Pugash , director of public information for Toronto police .
" When you consider how accessible the information is and the sensitivity of much of what we do , then you have to take this very seriously . "
Pugash did n't give a target date , and the operating budget does n't itemize the cost .
However , it 's coming in at a time when there is extraordinary pressure to cut costs .
The police services board voted Monday not to trim $ 5.9 million from the $ 892.2 million operating budget , as recommended by a review committee .
Chief Bill Blair said it would be " irresponsible " and would mean 258 fewer officers on the street .
Board chair Alok Mukherjee describes encryption as a " long - term capital expense " the city will benefit from introducing now because Ottawa will pay half the cost under its commitments toward security for the G20 .
Though costs have dropped drastically over the past decade , just one encrypted radio costs $ 5,000 , according to a Motorola dealer .
A communications insider said police are still maintaining the old Motorola radio system , but also testing encrypted radios for use in sensitive areas such as the emergency task force , undercover operations and summit preparations , in conjunction with the RCMP .
Meanwhile , the prospect of a blackout is causing anxiety to those who routinely monitor police , fire and ambulance calls , including media outlets , independent tow - truck drivers and scanner buffs .
For suddenly stranded motorists , it may mean a longer wait for a tow – and for drivers stuck behind a stalled vehicle or an accident , a longer backup .
Wadi Alsaadli , of Metro Toronto Towing , an independent operator with two trucks on the road , says his livelihood depends on an open radio system .
He figures more than 1,000 independent tow trucks work the GTA streets .
" We 're not ready for it .
When that happens I 'm going to have to work for a company that has a contract with the police , " Alsaadli said .
Radioworld , at Steeles Ave. W. and Highway 400 , caters to scanner enthusiasts who listen in to learn what 's going on in their neighbourhood .
" Obviously , they 'll be shut out , " said sales manager Tim Pacan .
When the Ontario Provincial Police switched to a digital system that blocked out the public , he said , they had to bring in a separate , open analogue channel so tow - truck operators could respond to accidents that paralyzed highways .
" Anything that should be secret already is , like the emergency task force and undercover work , " Pacan argues .
" And how often do you hear people committing a crime using a scanner ? "

Pugash said there is no " enshrined right " of the public or news media to listen in on emergency calls , despite the freedom they 've had to do so until now .
" Our job , in communicating with each other , is to resolve situations safely and be able to deploy our people safely and effectively , " he said .

These mace - shaped particles use quantum physics to control current Hand - held devices could soon have pressure - sensitive touch - screens and keys , thanks to a UK firm 's material that exploits a quantum physics trick .
The technology allows , for example , scrolling down a long list or webpage faster as more pressure is applied .
A division of Samsung that distributes mobile phone components to several handset manufacturers has now licensed the " Quantum Tunnelling Composite " .
The approach could find use in devices from phones to games to GPS handsets .
In January , Japanese touch - screen maker Nissha also licensed the approach from Yorkshire - based Peratech , who make the composite material QTC .
However , as part of the licensing agreements , Peratech could not reveal the phone , gaming , and device makers that could soon be using the technology to bring pressure sensitivity to a raft of new devices .
Besides control for scrolling , the pressure - sensitivity could lead to a " third dimension " in touchscreens .
For instance , instead of many " 2 - D " pages of applications , they could be grouped by type on a single page - using the press of a finger to dive into each type and select the desired app .
Quantum mace
The composite works by using spiky conducting nanoparticles , similar to tiny medieval maces , dispersed evenly in a polymer .
None of these spiky balls actually touch , but the closer they get to each other , the more likely they are to undergo a quantum physics phenomenon known as tunnelling .
Tunnelling is one of several effects in quantum mechanics that defies explanation in terms of the " classical " physics that preceded it .
Simply put , quantum mechanics says that there is a tiny probability that a particle shot at a wall will pass through it in an effect known as tunnelling .
The pressure - sensitive key can already be found in an available handset Similarly , the material that surrounds the spiky balls acts like a wall to electric current .
But as the balls draw closer together , when squashed or deformed by a finger 's pressure , the probability of a charge tunnelling through increases .
The net result is that pressing harder on the material leads to a smooth increase in the current through it .
There are a number of ways to make switches or screens pressure - sensitive , such as using mechanical switches .
However , the QTC approach is particularly suited to making thin devices .
Pressure - sensitive QTC switches can be made 70 micrometres thick - about the thickness of a human hair .
QTC is better than switches based on so - called " conducting polymers " , because they conduct no electricity until they are pressed , leading to better overall efficiency .
Samsung Electro - mechanics has now incorporated the QTC into the navigation switch familiar on smartphones - in addition to the up , down , left , right and centre button , the up and down functions are pressure - sensitive .
This is useful for scrolling more or less quickly through , for example , a long list of emails .
" That same model can be used in many other ways , like in games : to control how hard I want to jump or run for example , " said Peratech 's chief executive Philip Taysom .
" Electronics are being given the ability to sense something that we take for granted , which is how much we 're touching and applying force , " he told BBC News .
Further applications that Peratech is involved with include robotics .
While much work has gone into giving robots sensitivity to pressure and touch in their fingers , Mr Taysom said there can now be a push to create robots whose whole surface - rather like humans themselves - is pressure - sensitive .

A Turing Machine
Quick Introduction
In Alan Turing ’s 1936 paper on computable numbers , he presented a thought experiment .
Turing describes a machine that has an infinitely long tape upon which it writes , reads and alters symbols .
He further shows that a machine with the correct minimal set of operations can calculate anything that is computable , no matter the complexity .
My goal in building this project was to create a machine that embodied the classic look and feel of the machine presented in Turing ’s paper .
I wanted to build a machine that would be immediately recognizable as a Turing machine to someone familiar with Turing 's work .
Although this Turing machine is controlled by a Parallax Propeller microcontroller , its operation while running is based only on a set of state transformations loaded from an SD card and what is written to and read from the tape .
While it may seem as if the tape is merely the input and output of the machine , it is not !
Nor is the tape just the memory of the machine .
In a way the tape is the computer .
As the symbols on the tape are manipulated by simple rules , the computing happens .
The output is really more of an artifact of the machine using the tape as the computer .
The heart of the turing machine is the read - write head .
The read - write head transports the tape and positions cells of the tape appropriately .
It can read a cell determining what , if any , symbol is written there .
The machine works on , and knows about , only one cell at a time .
The tape in my machine is a 1000 ’ roll of white 35 mm film leader .
The characters , ones and zeros , are written by the machine with a black dry erase marker .
Video Overview
The following video is an overview of the machine and its components .
There is a lot more information in other parts of the site including hardware and software details , as well as video examples of it running some common Turing machine code .
While I have taken some liberty with a number of terms and concepts , I hope you can see just how simple the rules that drive a Turing machine are .
Changing ones to zeros , moving one cell to the left or right , these concepts are simple , yet they can compute anything that is computable .
And from these simple concepts , the most complex computers of today are born .

Is the Pentagon ready to “ rendition ” members of WikiLeaks in order to silence the whistleblower website ?
“ If anything happens to us , you know why , ” a recent Tweet issued by a member of the website states .
WikiLeaks has told supporters not to worry .
“ To those worrying about us – we ’re fine , and will issue a suitable riposte shortly , ” a Tweet stated .
WikiLeaks , the web portal of forbidden information that won Amnesty International ’s new media award last year , is under fire for its plan to make public unencrypted footage of an air strike in Afghanistan on May 7 last year that killed 97 civilians .
WikiLeaks has promised to reveal a “ Pentagon Murder Cover - up ” at the National Press Club in Washington on April 5 , according to the Mail Online .
The Pentagon initially planned to make the footage public , but backed off after it turned out to be more incriminating than at first thought .
Now they are gunning for WikiLeaks because they plan to release the video .
“ WikiLeaks is currently under an aggressive US and Icelandic surveillance operation , ” another Tweet claims .
“ One related person was detained for 22 hours .
Computer ’s seized . ”
“ We have airline records of the State Dep / CIA tails .
Do n’t think you can get away with it .
You cannot .
This is WikiLeaks . ”
A WikiLeaks editor reported that he was being followed by “ State Dep diplomatic cover ” in Norway .
WikiLeaks has angered the U.S. government in the past .
In 2007 , the site posted almost the entire order of battle for American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Earlier this month , the site posted a 2008 report from the Army Counterintelligence Center .

Online retailer NewEgg said late Monday that it has confirmed that a shipment of Core i7s were indeed fake , and that it had broken off its supply relationship with IPEX , the supplier .
NewEgg also apologized .
Online retailer NewEgg said late Monday that it has confirmed that a shipment of Core i7s were indeed fake , and that it had broken off its supply relationship with IPEX , the supplier .
NewEgg also apologized .
The fake Core i7s surfaced this weekend , and on Monday morning .
At the time , reports had indicated that the fake processors were in fact so - called " demo units " .
By Monday afternoon , NewEgg had rejected that story .
" Newegg is currently conducting a thorough investigation surrounding recent shipments of questionable Intel Core i7 - 920 CPUs purchased from Newegg.com , " a spokesman said in a statement .
" Initial information we received from our supplier , IPEX , stated that they had mistakenly shipped us ' demo units , ' the spokesman added .
" We have since come to discover the CPUs were counterfeit and are terminating our relationship with this supplier .
Contrary to any speculation , D&H Distributing is not the vendor that supplied us with the Intel Core i7 - 920 CPUs in question . "
Intel confirmed again that they had seen the fake Core i7s .
" Intel is getting samples to inspect and until then we can say that everything in the package appears fake , " a spokesman said in an email late on Monday .
" Some of the photos of the processor look like it is a casting and not even a real processor of any kind .
Newegg has moved quickly to replace the suspect units . "
Again , buyers should contact their point of purchase for a replacement , the Intel spokesman said .
NewEgg , for its part , said that it already had contacted affected customers , and would continue to reach out and replace the counterfeit parts .
" Newegg 's top priority is to proactively reach out to all customers who may have been affected to ensure their absolute satisfaction , " NewEgg said .
" We have already sent out a number of replacement units and are doing everything in our power to resolve the matter promptly and with the least amount of inconvenience to our customers .
" We have always taken pride in providing an exceptional experience for each customer , and we apologize for any inconvenience to our valued customers , " NewEgg added .
" We take matters like this extremely seriously , and are working in close cooperation with Intel and the appropriate law enforcement authorities to thoroughly investigate this incident . "
最近、オリオン座のベテルギウスに関して" 刺激的な"
タイトルのニュースが流れた。オリオン座は覚えやすく都会でも楽しめる手軽な星座だ。そのオリオンが肩を壊すかもしれないとなれば書かざるを得ない。
重い星の死 天蓋にぶら下がる星々は永遠の存在ではなく、だいたい数百万年から数兆年の寿命で移ろいゆく。ヒトの死が多様であるように、星の死にもまた個性がある。それは体重や組成、相方の有無などによって決まり、静かに冷たくなることもあれば、木っ端微塵に吹き飛ぶこともある。ベテルギウスのような重い星は、超新星と呼ばれる大爆発によって焼死する。爆発の閃光はひとつの銀河に匹敵するほどであり、ベテルギウスのような至近爆発ともなればどのような状況が生じるのか興味は尽きない。そして、爆発はどのくらい差し迫っているのだろう。
もうすこし細かな爆発プロセス：周囲への影響を考えるにあたり
core collapse ：０〜数秒 まず、中心付近の圧力が重力を支えきれなくなって崩壊する。重力崩壊というと、星全体が「ドドドドド」みたいな光景が思い浮かぶが、ベテルギウスを直径1m の球とすると、中心部の赤血球より小さな領域が瞬時に分子サイズに潰れる現象だ(数千km→数十km：0.1秒)。重力崩壊と続く数秒の冷却過程で「ニュートリノ」と呼ばれる幽霊のように万物をすり抜ける粒子が大量発生してエネルギーの99%を持ち去る。その数は太陽系に存在する全ての原子の数倍程度だ。
多かれ少なかれ超新星は非対称で重力波の検出が期待される。重力波とニュートリノはほぼ同時に地球に到着する*2。人には知覚できない微かな時空のゆらぎが0.1秒ほど、幽霊のような素粒子の突風が数秒ほどの間通り過ぎていく。スーパカミオカンデでは(データ取得が追いつかないことを無視すれば)1000万イベントぐらいのシグナルが期待されるだろう。狼少年のSNEWSが珍しく本物の警報を発する瞬間だ。 shock breakout ： ２日後 大マゼラン星雲で発生 し たSN1987A のときはニュートリノ観測から数時間だったが、ベテルギウスは半径がずっと大きいため爆発の影響が表面に伝わるまで数日必要だ。衝撃波は秒速数千kmで伝播するけど、ベテルギウスの半径は何億kmもある。衝撃波は外層を超高温に加熱しながら外へと広がっていく。衝撃波がベテルギウスの表面に到達すると、星全体がアーク溶接のように青白く輝き始める。大きさは木星軌道、数十万度のプラズマ塊となったベテルギウスが放つ激烈な黒体輻射だ。この時に放出される黒体輻射のエネルギーは膨大だが、温度が高すぎてほとんどは紫外線やX線として放出される。可視光での明るさは比較的小さい。基本的に数日掛けて増光していく。 plateau ~remnant : 数十日後 火の玉は膨張と放射を続けながら数時間で急速に冷え、次第に可視光で大部分のエネルギーを放つようになる。爆発直後の火球は１日に数天文単位の速度で膨張する。海王星軌道、冥王星軌道と、次々に飲み込み巨大な光球が形成される。外層が数千度まで冷えてくると電離していた水素が中性化して半透明になり、より内側のまだ高温で不透明な領域が光学的な表面(光球面)になる。我々は水素が中性化する温度の層を常に見ることになる。半透明のガス球の中心に、太陽のように
5000 K ぐらいで輝く巨大な天体を１００日ぐらいに渡って観測することになる。この過程がちょうど満月ぐらいの明るさになる。 tail ~ remnant ： 数ヶ月〜 衝撃波の熱が抜けたあとは残された熱源である各種放射性物質( 直後は主に56Co)の半減期にしたがって暗くなっていく。膨張が進み、中心部の放射性物質が露出してくると、ガンマ線がジワジワと増大する。膨張する超新星残骸は星間ガスを押しのけながら種々の熱源で加熱され10^6~10^7Kの高温プラズマとなり、X線で輝いている。
X線やガンマ線の影響 発生過程 他の作用はあんまり気にしなくていいけど、ガンマ線やX線は数百光年以上に被害を与えうるので分けて考えることにしよう。大気圏に保護されていない人工衛星や宇宙ステーションには、600光年離れていたとしても最大級のフレアを超えるX線が降り注ぐことが予想される。
ガンマ線/X線は高エネルギーの現象に避けられない代物で、超新星のありとあらゆる過程で発生する。しかし、衝撃波やニュートリノと違って速やかに物質に吸収されるため、我々がガンマ線を観測するのは遮る物質がほとんど無いときに限られる。ベテルギウス中心部で発生した膨大な量のガンマ線が星の外に出てくることはないし、地球大気もガンマ線/X線を透過しないため、宇宙線の二次粒子のような例外を除けば地上に到達することはない。下のような条件で地球まで飛来でき、地上ではなく宇宙望遠鏡によって観測される。
超相対論的*3なアウトフローが恒星をぶち抜いて周囲の物質を無双しているとき。( GRB/XRF ) （※ベテルギウスではたぶん起こらない）
衝撃波がベテルギウスの表面に到達して10万度の火の玉となった瞬間( shock breakout ) 衝撃波が星間物質と衝突したとき、あるいは加熱されて超高温のプラズマになっている時(これは何百年も掛けて明るくなっていく )
物質が十分に拡散して物質に覆われていた内部の放射性物質が露出したとき( remnant ) 地上や生物圏への影響 大気がガンマ線 やX線を吸収して地上まで届かないことは、地上が常に安全であることを意味しない。 地上で被爆することはなくてもオゾン層を破壊することで間接的に生態系に影響を与えることがある。大気圏に突入したガンマ線は、そこそこ大気密度が上昇してガンマ線に対して不透明になる高度30kmぐらいのところで力尽きる。ちょうど、オゾン層があるあたりだ。ガンマ線の持っていたエネルギーは最終的に大気を電離させるために使われる。ガスを電離させるには
30eVほど必要なので、大雑把には3MeVのガンマ線が１つ飛び込むと、10万個ぐらいの電離が起きる。大量の窒素酸化物やラジカルが生成され、オゾン層にダメージを与える。破壊は降り注ぐX線／ガンマ線の総量が30kJ/m^2くらいで深刻になる。
このとき宇宙空間では、断面積0.6m^2・体重60kgを仮定すると300Svの被曝になり、これは半数致死とされる4Svの75倍・JCO事故( 20Sv)
の15倍である。*4このケースでは、宇宙服ないし宇宙船が99%を遮蔽したとしても大量の死者を出すだろう。
仮に典型的な超新星の全運動エネルギーに相当するE=1e44Jのエネルギーがガンマ線に転換されるならば、600光年離れていても、
を浴びる。こんな狂ったX線・ガンマ線の放射は、後述のガンマ線バースト( GRB)ぐらいでしかないが(例えば等方仮定光度Li=5e44Wで10sと、さらに50倍くらいの威力があり、数千光年に渡って汚物を消毒する)
ベテルギウスは衝撃波が表面に到達した直後*5の超高温状態のときに膨大なX線を放射し、Ibc型の例だがSN2008Dだと2e39JくらいのX線を300秒かけて放射したそうなので、同火力なら地球で5J/m^2、過去30年で最大の太陽フレアの数十倍のX線照射が数分間続く。*6
600光年離れている場合、太陽系を50mSv相当のX線が満たすが、地上までは届かない。オゾン層を破壊して環境を擾乱するのはベテルギウスから10光年程度の範囲に限られる。
上が明るさで下が温度、横軸の単位は（日）:衝撃波が到達した瞬間は大量のX線が放射されている
ガンマ線バースト/X線フラッシュ( GRB/XRF ) 既に出てきたが、一部の超新星は極超新星と呼ばれる非常に巨大な爆発を起こし、その際に強い指向性を持った( 100keV~MeVの)ガンマ線のビームを放射する。また、そこまではなくても、ジェットが星をぶち抜いた場合、X線フラッシュ(XRF)とよばれるプチGRBみたいなX線が発生することがある。
GRB/XRFは様々な波長の光を含んでおり、爆発の軸方向では通常の超新星を数千個合わせたような閃光が観測される。酷い例だと可視光で非常に明るかったGRB080219Bがあり、光度距離*7で200億光年
( Z=0.937 ) 離れた場所から肉眼で見えるほどの(m_v=-5.8)閃光を放った。これは、通常の超新星のさらに数億倍、50京個の太陽が出現したのと同等の明るさだ。ベテルギウスの距離でも原爆の爆心地を遥かに超える輻射を浴びることになる。
GRB >> XRF >>> shock breakout >>>>SN remnant ベテルギウスでの極超新星の可能性は？ 極超新星は極めて重い星が、アルゼンチン国債のように吹き荒れる星風で外層の水素からヘリウムまでほとんどを吹き飛ばし、青白く輝く内蔵が剥き出しになったギシギシの恒星が消し飛ぶ、といった特殊な超新星なので、水素の外層がでっぷりとして横綱の風格のあるベテルギウスの柄ではない。
Hubble宇宙望遠鏡による直接イメージングに自転軸を重ねた図：自転周期は１７年と考えられている。
上の画像は、地球からみたベテルギウスの自転軸だ。自転軸は地球から２０°ほどずれており、万が一ベテルギウスが極超新星を起こしたとしても、地球への影響は無い。
結局、あとどのくらいでベテルギウスは爆発するの？
では、現在の情報を総合すると、どのくらい爆発が差し迫っているだろう。
まず、ベテルギウスのことは忘れてこの距離(600光年以内)
でII型超新星が観測できる頻度について考えてみよう。銀河系に於けるII型の超新星の発生頻度として、 ( Capellaro et al . 1997 ) を採用するなら、80万年に一度のイベントとなる。我々が特別に運がいい時代に生きていると仮定しなければ、この距離での超新星観測には数十万年の待ち時間を期待すべきだ。
次に、この距離にある赤色巨星というと、ベテルギウスとアンタレスが有名だが、それぞれ最後の日々を赤色超巨星として数十万から百数十万年過ごすと考えられており、銀河系におけるII型超新星の頻度と矛盾しない。
爆発直前のベテルギウスに外見的な兆候はあるか
様々な質量の星がHRダイアグラム上で辿る軌跡：赤丸がベテルギウスが現在いる位置である。( Log L/Lo=5,log T=3.55 ) 。実線は回転してない星、点線は高速回転している星。
ベテルギウスは15~20Moの天体であり、典型的なシナリオでは赤色超巨星になった後はほとんど外見を変えない。中質量星のようにヘリウム燃焼時にHRダイアグラム上をぐるっと徘徊することも無く、せいぜいちょっと明るくなるくらいだろう。SN1987Aの母天体が爆発直前に青色巨星になったことが気になるかもしれないが、それについては付録にまわす。「既に炭素燃焼が始まっているから、千年以内だ。」なんて話を小耳に挟んだことはあるが、根拠や確度については確認していない。
....（赤色超巨星となったヘリウム燃焼段階では核燃焼の生成物が運ばれ、表面の組成がすこしずつ変化していく。例えば、ベテルギウスはN/C比が太陽の８倍に達している。モデルや条件に大変依存するが、赤色超巨星になったばかりの段階では2倍しかない。この発言は信用してもらいたくないが、現在の[N/C]だと、ヘリウム燃焼がまだまだ続くかなという予感はある。）
超新星の確実な前兆はある：燃焼最終段階のニュートリノ冷却過程
赤色超巨星は消しゴムのカスに六本木ヒルズを押し込めたほどの高密度なコアと、ロータリーポンプで作った真空より希薄な外層という二重構造の天体だ。最終段階における質量分布は、中心から半径で0.1%圏内に３割、中心から0.0003%の圏内に１割を集中させる。この極限集中こそが炭素やネオンすら燃焼させ重力に対抗しう
る莫大な圧力をつくり出している。星の未来はコアだけで決まり、果てしなく広がった外層は、膨らもうが縮もうが消し飛ぼうが関係ない。
また、恒星の直径は内部のエネルギー生成率や圧力勾配の影響を鋭敏に受けるが、質量喪失や物質の混交でも容易に変化する。縮んだ膨らんだで一喜一憂するのも一興だが、直径や表面温度とは無関係に突然死する。
では、これが観測されれば確実に超新星の前兆だというものはあるだろうか。
超新星直前のタイムテーブル。 上の表は超新星までの数百年でどのような燃焼が起こるか示したものだ。外から見た可視光での明るさは変わらないが中心部では劇的な変化が起こっている。ヘリウム燃焼段階が終了し、炭素燃焼が開始した地点でのこり数百年、酸素とネオンの燃焼が１年くらい、最後のシリコン燃焼は数日で終了する。鉄が分解され始めると数秒で超新星だ。Tcは中心温度で1MeVは100億度に相当する、ヘリウム燃焼が２億度で、炭素燃焼が７億度、あとは終末に向かって急激に上昇していく。
ここで注目すべきは左から５番目、Lνの項目だ。これはニュートリノ放射量で、爆発の直前に急激に上昇しているのがわかるだろう。炭素燃焼の段階で、200万太陽光度、酸素燃焼時で200億太陽光度、最後のシリコン燃焼段階では１兆太陽光度ものエネルギーをニュートリノで放射している。超新星のニュートリノバーストにこそ及ばないものの、数億太陽光度に達すると言う超新星の輻射光度を遥かに上回る。100光年離れた場所でも太陽ニュートリノに匹敵するほどだ。光での明るさは高々10万太陽光度であり、最終段階の赤色巨星は実に99.99999%をニュートリノ放射の形で流出させている。(ちなみに太陽は２％程度)
一般に超高温の物体は熱放射で表面から悠長に冷えるよう暇はなく、膨大なニュートリノ放射によって直接内部から急冷される。天体では１億度を超えたあたりから無視できなくなり、数億度で光に卓越する。そして、数十億度では数日で太陽質量オーダーの核燃料が使い果たされてしまう異常な老化をもたらす。
燃焼最終段階のニュートリノ放射スペクトル
太陽ニュートリノ（実線）1kpc(3000光年) 離れたところにある20Moの星がシリコン燃焼段階で放出するニュートリノのスペクトル（灰色）、ベテルギウスの場合600光年なので、さらに25倍の信号が観測される。
地球では、爆発直前の数日前で太陽ニュートリノの３％程度の信号が観測される。また１年前はそれより２桁ほど小さなニュートリノ放射を見ることになる。現在の観測設備では難しいかもしれないが、より巨大なハイパーカミオカンデやUNOでの検出を議論している人たちもいるようだ。
最後に なんか、思いのほか長くまとまりの無いものになってしまったが・・・ 今、ベテルギウスが熱い！もし爆発すれば満月ほどの明るさで輝く星が１００日ほど観測されるだろう。被害については数光年以内だが、ガンマ線・X線が衛星に影響を与えるかもしれない。
何十万年に一度という天体ショーであり、おそらく何十万年待つことになるだろうが、明日にも爆発するかもしれない。爆発してほしい。爆発しろ。最近のニュースは超新星を連想させるものではないがベテルギウスを理解する上では重要な観測だ。ニュートリノの増光が観測できるようになったら爆発の前兆を信じてもいい。
VANCOUVER , British Columbia 
From the house on 13th Street where John Shuster grew up , along one edge of Chisholm , Minn. , it was only a few blocks to where Jason Smith lived .
And if you headed out of town a ways , out toward Biwabik , you would find the house of Jeff Isaacson .
Just like that , you would have most of what became the 2010 United States men ’s Olympic curling team .
There may be no team at the Vancouver Games any closer  quite literally .
For most of the past year , the three longtime friends and core members lived together in a two - bedroom Duluth apartment  with Shuster ’s remarkably accommodating fiancée  in northern Minnesota .
“ Jeff and I have bunk beds , ” Smith said .
And because you were going to ask , Smith sleeps on top .
If knowing your teammates well is a recipe for success , the Americans should be the best in the world .
All five members of the team  four on the ice and one as an alternate  are from Minnesota .
But the core is from one sliver north of Duluth .
They were born within nine months of one another in 1982 and 1983 .
As a kombucha homebrewer , I was pleasantly surprised to learn that MAKE columnist Tim Anderson brews his own kombucha as well .
From the New York Times :
Kombucha 's popularity has also attracted home brewers .
Tim Anderson , founder of a 3D printer technology company , moved from Boston to Berkeley , Calif. , with his " mother " — passed on to him from a friend who got it , as the story goes , from gypsies in Russia .
Mr. Anderson , an advocate for all things do - it - yourself , made step - by - step kombucha brewing instructions complete with videos for Instructables.com ( one of over 200 tutorials he has made on everything from tire sandals to wheelchair shopping carts ) .
Nearly 60,000 people have viewed the kombucha guide to - date , according to the site 's page - view statistics .
" I 'm surprised people would pay to get this stuff , " Mr. Anderson said .
" The kind you can buy tastes vinegary and dry , whereas the one you can make yourself is so incredibly delicious . "
Satisfying a mutual desire for companionship , this high chair permits your dog or cat to accompany you at the dinner table .
The high chair clips securely to tables up to 2 " thick and its height adjusts without tools to elevate your pet to near eye level .
It has a frame of powder - coated 5/8 " steel tubing and its arms are rubber - coated so they will not mar table surfaces .
By providing an alternative to sitting on your lap , running disruptively underfoot , or outright banishment , the chair assuages a pet ( and its owner 's ) frustration , and promotes more refined behavior .
The chair 's 600 - denier tan / brown nylon fabric cleans easily .
Two tethers on the chair protect your dinner guests against any lapses in etiquette .
Folds for convenient storage and travel .
For pets up to 10 lbs. 10 " H x 12 " W x 9 1/2 " D. ( 4 lbs . )
It ’s the eighth annual International Eat A Tasty Animal for PETA ( EATAPETA ) Day .
Today , as uber - commenter Alex Bensky likes to say , if it did n’t have a mother , do n’t eat it .
However , as I like to say : Eat meat .
It pisses off PETA like nothing else .

If you ever doubted the decline of the American empire , a new report shows that the number of Americans obtaining college degrees is declining .
Bottom line : Americans aged 25 - 34 have less education than their parent ’s generation .
Americans have always aspired to give their children a better life , but we seem to be backsliding .
A few weeks ago I posted about how Americans ’ household net worth went down for the first time in history .
But not only are we worse off economically , our children are not receiving as much education as we did .
Even worse , America is declining compared to the rest of the world .
The US ranks second among countries of the world in the percentage of people aged 35 - 64 with a college degree .
But among people aged 24 - 35 — the new generation in their most productive years — we rank tenth .
Indeed , we are one of only two countries where the number of people receiving college degrees is declining .
And for degrees in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics , the situation is even worse .
The report does n’t speculate on why our new generation is n’t getting college degrees , but given that the tuition has been increasing at double the rate of inflation over roughly the last 50 years , it seems like many young people just ca n’t afford to go to college any more .
Or maybe it is all the fault of Fox News .

Amazon deforestation has slowed markedly , the FAO reports
The world 's net rate of forest loss has slowed markedly in the last decade , with less logging in the Amazon and China planting trees on a grand scale .
Yet forests continue to be lost at " an alarming rate " in some countries , according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) .
Its Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 finds the loss of tree cover is most acute in Africa and South America .
But Australia also suffered huge losses because of the recent drought .
" It is good news , " said the report 's co-ordinator Mette Loyche Wilkie , a senior forestry office with FAO .
The area of ... forests undisturbed by human activity continues to decrease , so countries must further strengthen their efforts to conserve and manage them
Eduardo Rojas , FAO
" This is the first time we 've been able to say that the deforestation rate is going down across the world , and certainly when you look at the net rate that is certainly down .
" But the situation in some countries is still alarming , " she told BBC News .
The last decade saw forests being lost or converted at a rate of 13 million hectares per year , compared to 16 million hectares in the 1990s .
However , new forests were being planted to the tune of more than seven million hectares per year ; so the net rate of loss since the year 2000 has been 5.2 million hectares per year , compared to 8.3 million in the 1990s .
Globally , forests now cover about 31 % of the Earth 's land surface .
The biggest change has been in Asia which now reports a net forest growth
The biggest losses of forest occurred in Brazil , Indonesia and Australia .
Australia 's reduction of half a million hectares per year is principally down to the drought conditions that have covered most of the country in recent years , thought to be a consequence of global climate change .
The Indonesian and Brazilian figures were not such a surprise , with both countries possessing vast tracts of forest and major logging industries ; and deforestation is slowing .
" Both Brazil and Indonesia are reporting a significant drop in the loss of forests , " said Dr Loyche Wilkie .
" In Brazil it 's spectacular , and that 's largely because there is a political goal to reduce deforestation by 80 % by 2020 and that 's supported by the president . "
Business leaves forest footprints
As deforestation has fallen , there has also been an increase in the planting of new forests , particularly in China , leading to a net increase in national forest cover of three million hectares per year .
But the programme - aimed at preventing desertification , reducing flooding and protecting farmland - is due to end in 2020 , and if it does , the FAO points out , that will rapidly lead to an increase in the net loss of forest figure .
India and Vietnam have also mounted significant forest - planting programmes , the FAO notes .
UN agencies hope the net rate of loss will be slowed further in coming years if the climate change - related initiative on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ( REDD ) comes to fruition .
Diverse roots
The Global Forest Resources Assessment is principally based on data submitted by governments .
Details also include how forests are regulated and how they are used ; and here , there are also some encouraging trends , according to Eduardo Rojas , assistant director - general of FAO 's forestry department .
" Not only have countries improved their forest policies and legislation , they have also allocated forests for use by local communities and indigenous peoples and for the conservation of biological diversity and other environmental functions . , " he said .
" However , the rate of deforestation is still very high in many countries and the area of primary forest - forests undisturbed by human activity - continues to decrease , so countries must further strengthen their efforts to better conserve and manage them . "
The FAO is conducting another survey using satellite observations that they hope will provide a much more detailed assessment , and should be published at the end of next year .

The Mac OS X Finder column view is really handy , letting you see multiple folder contents side by side in a hierarchical view .
But unless you set the default column width yourself , anytime you launch a new Finder window , the columns size will be reset on a per window basis .
How to Set Default Column Size in Mac Finder
Changing the default column size behavior is very simple , and if you want to set the default column size for Column View in Finder of MacOS and Mac OS X , all you need to do is hover the mouse cursor over the column dividers of a Finder window , then hold down the Option key while dragging the columns to your desired width or size .
With the Option key modifier held as you resize , this will become the new default for Column Views in the Mac Finder .
If you ’re tired of the Column view resizing itself or being reset on the Mac , this is the solution you ’re looking for since it will lock as the default column width and column size .
This works in all versions of MacOS and Mac OS X that support Column View , and it ’s an easy trick to remember even if it ’s not the most obvious thing in the world .
If you ’re a column view user for Finder , try it out , you ’ll find this to be quite useful .
And yes , you must be in Finder Column View to have this work , it does not work in the other Finder views since there is no divider to align and set the width of .
Note that the Option / ALT key trick is intended for most keyboards and a US keyboard set , but some users may find the Command key to work depending on their keyboard layout and keyboard country settings .
Another similar handy trick is to resize column view to fit file names , discussed here .
If you ’re working in Column view with long file names , it ’s particularly handy .
Let us know in the comments what works for you , and share your experiences and tips if you have another approach to accomplish this task .
When Amy Bishop was hired by the University of Alabama in Huntsville seven years ago , she appeared to have everything going for her : she was young , Harvard - trained , passionate about her field , a mother of four .
But there were many things that her new colleagues did n’t know .
They did n’t know her adviser at Harvard had forced her to resign her post - doctoral fellowship .
They did n’t know she and her husband had been questioned by federal investigators in connection with a plot to kill that adviser : after Bishop resigned from his laboratory he received a package at his home containing a pipe bomb .
They did n’t know that , in 2002 , she had been arrested at an International House of Pancakes in Massachusetts after punching a woman who ’d taken a booster chair she ’d wanted for one of her children .
( ‘ I am Amy Bishop ! ’ she ’d screamed . )
They did n’t know that , in 1986 , she had ‘ accidentally ’ killed her 18 - year - old brother Seth with a shotgun in the family ’s Victorian mansion in Braintree , Massachusetts ; or that she ’d fled the scene , shotgun in hand and another round in her pocket , and held up an auto dealership , claiming that her husband ( this was before she had a husband ) was threatening to kill her and demanding a getaway car .
In other words , when Bishop killed three of her colleagues on 12 February because she ’d been denied tenure , she had no criminal record .
She was never convicted of assault in the ‘ pancake rage ’ affair , merely put on probation and encouraged to take anger - management classes ; and the death of her brother was judged an accident by the local police .
Clearly there was no reason for her to bring these things up when she applied for her job .
There were , of course , people who had noticed she was a little crazy – ‘ within striking distance of the edge ’ , as one person put it .
But reference letters tend not to include outspoken appraisals of a candidate ’s personality : employers are afraid of lawsuits .
If Bishop had a sense of impunity , it ’s no wonder .
She was white , well - connected and well - off .
She ’d long been coddled by the law , and until Huntsville there seemed to be nothing she could n’t get away with .
In 1986 , for example , she was immediately released by the police , even though she refused to put her gun down when they first tried to arrest her .
One of the investigators in Braintree decided she was ‘ too emotional to interview ’ , so she was n’t questioned for another 11 days .
Sitting beside her mother , Judith Bishop , an influential member of the town committee , she explained that she wanted to learn how to use her father ’s shotgun just in case a robber came by , and that the gun had accidentally gone off when she was trying to unload it ; her botched experiment just happened to take place after a family argument .
The police were satisfied with her explanation : no charges were filed , not even for firing a gun without a permit .
‘ You can not imagine how kind the Braintree police were to us , ’ Judith Bishop told a local paper .
Indeed they were .
After a group of neighbours cleaned up Seth Bishop ’s blood from the kitchen floor , a police investigator paid a visit to see if the family needed any food .
Amy Bishop ’s behaviour after the killing was n’t even reported to the state authorities investigating the case .
Now the case is under review .
No one in Huntsville knew about the pipe bomb investigation either , and for the first few years at least , Bishop was mostly on good behaviour .
She struck her colleagues as ‘ funny and extroverted ’ , though some noticed she could also be arrogant , and brooked no dissent : ‘ arguing with Amy was a one - way street . ’
Displaying an entrepreneurial streak that made them minor celebrities in Huntsville , Bishop and her husband , James Anderson , created and patented a ‘ portable cell incubator ’ , designed to keep nerve cells alive longer and make experiments easier .
It was really just a fancy Petri dish – she was n’t much of a scientist , contrary to some claims about her genius in the blogosphere – but they talked the university into marketing the device .
The president declared proudly that it would ‘ change the way biological and medical research was conducted ’ .
Bishop ’s smiling face graced the cover of the Huntsville R&D Report in the winter of 2009 , and Anderson ’s company , Prodigy Biosystems , raised $ 1.25 million to develop the device .
In part of her mind Bishop knew things were n’t that rosy .
She was also a novelist – the second cousin of John Irving , she often boasted – and in her three novels ( so far unpublished ) she was less confident of her prospects .
The heroine of the most recent , Amazon Fever , is a female scientist at an Alabama university who is burdened by guilt over the death of her brother , and afraid that she wo n’t get tenure before the world ends – a herpes - like virus has spread , causing pregnant women everywhere to miscarry .
( Bishop had a scientific interest in herpes , and after the killing spree in Huntsville , campus police were notified by people close to the university ’s biology department that she might have booby - trapped the science building with a ‘ herpes bomb ’ . )
In March 2009 , the university denied her tenure bid on the basis that her research and publication record was inadequate .
Though she appealed the decision – according to one colleague , her attitude was ‘ when are these idiots going to clear this up ? ’ – she may have understood how weak her case was .
She had n’t published anything in 2007 or 2008 , and her last paper was co-signed not only by her husband but by three of their four children , none of them older than 18 .
That article appeared in the International Journal of General Medicine , which is published by Dove , a vanity press which , according to its website , ‘ will publish your paper if it is deemed of interest to someone .
Therefore your chance of having your paper accepted is very high – it would be a very unusual paper that was n’t of interest to someone . ’
When the story first broke , much of the discussion revolved around tenure and gender discrimination .
In Psychology Today , Katherine van Wormer said she ‘ instinctively grasped the pain that had driven this apparently violence - prone woman to take her revenge ’ , and wondered : ‘ Given the strong emotions related to tenure denial , one question is why does it lead to homicide so rarely ? ’
Had Amy snapped because of the ‘ brutal ’ rejection inflicted by the university ?
Was she giving it to The Man , payback for the exclusion of women in science departments ( never mind that one of her victims was a female colleague ) ?
Calls to improve the tenure process were raised ; otherwise , one academic suggested , ‘ going professor ’ might share a place alongside ‘ going postal ’ in the lexicon of American mass murder .
But since then the story has swung : Bishop has gone from being the female avenger to being the daughter of privilege , a spoiled sociopath who got away with murder because of her class and Harvard pedigree .
The right - wing blogosphere , from comparatively mainstream journals like the Christian neo-conservative First Things to more wild - eyed sites , seizing on her enthusiasm for Obama , now refer to her as the ‘ socialist professor ’ .
Will nothing go Obama ’s way ?
I have never seen conservatives and liberals so divided . . . in beliefs , not values .
On the one hand , there are people like the TNR crew , and Jonathan Bernstein , Andrew 's guest - blogger , who seem to think that this it 's the next best thing to a done deal .
Meanwhile , all the conservatives and libertarians I know think that it 's pretty much hopeless , because Pelosi can't get it through an increasingly rebellious House .
To our jaded eyes it looks as if everyone who can is looking for an excuse not to vote for a bill that is unpopular with their constituents .
The opinions on both sides seem so confident , and so incompatible , that one group of people is clearly borderline delusional .
I do n't see how they can be right -- even if passing health care makes the party better off ( I'm doubtful ) , it does not improve the fortunes of members in conservative districts who do not get much mileage out of their affiliation with the Democratic Party ( and will get even less mileage if they are seen as enabling unpopular legislation ) .
But of course , borderline delusional people do n't think they 're delusional , or else they would n't be delusional .
So there you are : either it 's a done deal , or it 's dead .
There 's no longer much middle ground in between .
Two pieces of evidence : Pelosi seems to be losing yes votes .
On the other hand , it 's not clear that Republicans understand that at this point , the only thing they can delay or destroy is the fixes , not the bill itself ... which is a problem , because the only weapon they have left is a credible threat to torpedo the fixes and let the bill stand exactly as the Senate passed it .
We report , you decide .
Since I just announced my 125th career as a News Anchor ( and 126th as a Computer Engineer ! ) , I think it ’s time I cover my first piece of breaking news that also has a computer twist to it !
My 10th and final Woman to Watch in 2010 is MacArthur Fellow Yoky Matsuoka !
Not only does this super - smart doll boast top science degrees from Berkeley and MIT , but she ’s also currently educating others in the emerging field of neurobotics at the University of Washington .
Pretty inspiring , no ?
As a true trailblazer and innovator in neurobiotics , Yoky engineers and builds advanced prosthetic limbs ( think : robotic hands that look and act like real human hands ) so she can help change lives .
Her achievements are totally amazing , heart - warming and motivating .
What else do I love ?
This totally savvy scientist proves that young women everywhere can achieve anything they put their big brains to and look fashionable doing it .

Google 's relations with Beijing were never going to be smooth Google 's move into China four years ago was billed by some people as a battle between the irresistible force and the immovable object .
The inexorable expansion of the internet - epitomised by Google - would never exist happily in a command economy like China , said critics .
By taking its search engine onto Chinese soil - and thus agreeing to Beijing 's censorship rules - Google was accused of trading reputation for profit .
On Monday , however , Google pulled its search facility out of mainland China , redirecting users to an uncensored site in Hong Kong .
What now for both profits and reputation ?
Has it shut the door on the world 's biggest internet market ?
The Great Firewall China has hit back at Google , limiting its citizens ' use of the search facility through web filters that are collectively known as the Great Firewall .
And some of Google 's business partners are already starting to distance themselves from the company .
On Wednesday China 's second - largest mobile operator , Unicom , announced that it would drop Google 's search function from two new handsets that are being developed .
Google has taken a hard - headed business decision
Graham Titterington Principal analyst , Ovum Official Chinese figures put the number of internet users at 384 million .
But the number of mobile subscribers - people who do or will eventually - use the internet on their handsets is 745 million .
At Sina Corp , which owns a portal featuring a Google search bar on its main page , executives are considering the future of link with the US giant .
And there are several other news reports from China about how Google 's partners and advertisers are reviewing their relationships with the internet giant .
These moves underline the potential impact on Google 's business .
On the face of it , picking a fight with the rulers of what is soon to be the world 's biggest economy looks like commercial stupidity .
Today 's business mantra says that any company which wants to be global has to do business with China .
And yet , there is a growing consensus among analysts that Google 's move will have only limited impact on its business .
Google 's share price had fallen about 6 % since the company announced on 12 January that it was considering a withdrawal from China .
But since Monday , when the final decision was made , the shares have been rising .
Do n't Be Evil Google , whose motto Do n't Be Evil was tarnished by the move to China , has won plaudits in the blogosphere and among the commentariat for its decision to withdraw .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
The company has stood up for free speech and unfettered enterprise , they say .
These are fine words , says technology analyst Graham Titterington , but in reality they are just " fluff " .
" Google has taken a hard - headed business decision , " he said .
Mr Titterington , principal analyst at Ovum , said : " Google has looked at the benefits and damage to its business , and made a decision on whether the move will do more harm than good . "
In the immediate term , Mr Titterington does not expect much damage because China remains a small part of the company 's operations .
" Indeed , outside China there will be some kudos and benefits to company and its brand image , " he said .
China 's total internet advertising market was worth about $ 1bn last year , with Google 's revenues from the country amounting to about $ 250 m - $ 300 m .
Chinese press has attacked Google 's decision
This revenue figure represents about 1 % to 2 % of Google 's total , estimates Youssef Squali , analyst at Jefferies & Co. Before Google moved to the mainland , it had perhaps 13 % of the China search market .
Going " onshore " took market share to about 20 % .
Even if Google 's share returns to 13 % or less , it is by no means critical for the company .
" Exiting China would not be too damaging for Google since the company is the market share leader in most non-domestic markets , where search usage and monetisation opportunities still abound , " Mr Squali said .
Besides , Google was already struggling to consolidate and grow in China .
For many analysts
Beijing clearly backed Baidu as the home - grown internet market leader .
Censorship Google also faced subtle - and not so subtle - attempts to restrict growth , and was already the subject of attacks from officials over alleged failure to comply with censorship rules .
It is likely that Google saw the writing on the wall a long time ago .
But , surely , losing a position in the world 's single biggest constituency of web users must be a retrograde step ?
After all , by 2014 the Chinese market for internet advertising could grow to as much as $ 20bn , according to estimates .
Mr Titterington agrees : " In the longer term , Google needs China more than China needs Google . "
But he does not believe Google will remain outside China forever .
In fact , he believes the company could be operating within the country again within three years .
" China is opening , and in time they [ the leaders ] will change and react , " he said .
Google may have anticipated China would relax its rigid control on society sooner than it has done .
But eventually it will happen .
" Politicians have to live with short memories .
At some stage they [ Google and Beijing ] will start co-operating again , " Mr Titterington said .
Baidu is the market leader for online search in China " The big question , though , will be how much momentum Google will have lost in the meantime . "
Will the growth of indigenous operators like Baidu effectively marginalise Google , making a return to China irrelevant ?
Not everyone is so optimistic that Google will make a quick return .
David Wolf , president of technology marketing consultancy Wolf Group , says it will take years for Google to rebuild partnerships in China .
" Trust me , [ Google ] are n't walking away from this unhurt , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Nor does the rhetoric coming from Beijing bode well for an early rehabilitation .
The Beijing government called Google 's withdrawal " totally wrong " , while the People 's Daily newspaper was even more strident .
The paper said Google was part of an internet war being orchestrated by the US intelligence services .
Herein lies a danger .
What is currently a dispute over business , risks becoming a dispute over politics - which would make it far more difficult for relations to heal .

Want to try out the latest build of the next Ubuntu release with almost no hassle at all ?
TestDrive is a one - shot tool that downloads , virtualizes , and keeps daily Ubuntu builds up to date .
TestDrive runs from the command line , but you literally enter only one number to make it work .
Run it from your Applications / System Tools menu , and a terminal prompt asks you to pick which daily build of Ubuntu you want to install .
Enter your number , hit return , and TestDrive gets to work downloading the latest ISO , turning it into a virtual machine , and then , if you have VirtualBox or KVM installed , launching it immediately .
Advertisement
The truly great part of TestDrive is that when you run it again , it uses the rsync command to see what 's changed in the daily build on Ubuntu 's servers , grabs only those changed bits and downloads them , then re-compiles your virtual machine and launches it anew .
If you want to change the memory and other settings TestDrive uses to set up its virtual machines , you can edit the /etc / testdriverc file , but the defaults are pretty sensible .

It would be icing on some tasty cake if this tool could be made to work for Windows users .
If that can be pulled off , or there 's a similar tool , do let us know in the comments .
In the meantime , it 's a free download for Ubuntu users , who can install it by running the command sudo add - apt - repository ppa:testdrive / ppa , then reloading their sources and installing the testdrive package .

MOSCOW —
When two bombs ripped through Moscow subway stations at rush hour on Monday morning , Russia ’s leaders reached for the kind of hunt - them - down - and - kill - them statements that propelled the country through two brutal wars in the Caucasus .
President Dmitri A. Medvedev boasted that previous bombers had been “ annihilated to ashes , ” calling them “ beasts , simply . ”
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin told the police to “ drag them out of the bottom of the sewer and into the light of God . ”
So it was a surprise , barely a day after images of bloodied commuters flooded Russian airwaves , when Mr. Medvedev made a point of publicly discussing poverty and unemployment in the North Caucasus , which he has said are the root causes of violence there .
He said that resolving those problems was “ even harder than looking for and destroying terrorists , ” but that he planned to continue pursuing both aims .
“ People want a normal and decent life , no matter where they live , ” he said , in a meeting with his top human rights adviser .
“ The federal authorities , along with the authorities in the Caucasus region , are obliged to create these conditions . ”
Monday ’s bombings came at an uncertain moment for Russia ’s Caucasus policy , which had been wavering between the muscular clampdown championed by Mr. Putin as president and the cautious liberalization introduced after Mr. Medvedev took office .
If attacks become a regular occurrence in Moscow , as they were for most of Mr. Putin ’s presidency , “ it means war , war against terrorism , ” said Aleksei V. Malashenko , a Caucasus specialist at the Carnegie Moscow Center .
If they are not repeated , he said , Mr. Medvedev could continue to steer away from Mr. Putin ’s approach , which relied almost entirely on force .
Mr. Malashenko pointed especially to a decision Mr. Medvedev made early this year , when he appointed the businessman Aleksandr G. Khloponin — not a general or a veteran of the F.S.B. security service — as his special envoy to the region , giving him the task of creating new jobs .
“ It meant they recognized the old approach was failing , ” he said .
“ I think this is the last hope .
If it fails once again , it is over . ”
No group has claimed responsibility for the bombings , which killed 39 people , but the authorities have said they believe that the attackers were from the North Caucasus , the restive border region that includes Chechnya , Ingushetia and Dagestan .
A law enforcement official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told the Interfax news agency on Tuesday that two female suicide bombers and their male companion had arrived in Moscow on Monday morning on a bus that carried shuttle traders from the North Caucasus .
The official said the bus driver had identified the women from photos .
He said suicide bombers had used the bus system to carry out two subway attacks in 2004 , since “ the passenger flow on private buses , unlike trains and planes , is virtually impossible to control , ” according to Interfax .
Follow the action as the former foreign secretary - and current justice secretary - becomes the first serving cabinet minister to give evidence to the Chilcot panel
12.02 pm : Jack Straw is giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry this afternoon - he's the first member of Gordon Brown 's cabinet to appear - and there are at least two letters he wrote to Tony Blair that are likely to come up .
The first is one that Straw sent to Blair in March 2002 , before his meeting with George Bush at Crawford .
We can read the whole thing because it was published in the Sunday Times at the weekend .
It 's not sensational , but it does reveal that Straw - who was foreign secretary at the time - was sceptical about going to war in Iraq and that he accurately anticipated many of the problems that subsequently arose .
Interestingly , Geoff Hoon , the then defence secretary , told the inquiry on Tuesday that he raised similar concerns with Blair before Crawford .
But the really interesting one is the secret letter that Straw sent to Blair in March 2003 , just before the war started .
He appears to have used it to urge Blair to pull out at the last minute , but the text has never been published and , as Patrick Wintour said in a story about this recently , the contents remain " one of the great mysteries of the high politics of the British invasion " .
That said , there is plenty that we do know already about Straw 's reservations at the time .
In his biography Blair Unbound , Anthony Seldon describes what happened when Straw met Blair in Downing Street on 11 March 2003 , just after Donald Rumsfeld suggested an invasion could go ahead without the British .
' Jack said , " Here is an opportunity for the UK not to participate " , ' recalled one witness .
' I do n't recall anybody else saying the same thing .
Blair would have none of it ; he dismissed his suggestion out of hand . '
And here is what Seldon says about the secret letter .
After an anguished conversation with his close friend and adviser [ Michael Jay , head of the Foreign Office ] , [ Straw ] took up his pen one final time to write Blair a ' personal minute ' , urging him to think about alternatives ...
To colleagues , Straw explained his post - Azores letter to Blair as part of his ' duty ' as foreign secretary .
Yet Straw 's reservations went far further than that , and are a matter of record .
To some , his failure to speak out in cabinet was weak ; to others it was a fine demonstration of service .
The hearing starts at 2 pm .
See you then .
1.58 pm : Oh no !
Straw has prepared a " witness statement " for the inquiry .
And it runs to 8,000 words , according to Sky .
I presume the inquiry will put it up on its website when Straw starts speaking .
2.03 pm : The hearing has just started .
And the Straw memorandum is on the website now .
Here are some key extracts :
My decision to support military action in respect of Iraq was the most difficult decision I have ever faced in my life .
I had actively supported the military action in the Falklands and in the first Gulf War , whilst in opposition .
I had agreed as a member of the cabinet the action over Kosovo and Sierra Leone .
As foreign secretary I had been directly involved in the post - 9/11 strategy which had led to the invasion of Afghanistan .
But those choices were much easier .
Iraq was very different , and the moral as well as political dilemma were profoundly difficult .
If I was also fully aware that my support for military action was critical .
If I had refused that , the UK 's participation in the military action would not in practice have been possible .
There almost certainly would have been no majority , either in cabinet or in the Commons .
Those final three sentences are interesting .
Straw is saying that he could have single - handedly stopped Britain going to war .
That makes him sound tremendously self - important .
But it 's probably true .
2.14 pm : Straw has just told the hearing the the Iraq containment policy was a " stodge " by the summer of 2001 .
9/11 changed everything in the US , he said .
It was the largest loss of life on US soil since the Civil War .
I 'm still looking through his document .
2.16 pm : Here is Straw 's final paragraph :
I made my choice .
I have never backed away from it , and I do not intend to do so , and fully accept the responsibilities which flow from that .
I believed at the time , and I still believe , that we made the best judgments we could have done in the circumstances : we did so assiduously and on the best evidence we had available at the time .
2.18 pm : Some more points from the final pages of the Straw document :
• Straw said his assessment of the threat posed by Iraq " did evolve " from the beginning of 2002 .
• He said that if the weapons inspections had continued without an ultimatum , " all that would have happened is that the inspections process would have petered out , the unresolved disarmament questions would have remained unresolved and the Iraqi regime would have been re-emboldened " .
• He said the war had been the " most divisive " issue of his political lifetime .
• He said he " deeply regretted " the " grave loss of life " .
• He said the judgments made by the government were widely shared .
" ' It is for the Iraqi regime to end this crisis by complying with the demands of the security council ' was the view of the European Union , France , and Germany included .
It was my profound view too . "
• He cited Kierkegaard .
" To paraphrase Kierkegaard , whilst life can only be understood backwards , it has to be lived forward .
We do not have the benefit of hindsight . "
2.26 pm : In the hearing , Straw has criticised George Bush 's decision to link Iran , Iraq and North Korea in the axis of evil speech .
That made handling Iran " much more difficult " .
Asked about the government 's failure to anticipate problems in post - war Iraq , he also said " what we anticipated were different problems " .
Sir Roderic Lyne is questioning Straw now .
Lyne was a diplomat , so Straw is his old boss !
2.30 pm : From what I 've seen of it so far , the Straw memo does not seem to mention his last - minute " think again " letter to Blair .
( See 12.02 pm )
2.32 pm : Straw has just said this :
I do n't know what the difference is between a perception of risk and risk .
This was in response to a question from Lyne , who asked what the difference between the two was .
Straw says that , as justice secretary , he knows that you cannot tell someone worried about being burgled that they should not worry about it because , objectively , the risk of being burgled had gone down .
( That 's a good point , although ministers are often telling people that they should not worry so much about crime because the probability of being a crime victim has gone down . )
2.35 pm : Lyne mentions the memo published by the Sunday Times .
( See 12.02 pm ) Straw says the paper took it off a website .
He says it first appeared on the web in 2004 .
2.39 pm : Straw says :
Military action for regime change could not be an objective of British foreign policy .
2.40 pm : Straw says he offered Blair his " best judgment and his loyalty " .
He says he expected people who work for him to say when they disagree .
But he expects them to by loyal too .
That is the approach he took with Blair .
2.41 pm : I 've finished my preliminary skim through the Straw document .
His conclusions sound measured and sincere , and he goes through the diplomatic developments in lawyerly detail .
But there 's quite a lot that he does not write about .
He does not cover the legal advice he received about the war , and I did n't see a reference to the September dossier .
And , as I mentioned earlier , he does not comment on his private discussions with Blair .
Perhaps it will come up this afternoon .
Now I 'm tuning in and giving the hearing my full attention .
2.46 pm : Lyne asks if Iraq ever posed a terrorist threat .
Straw says there was no evidence that Iraq had been involved with al - Qaida .
There was evidence , however , that Saddam was ready to sponsor terrorism where he thought it was appropriate .
Straw says he cannot speculate on what would have happened if containment had been allowed to wither and die .
Lyne says containment could have been strengthened .
2.49 pm : Straw says he wants to make a point about intelligence .
Some things sit in the " psyche " of decison makers , he says .
During the Falklands , there were accusations that Lord Carrington , the then foreign secretary , had ignored intellegence .
This meant policy makers absorbed the lesson : take notice of intelligence .
2.52 pm : Lyne asks about Blair letters to Bush .
Straw says he saw some in draft , and some after they had been sent .
It depended where he was .
He spent a lot of time abroad .
On one occasion he spoke to Blair about one of the letters on a plane .
Asked if he saw all of them , he says : " I think so . "
He certainly saw all the key ones .
Lyne asks about one delivered by David Manning to Bush in late July 2002 .
He says the text is not in the public domain , but it has been written about .
Straw says he recalls the letter .
Lyne asks if Straw was " entirely comfortable " with what Blair said .
Straw said : " This would be easier if there were private sessions . "
He explains : " I happen to place a high value on the confidentiality of relations with foreign states . "
He says he had a very good relationship with David Manning , Blair 's foreign policy adviser .
He had known Manning for 20 years .
On the letter , he says :
Would I have written the memorandum in the same way ?
Probably not .
Straw says Blair had been close to the Clinton administration .
That led to " considerable suspicion " by the Bush adminstration about whether this " socialist " and the " worse socialists , or better socialists behind him " could be trusted .
Blair went to the US to push the Bush adminstration down the UN route , Straw says .
2.58 pm : Lyne says that the British support for the US led to an assumption on the part of the Americans that Britain would definitely support war .
Sir John Chilcot starts coughing badly .
Straw whips out some cough sweets and offers him one .
3.00 pm : Straw says regime change was never the objective of the British government .
Nor would I have ever been willing to be party to that .
But he concedes it was the American policy .
3.01 pm : Lyne asks about the conditions for Britain supporting the war .
Chilcot asks Straw to confirm that these were not pre-conditions without which Britain would not take part ; they were conditions designed to ensure that the strategy was successful .
Straw says that 's correct , although he points out that having a legal basis for war was an absolute condition .
3.04 pm : Straw talks about dealing with the Americans .
He says when he started the job he was influenced by three particular documents : the third volume of Skidelsky 's volume of Keynes ( which descibes how Keynes negotiated with the Americans : an internal Foreign Office paper on dealing with the Americans written by Roderic Braithwaite ; and a book by Sir Robin Renwich called Fighting with Allies .
3.07 pm : Lyne asks about a meeting Straw had with Colin Powell , the US secretary of state , in the summer of 2002 .
Straw , who obviously takes maintaining confidences quite seriously , says he does not want to quote from what Powell said .
But it is known that they shared similar views .
They 've stopped for a break .
I 'll summarise the key points in a moment .
3.12 pm : Here are the key points :
• Straw claimed that he could have stopped Britain going to war if he had wanted .
The implication of this is that he considered resigning , although he does not say this .
( See 2.03 pm )
• Straw said he was strongly opposed to regime change .
But he hinted that Blair did not feel about this as strongly as he did .
( See 2.40 pm and 3 pm )
• Straw said at one he would have felt more comfortable giving evidence in private .
( See 2.52 pm )
3.23 pm : The Press Association has got a good version of a key exchange about regime change .
Here it is :
Straw said :
[ Regime change ] was off the agenda as far as the UK was concerned .
A foreign policy objective of regime change I regard as improper and also self - evidently unlawful .
It had no chance of being a runner in the UK , it certainly would not have got my support .
The case therefore stood or fell on whether Iraq posed a threat to international peace and security by reason of its weapons of mass destruction .
Lyne asked if Blair shared this view .
Straw replied :
I think the best way to find that out is to ask him .
We are two different people .
Then Lyne said :
But one government .
I am trying to find out what the government 's policy is .
Straw replied :
It is no great surprise to know that people at senior levels in government hold different views and debate those .
What I had to offer the Prime Minister was my best judgment and my loyalty .
3.28 pm : They 're back , and talking about Israel .
Straw says Israel has a " completely ridiculous system of proportional representation " .
That wo n't surprise those in the Labour party who suspect Straw is trying to stop the Commons debating electoral reform before the election .
3.29 pm : Straw was Blair was " relentless " in trying to get Washington to take more interest in the Middle East peace process .
It was unfortunate that he was not successful , he says .
Lyne says Blair and Straw were pushing Bush in one direction .
But the Israelis were pushing Bush in another direction " and the Israelis won " .
Straw says getting Bush to back a road map for the Middle East was an achievement .
But he seems to concede the point .
Lyne suggests Britain " failed " .
And I miss the answer .
I 've been following on Sky and they decide to pull out .
3.35 pm : Sir Lawrence Freedman is asking the questions now .
He asks Straw if it 's true that the cabinet would not have supported war if the UN had not been involved .
Straw says that 's correct .
Freedman suggests this means autumn 2002 was a critical moment .
Straw says many in the US adminstration were opposed to the UN .
Britain was embarked on a strategy that could have led to a peaceful resolution of the dispute .
3.39 pm : Straw says that , as someone who " cared about the United Nations and aware of the history of the failure of the League of Nations pre-war " , that maintaining the authority of the UN was very important .
3.43 pm : Freedman says that Sir David Omand said yesterday that , if you were to look hard at the intelligence on Iraq , you might conclude : " Is that all there is ? "
Freedman says Straw at one point described the intelligence as " thin " .
Straw does not seem to recognise this .
He says that if Freedman says he has used the description , he will take his word for it .
Straw says that the case for war did not just rely on intelligence .
He writes about this at length in his 8,000 - word memo .
3.46 pm : Freedman asks about Blair 's decision to use the phrase " beyond doubt " in relation to the intelligence in the September dossier .
Straw says the dossier was not as important as Freedman suggests .
Andrew Gilligan , the BBC journalist , described the dossier as " dull " after it was published , Straw says .
There has been an assumption that the public reception of the dossier was ' My God , have you seen this ' ...
It was n't .
It was treated as telling people what they already knew .
Freedman suggests the document was important given the " criticality " of the moment .
Criticality - that 's a new word for me .
3.50 pm : Sir John Chilcot asks about the headlines that appeared in some papers after the publication of the September dossier suggesting Iraqi missiles could hit British troops in 45 minutes .
Did anyone try to correct them ?
Straw says he read Alastair Campbell 's judgment .
He thought Campbell was saying it was not within the power of Number 10 to correct those headlines .
But he accepts that the 45 - minute claim should have been much clearer .
3.53 pm : Straw says his whole aim during this period was to resolve the dispute through peaceful means .
He says people of the " highest integrity " , like John Scarlett and David Omand , were involved in the preparation of the September dossier .
He also says an International Institute of Strategic Studies report published two weeks before the publication of the September dossier contained an even more alarming assessement of the threat from Iraq .
3.56 pm : Straw says intelligence is " patchy and sporadic " by its very nature .
He says he made this point in his memo .
He 's right .
Here 's a quote from the memo :
Intelligence gathering in any environment is by its nature difficult .
The picture presented is inevitably going to be partial and incomplete .
This is true in any circumstances , but was especially true for closed authoritarian societies , with ruthless systems of enforcement , like Iraq .
That does rather contradict what Blair said in his foreword to the September dossier about the intelligence establishing " beyond doubt " that Iraq had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons .
4.03 pm : Freedman mentions something Straw said in his memo .
Straw revealed that he told two Times journalists on an unattributable basis in early January 2003 that the odds of avoiding war were 60/40 .
4.06 pm : Freedman says there was an assumption in early 2003 in the papers - I presume he means government papers - that if the pressure on Saddam became severe , there might be a coup .
Straw confirms that that is the case .
Freedman asks what would have constituted a " material breach " of UN security council resolution 1441 .
Straw says this was set out in " OP4 " of the resolution .
That 's operative paragraph 4 .
Freedman says people expected the weapons inspectors to find a smoking gun .
Straw says the inspectors did find things .
They discovered missiles with a greater range than UN rules allowed .
I think what you are asking is was compliance impossible for Saddam in the circumstances ...
My short answer to that is no .
The resolution required " cooperation " .
It did not say that unless Saddam produced a certain amount of mustard gas etc , there would be war .
If Saddam had cooperated with the inspectors , and allowed scientists to be interviewed , " that would have been the end of it " , Straw says .
4.14 pm : Straw says the level of international consensus that Iraq had WMD was " very broad " .
There was " no war party " on the UN security council .
If Hans Blix had said " this regime is complying " , that would have been the end of it from the point of view of the UK .
" The strategy of 1441 would have succeeded , " he says .
Freedman says David Omand complained yesterday that MI6 " overpromised and under - delivered " on the intelligence .
Straw says he used to question people from MI6 about the intelligence .
He was concerned " we were n't getting as much intelligence as we ought to " .
But he quotes from something Hans Blix wrote in his book after the conflict .
Blix said :
My gut feeling , which I kept to myself , suggested that Iraq still engaged in prohibited activities and retained prohibited items , and that it had the documents to prove it .
But it 's not clear from what Straw is saying at what point Blix was experiencing this " gut feeling " .
They 've now stopped for another short break .
4.23 pm : It 's been a slightly scrappy hearing so far .
The questioning has veered from subject to subject and the revelations have been low - grade .
Here are the latest of them :
• Straw complained to MI6 that he was not happy with the quality of intelligence coming out of Iraq .
( See 4.14 pm )
• He said that intelligence is " patchy and sporadic " by nature and ( in his memorandum ) that it is " inevitably going to be partial and complete " .
( See 3.56 pm )
• He said the 45 - minute claim in the September dossier should have been clearer .
( See 3.50 pm )
4.31 pm : Freedman says that resolution 1441 was designed to ensure that Britain and America did not need a second resolution to go to war .
So why did the government go for a second resolution ?
Straw says getting a second resolution would have made the handling of the matter easier in the UK .
The government also wanted to give Iraq a second final opportunity .
The proposed second resolution had clear benchmarks .
Straw thought this would ensure compliance .
Freedman asks when it became clear that there would not be a second resolution .
Straw says between March 7 and March 14 .
The moment when he saw President Chirac on television say that , whatever the circumstances , France would veto a second resolution was the moment he realised it would not happen .
Chirac 's move was designed to stop the second resolution happening , Straw says .
After Chirac gave his interview , the president of Mexico admitted himself to hospital with a bad back .
Straw says this was a surprise because no one realised his condition has become acute .
But it meant the alliance in favour of a second resolution fell away .
4.36 pm : Freedman asks if the military planning created a deadline .
Straw says some in the US wanted to invade in January .
The British wanted to delay .
Straw spoke to Colin Powell - a former head of the US armed forces - how long troops could be kept on standby without the force " degrading " .
Powell said they would have to go by late March or early April .
Freedman suggests there were " two contradictory timetables " .
Chilcot intervenes .
He suggests the critical moment was right at the final moment because that was when pressure on Iraq was most intense .
Straw says one of his " great frustrations " was that the French and the Germans did not agree to a second resolution .
That would have enabled the dispute to be resolved peacefully .
Military action would have been delayed .
Straw says Blix and his team needed to interview Iraqi scientists .
If this had happened , and if Blix had concluded that the Iraqi WMD programme was degraded , then war would have been avoided .
Freedman says
Blix did not want to take scientists out of Iraq .
Straw says : " He never said that to me . "
He goes on :
There are some of those who were involved who have sought to give an account of what they said at the time without gloss .
Others have given an account of what they said at the time " with gloss " .
It is not clear which camp Blix is in , Straw says .
4.45 pm : Straw says he had a meeting with Hans Blix .
He told Blix he had read " every word " of the document that Blix was presenting to the UN security council .
Blix replied : " That 's more than I have done . "
Straw says he was astonished .
The following day , at the UN security council meeting , a copy of Blix 's document was not available .
Straw says UNMOVIC , the United Nations monitoring , verification and inspection commission produced it .
In his memorandum , he says that the report convinced him that Iraq 's non-compliance with the UN was profound .
The UNMOVIC document was published on March 7 2003 , but only after the ministerial security council meeting at which it should have been discussed .
4.52 pm : Straw says he does not know what the Americans would have done if Blix had said Iraq was complying .
But he personally would not have supported war if Blix had said Iraq was complying .
And , even if he had still been in favour of war , there would not have been " a dog 's chance " of getting that through the House of Commons .
The March report from Blix concluded the Iraqis were not complying with the UN requirements .
But Straw again said it was strange that Blix did not release it until after the relevant UN meeting .
4.57 pm : Freedman says one interpretation of what Chirac said was that he did not want a second resolution then , not that he did not want a second resolution at any point .
Straw says there has been textual analysis of Chirac 's use of " le soir " .
But this was " a great Chiracian pronouncement " .
He was ruling out a second resolution " whatever the circumstances " .
5.01 pm : Freedman says the Americans went along with plans to get a second resolution " as a favour to the UK " .
Is that correct ?
Straw says it would have been easier for the government to win the vote in parliament with a second resolution .
A second resolution might also have avoided war , he says .
Freedman asks if there was a point where Straw and colleagues thought ' let 's stop and think .
Do we need to take another course ? "
Straw says he was " profoundly concerned " about the anger of the British public , " which included many friends of mine " .
Many of the Muslims in his constituency were opposed .
And many of the non-Muslims were opposed too .
Freedman asks if there was a " plan B " when it became clear there would not be a second resolution .
Straw says in February it was not clear that there would not be a second resolution .
5.04 pm : Straw says :
I thought about , and made submissions , about alternative approaches .
Freedman asks Straw if it is true that he suggested Britain not taking part in the military invasion .
Yes , says Straw .
That 's the first time he has confirmed this , I think .
He is saying he told Blair to considering pulling out of the invasion .
5.06 pm : Freedman asks Straw how his advice was received .
Straw replies :
You 'll have to ask Mr Blair , this .
Straw has used the " Mr Blair " several times in the hearing .
It sounds very formal , given that they used to be close colleagues .
He says he submitted his ideas in a formal minute .
It was " far too serious " to do verbally , he suggests .
Straw says he " may " have discussed his alternative approach with Geoff Hoon .
He did not discuss it with Clare Short .
He discussed his views with colleagues in his office , and with David Manning and Colin Powell .
Freedman reminds
Straw of what he said in his memo about his position being critical .
Was there any point at which he contemplated resigning ?
Straw replies :
I never got to that point .
I have been very anxious in all of this not to put a gloss on what I was thinking at the time .
You 're historians .
It 's very easy to do .
He says an " absolutely fundamental point " was the role of the Commons .
He thought it was " preposterous " that the Commons never voted on the Falklands war .
Had I not got agreement that we had to have a series of debates on substantive resolutions ... then I would not have been able to continue in my job .
He goes on :
Did I ever think I 'm going to resign over this .
No .
We all have our bottom lines .
But it did weigh " heavily " .
He supported the war " very reluctantly " .
5.12 pm : Straw says the minutes he wrote to Blair were not ciculated to the cabinet .
He says he knows the inquiry team have seen them .
Straw seems to be coughing a lot .
A sign of nerves ?
He goes on :
Was there a cabinet or cabinet committee where my alternative was discussed ?
The answer to that is no .
Freedman asks who knew about Straw 's concerns .
Straw says
Hoon knew about them .
And Gordon Brown did too .
It was extremely important in terms of international diplomacy that we were talking with one voice .
Freedman asks what other ministers thought .
Straw is avoiding the question .
He says he was making proposals based on a contingency .
At that time they thought they might not get a majority in the Commons .
But he does n't tell us what Brown said when he raised his concerns with him .
Freedman does not pursue the question , and so we do n't get an answer .
5.17 pm : Straw says that the Foreign Office acquired protective clothing for its staff in Iraq because it was so worried about Saddam using chemical and biological weapons .
5.21 pm : Sir Roderic
Lyne asks for a clarification about Chirac .
Chirac 's comments were ambiguous .
Did Straw go back to the French to try to find out what he really meant ?
Or did he just say , ' that 's it , game over ' ?
Straw says he watched Chirac make that statement .
" My French is n't bad . "
Although it was not a formal government statement , it was , " President Chirac pronouncing to La France " .
Straw said he assumed that Chirac knew what he was doing .
Lyne says he takes that to mean that Straw did not go back to the French .
Straw says he wil check .
5.24 pm : Chilcot says that Straw is coming back for a second evidence session in the next week or so .
And , with that , he winds up the hearing .
Well , finally it did take off .
I 'll sum up in a moment .
5.30 pm : Before I sum up , a colleague points out that I missed one good line from Straw .
At one point he told the panel : " You 'll need to talk to Robin Cook about that . "
Sadly , that 's not going to be possible .
5.33 pm : Here are the highlights from the last hour .
• Straw confirmed that he told Blair at the last moment to consider an alternative to going to war .
( See 5.04 pm and 5.06 pm )
• He said that he discussed his doubts about the war with Geoff Hoon and Gordon Brown .
( See 5.17 pm )
• He sidestepped a question about whether Brown shared his concerns .
( See 5.17 pm )
• He said that he did not consider resigning over going to war .
( See 5.06 pm )
• But he said that he would have resigned if Blair had refused to allow the Commons to have a vote on going to war .
( See 5.06 pm )
• He said that Hans Blix , the UN weapons inspector , had not read a 167 - page report produced by his own team of inspectors just before it was due to be presented to the UN .
( See 4.45 pm )
5.59 pm : After a week or so of hearings where the questioning has been fine , this was one of those sessions that left me wishing Sir John Chilcot had a journalist on the panel .
Straw gave a reasonably candid account of his involvement in the run-up to the war and the written memo he submitted suggests that he has thought deeply about the pros and cons of what had happened .
But the really interesting questions were the ones that did not get asked or , if they did get asked , did not get answered .
Straw told us that he advised Blair to consider " alternative approaches " at the last minute .
But we did not find out exactly when , or how ?
Straw was asked how Blair reacted , but he fobbed the inquiry off with a " you 'll have to ask him " and he was not asked what he felt about having his suggestions rejected .
And he told us that he had discussed his concerns with Gordon Brown .
But he dodged a question about Brown 's reaction and the panel did not chase him up .
One reader who has been emailing me about the hearings suggests that today 's session will increase the chance of Gordon Brown giving evidence before the election .
He may have a point .
That 's it for today .
Thanks for the comments .
Many insects can survive for long periods of time under water , but the brightly - colored Hawaiian Hyposmocoma moth has a unique evolutionary trait :
It can live half its life underwater .
Scientists call it the only known " perfectly amphibious " creature .

A study by environmental scientists published today in PNAS explores the life of this astonishing moth , whose larvae can live weeks underwater - or on dry land .
Natives of Hawaiian mountains , Hyposmocoma spend the first weeks of their lives as larvae before they weave themselves into cocoons and emerge as flying moths .
During this larva stage , they can choose to live in rushing streams , attaching themselves to rocks with silk drag lines , or they can nestle in nearby volcanic rocks .
They remain protected in part by " casings , " shell - like coverings for their bodies that come in a variety of sizes and colors .

According to a release about the study :
Daniel Rubinoff and Patrick Schmitz observed larvae of the moth genus Hyposmocoma feeding and breathing both underwater and away from streams on dry rocks and sequenced the caterpillars ' genes to reconstruct their evolutionary history .
Although many insects are able to withstand extreme conditions in a dormant state , no previously known insect can survive an entire life cycle above and below the water 's surface .

How do they survive underwater ?
Rubinoff and Schmitz are n't entirely sure , but they speculate in their paper that " they likely rely on direct diffusion of oxygen through the hydrophilic skin along their abdomens . "
Because they 're essentially sucking oxygen out of the water using their bellies , these larvae can only survive in fast - flowing streams full of water bubbles .
They die in stagnant water .
Though Hyposmocoma are a land - dwelling creature , the scientists have discovered that they 've evolved this aquatic ability no less than three times during their long evolution on the Hawaiian Islands - likely because they exist in a habitat where food is as likely to come from the water as it is from dry land .
They call these insects " unique " and " remarkable " because no other creature has yet evolved the ability to live entirely submerged or entirely on land .

WASHINGTON - Naturally occurring methane hydrate may represent an enormous source of methane , the main component of natural gas , and could ultimately augment conventional natural gas supplies , says a new congressionally mandated report from the National Research Council .
Although a number of challenges require attention before commercial production can be realized , no technical challenges have been identified as insurmountable .
Moreover , the U.S. Department of Energy 's Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program has made considerable progress in the past five years toward understanding and developing methane hydrate as a possible energy resource .
" DOE 's program and programs in the national and international research community provide increasing confidence from a technical standpoint that some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025 , " said Charles Paull , chair of the committee that wrote the report , and senior scientist , Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California .
" With global energy demand projected to increase , unconventional resources such as methane hydrate become important to consider as part of the future U.S. energy portfolio and could help provide more energy security for the United States . "
Methane hydrate , a solid composed of methane and water , occurs in abundance on the world 's continental margins and in permafrost regions , such as in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska 's North Slope .
Although the total global volume of methane in methane hydrate is still debated , estimates yield figures that are significant compared with the global supplies of conventional natural gas .
The existence of such a large and untapped energy resource has provided a strong global incentive to determine how methane might be produced from methane hydrate safely , economically , and in an environmentally sensible way .
Some of the remaining challenges to production identified by the committee include developing the technology necessary to produce methane from methane hydrate and understanding methane hydrate 's potential to behave as a geohazard .
For example , industry practice is to avoid methane - hydrate bearing areas during drilling for conventional oil and gas resources for safety reasons .
However , avoidance will not be possible if methane hydrate is the production target .
In addition , the committee recommended research and development areas for DOE 's program , such as designing production tests , appraising and mitigating environmental issues related to production , and determining with greater accuracy the methane hydrate resources on the Alaska North Slope and in marine reservoirs .

Conan O’Brien got screwed .
That ’s obvious .
What is n’t obvious is how he plans to pick himself back up from the royal beating that NBC has given him .
Sure , it ’s very possible that NBC will take Tuesday 's press release to heart , kick Leno aside , and give Conan his timeslot , but it ’s even more likely that they ’ll stand their ground , giveback to Leno , and leave the Redheaded Wonder in the dust .
And while a - like trip to a beach in Mexico sounds great to most of us , it would be a great waste for Conan to remain unemployed .
So what does a man of his stature ( no , not just his height ) do now ?
There are the supposed offers from other networks , namely Fox .
On a channel like Fox , he ’d likely be allowed to bring back the tone from hisdays , opting for more obscure humor than he was allowed to do on ( the masturbating bear ! ) .
But what ’s the likeliness that a brand new talk show – even one from Conan – would have enough success to rival the other networks ?
Conan would likely have to fight an uphill battle against two late night juggernauts : Letterman and Leno , as well as cult favorite Jimmy Kimmel .
If nothing else , he could probably beat Kimmel in the ratings , but Fox 's affiliates do n't even seem keen on joining the late night world .
He could head back to his writing roots .
Before he was chosen out of obscurity , Conan was writing classic episodes ofand .
It 's widely know that Conan has always been a writer at heart ; he was , after all , the editor ofduring his college years .
But who could really see Conan taking that kind of step back ?
It 's an idealist 's view if there ever was one .
We 'd all love to see Conan bringback to its prime years or even script a pilot or two , but writing is generally a background position ( unless , of course , you 're Tina Fey ) , and it seems highly unlikely that Conan would want to step out of the spotlight completely ; he 's gotten way too good at performing .
But what seems like the best but least likely and least talked - about option is for Conan to go online .
Recently , television has become less regarded as a ‘ push ’ form of media and has become more of a ‘ pull ’ form of entertainment , meaning that we choose what we want to see and when we want to see it .
We TiVo our favorite TV shows and watch them when it ’s convenient for us ( after dinner , before school ) .
We stream shows on websites like Netflix , Hulu , and many of the networks ’ own websites .
We purchase full seasons of televisions shows on DVDs , opting to skip them entirely during their original airing .
The internet will eventually suffocate conventional television and it will be those who understand the dynamics of this new era who survive .
This is great for not only viewers but advertisers as well .
Leo Laporte of TWiT.tv has found enormous success in playing to a specific niche .
His goal is to create a 24/7 online tech channel , and so far , he 's doing pretty damn well at doing so .
Recently , he revealed that he pulls in about $ 1.5 million annually while only spending about $ 350,000 on his website – that includes costs for over ten podcasts and shows , seven employees , and a lot of expensive recording equipment .
Laporte is able to do this because he offers his advertisers prime customers .
Companies do n't have to spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to air a commercial that only a fraction of viewers will care about .
Instead , they pay a few thousand dollars to have their ads play for a group that is actually interested in their product .
Laporte also benefits from having a large amount of listener support , so much so that he recently announced that listener donations would be used to pay his salary and that he would no longer personally pocket ad money .
Conan plays to a very similar crowd as LaPorte .
No , he does n't pull Leno or Letterman numbers ( although with a year or more , he probably could ) , but he has a very large , specific group of people who will follow him wherever he goes .
They 're a young , « hip » and tech - savvy crowd , much different from the crowds that normally enjoy late night programming .
So imagine this : an on - demand all - Conan all the time online video database , a place where Conan can post skits , interviews , on - location pieces .
He can stream live monologues and archive them for later viewing .
He can even have his audience still , albeit in a much smaller soundstage .
But who would n't sign up to see Conan do his thing in an intimate atmosphere ?
Late night shows are known for being cheap to produce , and it would be even cheaper to produce them in a smaller set and with less production value .
No flashing lights .
Only a couple of cameras .
Conan can even go back to hosting smaller indie bands rather than junky mainstream acts like Pearl Jam .
All of this could be done for relatively little money , and advertisers would happily pay only thousands to advertise to the same group of people that they were paying hundreds of thousands to advertise to on NBC at 11:35 pm .
They could sell theirDVDs , their Mini Coopers , their iPods .
They could sell cell phones , computers , technology , and they could do this with far more confidence and less risk than they would with a network .
They know the group they 're selling to and can target more effectively .
Niche advertising works .
This could be in addition to a viewer support program , a donation - based system that would like bring in hundreds of thousands annually if handled correctly .
Without a network , this is completely possible .
More importantly , Conan 's fans are made up almost entirely of the social networking generation .
When he released his statement on Tuesday announcing that he would not stay withif it got moved back to 12:05 am , Twitter was bombarded with tweets from people joining Team Conan .
The support online has been almost unanimous , with very few people coming out on « Team Leno . »
The internet is Coco 's crowd , so why would n't he take advantage of that , even if it means taking a pay cut up front ?
But Conan wo n't start an online Conan channel .
It probably has n't even crossed his mind .
Moves like this are risky , and even though Conan has more than enough money to try it out , he has no reason to .
Television is still safe , and we 're still very early on in this transition .
But what if he did consider it ?
What if he did decide to make the move to the interwebs ?
Just like that , he could singhandedly validate online television .
He could make us turn off our TVs and head to our iMacs .
No longer would our computers be a novel way of viewing episodes of shows that we missed the night before ; instead , our computers could easily become our primary gateway for viewing media .
A couple of weeks ago , Nick Bilton of the NY Times wrote an article about his home television set - up .
He ditched his cable company and now pays only for an internet connection and a Netflix account .
He connected a cheap Mac Mini to his TV and now gets all of his TV from the internet .
Bilton understands that we no longer have to be spoonfed our media .
The age of the internet is an age of choice .
The future of media is choice .
The future of television is choice .
And I wish Conan could be the one to lead us there .

Warning : I 'm not really advising anybody to use this hack in production code , but it is an interesting bit of code that may have a few good use cases .
Last night I thought of a really neat trick to solve this long - running “ _to alias_method_chain or not to alias_method_chain_ ” feud .
It ’s completely transparent , meaning it requires absolutely no modification to your original code .
More importantly , it essentially changes Ruby ’s inheritance model to what I would consider the “ correct ” model , with respect to mixin behaviour .
A Little Background
The issue that people bump their heads against can be expressed by the following Ruby example .
Say I ’m using a library that defines some class ‘ A ’ :
class A def foo ; " foo " end end
Being the Rubyist that I am , I want to be able to extend this method and add my own behaviour , but without wiping out the original .
This is where alias_method_chain traditionally comes in .
I would normally just rename the method and call it myself from my overridden method .
The problems with that have been discussed ad infinitum , and people have realized that mixing in a module is proper OO , much cleaner , maintains inheritance , etc ..
so let ’s do that :
module B ; def foo ; super + " bar " end end class A ; include B end
Problem !
You probably noticed this .
“ But ‘ foo ’ is defined directly in A , ” you say , “ you ca n’t override it with a mixin ! ”
This is the ultimate problem with Ruby ’s inheritance model , in my opinion .
Because mixins always take lower priority than methods defined directly in a class body , A #foo can not be overridden by mixin inclusion .
Moreover , because mixins take lower priority than methods , A #foo is now violating encapsulation , but to see this we will need to modify our example slightly .
What is Proper Encapsulation , Anyway ?
Encapsulation is the idea that only a component knows about its internal structure .
But structure in OOP implies your inheritance tree as much as it implies your data .
Suppose our ‘ A ’ class inherited some class ‘ X ’ and the A #foo method we ’ve been calling really calls the super method X #foo :
class X def foo ; " foo " end end class A < X ; def foo ; super end end
When our class ‘ A ’ calls super , it expects that super should be class ‘ X ’ , because this is its internal structure as defined by A .
By this standard , mixing in another module should not change A ’s internal expectations .
Mixing in a module should create the following encapsulation , where B encapsulates A :
This is what mixing in a module after A has been created should look like .
However , Ruby does not wrap our ‘ A ’ class , instead it injects itself under A :
Here we have modified the “ internal structure ” of A , violating proper encapsulation .
Whether or not this is “ right ” or “ wrong ” depends on how you view the concept of re-opening a class in Ruby .
However , pragmatically speaking , this behaviour causes a lot of problems with the way people tend to write code in Ruby - land ( and , in general , many languages ) .
Firstly , it requires that developers design for the possibility that a module would be inserted into itself rather than wrapped around , which means to properly accept mixins you should always call “ super ” in all of your methods since you never know what your inheritance tree will look like .
Secondly , it requires you to opt -in to allowing a method to be overridden by a mixin by performing very explicit code transformations that make your code harder to document and add needless complexity .
I ’m referring to the ClassMethods and InstanceMethods module idioms that Rails likes to use .
These are problematic because most documentation tools will show these methods as being “ inherited ” by the class ( if at all ) , and although this is technically correct , these methods now need to be addressed and looked up as ClassName : : InstanceMethods # method_name which is unintuitive for the user .
Of course this is in addition to actually organizing your code in this manner , which is , in general , an unintuitive step .
These are all workarounds to deal with the failings of a proper inheritance model .
Solving Encapsulation Transparently
So how can we solve the inheritance / encapsulation problem and do so with as small a footprint as possible ?
This is what I came up with last night :
class Object def self.method_added( name ) return if name == : initialize const_set (: InstanceMethods , Module.new ) unless defined ?( self : : InstanceMethods ) meth = instance_method ( name ) self : : InstanceMethods.send ( : define_method , name ) { |*args , & block| meth.bind ( self ) .call ( *args , &block ) } remove_method ( name ) include self : : InstanceMethods end end
This simple hook transparently defines all new methods inside an anonymous inner module , essentially doing this source transformation for us on the fly .
As mentioned , it requires no modification to the source code you ’re trying to modify , simply add this code before including the rest .
For instance , with the above hook , we can now do the following with our original example :
class A ; def foo ; " foo " end end module B ; def foo ; super + " bar " end end A.new.foo # => " foo " A.send ( : include , B ) A.new.foo # => " foobar "
Note that we need not change the code from our original example and our mixed in module now takes precedence over the explicitly defined A#foo .
Hold on There , Cowboy
“ But that looks so inefficient ! ” you scream .
For those who noticed , you will see that we ’ve been replacing every method with a delegate Proc object that performs quite a lot of crap before dispatching another method call .
Yes , it ’s inefficient .
There is , however , a better way to do this , but it involves native code .
I ’ve implemented the native version for 1.9.x , but I ’ll spare you the details and code .
If you care , you can check the github link ( see below ) .
The Metamorph Gem ( 1.9 Only )
In 1.9 you can do a gem install metamorph to get this gem .
It ’s a native gem , so it requires a compile .
For 1.8 ( or Windows machines ) you can use the above non-native version , but it will probably be slower .
The code is on github at : http://github.com/lsegal/metamorph, so if you want to make it work in 1.8 , feel free .
PS .
It ’s not that it ’s impossible to implement ( efficiently ) in 1.8 , it ’s simply that I do n’t personally care about your legacy Rubies the same way DHH never cared about your legacy DBs .
Oddly enough , people seem to love their legacy Rubies and still manage to hate legacy databases , but that ’s a rant for another day .
Branding is one of the most important aspects of building a business .
The best branding is based on a strong idea .
Here 's how to start .
ACLU National , ACLU of Wisconsin , and EFF have filed an amicus brief in the Wisconsin Supreme Court arguing that the law of that state prohibits police from installing a GPS device on you or your car without first getting a warrant from a judge .
A growing number of state high courts have decided that their citizens should be protected from suspicionless GPS tracking , recognizing that uninterrupted around - the - clock surveillance is qualitatively different from ordinary police observations of a suspect .
In the Wisconsin case , People v. Sveum , we ask the court to follow the example of Washington , New York , and Massachusetts and find that GPS tracking is a search that requires a warrant .
EFF participated as amicus in the New York case , People v. Weaver , and is awaiting a decision under the federal Constitution in U.S. v. Jones , a GPS tracking case pending in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
As more and more states find that their residents have a reasonable expectation that they will not be digitally tracked with surreptitiously installed devices , the federal courts must take note .
The Fourth Amendment protects legitimate expectations of privacy .
EFF is also actively litigating several location privacy cases involving government use of cell phone tower information to track the location of mobile handsets .
These cases involve the same creepy surreptitious pervasive electronic tracking as GPS tracking , but somewhat different legal issues in part because a complex statutory scheme protects data generated by cell phones .
We recently argued one such case in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals .
For an in depth analysis of the legal issues in that cell tracking case , see our amicus brief .
For more information , see : State v. Jackson , 150 Wash .
2d 251 , 76 P.3d 217 ( 2003 ) ( installation of a GPS tracking device on defendant ’s car required a warrant ) , People v. Weaver , 12 N.Y.3d 433 , 909 N.E.2d 1195 ( 2009 ) ( same ) , and Commonwealth v. Connolly , 454 Mass .
808 , 913 N.E.2d 356 ( 2009 ) ( installation and monitoring of a GPS tracking device on defendant ’s minivan was a seizure ) .

France has echoed calls by the German government for web users to find an alternative to Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) to protect security .
Certa , a government agency that oversees cyber threats , warned against using all versions of the web browser .
Germany warned users on Friday after malicious code - implicated in attacks on Google - was published online .
But Microsoft told BBC
News that IE8 was the " most secure browser on the market " and people should upgrade .
Cliff Evans , head of security and privacy , said that so far the firm had only seen malicious code that targeted the older version of its browser , IE6 .
" The risk is minimal , " he said .
For a web user to be affected , he said , they would have to be using IE6 and visit a compromised website .
" There are very few of them out there , " he told BBC News .
However , if this did occur , a PC could become infected with a " trojan horse " , allowing a hacker to take control of the computer and potentially steal sensitive information .
' Sophisticated attack '
Although the vulnerability has so far been exploited only in IE6 , security researchers warned that could soon change .
" Microsoft themselves admit there is a vulnerability , even in IE8 , " said Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos .
This terrible piece of PR for Microsoft comes just as the IE browser which had almost total control of the market starts to come under pressure ...
Rory Cellan - Jones , BBC technology correspondent
Has China helped Google in the browser wars ?
Mr Cluley said that because details of the exploit were now available online , hackers could soon change the code to target other versions of the browser .
He warned web users to be careful about clicking on links in unsolicited e-mails and advised all web users to upgrade their browser to the latest version , no matter which software they used .
The advice follows revelations that a " targeted and sophisticated " attack on Google exploited the vulnerability .
Google said last week that an attack on its corporate network had targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists .
The attack led Google to announce that it might withdraw from China , after it revealed that the attacks had probably originated in the country .
Following the news , Germany 's Federal Office for Information Security issued a warning against all versions of Internet Explorer and recommended that users switch to an alternative such as Firefox or Google 's Chrome .
The French agency Certa issued a similar warning .
" Pending a patch from the publisher , Certa recommends using an alternative browser , " it said .
The UK government had said that it would not issue a similar warning .
However , it said the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure ( CPNI ) was " monitoring the situation " and would " publish further advice if the risks change " .
Patch path But Mr Evans said that calls to change browsers were " not very helpful " .
" If you look at other browsers , it 's likely they will have other vulnerabilities , " he said .
The vulnerability was found to be used in an attack on Google
He pointed to a report by security firm NSS Labs reportedly showing that IE8 provided better security against phishing and malware than other browsers .
" We feel strongly that IE8 is most secure browser on the market , " Mr Evans said .
His advice was echoed by Mr Cluley .
" Switching away will get away from this particular problem , " he told BBC News .
" But all browsers have security flaws . "
Mr Cluley said that switching away from IE could create other problems , particularly for companies .
" Some web - based applications may not work at all if you 're not using Internet Explorer . "
Microsoft is currently working on a patch for the problem , but a spokesperson said it could not commit to a timeframe .
The firm traditionally releases a security update once a month - the next scheduled patch will be ready on 9 February .

Certain hormones are active during the ' acute love ' phase
A team from the University of Pisa in Italy found the bodily chemistry which makes people sexually attractive to new partners lasts , at most , two years .
When couples move into a " stable relationship " phase , other hormones take over , Chemistry World reports .
But one psychologist warned the hormone shift is wrongly seen as negative .
Dr Petra Boynton , of the British Psychological Society , said there was a danger people might feel they should take hormone supplements to make them feel the initial rush of lust once more .
' Not ever - lasting '
The Italian researchers tested the levels of the hormones called neutrophins in the blood of volunteers who were rated on a passionate love scale .
It is suggesting that what happens first is the best bit - and that is n't true
Dr Petra Boynton , British Psychological Society
Levels of these chemical messengers were much higher in those who were in the early stages of romance .
Testosterone was also found to increase in love - struck women , but to reduce in men when they are in love .
But in people who had been with their partners for between one and two years these so - called " love molecules " had gone , even though the relationship had survived .
The scientists found that the lust molecule was replaced by the so - called " cuddle hormone " - oxytocin - in couples who had been together for several years .
Oxytocin , is a chemical that induces labour and milk - production in new and pregnant mothers .
Donatella Marazziti , who led the research team , said : " If lovers swear their feelings to be ever - lasting , the hormones tell a different story . "
Similar research conducted by Enzo Emanuele at the University of Pavia found that levels of a chemical messenger called nerve growth factor ( NGF ) increased with romantic intensity .
After one to two years , NGF levels had reduced to normal .
' Real Cupid 's arrows '
The researchers said : " Whether more nerve growth is needed in the early stage of romance because of all the new experiences that are engraved into the brain , or whether it has a second , as yet unknown function in the chemistry of love , remains to be explored . "
Michael Gross , a bio-chemist and science writer who has studied the latest findings , said : " It shows that different hormones are present in the blood when people are acutely in love while there is no evidence of the same hormones in people who have been in a stable relationship for many years .
" In fact the love molecules can disappear as early as 12 months after a relationship has started to be replaced by another chemical glue that keeps couples together . "
He added : " To any romantically inclined chemist , it should be deeply satisfying to be able to prove that chemical messengers communicate romantic feeling between humans . "
" It may be the only thing that science can offer as a real - world analogy to Cupid 's arrows . "
But Dr Boynton said : " This feeds into a 1970s view that when you meet it 's all sparky , and then it's a downward trajectory to cuddles - which is seen as a negative .
" It is suggesting that what happens first is the best bit - and that is n't true . "
She added : " I 'm concerned that , having identified these hormones , there will be some move to suggest replacements to recreate the early passion . "
Fear of Rising Death Toll Berlin Reluctant to Follow American Lead on Afghanistan
The German government hopes to discuss a new approach to Afghanistan at Thursday 's conference in London .
But the Americans see the strategy as already fixed .
If Berlin adopts the new counterinsurgency methods , more German troops are likely to die -- making the operation even more unpopular back home .

Robert Wistrich ’s vast and important book is the most comprehensive account in print of the history of anti-Semitism since 1945 in Europe , the Middle East , and Iran .
The reference to antiquity in the title is unfortunate : its treatment of its dark subject before 1945 is very brief ; 810 of its 938 pages and twenty - three of its twenty - five chapters deal with the past seven decades .
Wistrich is one of the world ’s leading historians of the subject , particularly of the continuities and discontinuities in the history of this lethal prejudice , in Europe but also beyond it , particularly in the Arab and Muslim world .
A Lethal Obsession is an encyclopedic — and genuinely alarming — compendium of the new anti-Semitism .
Wistrich gathers a massive amount of evidence to drive home the point that we are witnessing yet another significant chapter in the history of anti-Semitism , one that the conventional focus on the history of anti-Semitism before and during Nazism and the Holocaust does not address .
Every historian must decide what the proper balance is between argument and evidence .
No one can criticize Wistrich for paucity of evidence .
The examples are plentiful , overwhelming , at times excessive .
And the plenitude of scholarship here is more than is necessary to make Wistrich ’s argument , which is that the history of radical and potentially genocidal anti-Semitism did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 .
Hitlerism , understood as hatred of the Jews and of liberal modernity , persisted beyond the destruction of Hitler , in Wistrich ’s account , and acquired new political , cultural , religious , ideological , and geographical coordinates .
The terminology of the new post -1945 Jew - hatred was no longer predominantly Christian , fascist , or racist .
Instead it draws on neo -Marxist , Islamic , or anti-globalist ideologies .
Unreconstructed neo -Nazi groups persisted , to be sure , but largely on the margins of European politics , and they ceased to be the most important source of radical anti-Semitism .
Instead , the anti-Semitism after Hitler consisted of a mixture of the “ old anti-Semitism ” with “ the new anti-Zionism . ”
It was expressed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War , by the radical left since the 1960s , and above all in the mix of secular and Islamist politics of the Middle East and Iran .
While the rallying cry of the old anti-Semitism was the attack on “ world Jewry , ” the core of anti-Semitism has been the attack on “ international Zionism ” and on the state of Israel .
Wistrich is certainly aware that not all criticism of Israeli policy is inspired by hatred of the Jews and Judaism , but the “ logic ” and the structure of influential arguments attacking Israel have been ominously identical to the imputations of vast power and enormous evil attributed to “ world Jewry ” by European anti-Semites of old .
The “ lethal obsession ” of the recent past , according to Wistrich , has been a melange of the old conspiracy theories of that infamous forgery , the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , with Marxism - Leninism , secular third worldism , and Islamism .
In this period , the center of gravity of anti-Semitism has shifted from Europe to the Middle East and Iran .
Although the cultural sources of the anti-Semitism of recent decades differ from those in Europe , the publicly articulated policies of the government of Iran and its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah , are no less “ lethal . ”
Far from clearly recognizing the danger , too much of the political mainstream in Europe has failed to acknowledge the anti-Semitic resurgence .
And in certain precincts of the Muslim diaspora in Europe , radical anti-Semitism has been re-exported back to Europe and on occasion enters the mainstream of political , journalistic , and intellectual life .
Wistrich presents evidence of a " culture of hatred " in the Middle East in recent years that permeates books , magazines , newspapers , sermons , videocassettes , the Internet , television , and radio on a scale unprecedented since the heyday of Nazi Germany .
“ Indeed , the demonic images of Jews presently circulating in much of the Islamic world are sufficiently radical in tone and content to constitute a new warrant for genocide .
They combine to devastating effect the blood libel of medieval Christian Europe with Nazi conspiracy theories about the Jewish drive for world domination and dehumanizing Islamic quotations about Jews as the ‘ sons of apes and donkeys . ’”
Like the Nazis , these anti-Semites see themselves at war with Western decadence , infused as they say it is with evil “ Jewish influence . ”
“ Islamofascism today builds on the same mythological figure of the satanic , ubiquitous , immoral and all - powerful Jew that once haunted the European anti-Semitic imagination from Richard Wagner to Adolf Hitler . ”
I find these claims entirely persuasive .
Samurai Jack is probably my favourite cartoon character of all time .
Look how badass he is !
So ... I love the SJ art style to death ....
Even more so than a lot of popular series ' out there , even Avatar .
I decided to do a different style from the cartoon , something more realistic and scary .
Hope it worked out ! edit : I tweaked the anatomy a little on Jack , and made it look a little more like he is in hell ...
I hope you guys still like it ! old one : [ link ]
March 17 , 2010  --
In rare public remarks last week , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the money involved in electing judges remains one of the most pressing concerns facing the American court system .
And she joined her former colleague , Sandra Day O'Connor , in calling for reform .
" If there 's a reform I would make , it would be that , " Ginsburg said when asked about the issue at the National Association of Women Judges Thursday night .
Yet money has continued to pour into the campaign accounts of state judges around the country , and ABC News has obtained an advanced copy of a study showing the amounts involved are unprecedented .
In the past decade , candidates for state judgeships raised more than $ 206 million , more than double the $ 83 million judges raised in the 1990s , according to the soon - to - be released study by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and Justice at Stake , two non partisan groups that advocate for reforming the judicial selection process .
Three of the last five state Supreme Court election cycles topped $ 45 million .
And judges shattered fundraising records in all but two of the 21 states with contested Supreme Court elections in the last ten years , the report found .
" State judicial elections have been transformed , " the report says , and the money involved has created " a grave and growing challenge to the impartiality of our nation 's courts . "
Concerns about the expanding role of money in judicial elections achieved widespread attention two years ago when ABC News and other outlets documented contributions from West Virginia mining executive Don Blankenship to fund an advertising campaign for a candidate for that state 's high court .
The CEO of the country 's fourth largest coal company helped raise more than $ 3.5 million for ads aimed at getting a new judge elected , all while his company was appealing to the State supreme court a $ 70 million judgment against it .
That case led the U.S. Supreme Court to cry foul , saying a justice should step aside from a case if one of the parties has given so much money that the probability of bias would not be " constitutionally tolerable . "
Electing judges is a common practice in the U.S. , with nearly 90 percent of all judges in 39 states facing at least some form of election during their tenure .
Some advocates for expanding judicial elections say the contests serve a valuable purpose .
Jim Bopp , an Indiana lawyer who has been pushing for more states to elect their judges , said many conservatives view the elections as " a way to keep judges within the proper bounds .
A way to keep them judges rather than judicial activists . "
But others see the Blankenship controversy as a proverbial canary in the coal mine for what top judicial scholars – including Justice O'Connor -- are now calling an alarming political trend .
The amount of money flowing into these contests , O'Connor told a group of Georgetown Law students last month , has become " a threat to judicial independence . "
" If both sides unleash their campaign spending without restrictions , " O'Connor said , it will " erode the impartiality of the judiciary . "
More expensive battles are coming .
Thirty eight state court justices will be on state ballots this year , and in many of the races , the fundraising has already begun .
Last week , on the same day Ginsburg was calling for reform , top Alabama appellate lawyers were flowing into the Ruth 's Chris Steak House in downtown Birmingham for a reception honoring Alabama Supreme Court Justice Michael F. Bolin , according to an invitation to the event .
The requested contribution was $ 250 .
Bolin is seeking reelection to the bench after first being elected in 2004 with more than $ 1 million in financial support from business groups , according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics .
Alabama campaigns have been exceptionally contentious in recent years , as business interests and trial lawyers have squared off behind opposing candidates for the state supreme court .
A 2003 study by the Institute found that out of 1,424 court cases they examined , 904 of them -- or 63 percent -- involved a party or attorney who had made a contribution to a Supreme Court Justice before that Justice ruled on the contributor 's case .
Bopp said there 's a reason Bolin and other business - backed judges won seats on the court .
They were elected , Bopp said , to help reverse a trend of rulings that favored trial lawyers .
For years , Bopp said , " Democrat judges in Alabama created tort hell . "
" What was happening was , the trial lawyers had seized control of the state supreme court and their rulings were very favorable to the trial lawyers , " he said .
" There became very substantial opposition to these judicial activists and they were defeated . "
Similar battles – fueled by business groups on one side , and trial lawyers on the other -- have been erupting all around the country .
In many cases , the involvement of local interest groups serves to hide the role of the national money in the contests .
In Washington State in 2004 , for instance , a pro-business group called the Voters Education Committee poured $ 1.4 million into attack ads in an attorney general 's race .
After the group refused to identify its investors , the state launched an investigation that uncovered one major source of its funds – the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the powerful pro-business lobby in Washington .
Chamber officials declined to comment for this report .
Another flashpoint has been Wisconsin , where a business group made up of utilities , insurance carriers , investment houses , and others began supporting candidates in judicial elections .
Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce spent $ 4 million on ads that blanketed the airwaves in recent contests for two seats on the Wisconsin State Supreme Court , according to research by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign , a non partisan group that tracks political giving in the state .
The most controversial ad in the 2008 campaign was produced by the business - backed challenger to Justice Louis Butler .
The ad accused Butler of setting a child molester free to rape again , and showed a photo of Butler , who is black , next to the mug shot of the rapist , who is also black .
CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL AD .
" Louis Butler worked to put criminals on the street , like Ruben Lee Mitchell , who raped an 11 year old girl with learning disabilities , " the ad said ominously .
" Butler found a loophole … Mitchell went on to molest another child .
Can Wisconsin families feel safe with Louis Butler on the Supreme Court ? "
The Wisconsin Judicial Commission called the ad misleading and the ad's sponsor , Michael Gableman , later conceded in a public statement that he made his case to voters " imperfectly and in shorthand , a necessity in judicial campaigns . "
Gableman narrowly won the election anyway and now sits on the court .
Lawyers for the Wisconsin business group have told reporters that their involvement in judicial elections is a matter of free speech , and that judges they help elect should be free to hear cases even when Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce is itself a party .
" Individuals and organizations spend money to help elect a judicial candidate precisely because they want that candidate to be a judge that is , to preside over cases , including their own , " one of the group 's attorneys , Mike Wittenwyler said in a petition to the court .
" There is nothing corrupt about that .
That is democracy . "
After Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce spent $ 2.2 million to help elect conservative candidate Annette Ziegler in 2007 , its lawyers filed a friend - of - the - court brief on a major corporate tax case .
Ziegler authored a 4 - 3 decision in the case that ruled in the group 's favor .
Notoriety from that episode , along with fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the West Virginia case , helped prompt the court to consider new rules spelling out when campaign donations create conflicts of interest .
What emerged were new guidelines saying justices do not have to sit out a case just because one of the parties involved donated to them .
At a contentious meeting where the justices debated the new guidelines , Gableman said forcing a justice to step aside would lend credence to the incorrect assumption that " judges , by receiving lawful campaign contributions , are somehow suspect or are going to be swayed or persuaded or more inclined to vote for one party or the other . "
" The electorate has the right to support the judicial candidates that they feel are the best , " he said .
But Wisconsin Justice Ann Walsh Bradley , one of the three dissenters to the new policy , said she was " dumbfounded " by the decision to let sitting justices solicit donations from parties with pending cases before them .
She said if she described that policy to her friends back home , she knew how they would respond .
" Are you crazy ? " would be their reaction , she told her colleagues .
" Are you kidding ? "
The new recusal rules , the majority acknowledged , were taken nearly word - for - word from a proposal drafted by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce .

Survey finds agriculture causing major damage .
Industry is responsible for much of China 's air pollution , while agricultural run off pollutes its waterways .
PETER PARKS / AFP / Getty Images
China has completed its first ever pollution census .
The 4 - billion yuan ( US $ 585 - million ) project took 570,000 people two years to complete .
It tracked pollution from industry , agriculture , urban waste , landfills and incinerators .
The broad survey will provide the basis for setting environmental protection targets in the next five - year plan of economic initiatives that begins in 2011 , says Zhang Lijun , China 's vice - minister of environmental protection .
The census found that agriculture was more damaging to China 's waterways than manufacturing .
In 2007 , agriculture was responsible for 43.7 % of the total 30.3 million tonnes of chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) — a measure of organic pollutants — in water .
It also contributed to 57.2 % and 67.4 % of the total 4.7 million tonnes of nitrogen and 0.4 million tonnes of phosphorus effluents , respectively .
This is the first time that China has factored agriculture into a pollution assessment .
Livestock seems to be the largest contributor to the run-off pollution and is responsible for 96 % , 38 % and 56 % of COD , nitrogen and phosphorus discharges , respectively , says Wang Yanliang , an official at the agriculture ministry 's science and technology education division .
The pollution discharges far exceed the 7 million tonnes a year that China estimates its water can safely absorb .
Consequently , the country 's numerous lakes , rivers and coastal waters have suffered from repeated outbreaks of algal blooms owing to the excess of nutrients polluting the water .
" It 's encouraging to see that agricultural pollution is now on the government 's radar , " says Fusuo Zhang , a researcher at the China Agricultural University in Beijing .
" We have been trying to draw such attention for a long time . "
Zhang published a survey of Chinese soil in the journal Science this week , which showed that the soil was acidifying rapidly because of over - fertilization ( see ' Acid soil threatens Chinese farms ' ) .
Agriculture is far from being the only source of pollution .
The census also shows serious air pollution , with 23.2 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide emissions , most of which came from industry ; 18 million tonnes of nitrogen oxide emissions , a third of which resulted from vehicles ; and 11.7 million tonnes of soot .
Industry gave rise to 3.8 billion tonnes of solid waste — equivalent to 3 tonnes per person in China — and of that solid waste , 45.7 million tonnes were hazardous .
Pollution and other environmental issues in China have caused widespread health problems such as cancer and birth defects and have led to much social unrest .
Many observers think that the publicizing of such huge pollution levels by a country that is often secretive about bad news is a sign that China is taking the issues seriously .
Coming clean
" The upcoming five - year plan may reflect this sense of urgency , " says Lei Ming , an environment economist at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in Beijing .
Many , like Lei , hope that the next five - year plan will introduce an environment tax on polluters .
ADVERTISEMENT
Currently , industrial sectors are charged pollution fees as a form of excise tax , which are under provincial jurisdiction .
Depending on a province 's economic situation , the fee amount can vary and the implementation is often weak .
The system is also riddled with corruption : some local governments reduced charges or exempted polluters from paying them , whereas others did not hand over the revenue they had raised to the central treasury .
An environment tax would be a nationally standardized system and the generated revenue would be used to curb environmental pollution , says Lei .
However , a complete switch from a local fee system to a national tax may face resistance from local governments ; it may also take a long time to be enacted because new legislation would need to be passed by the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , China 's top legislature .
" An easier solution would be to introduce the green tax as an addition to the existing charge system , " Lei says — as happened with the recent introduction of a fuel tax , which bypassed the NPC by being tagged onto the existing consumption - tax legislation .
Vice - minister Zhang Lijun says that the environmental protection targets for the next five - year plan are being deliberated , adding that the environment ministry is in discussion with the finance ministry and the State Administration of Taxation about an environment tax .
Decisions are expected to be publicized towards the end of this year .

US slaps duties on steel pipe from China ( Agencies )
Updated : 2010-02-25 11:26
US expected to announce more duties in April
WASHINGTON : The United States on Wednesday imposed preliminary duties ranging from 11 to 13 percent on steel pipe from China to offset government subsidies , the Commerce Department said .
The decision puts further strain on US - China trade relations , already tested by disputes over other US trade actions and China 's currency policy .
It is a victory for US Steel Corp and the United Steelworkers union , which filed a petition in October asking for protection against the Chinese imports .
Texas company V&M Star LP and Illinois company TMK IPSCO also signed the petition asking for relief .
Roger Schagrin , an attorney representing the petitioners , said he believed the Commerce Department underestimated the amount of Chinese government subsidies .
But " we 're still happy ( with the countervailing duties ) .
They 're in the double digits , " Schagrin said .
The case concerns seamless carbon and alloy pipe of 16 inches ( 41 cm ) or less in outside diameter used in industrial piping systems to carry water , steam , petrochemicals , chemicals , oil products , natural gas and other liquids and gasses .
The United States imported $ 382 million of the pipe from China in 2008 , compared to $ 130 million in 2007 .
Imports declined in 2009 along with the overall drop in world trade but surged late in the year as importers tried to beat anticipated duties , Schagrin said .
The Commerce Department set a preliminary duty rate of 12.97 percent on the Hengyang group of companies and 11.06 percent on the Tianjin Pipe Group Co and related firms .
All other Chinese producers and exporters will face a country - wide duty rate of 12.02 percent .
US petitioners have also asked the Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties in addition to the countervailing duties announced on Wednesday .
Those duties aimed at below - market prices are often far larger than countervailing duties that Commerce imposes .
" We 're optimistic that we 'll get significant anti-dumping duties " when the decision comes out in April , Schagrin said .
One of the best aspects of science has always been its readiness to admit when it got something wrong .
Theories are constantly being refigured , and new research frequently renders old ideas outdated or incomplete .
But this has n’t stopped some discoveries from being hailed as important , game - changing accomplishments a bit prematurely .
Even in a field as rigorous and detail - oriented as science , theories get busted , mistakes are made , and hoaxes are perpetrated .
The following are ten of the most groundbreaking of these scientific discoveries that turned out to be resting on some questionable data .
It is worth noting that most of these concepts are not necessarily “ wrong ” in the traditional sense ; rather , they have been replaced by other theories that are more complete and reliable .
10 . The Discovery of Vulcan
Vulcan was a planet that nineteenth century scientists believed to exist somewhere between Mercury and the Sun .
The mathematician Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier first proposed its existence after he and many other scientists were unable to explain certain peculiarities about Mercury ’s orbit .
Scientists like Le Verrier argued that this had to be caused by some object , like a small planet or moon , acting as a gravitational force .
La Verrier called his hypothetical planet Vulcan , after the Roman god of fire .
Soon , amateur astronomers around Europe , eager to be a part of a scientific discovery , contacted Le Verrier and claimed to have witnessed the mysterious planet making its transit around the Sun .
For years afterward , Vulcan sightings continued to pour in from around the globe , and when La Verrier died in 1877 , he was still regarded as having discovered a new planet in the solar system .
How it was Proven Wrong :
Without La Verrier acting as a cheerleader for Vulcan ’s existence , it suddenly began to be doubted by many notable astronomers .
The search was effectively abandoned in 1915 , after Einstein ’s theory of general relativity helped to explain once and for all why Mercury orbited the Sun in such a strange fashion .
But amateur stargazers continued the search , and as recently as 1970 there have been people who have claimed to see a strange object orbiting the sun beyond Mercury .
Amusingly , the entire would - be discovery ’s greatest legacy today is that it inspired the name of the home planet of the character Spock from Star Trek .
9. Spontaneous Generation
Although it might seem a bit ludicrous today , for thousands of years it was believed that life regularly arose from the elements without first being formed through a seed , egg , or other traditional means of reproduction .
The main purveyor of the theory was Aristotle , who based his studies on the ideas of thinkers like Anaximander , Hippolytus , and Anaxagoras , all of whom stressed the ways in which life could spontaneously come into being from inanimate matter like slime , mud , and earth when exposed to sunlight .
Aristotle based his own ideas on the observation of the ways maggots would seemingly generate out of dead animal carcass , or barnacles would form on the hull of a boat .
This theory that life could literally spring from nothing managed to persist for hundreds of years after Aristotle , and was even being proposed by some scientists as recently as the 1700s .
How it was Proven Wrong :
It was only with the adoption of the scientific method that many of the classical theories like spontaneous generation began to be tested .
Once they were , they quickly crumbled .
For example , famed scientist Louis Pasteur showed that maggots would not appear on meat kept in a sealed container , and the invention of the microscope helped to show that these same insects were formed not by spontaneous generation but by airborne microorganisms .
8. The Expanding Earth
Our modern understanding of the interior and behaviors of the Earth is strongly based around plate tectonics and the concept of subduction .
But before this idea was widely accepted in the late 20th century , a good number of scientists subscribed to the much more fantastical theory that the Earth was forever increasing in volume .
The expanding Earth hypothesis stated that phenomena like underwater mountain ranges and continental drift could be explained by the fact that the planet was gradually growing larger .
As the globe ’s size grew , proponents argued , the distances between continents would increase , as would the Earth ’s crust , which would have explained the creation of new mountains .
The theory has a long and storied past , beginning with Darwin , who briefly tinkered with it before casting it aside , and Nikola Tesla , who compared the process to that of the expansion of a dying star .
How it was Proven Wrong :
The expanding Earth hypothesis has never been proven wrong exactly , but it has been widely replaced with the much more sophisticated theory of plate tectonics .
While the expanding Earth theory holds that all land masses were once connected , and that oceans and mountains were only created as a result of the planet ’s growing volume , plate tectonics explains the same phenomena by way of plates in the lithosphere that move and converge beneath the Earth ’s surface .
7. Phlogiston Theory
First expressed by Johan Joachim Becher in 1667 , phlogiston theory is the idea that all combustible objects — that is , anything that can catch fire — contain a special element called phlogiston that is released during burning , and which makes the whole process possible .
In its traditional form , phlogiston was said to be without color , taste , or odor , and was only made visible when a flammable object , like a tree or a pile of leaves , caught fire .
Once it was burned and all its phlogiston released , the object was said to once again exist in its true form , known as a “ calx . ”
Beyond basic combustion , the theory also sought to explain chemical processes like the rusting of metals , and was even used as a means of understanding breathing , as pure oxygen was described as “ dephlogistated air . ”
How it was Proven Wrong :
The more experiments that were performed using the phlogiston model , the more dubious it became as a theory .
One of the most significant was that when certain metals were burned , they actually gained weight instead of losing it , as they should have if phlogiston were being released .
The idea eventually fell out of favor , and has since been replaced by more sophisticated theories , like oxidation .
6. The Martian Canals
The Martian canals were a network of gullies and ravines that 19th century scientist mistakenly believed to exist on the red planet .
The canals were first “ discovered ” in 1877 by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli .
After other stargazers corroborated his claim , the canals became something of a phenomenon .
Scientists drew detailed maps tracing their paths , and soon wild speculation began on their possible origins and use .
Perhaps the most absurd theory came from Percival Lowell , a mathematician and astronomer who jumped to the bizarre conclusion that the canals were a sophisticated irrigation system developed by an unknown intelligent species .
Lowell ’s hypothesis was widely discredited by other scientists , but it was also popularly accepted , and the idea managed to survive in some circles well into the 20th century .
How it was Proven Wrong :
Quite unspectacularly , the Martian canals were only proven to be a myth with the advent of greater telescopes and imaging technology .
It turned out that what looked like canals was in fact an optical illusion caused by streaks of dust blown across the Martian surface by heavy winds .
Several scientists had proposed a similar theory in the early 1900s , but it was only proven correct in the 1960s when the first unmanned spacecraft made flybys over Mars and took pictures of its surface .
5. Luminiferous Aether
The aether , also known as the ether , was a mysterious substance that was long believed to be the means through which light was transmitted through the universe .
Philosophers as far back as the Greeks had believed that light required a delivery system , a means through which it became visible , and this idea managed to persist all the way through to the nineteenth century .
If correct , the theory would have redefined our entire understanding of physics .
Most notably , if the aether were a physical substance that could exist even in a vacuum , then even deep space could be more easily measured and quantified .
Experiments often contradicted the theory of the aether , but by the 1700s it had become so widespread that its existence was assumed to be a given .
Later , when the idea was abandoned , physicist Albert Michelson referred to luminiferous aether as “ one of the grandest generalizations in modern science . ”
How it was Proven Wrong :
In traditional scientific fashion , the notion of a luminiferous aether was only gradually phased out as more sophisticated theories came into play .
Experiments in the diffraction and refraction of light had long rendered traditional models of the aether outdated , but it was only when Einstein ’s special theory of relativity came along and completely reconfigured physics that the idea lost the last of its major adherents .
The theory still exists in various forms , though , and many have argued that modern scientists simply use terms like “ fields ” and “ fabric ” in place of the more taboo term “ aether . ”
4. The Blank Slate Theory
One of the oldest and most controversial theories in psychology and philosophy is the theory of the blank slate , or tabula rasa , which argues that people are born with no built - in personality traits or proclivities .
Proponents of the theory , which began with the work of Aristotle and was expressed by everyone from St. Thomas Aquinas to the empiricist philosopher John Locke , insisted that all mental content was the result of experience and education .
For these thinkers , nothing was instinct or the result of nature .
The idea found its most famous expression in psychology in the ideas of Sigmund Freud , whose theories of the unconscious stressed that the elemental aspects of an individual ’s personality were constructed by their earliest childhood experiences .
How it was Proven Wrong :
While there ’s little doubt that a person ’s experiences and learned behaviors have a huge impact on their disposition , it is also now widely accepted that genes and other family traits inherited from birth , along with certain innate instincts , also play a crucial role .
This was only proven after years of study that covered the ways in which similar gestures like smiling and certain features of language could be found throughout the world in radically different cultures .
Meanwhile , studies of adopted children and twins raised in separate families have come to similar conclusions about the ways certain traits can exist from birth .
3. Phrenology
Although it is now regarded as nothing more than a pseudoscience , in its day phrenology was one of the most popular and well - studied branches of neuroscience .
In short , proponents of phrenology believed that individual character traits , whether intelligence , aggression , or an ear for music , could all be localized to very specific parts of the brain .
According to phrenologists , the larger each one of these parts of a person ’s brain was , the more likely they were to behave in a certain way .
With this in mind , practitioners would often study the size and shape of subjects ’ heads in order to determine what kind of personality they might have .
Detailed maps of the supposed 27 different areas of the brain were created , and a person who had a particularly large bump on their skull in the area for , say , the sense of colors , would be assumed to have a proclivity for painting .
How it was Proven Wrong :
Even during the heyday of its popularity in the 1800s , phrenology was often derided by mainstream scientists as a form of quackery .
But their protests were largely ignored until the 1900s , when modern scientific advances helped to show that personality traits could not be traced to specific portions of the brain , at least in not as precise a way as the proponents of phrenology often claimed .
Phrenology still exists today as a fringe science , but its use in the 20th century has become somewhat infamous : it has often been employed as a tool to promote racism , most famously by the Nazis , as well by Belgian colonialists in Rwanda .
2. Einstein ’s Static Universe
Prior to scientists embracing the notion that the universe was created as the result of the Big Bang , it was commonly believed that the size of the universe was an unchanging constant — it had always been the size it was , and always would be .
The idea stated that that the total volume of the universe was effectively fixed , and that the whole construct operated as a closed system .
The theory found its biggest adherent in Albert Einstein — the Static Universe is often known as “ Einstein ’s Universe ” — who argued in favor of it and even calculated it into his theory of general relativity .
How it was Proven Wrong :
The theory of a static universe was problematic from the start .
First of all , a finite universe could theoretically become so dense that it would collapse into a giant black hole , a problem Einstein compensated for with his principle of the “ cosmological constant . ”
Still , the final nail in the coffin for the idea was Edwin Hubble ’s discovery of the relationship between red shift — the way the color of heavenly bodies change as they move away from us — and distance , which showed that the universe was indeed expanding .
Einstein would subsequently abandon his model , and would later refer to it as the “ biggest blunder ” of his career .
Still , like all cosmological ideas , the expanding universe is just a theory , and a small group of scientists today still subscribe to the old static model .
1. Fleischmann and Pons ’s Cold Fusion
While the conditions required to create nuclear energy usually require extreme temperatures — think of the processes that power the sun — the theory of cold fusion states that such a reaction is possible at room temperature .
It ’s a deceivingly simple concept , but the implications are spectacular : if a nuclear reaction could occur at room temperature , then an abundance of energy could be created without the dangerous waste that results from nuclear power plants .
This groundbreaking theory briefly seemed to have become a reality in 1989 , when the electro - chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons published experimental results suggesting that they had achieved cold fusion — and the precious “ excess energy ” it was hoped to produce — in an experiment where an electric current was run through seawater and a metal called Palladium .
The response to Pons and Fleischmann ’s claims by the media and the scientific community was overwhelming .
The experiments were hailed as a turning point in science , and it was briefly believed that with cold fusion energy would be cheap , clean , and abundant .
How it was Proven Wrong :
The fervor over cold fusion died down as soon as other scientists tried to replicate the experiment .
Most failed to get any kind of similar results , and after their paper was closely studied , Fleischmann and Pons were accused not only of sloppy , unethical science , but were even said to have stretched the truth of their results .
For years after , the idea of cold fusion became synonymous with fringe science .
Still , despite the stigma attached to it , many have argued that there was never anything necessarily wrong about cold fusion as a theory .
In recent years , scientists have once again started to experiment with new ways of achieving a so - called “ tabletop nuclear reaction , ” with some even claiming to have achieved surprising success .

Thanks to greater use of generic drugs , the financial burden of prescription costs has become less of an issue for families in the United States , according to a new study by the RAND Corporation .
The study shows that the number of Americans living in a family that spent more than 10 percent of its income out of pocket on prescription drugs decreased from 2003 to 2008 .
The decrease in costs to families is in contrast to the preceding five - year period , from 1999 to 2003 , when drug costs rose year after year and were a financial burden for an increasing number of families .
The study , released Wednesday afternoon , is published in the February issue of Health Affairs , an academic journal .
The study examined people under the age of 65 , which is generally when people obtain drug coverage under the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly .
Researchers studied uninsured Americans as well as those with public and private insurance , defining families with a “ high financial burden ” as those that spent more than 10 percent of their income on out - of - pocket costs for drugs .
The number of Americans with this financial burden rose to 4.3 percent of the United States population , or 10.8 million people , in 2003 , when researchers said the burden of drug costs peaked .
This compares with 2.9 percent of the population , or 7.1 million people , in the same situation in 1999 .
Since 2003 , the percentage of people living with a high cost burden fell to 3.1 percent of the population , or 8.3 million people , in 2008 , the study showed .
“ If prescription spending had not decreased , we ’d be talking about an even higher overall burden for health care costs , ” said the study ’s lead author , Dr. Walid Gellad , who is a RAND researcher and an internist at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System .
“ There are still more than eight million people living in families with a high burden and drug prices are going up , but more people are being helped by taking cheaper drugs . ”

The control - flow problem
In programming languages , and static analysis in particular , the higher - order control - flow problem refers to the fact that the precise target of a function call may not be obvious .
The problem afflicts functional languages in the form of first - class functions , and it afflicts object - oriented languages in the form of dynamically dispatched methods .
For example , in an object - oriented language , the target of the function call object.
method ( ) depends on the value that flows to the expression object .
Thus , the control - flow of this call depends on the data - flow affecting the value of object .
If the object object were a function parameter , it 's clear that the control - flow of this function would also determine the data - flow of its parameters .
As another example , the target of a function call like ( g x ) in Lisp depends on where this call appears .
This call could appear in the term ( lambda ( g ) ( g x ) ) , in which case the target of g depends on where this procedure flows .
Consider , further , the control - flow possibilities resulting from the term ( map ( lambda ( g ) ( g x ) ) my - procedures ) .
In summary , in higher - order languages , control - flow affects data - flow , even as data - flow affects control - flow .
Any attempt to reason about one facet must grapple with the other .
The value - flow problem
In practice , the scope of the control - flow problem is always widened to the more general value - flow problem .
To contrast , the control - flow problem asks , " Which procedures may the expression f be in the call ( f x ) ? " ; the value - flow problem asks " To which values may the expressions f and x evaluate ? "
The challenge of the value - flow problem is that , in general , it is undecidable to determine the exact set of values to which an expression might evaluate .
Solution : Simulate the program
Control - flow analyses ( CFAs ) are the class of algorithms that solve the value - flow problem .
Because a precise solution is impossible , CFAs compute conservative over - approximations .
That is , if a CFA says that the procedure foo is invoked at some call site , then it may be invoked at that call site .
If foo can't actually be invoked , then it is a false positive .
CFAs attempt to minimize the number of false positives without resorting to intractable techniques .
The simplest way to write a CFA is to use a " small - step abstract interpretation . "
The code for an abstract interpretater can be quite similar to that of an ordinary interpreter ; in practice , there are three major differences :
Abstract interpreters use abstract values .
For instance , one might use positive or negative , instead of 3 or - 4 .
Another common strategy has all pointer addresses allocated at the same program location share the same " abstract " pointer address .
or , instead of or .
Another common strategy has all pointer addresses allocated at the same program location share the same " abstract " pointer address .
Abstract interpreters can be non-deterministic ; often , when an abstract interpreter encounters a conditional ( e.g. if ) , it follows all branches .
If a CFA thinks there could be two procedures called at a call site , it will non-deterministically invoke both of them during its analysis .
) , it follows all branches .
If a CFA thinks there could be two procedures called at a call site , it will non-deterministically invoke both of them during its analysis .
Abstract interpreters typically operate over a finite number of machine states , to ensure termination .
In instances where abstract interpreters do n't use a finite state - space , a special technique called widening can accelerate and guarantee termination of the interpreter .
In essence , an abstract interpreter simulates all possible ( and , necessarily , some impossible ) executions of the program .
By looking over all possible executions , one can check whether there is any execution in which an expression gets bound to a number or a string .
Similarly , one can look at every state containing a call site of interest , to see which procedures may actually get called there .
The first popular solution to the control - flow problem was k- CFA , a hierarchy of increasingly precise ( and increasingly slower ) analyses .
k- CFA was originally specified as an abstract interpreter for Scheme that had been translated into continuation - passing style .
( An implementation of k- CFA for that kind of Scheme is included below . )
The core principles of CFAs translate easily between different languages .
That is , once you understand how to implement a CFA for Scheme , it 's not hard to implement a CFA for any other language .
How 0CFA thinks
0CFA is a special case of the k-CFA framework , and it is one of the most popular CFAs .
0CFA is notable for the simplicity of its abstraction : values are abstracted to the syntax from which they came .
In Scheme , a procedure is abstracted to the lambda term that created it ; the environment associated with its closure is ignored entirely .
This coarse abstraction leads to considerable imprecision , but it has a major benefit in the form of a polynomial - time bound ( cubic , in fact ) for an efficient abstract interpreter .
For the pure lambda calculus , as described by the following grammar :
f, e ::= ( lambda ( v ) e ) | ( f e ) | v v is a variable
0CFA could be thought of as filling in a " flows to " relation according to three rules :
For each lambda term ( lambda ( v ) e ) : ( lambda ( v ) e ) flows to ( lambda ( v ) e ) .
For each application ( f e ) , if the value ( lambda ( v ) e ' ) flows to the function f and the value value flows to the argument e , then value flows to v .
For each application ( f e ) , if the value ( lambda ( v ) e ' ) flows to the function f and the value value flows to body e' , then value flows to ( f e ) .
A word about k-CFA
k - CFA improves the precision of the flow analysis by considering in what context a value flows to an expression .
For instance , 1CFA might say , " ( lambda ( v ) e ) flows to the variable x , when the procedure ( lambda ( x ) e ' ) is called from the site ( g h ) . "
Where to learn more
If you 'd like to get into the details of how CFAs work , there are a few good papers and books out there .
Here 's what I recommend :
Principles of Program Analysis covers many topics in static program analysis , including abstract interpretation , CFAs and data - flow analysis .
The book covers both imperative and functional languages .
It describes techniques so standard you 'll find them in GCC , but it also contains analyses so sophisticated that no one has ever implemented them in a commercial compiler .

A reference implementation of k-CFA in R5RS Scheme
The implementation below of k-CFA is a tutorial / reference implementation .
That is , it 's purely functional , it uses convenient data structures over efficient data structures , and it does n't use any form of widening to accelerate convergence .
( In fact , it is exponential time instead of cubic . )
The implementation is based on the mathematics found in my Ph.D. dissertation .
It uses a small - step abstract interpreter that transforms an abstract machine state into possible successor states .
To compute the analysis , it crawls the graph of machine states ( starting from an initial state ) until all potentially reachable states have been found .
The resulting set of reachable states is then summarized to yield a composite abstract heap .
This abstract heap is further summarized to produce a map from variables to the lambda terms which may flow to them .

8 Reasons Team - Level Agile Is n't Enough
Read this eBook to find out eight reasons how only using team - level agile may be limiting the organization and the keys to increasing effectiveness and scalability as the organization grows .
Tom Warner documents the powerful beauty of lightning with an array of optical and electromagnetic sensors .
He often uses a Vision Research ‘ Phantom ’ high - speed camera .
Warner is a Ph.D student at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology , in Rapid City .
He studies atmospheric sciences with a specialty in lightning research .
“ Lightning is one of nature ’s most spectacular phenomena , ” says Warner .
“ I want to understand how lightning behaves . ”
“ Since 2007 , I have used high - speed video cameras capable of recording lightning at up to 54,000 images per second .
These cameras enable us to see lightning like never before , as we can clearly see lightning propagate downward from the clouds or upward from tall objects .
The camera continuously records in a looping memory buffer .
“ When I see a flash take place , I trigger the camera at the end of the flash and it saves the previous 2.5 seconds of video prior to the trigger . ”
He then saves the video into the camera ’s memory .
It is then transferred to a computer hard drive to analyze later .
Warner explains what ’s in each of these six videos , and how he made them .
Above :
Near Devil ’s Tower , Wyoming
The video shows a downward - propagating negatively charged , stepped leader .
The lightning branches out in many different directions , causing one leader to make a connection with the ground , creating a bright return stroke .
The lightning was filmed at 7,200 images per second ( 139 microseconds per image ) .
The downward leaders are traveling at a couple of hundred kilometers per second .
The bright return stroke travels upward at around half the speed of light , and is too fast to capture in more than one image .
Bear Butte , South Dakota
The video shows multiple , negative stepped leaders .
The leaders travel in many different directions and periodically pause and redevelop .
Eventually a negative stepped leader travels downward and reaches the ground , creating a return stroke .
Filmed at 7,200 images per second ( 139 microseconds per image ) .
Above the Clouds
This lightning , a negative stepped leader , was filmed from an airplane .
A stepped leader forms a connection making a return stroke with a rapid re-brightening of the channel .
A second brightening is caused by a fast , downward dart - leader .
It travels down the same channel and causes a second return stroke .
When seen in real time , it looks like flickering .
Filmed at 1,000 images per second ( 1 millisecond per image ) .
From the Clouds
Video shows a positive leader of lightning from a cloud .
There is a return stroke after the lightning hits the ground .
The positive leader is very dim and highly branched at first .
A strobe effect appears along the dim branch channels .
These are recoil leaders and actually travel back towards the clouds along the channel branches .
This is a unique feature of positive - leader development — not seen optically , Warner notes , until the advent of high - speed cameras .
Filmed at 7,200 images per second .
Negative Lightning Hits Tower
This is a unique recording of a downward , negative stepped leader that makes a connection with a tower .
As the negative stepped leader gets closer to the tower , a positive leader forms from the tower tip and moves upward .
This upward leader connects with the downward leader and a return stroke occurs .
Five more dart leader - return strokes follow .
Filmed at 7,200 images per second .
TV Tower Initiates Lightning Strike
This video shows a positively charged upward - propagating leader .
It forms from the tip of a TV tower , then branches up to the cloud above .
Some of the dim branches exhibit bright recoil leaders .
The shape of the tower enhances its electric field , which in essence , initiates the lightning .
Filmed at 7,200 images per second .
I 'm afraid that there are a few minor mistakes in the article , though overall it 's pretty accurate from a physics perspective .
In order to see where those mistakes are , consider these two facts :
a ) the " vacuum of space " is pretty empty , although not totally empty .
What that means is that its pressure is very very low compared to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level ( ie , the pressure we have evolved to live with ) .
b ) the human body ( or any other living organism , other than certain plants ) has cavities ( some filled with gasses and / or liquid fluids ) , cells ( which have an internal osmotic pressure ) , and tissues ( which have both liquids and gasses dissolved in them , at various concentrations and partial pressures ) .
Certain plants have cells with rigid walls , so they 're not as easily deformable as human cells .
So , on to the article .
1. Exploding eyeballs
" Fortunately , eyeballs would n't explode in a vacuum , any more than they 'd cave in under 33 feet of water . "
This is entirely correct , and the comparison is a good one .
At 33 feet / 10 meters of ( sea ) water , you are already exposed to an entire extra atmosphere 's worth of pressure .
In fact , you gain one atmosphere of pressure for every 10 meters of sea water .
Since the ocular pressure ( the pressure of the liquid inside your eyes , called aqueous humor ) is about 1 atm , and the water pressure outside is 2 atm , the relative pressure is 1 atm , the same relative pressure between the inside of your eyes and the vacuum of space .
From personal experience , we all know that 10 meters underwater wo n't have much of an effect on anyone .
( Well , those of us who like diving know that )
Therefore , being in the vacuum of space wo n't make your eyeballs explode .
What 's likely to happen is that the aqueous humor will start sipping through the walls of the eyeballs , decreasing the internal ocular pressure .
This will happen very slowly , however , because 1 atm of differential pressure is not all that much .
You 'll also have some rupturing blood vessels in the eyes ( for the same reason , the blood would start sipping through the arteries in an attempt to equalize the pressure inside the arteries with the pressure outside ) , but the eyes themselves wo n't explode .
They might , in fact , shrink a little , due to the escaping aqueous humor , which would alleviate possible glaucoma symptoms .
You may die in space , but you 'll not go blind with glaucoma .
( Glaucoma is the condition where the ocular pressure is larger than normal , large enough to make an eyeball swell , putting pressure over the corresponding ocular nerve , cutting off its blood supply , and causing it to die .
The condition is neither reversible nor curable but it is preventable )
" The body would n't swell up and explode like a marshmallow in a microwave , either .
There 's just not enough pressure inside of us to blow us up . "
Again , this is entirely correct .
And for the same reasons as above .
The differential pressure is 1 atm and that 's fairly small to do anything to the body .
Just as before , however , fluids that are inside the body ( both liquid and gasses ) will start sipping through the interstices between the cells , attempting to escape the body .
You wo n't notice the liquid sipping , though , because it will happen way too gradually .
The gas sipping , on the other hand , might be noticeable depending on the concentrations under which they 're dissolved in your tissues and blood .
If you 're a scuba diver , you know about " the bends " which is a sudden release of gasses dissolved in your blood ( usually Nitrogen ) into your muscles .
When you dive to even moderate depths and stay there for a long time , nitrogen in the air you breathe gets dissolved into your blood .
Since the air you breathe is under high pressure ( to compensate for the high pressure of the outside water , or else your lungs would collapse and you would n't be able to breathe at all ) , the Nitrogen is also under high pressure .
As you breathe , it gets dissolved into your blood and accumulates there .
If too much accumulates , you may suffer from something called Nitrogen narcosis , which causes ( typically temporary ) neurological effects .
Essentially , you go nuts for a while .
Now , as you rise up to the surface , the outside pressure is decreasing , so the high - pressure dissolved Nitrogen boils off the blood into the surrounding tissues .
If you come up too quickly , that boiling off can be extremely painful and may cause serious injuries .
Note that it 's not your blood that is boiling , and neither is anything boiling because of increased temperatures .
The Nitrogen in your blood is boiling off because it is dissolved at a higher pressure than the surrounding areas .
It 's exactly like when you open a bottle of coke after you 've shaken it up .
So , yeah , when you 're thrown off the airlock , gasses dissolved in the tissue under your skin will start boiling off , and that 's probably much more painful than just tickling .
2. Freezing to death .
" For one thing , space is n't freezing .
Space is n't any temperature .
Temperature is the measurement of the movement of atoms .
There are n't many atoms in a vacuum , so technically there can't be a temperature . "
The above is n't quite correct .
You are correct that temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of a collection of moving objects , but even a small number of objects can have a large temperature , if they have a large average kinetic energy .
If you 're in a region of space with lots of radiation , then it 's possible for the temperature of vacuum to be above freezing .
If there are n't any sources of radiation , then it * is* pretty cold in space .
However , that has little effect on you because there are n't enough atoms to exchange energy with the atoms in your body ( and not because there is n't a temperature , as claimed ) .
Think of it this way .
A thermometer works ( ie , measures temperature ) because it robs some energy from what you 're trying to measure the temperature of .
You do n't want a large thermometer because it will rob so much energy that the measurement will be incorrect .
So , by making the thermometer small , little energy is robbed , just enough to sample the object 's temperature .
Now , if the thermometer is too small , it will rob so little energy that there will be no noticeable effect in the object .
And this is true regardless of the initial temperature of the thermometer itself .
The vacuum of space is like a tiny but very cold thermometer .
It 's very cold , but there are so few atoms that they wo n't rob enough energy from you in a reasonable amount of time for you to notice .
3. Boiling Blood .
Everything mentioned in this section is correct , but something was not mentioned that should have been .
The gasses that are dissolved in the various tissues , in the blood , and which occupy various cavities of the body .
As I mentioned a couple of paragraphs above , those gasses will boil off , and that 's both painful and potentially fatal .
4. Lung Shredding
" They also happen to hold gas that expands quite a bit when external pressure is dropped . "
Indeed , and that 's what I 've already explained above .
When these gasses expand and boil off the various tissues , those tissues can be damaged .
The alveoli are some of the most fragile macroscopic organelles in the body .
Imagine that they 're tiny coke bottles .
You can imagine the rest .
" Because a vacuum does not carry sound very well "
Not just not very well , but not at all .
Sound does not travel in a vacuum .
" Fortunately , this only happens if you hold your breath , "
Quite possibly not true .
Your eardrums will probably burst , which is an excruciatingly painful experience ( I know , because I punctured my right eardrum in an accident in 1993 ) .
They 'll pop , not because of the pressure differential - it 's only 1 atm - but because of the sudden change in pressure .
You 're being thrown out the airlock , going from a pressure differential of 0 to that of 1 atm , in a matter of seconds .
Your eardrums will bend outward and will likely pop , exposing the so - called Eustachian tube to the vacuum of space .
Now , the Eustachian tube is connected to your larynx , which is connected to your lungs through the trachea .
Ergo , say goodbye to your alveoli .
And once your alveoli burst , exposing your blood to the vacuum of space , then the gasses dissolved in your blood and surrounding tissue will start boiling off at a faster rate .
Of course , if you do n't hold your breath , it 's even worse , because your lungs will be exposed right away , and will collapse and start bleeding rather quickly .
Heart failure .
" Once a heart stops , the pressure inside of small blood vessels drops , allowing the vacuum to damage them faster .
Once the tissue dissolves and the liquid is exposed , well , that 's when the blood boiling happens . "
Much of the above is n't correct , actually .
For instance , if the pressure inside of a vessel drops , then it 's going in the direction of equalizing the pressures inside and out , which means that * less * damage would be caused by the differential pressure , not more .
Also , there is no dissolving tissue .
Stuff happens in the opposite direction .
First , stuff happens and then the heart fails , not the heart fails and then stuff happens .
As I already pointed out , what first happens is that the differential pressure causes fluids and gasses to start sipping through the skin and your lungs start collapsing and bleeding ( as a result of the exposure of the Eustachian tube , whether or not you hold your breath - of course , if you do n't hold your breath , it 's even faster because your lungs will collapse right away ) .
The leaking of gasses from blood to tissues and through the tissues causes the blood vessels to dilate , which decreases blood pressure .
The natural response of the body to both a decreased lung capacity and a decreased blood pressure is to increase the heart rate .
With no blood circulating back to the heart from the lungs ( they 're collapsed ! ) and with blood loss , the heart simply can't keep up and eventually fails .
Apparently , that happens fairly quickly , quickly enough that you die of heart failure before you asphyxiate .
Republicans in Congress have introduced a breathtaking new budget plan that would essentially put America ’s plutocracy on steroids .
By Sam Pizzigati
The Republican Party , critics like to quip , has become the “ party of no . ”
That tag no longer works .
The GOP has now become , thanks to a sweeping new legislative proposal from the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee , the “ party of whoa ” — as in , “ Whoa , they ca n’t be serious . ”
Rep. Paul Ryan could hardly be more serious .
Admirers consider this lawmaker from Wisconsin the top GOP “ idea man ” in Congress , and Ryan ’s proposed new Roadmap for America ’s Future is certainly advancing one whopper of an idea .
In a nutshell : With one in ten Americans jobless and one in eight home mortgages delinquent , Rep .
Ryan wants to raise taxes on the middle class and slash them on the rich , shove Social Security retirement savings onto Wall Street , and hand insurance companies even more control over the nation ’s health care .
You wo n’t find , of course , a hint of any of this at the ever so slick Web presence House Republicans have created to pitch Rep. Ryan ’s Roadmap .
On the Web , and in all the publicity for this new gameplan for America , an earnest but always genial Ryan presents his Roadmap as “ a comprehensive , alternative approach to the Nation ’s most pressing domestic priorities . ”
Enactment of the Roadmap , we ’re promised , would bring us “ universal access to affordable health coverage , ” make Social Security “ sustainable , ” and establish a “ simplified ” tax system that “ rewards work , saving , and investment . ”
Last week , in a series of devastatingly detailed analyses , Washington ’s policy wonk community neatly shredded every one of these claims .
First out of the gate : the Tax Policy Center , an offshoot of the centrist Brookings Institution .
Rep. Ryan ’s Roadmap , Center analyst Howard Gleckman noted , would annually generate “ hundreds of billions ” less in revenue than advertised .
Its passage “ would give a huge tax cut to the wealthy , while cutting taxes by little or nothing ( and in some cases even raising taxes ) for low - and middle - income people . ”
The Tax Policy Center report on the Roadmap zeroes in on the Ryan plan ’s likely impact in 2014 .
That becomes a somewhat complicated task , since the Roadmap actually lets taxpayers choose between tax systems .
One tax system would make the George W. Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 permanent .
The other , a new “ simplified ” system , would set a 25 percent tax on family income over $ 100,000 and a 10 percent tax on income under .
But these tax rates would only apply to income from work .
Income from investments — interest , dividends , and capital gains — would all go untaxed .
Given these ground rules , and assuming that taxpayers would choose the tax system that minimizes their tax liability , the Tax Policy Center has calculated that the Roadmap ’s passage would , on average , save taxpayers who make more than $ 1 million over $ 633,000 in 2014 .
Taxpayers in 2014 who earn between $ 40,000 and $ 50,000 would pay , under Rep. Ryan ’s Roadmap , $ 128 more in total federal taxes .
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities last week quickly echoed the Tax Policy Center findings — in more forceful prose .
The GOP ’s Roadmap , the Center posited , “ would result in a massive transfer of resources from the broad majority of Americans to the nation ’s wealthiest individuals . ”
The Ryan gameplan , this Center pointed out , “ would cut in half the taxes of the richest 1 percent of Americans . ”
Average families , by contrast , would find themselves facing a future with considerably less retirement and health security .
On health , the Center analysis explained , the Roadmap would “ end traditional Medicare and most of Medicaid . "
In their place : vouchers whose values “ would erode over time ” and buy “ fewer health care services . ”
On Social Security , the Ryan plan would cut benefits , by up to 28 percent , and divert the savings into privatized accounts that taxpayers would be obliged , if need be , to bail out .
Citizens for Tax Justice , the third of the groups to report in last week on the Roadmap , would be blunter still .
“ It ’s difficult to design a tax plan that will lose $ 2 trillion over a decade even while requiring 90 percent of taxpayers to pay more , ” the research group observed .
“ But Congressman Paul Ryan has met that daunting challenge . ”
Citizens for Tax Justice ran the numbers to see what a Roadmap America would look like in 2011 .
In that year , with the Roadmap in effect , the nation ’s bottom 80 percent of taxpayers “ would pay about $ 1,700 more , on average , than they would if President Obama ’s proposals were enacted . ”
For the richest 1 percent : an average $ 211,300 tax savings .
Do any of these numbers really matter ?
Should we be shaking in our boots at the thought of an America that actually followed Rep. Ryan ’s Roadmap ?
Some would argue no .
Ryan ’s party , after all , has no congressional majority .
The Roadmap has zero chance of making its way into law this year .
That could change , of course , after November ’s elections .
The new Congress sworn in next January could have the votes to set America on the Roadmap ’s course .
But the Roadmap will remain dangerous even if the November elections do n’t alter the nation ’s political calculus .
The reason ?
Giveaways to the rich as outrageously blatant as Rep. Ryan ’s Roadmap make our staggeringly unequal status quo look good .
Democrats , by stopping the Roadmap , would legitimately be able to claim they ’ve accomplished something .
But the United States , despite that victory , would remain as plutocratic as ever , with a top 1 percent that holds over $ 3.5 trillion more in wealth than the bottom 90 percent of Americans combined and a tax system that has the super rich paying less in taxes than their receptionists .
This America needs to disappear in our national rearview mirror .
We need a roadmap that can help this disappearing along .

Webapps on App Engine part 1 : Routing
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , coding , app - engine , tech , framework
This is part of a series on writing a webapp framework for App Engine Python .
For details , see the introductory post here .
The first part of a framework you encounter when using one is , more often than not , the routing code .
With that in mind , it 's what we 'll be tackling first .
There are several approaches to handling request routing , and we 'll go on a quick tour of the libraries and approaches before we decide on one and implement it .
The built - in App Engine webapp framework takes an extremely straightforward approach :
The incoming request 's URL is compared to a list of regular expressions in order , and the first one that matches has the corresponding handler executed .
As an enhancement , any captured groups in the regular expression are passed to the request handler as additional arguments .
You can see the code that does all this here - it 's extremely straightforward and easy to follow .
The webapp module does one thing that I 'm not a huge fan of :
It ties the request routing in with handling the requests .
The same function that finds the appropriate handler for a request also takes care of parsing the request and calling the appropriate methods on the RequestHandler subclass .
As a result , RequestHandler classes are not WSGI applications , and you can't mix non-webapp apps in .
With that caveat in mind , let 's continue to look at some of the alternate approaches .
Django's approach to URL handling is documented here .
It bears a remarkable resemblance to the webapp module 's approach , and for good reason : A lot of App Engine 's python library was inspired by Django .
One difference worth noting about the way Django handles things is that the second parameter in each tuple is the string name of the module that will handle requests for that URL regex , rather than the class itself .
This seems a little awkward , but provides a real benefit :
It means we do n't need to load every handler module in order to service a request to just one of them .
We 'll discuss optimisations like this in more detail in a later post .
In the realm of independent libraries , there are several prominent options .
The routes library is a port of the Rails routing system , and uses a rather sophisticated system based on expressions that symbolically represent the sort of URLs you want to match .
For example , the string " / error/{action} / {id} " matches any URL that has 3 slash - separated components starting with " / error " , and breaks out the last two into separate variables , ' action ' and ' id ' .
Somewhat counterintuitively , the Routes library does n't actually route requests to individual WSGI applications or handlers ; instead it simply takes care of parsing URL patterns into dictionaries mapping set keys to values found in the URL .
In that respect it 's very sophisticated , allowing a great deal of flexibility in how you specify your URL parsing , including default values , regular expressions , and other features .
It 's then the job of another ( simpler ) piece of WSGI middleware to take the information routes produces and use it to dispatch to the appropriate handler .
Besides being typically easier to understand and more flexible than a naive regular - expression based system , Routes ' approach has another advantage :
It 's possible to perform the reverse transformation , and generate a URL given a dict like that generated by routes .
As long as your apps use this to generate URLs when they 're needed , this means that you or your users can completely restructure the URL structure of your app without needing to make any changes to the rest of your code .
The werkzeug framework provides a similar mechanism , enhancing it with ' converter ' functions that specify the accepted characters and converting the returned value .
Unlike Routes , however , it does n't provide the capability to use the mapping in the reverse direction , generating URLs .
Edit : Werkzeug also supports doing reverse mappings , like Routes .
Finally , Webob's " do it yourself framework " demonstrates a method that is very similar to that defined by Routes , but has the substantial advantage that it 's easily converted from the semantic form users enter into an ordinary regular expression .
It is on this that we will base our own routing middleware .
First , let 's take a look at the template_to_regex function from the webob framework , which we will use without modification :
>>> import re >>> var_regex = re.compile(r ''' ... \{ #
The exact character " { " ... ( \w + ) #
The variable name ( restricted to a - z , 0 - 9 , _ ) ... (? ::( [ ^} ] + ) ) ? #
The optional : regex part ... \} #
The exact character " } " ... ''' , re.VERBOSE ) >>> def template_to_regex ( template ) : ... regex = '' ... last_pos = 0 ... for match in var_regex.finditer ( template ) : ... regex += re.escape(template[last_pos:match.start ( ) ] ) ... var_name = match.group ( 1 ) ... expr = match.group ( 2 ) or ' [ ^ / ]+' ... expr = '( ?
P< %s> %s ) ' % ( var_name , expr ) ... regex += expr ... last_pos = match.end ( ) ... regex += re.escape(template[ last_pos : ] ) ... regex = '^ %s$ ' % regex ... return regex
The workings of this function are described in detail on the webob site , but we 'll go over the basics here .
Our ultimate goal is to take strings that contain expressions of the form " {variable : regex} " and convert them into fully formed regular expressions .
For example , a template such as " /{year : \d\d\d\d}/{month: \d\d}/{slug} " should be converted into the regular expression " ^/(? P< year > \d\d\d\d )/(? P< month > \d\d ) /(? P< slug >[ ^/ ] + ) $ " .
The parentheses in the regular expression are capturing subexpressions , meaning their contents will be available to us if the expression matches , while the " ? P " part signifies a label for that subexpression , allowing us to access it by name rather than by position .
The main part of the function is a loop over every template expression found in the input string .
The output regular expression is built up in the variable named ' regex ' .
For each match , we first append the text between the previous match ( if any ) and the current one ( after escaping it , so special characters are n't mistakenly interpreted as regular expression modifiers ) .
Then , the variable name and regular expression are extracted from the template expression .
If no regular expression was specified , the default expression " [ ^/ ] + " , meaning one or more non -forward - slash characters , is used .
The regular expression for this match is then appended to the regex - so - far , as a named sub - group as we described above .
Finally , any remaining text is appended to the string , and the whole regular expression is wrapped in ' ^ ' and ' $ ' , the regular expression symbols that indicate the start and end of a string .
And yes , if you think using a regular expression to parse bits of regular expression into a new regular expression is all a bit meta , you 're not alone .
Now that we 've sorted out what format we 'll use for specifying routes , we 're ready to write the routing code itself .
We 'll be using a system similar to Routes , whereby you can specify additional default named arguments with your route and handler , but our handlers will be regular WSGI applications , called directly , rather than using the extra layer of indirection provided by Routes .
Also , although we have left the door open for being able to do the reverse transform of handlers back to URLs , we wo n't be doing so in our first iteration .
class WSGIRouter ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self.routes = [ ] def connect ( self , template , handler , ** kwargs ) : " " " Connects URLs matching a template to a handler application .
Args : template : A template string , consisting of literal text and template expressions of the form {label [ : regex]} , where label is the mandatory name of the expression , and regex is an optional regular expression .
handler : A WSGI application to execute when the template is matched .
** kwargs : Additional keyword arguments to pass along with those parsed from the template . " " " route_re = re.compile( template_to_regex( template ) ) self.routes.append(( route_re , handler , kwargs ) )
As you can see , the basic code for our router is extremely simple .
We define a method , connect ( ) , which takes a template string , a handler , and optional keyword arguments .
This method calls template_to_regex to generate a regular expression , then inserts that and the additional argument in the list of routes .
The real work happens when our router object is called as a WSGI application :
def __call__( self , environ , start_response ) : for regex , handler , kwargs in self.routes : match = regex.match ( environ [ ' PATH_INFO ' ] ) if match : environ [ ' router.args ' ] = dict ( kwargs ) environ [ ' router.args '].update(match.groupdict ( ) ) return handler ( environ , start_response )
The name of the method , __call__ , distinguishes this as a special method to python .
Normally it 's not possible to call an object as you would a function , but if your class defines the __call__ method , this method is executed when someone calls your object .
This allows objects of our WSGIRouter class to act as regular WSGI applications .
When our router is called , it iterates over each of the routes that were provided , and for each one attempts to match it against the PATH_INFO CGI variable .
If it finds a match , it extends the WSGI environment by adding a variable called ' router.args ' .
This variable consists of any static arguments that were passed to the connect ( ) method , in addition to the values of all the matched template parameters .
The router then calls the selected WSGI app , returning its result to its own caller .
It 's up to whatever WSGI application is being called to extract the router.args variable from its environment if it needs it , and to act on it accordingly .
Let 's define a simple webapp to test all this out :
def hello_app ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( 200 , [ ( " Content - Type " , " text / plain " ) ] ) return [ " Hello , world . " ] def echo_app ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( 200 , [ ( " Content - Type " , " text / plain " ) ] ) return [ repr( environ [ ' router.args ' ] ) ] router = WSGIRouter ( ) router.connect ( " / hello " , hello_app ) router.connect ( " / echo /{foo}/{bar:[ 0 -9]+} " , echo_app , test = " test " ) def main ( ) : run_wsgi_app( router ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main ( )
This app defines two handlers , mapped to two different URL patterns .
If you go to ' / hello ' , you should see " Hello , world . " .
If you go to a URL such as " / echo/bleh /123 " , you should see the complete template dict - in this example , it 'll be " {'test ' : ' test ' , ' foo ' : ' bleh ' , ' bar ' : ' 123'} " .
That 's it for routing !
In the next post we 'll handle decoding and encoding requests and responses .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Two ex-Blackwater Worldwide employees allege the company charged the government for a prostitute and strippers and kept incompetent personnel for financial reasons , part of what they call a systematic pattern to defraud authorities .
The accusations come in a lawsuit filed by Brad and Melan Davis -- who said the fraudulent activity , such as double billing and submitting false invoices , occurred while the security firm , now known as Xe , carried out its work in Iraq , Afghanistan and in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina 's aftermath .
Melan Davis , who was involved in record - keeping , said Blackwater billed the government for prostitution services in Afghanistan from a Filipino female , whose name was on Blackwater 's payroll roster under a category called " Morale Welfare Recreation . "
She said Blackwater billed the woman 's plane tickets and monthly salary to the United States .
The lawsuit also said a vendor being paid for " cleaning services " in Louisiana was providing strippers .
Another accusation in the suit was that Melan Davis was wrongfully dismissed after raising the issue of " fraud and abuse . "
Xe on Friday responded to the suit .
" The allegations are without merit and the company will vigorously defend against this lawsuit .
It is noteworthy that the government has declined to intervene in this action , " Xe said in a statement to CNN .
The married couple filed suit in December 2008 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the False Claims Act .
It was unsealed this month .
Blackwater became the target of widespread Iraqi outrage after its contractors were involved in the September 2007 shooting in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square that left 17 civilians dead .
That outrage was renewed in December when a U.S. judge dismissed manslaughter charges against five guards involved in the shootings on constitutional grounds .
In the fraud suit , Brad Davis , an ex-Marine who worked as a security guard for Blackwater , said he " personally observed " three instances where personnel " intentionally used excessive and unjustified deadly force " and the suit said Blackwater refused to fire such " unqualified people . "
Blackwater would continue to retain " wholly incompetent " personnel so they could pay their tuition bills to the company 's private training facility , the suit said .
In Louisiana , where Blackwater was contracted to supply security services after Katrina , employees there " submitted a variety of bogus receipts , " the suit said .
" For example , Blackwater employees , when filling up Blackwater vehicles at commercial gas stations , would simply pick up the receipts that were left behind by other customers .
They would then submit these receipts and be paid in cash by Blackwater . "
At the same time , the suit said , Blackwater failed to provide the services set down under its contract with Louisiana and the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
It said Blackwater did n't monitor the " deadly weapons " it provided employees and " lost track of countless weapons . "
The suit said Blackwater overbilled for travel expenses and " created phone invoices to obscure the fact that Blackwater had failed to keep any of the necessary contemporaneous documentation on travel . "
The suit said Melan Davis attempted " to blow the whistle on the fraud and abuse occurring in New Orleans " and was told in 2006 she " needed to back off . "
The suit said she was fired in 2008 when " she was on leave battling cancer . "
Blackwater had about 1,000 contractors working in Iraq at the height of its involvement , guarding diplomatic convoys and supply vehicles after the U.S. invasion in 2003 .
At least 10 of its employees were killed , including four whose burned and mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Falluja after an ambush in 2004 .
A new type of technology may bring Mars and distant planets even closer to home than previously imagined .
The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket -- or VASIMR -- could cut space travel time to nearly a sixth of the time currently required .
While traditional chemical based rockets could bring men to Mars in just over three years , the new VASIMR engine could cut that travel time to just 39 days .
NASA is pinning its hopes on private firms like Ad Astra , developer of the VASIMR , to pioneer novel technologies after the Obama administration cancelled its next manned moon mission .
[ NASA was ] mesmerized by the Apollo days and lived in the Apollo era for 40 years , and they just forgot developing something new , Ad Astra 's chairman , Frank Chang - Diaz , tells AFP .
Diaz said his rockets would use electricity to transform fuel -- hydrogen , helium or deuterium -- into plasma gas that , in turn , would be channeled by magnetic fields and ejected at high speeds .
That would send a shuttle toward distant planets like Mars up to an estimated 35 miles per second until , Diaz told the service .
Additionally , the use of ionized fuel could create a magnetic field around the spacecraft to protect against radiation .
So far , only scaled - down models of the VASIMR have been built and tested in a vacuum , under a deal with NASA .

The committee has also governments approach to copyright
An influential group of MPs and peers has said the government 's approach to illegal file - sharing could breach the rights of internet users .
The Joint Select Committee on Human Rights said the government 's Digital Economy Bill needed clarification .
It said that technical measures - which include cutting off persistent pirates - were not " sufficiently specified " .
In addition , it said that it was concerned that the Bill could create " over - broad powers " .
" The internet is constantly creating new challenges for policy - makers but that cannot justify ill - defined or sweeping legislative responses , especially when there is the possibility of restricting freedom of expression or the privacy of individual users , " said Andrew Dismore MP and chair of the Committee .
A spokesperson for the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , which oversees the Digital Economy Bill , said that government had " always been clear that [ its ] proposals to deal with unlawful file - sharing should not contravene human rights " .
' Sweeping powers '
The Select Committee only examined the parts of the Bill that focus on plans to tackle illegal file - sharing as well as a controversial amendment to copyright law .
" The concern we have with this Bill is that it lacks detail , " said Mr Dismore .
" It has been difficult , even in the narrow area we have focussed on , to get a clear picture of the scope and impact of the provisions . "
The Digital Economy Bill was outlined in the Queen 's speech in November 2009 .
One of the most hotly - debated elements is the so - called " three strikes rule " that would give regulator Ofcom new powers to disconnect or slow down the connections of persistent net pirates .
The Committee said it had concerns about " technical measures " like these and how they would be applied .
DIGITAL ECONOMY BILL Legal framework for tackling copyright infringement via education and technical measures Ofcom given powers to appoint and fund independently funded news consortia New duties for Ofcom to assess the UK 's communications infrastructure every two years Modernising spectrum to increase investment in mobile broadband Framework for the move to digital radio switchover by 2015 Updating Channel 4 functions to encompass public service content , on TV and online Age ratings compulsory for all boxed video games aimed at those over 12 years
For example , the government has not specified whether a whole household could be cut off if only one member of a family was identified as a persistent file - sharer .
The committee said that measures such as this have " the potential to breach internet users ' rights " and had not been " sufficiently specified to allow for an assessment of proportionality " .
Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group , which has campaigned against the measures , said that disconnecting alleged file - sharers was " draconian and unpredictably damaging " .
A spokesperson for BIS said : " slowing down or suspending peoples broadband would only be invoked following several clear warnings " .
Any technical measures would require " secondary legislation " , he added .
" There will be no technical measures imposed at all if the initial measures taken are as successful as we expect . "
The Committee also examined Clause 17 of the bill , which would give the government the power to amend the copyright law without passing further primary legislation .
The clause has proved controversial .
In late 2009 , a consortium of web companies including Facebook , Google , Yahoo and eBay wrote to the business secretary Peter Mandelson objecting to the clause .
The web firms urged MPs to remove the clause , which they said could give government " unprecedented and sweeping powers " to amend copyright laws .
The Select Committee said that it had been told that changes would be made to the clause to ensure that any amendments to copyright law would be " better scrutinised by Parliament " .
" Despite this the Committee remains concerned that Clause 17 remains overly broad and that parliamentary scrutiny may remain inadequate , " it said .
The BIS spokesperson said that government had already tabled " a series of amendments which aim to clarify the breadth and scope of clause 17 " .
The Digital Economy bill is currently being scrutinised by the House of Lords .
It was dealt a blow recently when Sion Simon , one of the MPs charged with pushing it through parliament , announced he was standing down .

Given it will stretch to several million words , Lord Saville 's report on Bloody Sunday is bound to contain surprises when it is finally published .
The exhaustive document will be handed to Shaun Woodward , the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , in a week 's time and the findings are likely to be made public a few days later .
If it concludes that the 14 people who were killed in Londonderry 's Bogside on that fateful January day in 1972 had guns or bombs on them , it will create a sensation .
This would be because , firstly , all the years of hearings and hundreds of witnesses have failed to produce convincing evidence to back up allegations that those killed were gunmen and bombers .
Secondly , two former British prime ministers , one Conservative and one Labour , have already exonerated those killed .
In 1992 , John Major said the dead " should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives " .
This was endorsed by Tony Blair when he set up the inquiry in 1998 .
In fact , the authorities conceded as far back as the mid-1970s that those shot by the Parachute Regiment were not gunmen or bombers .
Lord Saville will certainly take note of the fact that thousands of people were taking part in an illegal march , troops were attacked with stones and missiles , and several shots were fired by republicans .
But no soldiers were killed or injured by gunfire or nail bombs , and no weapons were recovered by the Army .
It seems out of the question Lord Saville will conclude there was anything that could come close to justifying the killings .
It is also unlikely that he will give any real credence to various myths , such as the assertion 34 gunmen and bombers were killed by the Army and spirited away for secret burials .
That theory was effectively despatched at a hearing by one of the great emblematic figures of the Troubles , the now - retired Catholic bishop Fr Edward Daly .
On Bloody Sunday he was a young local priest , crouching and desperately waving a blood - stained handkerchief , seeking safe passage from troops as a fatally injured youth was carried away .
That image will endure in Irish history .
At the hearing , counsel for more than 400 soldiers commended the churchman 's honesty and what was described as his record of outspoken opposition to violence .
Asked about the supposed secret burials , he gave a curt response : " I think it is offensive nonsense . "
He also gave an insight into the lasting effects of Bloody Sunday when he described visiting young people in prison .
Many of them told him , he recalled , that they would never have become involved in the IRA if it had not been for the events of that day .
Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein confirmed in his memoirs how it had swelled republican ranks .
" Money , guns and recruits flooded into the IRA , " he wrote .
In 1972 , the city had a particularly dangerous Provisional IRA unit whose prime mover , Martin McGuinness , was as effective as an IRA commander as he is today as a Government minister .
His units pulverised so many premises that the city " looked as though it had been bombed from the air " .
During the two - years when he was in command or second - in - command , the organisation killed 29 members of the security forces , 24 of them regular soldiers .
After some hesitation , Mr McGuinness agreed to give evidence to the tribunal .
On Bloody Sunday , he was the organisation 's second - in - command ; afterwards he took over as its " Officer Commanding " .
He told the tribunal : " There was a state of war between the IRA and British military forces .
This was a war area . "
The probability is that the Saville tribunal will not reject his testimony .
On the morning of Bloody Sunday , according to his account , he arose at about 9 am , went to Mass and locked away his guns and bombs .
" Certainly the IRA had nail bombs , but not in that area , " he said .
" It would have been lunacy of the worst kind for anyone to have nail bombs when 30,000 people were on the street . "
He went unarmed to the march on what turned out to be " the worst day that I had ever experienced in my life " .
It was , he said , " devastating – I was in a daze " .
The IRA did not engage the Army , he insisted .
He said : " I felt helpless , angry and disgusted that there was nothing I could do .
I wanted to get a rifle , find other Volunteers and try to do something . "
At that time , political direction was divided between the Cabinet of the Prime Minister , Edward Heath , and a unionist administration at Stormont .
Documents unearthed by the tribunal showed the two governments feared a general breakdown of law and order .
But Bloody Sunday made a bad situation worse , as part of a further escalation of violence which meant that , with almost 500 dead , 1972 was to be by far the worst year of the Troubles .
One theory is that squaddies ran amok , out of the control of ineffective Parachute Regiment officers .
Another is that the military top brass wanted " to teach the IRA a lesson " .
Yet another is that Mr Heath 's Cabinet specifically instructed the Army to take the gloves off .
But it is difficult to believe the conclusion will be that anyone in high authority set out to leave civilian bodies on the streets : it was obvious that such killings were highly damaging to the cause of anyone who caused them .
This was illustrated by the huge reaction to the shootings , locally and internationally , and helps explains why the Heath Government was galvanised into setting up an immediate inquiry under Lord Widgery , then the Lord Chief Justice .
The judge concluded only that the actions of some soldiers " bordered on the reckless " , prompting widespread accusations that this amounted to a cover -up .
As Tony Blair 's chief of staff , Jonathan Powell was involved in the decision to set up the Saville inquiry .
He said that when he read the Widgery report " it was perfectly clear that it was a complete and utter whitewash " .
Lord Widgery was as brisk as Lord Saville has been unhurried and meticulous .
He delivered his report in what some thought almost indecent haste , finishing the task in just 11 weeks .
The document 's text ran to just 39 pages , with some of the deaths rating just one paragraph each .
The judge also studiously refrained from reading hundreds of eyewitness reports .
The report was viewed as adding insult to injury .
As the Irish Government put it : " The victims suffered a second injustice , this time at the hands of Lord Widgery , who sought to taint them with responsibility for their own deaths in order to exonerate those he found it inexpedient to blame . "
The Saville exercise was inordinately time - consuming and expensive .
Even as it proceeded , new legislation was introduced to ensure that no future inquiry would ever again devour such resources .
Jonathan Powell was astounded when even Martin McGuinness remarked to him that " an apology would have been quite sufficient " .
Northern Ireland has , of course , been transformed since 1972 .
Today Mr McGuinness is second - in - command of Northern Ireland 's Government .
But Bloody Sunday is still part - history , part - current affairs .
Lord Saville has a much better chance of producing a report that might command the sort of widespread acceptance that Lord Widgery 's never did .
Yet it is unlikely that his conclusions will satisfy everyone : those who are unshakeably convinced that British ministers ordered a deliberate massacre of innocent civilians will not be satisfied .
There will certainly be much debate on a venture which has generated such a gigantic amount of documentation .
In paper form the material is said to fill a lorry .
No one yet knows , however , whether this colossal exercise will unearth what most can accept as the truth , bring closure to the bereaved , and at last lay to rest the ghosts of Bloody Sunday .
In numbers : The Saville Inquiry
* The tribunal has been the longest and costliest inquiry in British legal history , with a totalcost of almost £ 200m .
* The inquiry sat for 434 days between 2000 and 2004 .
* 2,500 witness statements were collected , with more than 900 people called to give direct evidence .
Those interviewed included more than 600 soldiers and 700 civilians .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
A trendy California sushi restaurant charged by federal authorities with serving whale meat offered an apology Monday , saying it " ignored its responsibilities " to endangered species .
Prosecutors charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc. , the parent company of Santa Monica 's The Hump , and chef Kiyoshiro Yamamoto , 45 , with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose .
Although it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries , meat from whales -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States .
" We write to address the misdemeanor charge recently filed by the U.S. attorney , " the restaurant said in a statement posted on its Web site .
" The charge against the restaurant is true : The Hump served whale meat to customers looking to eat what in Japan is widely served as a delicacy , " the statement continued .
" In serving this meat , The Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species . "
The restaurant pledged to set up procedures to ensure that it complies with laws and " becomes a good corporate citizen . "
" We sincerely apologize .
We pledge to work hard to re-earn the trust of the public and respect of our customers . "
The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $ 200,000 for the company , said Thom Mrozek , spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office .
The law firm for the restaurant and its parent company deferred questions to The Hump 's Web site .
However , Typhoon attorney Gary Lincenberg has said the restaurant accepts responsibility for serving whale and will agree to pay a fine , CNN affiliate KTLA reported .
The investigation into the restaurant began in October , when two members of the team that made the documentary " The Cove " visited The Hump , officials said .
" The Cove , " which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village , won the Academy Award for best documentary this month .
The restaurant , located at the Santa Monica Airport , is known for its exotic fare .
Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for " a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced . "
Crowd marches outside restaurant
Armed with a hidden camera , the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such , a federal criminal complaint said .
A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as " whale " and " horse " with the cost -- $ 85 -- written next to them .
The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University .
He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale , prosecutors said .
The sei is found throughout the world 's oceans .
Whalers began to hunt them after the populations of right , humpback , blue and fin whales declined due to overfishing .
It is now considered an endangered species .
In February and March , the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat , the criminal complaint said .
A DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale , Mrozek said .
During a final visit in March , officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for " kujira , " or whale meat .
One of the officers then saw the sushi chef leave the restaurant and return with a wrapped package that he seemed to have retrieved from a parked Mercedes , the complaint said .
The chef told a customer it was whale meat , the document said .
Next , officials raided the restaurant , and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat , the complaint said .
" Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species , " U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said .
Conservation agencies are engaged in an ongoing feud with Japan over whaling .
In the early 1980s , the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting .
However , whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons , which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts .
The country 's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales .
Many in the international community believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter .

Why did Blackwater set up a new corporate identity when it inked a subcontract with Raytheon to train Afghan troops ?
Masking its scandal - tainted brand was the brainchild of its defense contractor client , according to a top executive for Xe Services ( as Blackwater is now known ) .
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday , Fred Roitz , an executive vice president at Xe , pulled back the curtain on the creation of Paravant , LLC .
He suggested that Raytheon wanted to do business with Blackwater — so long as it did n’t appear that it was actually doing business with the controversial security firm .
Roitz said it was his “ understanding … that the request for a company other than Blackwater came from Raytheon . ”
So Paravant was born .
As Brian McCracken , a former Paravant vice president who now works for Raytheon , acknowledged , the subsidiary and Blackwater were effectively “ one and the same . ”
Along with a bank account and address , Paravant also shared its corporate parent ’s propensity for stirring up controversies .
In May , two of the firm ’s trainers , Justin Cannon and Christopher Drotleff , opened fire on an oncoming car , killing two Afghan civilians and wounding a third .
The men are currently being prosecuted by the Justice Department on second - degree murder and weapons charges .
A months - long investigation by the armed services committee followed , unearthing evidence [ PDF ] that Paravant personnel had acted recklessly , disregarded military regulations , and improperly acquired hundreds of AK - 47s and other firearms that were intended for use by the Afghan National Police .
The probe also indentified a series of vetting lapses by Blackwater and major oversight failures by the army officials that were supposed to be supervising its work .
Paravant ’s two - year contract , which was worth about $ 20 million and expired last fall , was part of a 10 - year , $ 11.2 billion Raytheon program called Warfighter FOCUS that is overseen by the Army ’s Program Executive Office for Simulation , Training , and Instrumentation ( PEO STRI ) .
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , a member of the committee , described Paravant as a “ classic example of a cover corporation , ” created to deceive government contracting personnel about the true corporate governance of Paravant .
Apparently , it worked .
Both the PEO STRI contracting officer overseeing Paravant ’s work , Steven Ograyensek , and the head of its contracting office , James Blake , testified on Wednesday that they were unaware that Paravant was linked to Blackwater .
That is , until the connection became public following the May shooting involving Cannon and Drotleff .
( A source close to Blackwater , however , scoffed at the suggestion that PEO STRI was unaware of Parvant ’s corporate parent .
“ All they had to do was look at the address , ” he said . )
McCaskill said Raytheon ’s apparent attempt to “ cover the fact that they were actually contracting with Blackwater ” was “ very troubling . ”
And she hinted that Raytheon officials may be called upon to answer for this .
( A Raytheon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment . )
In a statement , Raytheon spokesman Jon Kasle declined to directly address Roitz ’s claim , but said the company ’s client , PEO STRI , had been “ involved ” in the “ evaluation and selection process ” of subcontractors , including Paravant .
“ Paravant employees subsequently violated policies of their contract which led to our termination of the relationship for cause last year .
Raytheon has been working closely with our customers to enhance controls , procedures and oversight of contractor and subcontractor personnel .
We will continue to work with our customers to ensure that strong oversight supports the success of our training services programs . ”
“ There ’s clearly an effort to coverup that Blackwater was the real contractor here , ” said Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , the committee ’s chairman .
He added later , “ This is some very serious business we ’re talking about here …
This is deception . ”
During the hearing , McCaskill grilled Roitz about Xe ’s infamously opaque corporate structure .
Under Blackwater founder Erik Prince , who stepped down as the company ’s CEO last March , the firm created an ever expanding network of subsidiaries and related entities , incorporating some of them in tax havens like the Bahamas .
When McCaskill asked Roitz how many names Blackwater / Xe is actually operating under , he was unable to enumerate the extent of Prince ’s corporate holdings .
He told the Senator he would have to get back to her so he did n’t “ forget any . ”
He added , “ We have many names . ”

Tiny particles carrying short strands of RNA can interfere with protein production in tumours .
Cancer genes in human melanomas have been switched off .
National Cancer Institute
Short sequences of RNA that can effectively turn off specific genes have for the first time been used to treat skin cancer in people .
The technique , called RNA interference ( RNAi ) , gained its inventors a Nobel Prize in 2006 , but researchers have struggled to get it to the clinic , partly because of problems in getting the molecules to their target .
Now , Mark Davis from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and his colleagues have found a way to deliver particles containing such sequences to patients with the skin cancer melanoma .
When analysing biopsies of the tumours after treatment , they found that the particles had inhibited expression of a key gene , called RRM2 , needed for the cancer cells to multiply .
Their research is published today in Nature1 .
The researchers created the particles from two polymers plus a protein that binds to receptors on the surface of cancer cells and pieces of RNA called small - interfering RNA , or siRNA , designed to stop the RRM2 gene from being translated into protein .
The siRNA works by sticking to the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) that carries the gene 's code to the cell 's protein - making machinery and ensuring that enzymes cut the mRNA at a specific spot .
When the components are mixed together in water , they assemble into particles about 70 nanometres in diameter .
The researchers can then administer the nanoparticles into the bloodstream of patients , where the particles circulate until they encounter ' leaky ' blood vessels that supply the tumours with blood .
The particles then pass through the vessels to the tumour , where they bind to the cell and are then absorbed .
Once inside the cell , the nanoparticles fall apart , releasing the siRNA .
The other parts of the nanoparticle are so small , they pass out of the body in urine .
" It sneaks in , evades the immune system , delivers the siRNA , and the disassembled components exit out , " Davis says .
Fire at will
The study describes the science behind a phase I trial assessing the safety of the technique in 15 patients .
When researchers analysed tumour samples from three of the patients who volunteered samples , they found fragments of the mRNA in exactly the length and sequence they would expect from the design of their siRNA .
And in at least one patient , the levels of the protein were lower than they were in samples of the tumours taken before treatment .
They also found that patients who were given higher doses had higher levels of siRNA in their tumours .
" The more we put in , the more ends up where they are supposed to be , in tumour cells , " Davis says .
Researchers will need more data from clinical trials to ensure that such therapies are safe to use in people .
But Davis says that his study means there is now direct evidence that nanoparticles and RNAi can be used to attack harmful genes in humans — and not just in the test tube .
" What 's so exciting is that virtually any gene can be targeted now , " he says .
" Every protein now is druggable . "

Davis says that by targeting specific genes he hopes these treatments will not have major side effects .
" My hope is to make tumours melt away while maintaining a high quality of life for the patients , " he says .
" We 're moving another step closer to being able to do that now . "
But some researchers are concerned that the treatment has not been tested on more patients and that more samples were not taken from each patient .
Molecular biologist Thomas Tuschl from Rockefeller University in New York says it is " exciting that such nanoparticles in multiple dosing schemes can reach the tissue and apparently have measurable effects " .
That is , he says , if one wants to believe the data from the single patient who had lower levels of the protein .
" I hope these findings can be confirmed in the future , " he adds .
Biomedical engineer Daniel Anderson from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge has also been trying to develop RNAi delivery systems , and he thinks the data are a great start .
" Generally , people who worry about making therapeutics understand that animals are not people , " he says .
" There are a lot of really exciting data with animals , but ultimately , the usefulness of these types of drug - delivery systems must be evaluated in humans , and that 's why this is an important study .
But it 's not like we 're done . "
For patients in intractable pain , time is not on their side .
Therefore , for supporters , New York 's pending legalization of the medical provision and use of marijuana is timely .
Meanwhile , the debate continues .
Furthermore , its psychoactive component spawns fears of dependency and abuse , although authorized stimulants , antidepressants and analgesics also produce highs and lows .
While critics allege medical marijuana to be addictive , a so - called gateway to lethal drugs and without medical benefit , they also reject it as valid medicine .
So , is medical marijuana " real medicine " or an oxymoron ?
This deep - seated question is unsettling .
Why ?
Because it unearths an unhealthy tension among politics , power and science .
In his " Social Transformation of American Medicine , " sociologist Paul Starr chronicles this tension by describing how U.S. mainstream medicine , through licensing and certification requirements , assumed a purportedly more " scientific " medical paradigm that marginalized alternative , including herbal , therapies .
Wedded politics and science then enabled federal agencies ' virtual embargo on serious research into marijuana 's therapeutic efficacy .
To illustrate , the National Institute on Drug Abuse plantation at the University of Mississippi is the only place where researchers can legally obtain marijuana .
Yet , with pressure from the Drug Enforcement Agency , NIDA 's ongoing denial of research on the plant 's medical benefits has blocked important clinical studies .
As Madelon Lubin Finkel , clinical public health professor at Cornell 's Weill Medical College asserts , " reasons for this prohibition are clearly politically ideological . "

Nicola Tappenden was a 14 - year - old schoolgirl , living in Croydon , when a psychic told her she 'd grow up to do something very special .
She would marry a professional footballer .
At the time , she had a crush on a youth team player – " I fancied the pants off him ; I think I might have snogged him once " – so she confided in her mother that she thought it might be him .
It was n't .
Then Tappenden left school , won a competition to become a Page 3 girl , and met the then West Ham United player Bobby Zamora .
" Two of my friends had stayed at his house , so they invited me over , " she says .
" He got in from football , and he was like , ' Oh my God !
When I left there were two Page 3 girls in my house , and now there are three ! ' "
Tappenden and Zamora started ­dating but again , the relationship did n't work out .
Then she met Simon Walton , a " journeyman " footballer who has had spells at nine ­different clubs in six years , in a branch of Nando's , and they went on a date .
­ Fifteen months ago , the pair had a baby girl , Poppy , and now they 're engaged .
That psychic 's ­prediction should soon come true .
Tappenden is living many young girls ' dream .
She 's a kind , appealing woman – chatting openly about ­everything from her PMT to her ­worries about being a good mother – and I believe her completely when she says that she did n't date Zamora for the publicity .
But she admits it raised her profile : she appeared on TV shows ­including WAGs Boutique and Celebrity Big Brother , began an online ­clothing business , and is now bringing out a single , Drunk .
And yet , when I ask if she could recommend being a footballer 's ­girlfriend , Tappenden says no .
" The money is great for those lads . . . but if you could get the same amount and have a nine - to - five job , I 'd say fuck the football .
And I 'm telling you now , if anything ever happens between me and Simon , I 'll never look at another footballer . . .
I think it 's a bit of a curse on a relationship . "
Cheryl Cole and Toni Terry might well agree .
The past few weeks have cast an ugly light on the lot of a ­footballer 's wife , starting with the ­allegations of John Terry 's affair with Vanessa Perroncel – the former ­partner of his England team - mate Wayne Bridge and friend of his wife , Toni .
This is n't the first time Terry has ­apparently cheated .
There have been many other allegations over the years ­involving a cast of glamour models .
The Terry scandal has been ­followed , in the past few days , by ­stories that naked pictures of the ­Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole have been texted from Cole 's phone to that of a topless model .
He claims a friend of a friend was responsible for sending them , but it's not the first time he has faced allegations of sexual impropriety – specifically , a night with a hairdresser behind the back of his pop star wife , Cheryl .
In fact , footballers can seem a ­singularly priapic bunch , unable to walk past a glamour model without propositioning her for a threesome .
And yet , in recent years , ­marrying a footballer has become highly ­aspirational for some young women .
Surveys confirm it is seen as a career option by a minority ; and that many girls can name more wives and girlfriends of footballers than female politicians .
There is also a lighthearted group on Facebook called When I grow up I want to be a WAG , and an instructional book called WAG Do n't ­Wannabe : How to Date Footballers – and Survive !
But the living , breathing proof is the women in bars and clubs who try to pay bouncers to point out all the ­players .
A member of staff at Newz , a ­Liverpool bar that 's popular with many of the city 's highly paid footballers , says that " even when a reserve team player ­arrives , the girls go completely wild : they 're all over him .
It 's ridiculous .
You really have to see it to believe it . "
Of course Wags , the ­acronym used to describe the wives and girlfriends of footballers , is a sexist slap in the face ; an appellation that underlines their status as adjuncts to their ­husbands : accessories , appendages .
By the 21st century , we might have ­expected the idea of women being ­defined by their male partners to have died – along with the idea of marriage as a career path .
And yet , when it comes to the Wag obsession , we seem to have regressed many decades .
As the feminist writer Natasha Walter says , " There 's a really worrying hierarchy in the newspapers : that to be the wife is better than to be the girlfriend , and to be the wife of the more successful footballer is ­better than to be the wife of the less successful footballer .
It 's like an 18th - or early 19th - century idea of the woman being given value by her ­relationship with the man , and the more successful he is , the more ­valuable she is . "
When it comes to pinpointing the appeal of marrying a footballer , the short answer that 's always given , of course , is money .
This attraction flourished in 1992 with the birth of the Premier League , when footballers ' fees rose hugely .
And then there 's the status : traditionally , the wives and girlfriends of players have been fairly anonymous , but in 2006 , when the partners of the England team ­descended on Baden - Baden for the World Cup , the term Wag was embraced by the media with zeal ; coverage of their every move was extensive , and suddenly these women were stars .
Steven Gerrard 's partner , Alex Curran , brought out her own ­perfume and a weekly ­newspaper ­column ; Wayne Rooney 's partner , Coleen , ­published her autobiography and appeared in Vogue .
The scene in Baden - Baden – the sunbathing , shopping , drinking and dancing on tables – looked such a laugh that Alison Kervin , a sports writer , decided to begin a series of novels based on the Wags ( the next , due out in May , is Wags at the World Cup ) .
Their stories , she thought , represented a modern fairytale .
" If you 're a manicurist earning £ 15,000 a year , you could go into a nightclub and , in a Cinderella - style moment , meet your Prince Charming and your life would be changed for ever .
You'd have more money , every day , than you 'd have had in years .
You 'd have the castle on the hill .
You'd be a style icon . "
But when Kervin began her ­research , a different story emerged .
She spoke to a number of Wags , and says she " came away almost in tears , because I just felt desperately sorry for them . . .
Some of those I met found it very , very difficult living in somebody else 's shadow . "
One woman told Kervin that fans would open the door for her husband to walk through , then slam it in her face ; that taxi drivers would take her husband 's bags and leave her to struggle .
" All the normal rules of etiquette and behaviour are out of the window , because he 's famous and needs to be looked after , " Kervin explains .
" She was nothing .
She said she wanted to get a T - shirt printed with ' Do n't ask about my husband 's football ­career without saying " hello " ' because people were always charging up to her and saying , ' Where is he ?
What 's he doing ? ' "
Many aspects of Wags ' lives bring to mind a sort of 1950s womanhood : they seem to be expected to come when called and , equally , to stay away when they 're not wanted .
( There was the ­notorious Manchester United Christmas party in 2007 , when the Wags were apparently told to stay at home , 100 handpicked women were brought in to party with the players , and the night ended with a rape allegation that was later dropped . )
The women face isolation and upheaval , says Kervin , as their partners move from club to club and they either follow them , and lose established friendships , or stay put , and live apart from their partners .
Tappenden is well - versed in this problem – it's what she finds most stressful .
Her fiance , Walton , has moved clubs a lot recently , " and you do n't know whether you 're coming or going .
I could n't keep doing it , so now we 're living separate lives practically . "
Tappenden is in Epsom Downs , while Walton is in Crewe , " and I would n't wish that on anybody .
I find it really , really difficult . "
Jadene Bircham , the wife of former QPR player Marc Bircham , concurs : " It 's a long hard slog being married to a footballer , " she says .
" They 're out continuously .
Their job is their life .
It 's lonely : a lot of weddings , ­christenings , birthday parties are on ­Saturdays , so they can't go because they 're ­playing football . . .
That 's always their first priority . "
And alone in the house , the Wags face the fear that another woman may be targeting their husband , that he will be the next player to jump from newspapers ' back pages to the front .
Nicola Smith , who dated Teddy Sheringham for eight years , says the attention the players get is extraordinary ; that women " parade in front of the boys in bars , walk up and down five or six times , looking them in the eye , even when their girlfriends are sitting next to them . . .
I was actually attacked once by a girl who was doing that ; she tried to hit me , but Teddy and the bouncers got between us . "

She says : " I think football is a bit of a curse on a relationship . "

Tappenden completely trusts her current partner , but says that when Zamora 's team , West Ham , went up to the Premier League because of a goal he'd scored , " Something flicked in my brain .
He was the goldenballs and I just could n't cope with it .
I thought , ' Girls are going to throw themselves at him , ' and I became obsessed – a psycho girlfriend .
He did n't give me any reason not to trust him , but when he walked out of the room I 'd look at his phone , I 'd try to find out information about him .
I just got really insecure . "
Perhaps as a result of this paranoia , Wags are often enormously careful about their looks .
Bircham says that in the 12 years she 's been with her husband , she 's never seen a single ­" ungroomed footballer 's wife .
Not one .
All of them have always looked the ­picture of perfection . "
" They 're judged constantly on their looks , " Kervin agrees .
" There are worst - dressed Wag features in the papers ; there 's the fact that the young girls who are so predatory around these men tend to be exceptionally pretty 16 - year - olds .
And I also think there are more psychological issues at play .
The women I met did n't know when they were going to see their husbands , where they were going to be living next year , how much he was going to be earning .
And they also knew that if he has an injury , it 's all over .
They 're totally powerless .
I got the sense that some felt the only power they had was making themselves as perfect as they could ­humanly be – not even humanly , in fact ; they 'd have various operations .
If they were the image of perfection , and if the house was immaculate , then they 'd done all they could do . "
There is a particular Wag aesthetic that has developed , and Kervin says she has often pondered why this is .
" The Barbie doll look – where did that come from ?
You'd think they 'd need to assert their individuality , but they all look very similar .
Orange tan .
Very , very pretty .
Very , very thin .
And all wearing similar clothes . "
One answer seems to be that – ­consciously or not – the women know their role is to boost their partner 's masculinity .
The Wag style , with its manicured nails , high heels , huge false eyelashes and tiny dresses , is as feminised as it can possibly be – underlining these women 's status as possessions , part of the package for footballers .
Kervin once interviewed the England striker Peter Crouch ; and in reply to the question " If you had n't been a footballer , what would you have been ? " , he answered " a virgin " .
As well as showing an attractive self - deprecation , his quip underlines the fact that girls are ­considered one of the rewards of being a top sportsman .
When Walter was researching her new book Living Dolls : The Return of Sexism , she flicked through a lads ' magazine and there was " a Wags feature , where they had as many ­photographs of wives and girlfriends of footballers as they could find , either in glamour model poses – because a lot of them have done that kind of thing – or on the beach in bikinis .
All the focus was on their bodies , the size of their breasts .
It was like photographing a car or a house .
The message was that if you 're a successful sportsman , you get access to these kinds of objects .
I just thought that was horrible . "
So why , in the 21st century , when women 's options are supposedly as limitless and varied as they 've ever been , would anyone seek power , ­status or wealth through marriage ?
The answer , Walter suspects , is that the possibilities for working - class women are still highly constrained .
" They 're going into this world of glamour ­modelling ­because it 's the only route they can see to wealth and success , and the Wag culture is bound up with that .
No one looks at the fact that our society is n't giving the opportunities and aspirations to young women that it does to young men , and particularly to women with fewer options and less education . "
The options are limited for working - class men too , of course , but they do at least have some credible paths to ­extreme wealth , if that 's what they want .
They can go into the money markets : a highly male - dominated industry .
Or they can dream of being a footballer – at any one time there are around 4,000 professional footballers in England and Wales , ­although since the birth of the Premier League many more of them are from overseas .
Those that do succeed in our ­national game become local and potentially national icons – the 50ft banner for John Terry that appears at every Chelsea home game reads : " JT , ­captain , leader , legend . "
" They 're a hero , " says Walter , " whereas the women are ­despised .
They might get some kind of status , but they also get nasty , misogynistic press at the same time . "
The icons and images at the heart of a culture tell us an enormous amount about its values .
It 's interesting to note which images of women have multiplied over the last five years : an increasing sexualisation , and a media obsession with women in turmoil ( Britney Spears , Amy Winehouse , Anna Nicole Smith ) .
The Wags are a part of this wider culture .
It 's not their fault – very often , the couples are childhood sweethearts who would have stayed together had he been a plumber , a plasterer or a teacher .
It is the media that has chosen to describe them as Wags and define them by their marital status .
But the idea is thus reinforced that women can never be heroes in their own right .
If the obsession with Wags represents one thing , it 's surely a means of putting women firmly back in their place .
Still , at least many people do realise that being a Wag is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
I drop by an event in Liverpool , where women are being offered a free lip treatment , and watch as a young woman in tracksuit bottoms and false eyelashes has 10 injections in her top lip , the beautician wiping away pinpricks of blood as she goes .
The young woman is a cleaner who has come for the procedure with her mother .
After they 've both had it done , they speak to me through numb mouths , only their bottom lips moving .
" Would you like your daughter to be a Wag ? " I ask , and her mother shakes her head .
" They 're all cheats , are n't they , " says her daughter .
" Why would you want to go out with someone like that ? "
I move on to another woman who 's waiting for the injections .
" Do you know anyone who wants to be a Wag ? " I ask .
" Oh no , not at all , " she says , and I smile widely .
Not for long .
" All the women I know want to be like Jordan . "
• Do you think the media are too hard on Wags ?

No matter what , at this moment all the Israeli legal community knows that someone , somewhere in the internet , called Rami Mor a quack .
1 .
The supreme court ’s decision in RCA 4447/07 Rami Mor v. Barak was quite a surprise .
Rami
Mor an alternative medicine practitioner , was enraged that someone , somewhere in the internet , slandered him .
Mor filed two different motions , the first against 013 - Barak , ( OCR 1238/07 Rami Mor v. Barak ) and another one against Bezeq International ( OCR 1752/06 Rami Mor v. Bezeq Int ) to reveal the identity of anonymous posters .
After the motions were dismissed , Mor petitioned to the Haifa District Court , where judge Yitzhak Amit ruled ( RPA 850/06 Rami Mor v. Yedioth Internet ) that the veil of anonymity shall only be removed where a cause of action against the anonymous commenter exists and where the anonymity was used in order to avoid liability ; moreover , the court explained that “ an additional mean is required ” in order to accept the petition .
Mor , who did not accept the ruling , appealed again to the supreme court .
This week , in a precedent decision , the Israeli supreme court ruled that the veil of anonymity is , sometimes , a constitutional right , and that currently Israel has no procedure to unmask commenters who post anonymously as there is no legislation .
2 .
Hon. Justice Eliezer Rivlin dismissed Mor ’s petition and analysed the procedure to reveal anonymous posters .
According to his ruling “ it is an attempt to harness , prior to a legal proceeding , the justice system and a third party in order to conduct an inquiry which will lead to the revealing of a person committing a tort so that a civil suit could be filed against him .
It is , de facto , an investigative - like procedure that the court is drafted to in a preliminary procedure in this way or another .
This procedure is not trivial , it involves policy consideration and requires legislative regulation “ .
His decision rules , actually , that until a procedure will be legislated , petitions to reveal anonymous users may not be granted ( and according to estimations , there is at least one daily request per ISP ) .
3 .
Justice Rivlin alson rules out the availability of an Israeli John Doe process as it contradicts due process .
“ It is , in fact , a judicial change of the civil procedure rules by adding a new chapter titled ‘ John Doe Lawsuits ’ , if such update is needed , it should be done by legislation “ .
This is a substantial ruling as it has implications on standing cases where John Does are presenting their case to avoid being revealed ( see , for example , OCR 567/08 א 4854/07 Barlomenfeld v. Google Inc ) .
But it mostly have meaning in another pending case , the appeal on OCR 11646/08 Premier League v. Doe ( which the supreme court is hearing under CA 9183/09 Premier League v. Doe ) ( English summary of the case ) .
The Premier League ’s request was to reveal an anonymous website operator who posted links to video streams of sport events .
But does the Rami Mor decision say anything else ?
4 . The supreme court ruled that :
Shattering the ‘ illusion of anonymity ’ , in a reality where a user ’s privacy feeling is a myth , may raise associations of a “ big brother ” .
Such violation of privacy should be minimized .
In adequate boundaries the anonymity shelters should be preserved as a part of the Internet Culture .
You may say that anonymity makes the internet what it is , and without it the virtual freedom may be reduced .
Actually , at this moment there are dozens of requests to unmask anonymous users that following the Mor decision may be dismissed ; apart from that , several lawsuits are based on evidence that was obtained in such manner ( or not in such manner , decent disclosure etc ) and may be dismissed as the evidence was obtained by violation of privacy ( see HCJ 6650 / 04 Doe v. The Rabbinical Court of Netanya ) .
In fact , the supreme court took five years of case law , and ruled that it is based on a legal mistake .
No more cases which need to choose between Judge Amit ’s approach to the method construed by Judge Michal Agmon - Gonen in PP 541/07 Jacob Sabo v. Yedioth Internet and the interpretation of Judge Drora Pilpel in PP ( Tel - Aviv ) 250/08 Brokertov v. Google , but a ruled precedent by the supreme court .
5 .
The real meaning is that now a hasty legislator needs to start drafting an adequate procedure , where the Knesset may ask if there is room for a John Doe process in Israel or not .

US airline Continental and two of its employees go on trial this week for the manslaughter of 113 people who died in a Concorde crash that put an end to the dream of supersonic travel .
US airline Continental and two of its employees go on trial this week for the manslaughter of 113 people who died in a Concorde crash that put an end to the dream of supersonic travel .
A former French civil aviation official and two senior members of the Concorde program will be tried on the same charge from Tuesday in a court near Paris , with proceedings expected to last four months .
The New York - bound jet crashed in a ball of fire shortly after take - off from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on July 25 , 2000 , killing all 109 people on board - most of them Germans - and four hotel workers on the ground .
The blazing Concorde demolished an airport hotel when it hurtled to the ground in a crash that marked the beginning of the end for the world 's first -- and thus far only -- regular supersonic jet service .
Air France and British Airways grounded their Concordes for 15 months after the crash and , after a brief resumption , finally put an end to supersonic commercial service in 2003 .
The plane , born of British and French collaboration , embarked on its maiden commercial flight in 1976 .
Only 20 were manufactured : six were used for development and the remaining 14 flew mainly trans -Atlantic routes at speeds of up to 2170 km /h .
A French accident inquiry concluded in December 2004 that the Paris disaster was partly caused by a strip of metal that fell on the runway from a Continental Airlines DC - 10 plane that took off just before the supersonic jet .
The Concorde , most of whose German passengers were due to board a Caribbean cruise ship in New York , ran over the super - hard titanium strip , which shredded one of its tyres , causing a blow - out and sending debris flying into an engine and a fuel tank .
Continental is charged over a failure to properly maintain its aircraft , along with two US employees : John Taylor , a mechanic who allegedly fitted the non-standard strip , and airline chief of maintenance Stanley Ford .
An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Taylor after he failed to show up to be questioned by investigators here , and , according to his lawyer , he will not be attending the trial in the court in Pontoise , northwest of Paris .
Mr Taylor 's lawyer declined to say if his client would show up in court .
The former Concorde officials and French aviation boss are also accused of failing to detect and set right faults on the supersonic aircraft , brought to light during the investigation and thought to have contributed to the crash .
Henri Perrier was director of the first Concorde program at Aerospatiale , now part of the EADS group , from 1978 to 1994 , while Jacques Herubel was Concorde 's chief engineer from 1993 to 1995 .
Both men are accused of ignoring warning signs from a string of incidents on Concorde planes , which during their 27 years of service suffered dozens of tyre blowouts or wheel damage that in several cases pierced the fuel tanks .
Finally Claude Frantzen , director of technical services at the French civil aviation authority DGAC from 1970 to 1994 , is accused of overlooking a fault on Concorde 's distinctive delta - shaped wings , which held its fuel tanks .
The trial will seek to pin down the share of responsibility of the US airline , the Concorde and French aviation officials .
Most of the victims ' families agreed not to take legal action in exchange for compensation from Air France , EADS , Continental and the Goodyear tyre manufacturer .
The amount they received has not been made public , but reports said that around $ US100 million ( $ A111.78 million ) was shared out among some 700 relatives of the dead .
Throughout the eight - year investigation , Continental pledged to fight any charges in the case .

Last month the worldwide effort to thwart the illegal copying and sales of video games took a turn to the draconian , with a number of publishers introducing new measures that often seemed to impact legitimate gamers as much as pirates .

France - based Ubisoft rolled out a new form of digital rights management that require players of their PC games to stay online at all times to play .
Japan - based
Sony tested out a new system that would require people purchasing one of their Playstation Portable games used to pay an extra $ 20 to play online .
And Nintendo , taking a page from the music industry , levied a $ 1.5 million dollar suit against an Australian for copying their games .
But the companies involved all say the timing was coincidental and that these efforts are just their latest attempts to stop a practice that is hurting everyone from legitimate gamers to developers and publishers .

" Nintendo has been battling piracy in all its forms around the world for more than 20 years , " said Jodi Daugherty , Nintendo of America 's senior director of anti-piracy .
" We have anti-piracy programs in more than 40 countries and we take a multifaceted approach to combat it , combining legal enforcement , consumer education , technology innovation and lobbying .
I think a number of high - profile enforcement cases recently might have made it seem like there has been a surge , but Nintendo has always been aggressive in fighting piracy . "
But what is becoming Nintendo's most notorious anti-piracy effort is the case against Queenslander James Burt .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Burt , 24 , is the first Australian individual to be sued in the country 's federal court for game piracy .
Burt uploaded a copy of Super Mario Bros. to the Internet and the game was later downloaded more than 50,000 times .

In early February , the federal court ordered Burt to pay Nintendo $ 1.5 million .
Daugherty told Kotaku that Nintendo later reached a settlement agreement that has Burt paying a " significant lesser amount . "
She declined to say how much that amount is .
" It is not Nintendo 's policy to go after individuals ; however , this was not a situation of merely an individual gamer , " Daugherty said of the agreement .
" Mr. Burt actually was a distributor of illegal software and boasted about being the first to upload New Super Mario Bros .
Wii ahead of the global launch date . "

Ubisoft 's latest anti-piracy efforts hope to prevent that sort of thing .
In January , the company announced they would be ditching an unpopular third - party digital rights management system for one created in - house .
The new system , they said , would require gamers of their PC titles to be online to play the game .
Advertisement
While they are n't the only ones to experiment with this form of copy protection , the implementation became a problem for gamers with spotty Internet connections .
Apparently , if a gamer loses a connection to the Internet while playing on their own , the player is immediately kicked from the game , losing all of their progress .

Ubisoft declined to comment on the loud and seemingly legitimate backlash this decision has spurred .
The third big effort to combat piracy that hit in February came in a surprise move from Sony with the launch of their Playstation Portable shooter SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3 .

The game , which includes a popular online element , comes with a printed voucher code that allows a person to create an account and play the game online .
But it only comes with one of these " online entitlement vouchers " , so if the game is purchased used , borrowed , rented or the code is lost , or if the game is pirated , a player will have to pay an additional $ 20 to get a second code .

John Koller , Director of Hardware Marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment of America , said the company decided to test out this new anti-piracy system because of the significant impact piracy has had on the Playstation Portable .
" There 's no doubt that piracy has had a negative impact on PSP software sales , " he told Kotaku " It 's an issue that affects everyone , from the smallest developer to the largest publisher , and unfortunately impacts honest consumers as well – as it can limit the creative software launches that we 've come to expect on the platform .
Today 's consumers are more tech savvy and better connected to the internet than ever before .
While the launch of ( download only ) PSPgo was a significant step towards the fight against piracy , we 're continuing to take aggressive steps to address the issue and minimize its impact on the PSP . "
Advertisement
He said that Sony decided to test the system now because the company knew it would have a " clear impact " on SOCOM , which has such a strong online community .
" We 're committed to doing everything in our power to protect the PSP platform and our publishing partner 's IPs , " he said .
" This new initiative is a significant step forward in the fight against piracy and will help ensure that SCEA continues to deliver innovative , cutting - edge software titles to consumers . "
Advertisement
The system also could have a significant impact on the used sales of the game , something most game publishers are n't very supportive of because they do n't get a portion of those sales .
But Koller said any impact on used game sales was not deliberate and that the program was " designed strictly with piracy in mind . "
He added that retailers like GameStop " understand the need to combat piracy , as their revenues are affected as well . "
Advertisement
And it 's possible the Online Entitlement System will get more use .
" We are currently exploring the possibilities of including this new feature with additional PSP titles moving forward , but we have no announcements to make on it at this time , " Koller said .
He did n't say whether the system could one day come to the Playstation 3 as well .

People have been copying and stealing creative works almost as long as they have been mass produced .
In fact the use of the word pirate to describe someone who copies someone else 's work dates back to the 1700s when Daniel Defoe agonized over hand - written , pirated copies of his poems sold on the streets .
But in creating new ways to fight piracy , developers and publishers should n't , can't ignore the impact those new efforts have on legitimate gamers .
Advertisement
In talking with Sony , Nintendo and Microsoft , all three acknowledged the importance of not trampling the rights of legitimate gamers in their pursuit of pirates .
But some of these new measures seem to do just that .
While the Online Entitlement Voucher system will certainly cut down on people playing the game online illegally , it also makes renting the game seemingly impossible and hikes the true cost of buying it used at GameStop to nearly ten dollars more than the new price .
And if it is n't adjusted , Ubisoft 's system could also make pirates out of people who would normally never consider the prospect .

The fight against piracy may be a war , as the video game industry so often calls it , but that should n't make all gamers the enemy .

MARCH 15 -- Meet Michael Murphy .
The Montana inmate is not letting a 25 - year prison sentence interfere with his love life , according to state correction officials .
An investigation has determined that Murphy , 36 , convinced at least five female prison employees to have sex with him , provide contraband , or grant him illegal favors .
A Montana Department of Corrections investigative report , first obtained by the Associated Press , details Murphy 's manipulating ways and the sway he held over several guards and a clinical therapist .
The corrections probe targeted prison employees , not Murphy , since Montana law states that inmates , like minors , cannot legally consent to sexual activity .
Murphy , whose rap sheet includes theft , forgery , burglary , and criminal endangerment collars , is pictured in the mug shot at left .
According to investigative reports , which we 've excerpted here , Murphy targeted certain women in a charm offensive whose goal was securing sex or favors .
Therapist Killian Thomas told investigators that Murphy ' kissed me one day in my office and I just thought what the fuck did I just do . '
She then told of engaging in mutual oral sex with Murphy in her office , and giving him about $ 400 .
' I could n't say no to him , ' said Thomas .
' I could n't get myself out of it . '
Guard Lisa Mantz , who told of ' swapping spit ' with ' Murph , ' admitted writing the convict a letter in which she said that ' I could n't wait to screw him , fuck him , ride his dick .
Shannon Davies , a guard who resigned her job during the corrections probe , copped to developing a ' limited emotional attachment ' to Murphy , to whom she sent a greeting card with the notation , ' I 'm in love with you . '
Murphy is being held at the Dawson County Correctional Facility in Glendive , about 20 miles from the North Dakota border .

Arp 220 is a nearby example of a merged starburst galaxy similar to SMM J2135 -0102 .
Located 250 million light - years from Earth , Arp 220 is the aftermath of a collision between two spiral galaxies .
The collision , which began about 700 million years ago , has sparked a crackling burst of star formation , resulting in about 200 huge star clusters in a packed , dusty region about 5,000 light - years across ( about 5 percent of the Milky Way 's diameter ) .
The star clusters are the bluish - white bright knots visible in the Hubble image .
Years of research into Saturn 's rings , plus new information from the Cassini spacecraft in orbit around the ringed gas giant , have resulted in a comprehensive new study of the planet .
These images are among the most stunning from that study .
Science magazine published two studies on Saturn today , which bring together past research with contemporary discoveries .
One focuses on the rings , the other on Saturn 's atmosphere .
According to a release from AAAS :
Jeffrey Cuzzi and colleagues put a spotlight on the ring system surrounding Saturn , made mostly of water ice , and detail its many layers .
Based on Cassini 's near - infrared observations , the researchers suggest that the mysterious reddish coloration , which contaminates portions of the ring system , could be caused by small clusters of carbon rings or by negatively charged iron compounds .
They also detail the dynamic , constantly changing nature of the rings ' features , and note that the vigorous evolutionary processes altering their structure occur on extremely short timescales of years , months , or even days .
Cuzzi and the researchers say that many of the processes affecting Saturn 's rings can also be observed in protoplanetary disks - the precursors to new planets .

In addition :
Tamas Gombosi and Andrew Ingersoll reveal new and unique details about the planet 's atmosphere , ionosphere , and magnetosphere .
Using the tools on - board Cassini , these researchers analyzed the wind speeds and jet streams influencing Saturn 's atmosphere and listened in on lightning storms rocking the face of the planet .
They describe Saturn 's magnetosphere , which forms around planets when solar winds interact with a planet 's magnetic field , as a distinctive hybrid between Jupiter 's and Earth's , unlike any other planets ' in the solar system .

These images are true color , except the black - and - white one and the one with the bluish ring , which is enhanced .
You can see the reddish tinge in some of the rings .

" We need to stand up to the special interests , bring Republicans and Democrats together , and pass the farm bill immediately , " Barack Obama declared last November .
It was a weird thing to say , since the farm bill , which subsidizes an arbitrarily chosen section of the economy at the expense of taxpayers and consumers in general , is special - interest legislation by definition .
The latest version , which President Bush has promised to veto , includes tax breaks for racehorse owners , " marketing aid " for fruit and vegetable growers , research funding for organic farmers , enhanced price supports for domestic sugar producers , increased subsidies for dairy farmers , a $ 170 million earmark for the salmon industry , and billions of dollars in automatic payments and " permanent disaster assistance " for corn , wheat , cotton , rice , and soybean growers .
Take that , special interests !
Less than a month ago , the Associated Press reported that " it 's not a good year for a farm bill , " what with surging food prices , record farm income , a tight federal budget , and a resistant president unconcerned about getting re-elected .
But in the logrolling culture of Washington , the solution to wasteful , unjustified spending is more wasteful , unjustified spending .
" This is truly bipartisan legislation , " says Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R - Va. ) , the senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee .
" There was give - and - take on all sides . "
Mostly take .
In response to fruit and vegetable farmers who have long complained about payments for other crops , the five - year , $ 300 billion bill expands existing subsidies while paying off the produce growers .
In response to food price inflation , the bill continues the price supports and ethanol subsidies that contribute to it while boosting spending on food stamps .
It even manages to combine two kinds of farm folly in one program , requiring the government to protect domestic sugar producers by buying imported sugar and selling it at a loss to ethanol refiners .
The bill 's supporters are bragging about a new rule that would bar payments to individual farmers earning more than $ 750,000 a year and couples earning more than $ 1.5 million .
That modest change is expected to affect about 2,000 subsidy recipients , less than 1 percent of the total .
But it highlights the extent to which agricultural subsidies are a welfare program for rich people .
Last summer Obama 's presidential campaign boasted that the Illinois senator " expressed his support " for " reducing the number of multimillionaires who are eligible for farm bill subsidies . "
While that sounds better than Hillary Clinton 's wholehearted endorsement of the farm bill , which the New York senator says will " help revitalize rural America " and " provide a safety net for our family farms , " it 's a pretty sad state of affairs when self - styled reformers aspire merely to reduce taxpayer - funded payments to multimillionaires .
Not all farmers are rich , but as a group they are better off than the people footing the bill for their subsidies , with a median income of $ 55,000 in 2006 , compared to the national median of $ 48,000 , and median wealth about five times the national median .
Heritage Foundation analyst Brian Riedl notes that most subsidies " go to large commercial farms , which report an average income of $ 200,000 and a net worth of nearly $ 2 million . "
Riedl estimates that farm subsidies cost Americans $ 25 billion a year in taxes and another $ 12 billion in higher food prices .
According to a Cato Institute study , the opportunity cost of agricultural support during the last two decades ( i.e. , the amount we'd have if the money had been invested instead of squandered ) is more than $ 1.7 trillion .
John McCain is the only one of the three remaining major - party presidential candidates who takes a stand against this regressive , market - distorting , trade - disrupting scam .
The Arizona senator , who has long opposed agricultural subsidies , recently told voters ( in Iowa , no less ) that if he were president he'd veto the farm bill because " the subsidies are unnecessary . "
By and large , though , Obama is right that farm subsidies " bring Republicans and Democrats together . "
It 's the sort of unity that causes one to lose hope .

WASHINGTON — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , under extraordinary pressure from the Obama administration to curb the construction of Jewish housing in Jerusalem , served notice on Monday that his government would not yield easily to American demands .
In a speech to a pro-Israel lobbying group , Mr. Netanyahu reiterated that Israel had no plans to freeze housing in Jerusalem , the trigger for a recent dispute between Israel and the United States .
He rejected the administration ’s contention that Israel ’s policies were impeding the peace process .
“ The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years , and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today , ” Mr. Netanyahu said to the group , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
“ Jerusalem is not a settlement ;
It ’s our capital . ”
Earlier Monday , Mr. Netanyahu met for 75 minutes with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , in the first of a series of meetings expected to reveal whether the United States sticks to its hard line with Israel on settlements .
He later met with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , and he was scheduled to meet President Obama on Tuesday .
An 11 - year - old girl gave birth to a baby boy somewhere in the Northeast , the girl ’s family reported to Fox News .
Details about the family and their location were withheld due to the girl ’s shockingly young age , but the girl ’s mother made a creepily blase statement about her daughter ’s ordeal :
“ My daughter and ( her ) baby are fine , and the baby is absolutely beautiful , ” said the mother of the 11 - year - old girl .
The unnamed girl is n’t the only one in the news for having a child while still a child this week - a nine - year - old Chinese girl delivered a baby by c-section this week in Changchun .
Pregnancy at such a young age is extremely risky , and children of that age are rarely at a proper developmental stage to physically handle the condition without complications .
A national expert on high risk pregnancy , Abdullah Al - Khan , spoke to Fox about the risks to which the girl was exposed :

She raised her son to be sensitive , to be Catholic , to be her friend .
When he was 18 , he joined the Mormon Church .
She fought it .
He fought back .
They worked to stay close anyway .
There were years of long talks on the phone : sometimes awkward , sometimes just like before .
He went on a church mission .
He went to college .
She went on working , coordinating weddings .
Last fall , another blow :
He was in love , getting married - in the Mormon temple - and she could n't come .
It hurt them both , but the mother more deeply than the son .
She knew all of it , already .
When her son told her he was converting , Cheri Richardson studied his church .
She knew that temples are the Mormon religion 's most sacred places and only Mormons who obey the church 's teachings are allowed within .
She knew that her son , Chase Richardson , held temple marriage among his most important goals : Mormons believe a temple wedding seals a marriage for eternity , to last even after death .
It is a treasured cornerstone of the faith .
It would be a sacrifice for Chase to ask his family to stay away , to leave his father , sister and grandparents out .
His mother knew he'd do it anyway .
" His response is that God comes before all of that , " says Cheri , 52 , " and that 's what I taught him , too . "
The irony stung :
As a wedding coordinator , Cheri had been to hundreds of ceremonies , but she would miss her son's .
Still , she knew that he would need her .
Chase was 22 , marrying young , as many Mormons do .
She had always been his confidante , his coach , his comfort .
He 'd need help proposing , paying for a honeymoon , picking out a tuxedo .
And on his wedding day , Cheri knew Chase would want her to be outside the temple , waiting .
He would come out after the ceremony and look for his mother 's smile - a silent assurance that everything was OK .
That , Cheri knew , was something she could n't do .
Because somewhere on the other side of the temple 's concrete facade , there would be a moment when her son faced his bride and promised to love her .
Cheri longed to see it , to memorize his face .
She could n't stand and wait outside a place that promised eternal families , but stood between her and her child .
Her God would never ask this of a mother , Cheri says , " or a son . "
Baptized by ire
Before they moved to Arizona , the Richardsons knew little about the Mormon religion , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
" Salt Lake , Donny Osmond - that 's all I knew , " Cheri says .
Cheri and her husband , Steve , raised their two children in Peoria , Ill. , and sent them to Catholic school , though Steve is Methodist .
Steve 's job moved the family to Scottsdale during Chase 's junior year .
He enrolled in public high school and met a girl , a Mormon .
Chase , a quiet type who likes music and his guitar , asked his girlfriend about her faith .
" It really intrigued me , " he says .
He considered Catholicism to be a culture , a habit .
" I went through the motions , " he says , " but I did n't believe . "
His girlfriend referred his questions to Mormon missionaries , and Chase met them weekly at her house to talk about their church .
" I felt a calmness , a peace , " Chase says .
" These words were comforting to me . . . that I am already saved , in a way , and I could be saved if I followed him .
I felt a new hope I had n't felt in a while . "
He did not , however , feel hopeful in regard to sharing this news with his parents .
Chase says he told his mom he was learning about Mormonism .
Cheri says she was n't aware of it until " he came home one day and said , ' I want to be baptized . ' "
She balked .
He 'd been baptized .
She had pictures .
She told him she 'd need to talk to his father .
She told Chase to slow down and give her time to learn about this new church , too .
The rules
Cheri found out as soon as she began her research .
She Googled her way into an online support group called " Mormons have my child " and learned that if her son converted , a likely path would follow :
He would leave college at 19 to serve a two - year proselytizing mission .
He would look for someone to marry soon after he returned .
The wedding would take place in a temple , and as non-members , Cheri , Steve and Chase 's older sister , Danielle , 25 , could not attend .
Cheri learned that U.S. couples are discouraged from having a civil ceremony before a temple wedding , even if only to include their families : Couples who do so must wait a year before being allowed to " seal " their marriage for eternity in a temple .
But in countries like England , France , Japan and Mexico , where Mormonism is not recognized as a legal marriage authority , a civil ceremony is allowed the same day .
" Temple worship is the highest form of religious expression for Latter - day Saints , " says Kim Farah , a church spokeswoman .
" In these sacred structures , members of the church make formal commitments to God . . . including the marriage of couples for eternity .
" No other type of wedding can take its place as one of the crowning sacraments of the faith . "
Cheri learned about the interview required of church members before temple admittance : questions about chastity , honesty and whether they were paying 10 percent of their income to the church .
Each member must be found " worthy , " church language says , of the temple .
Cheri learned that non-adult siblings are n't allowed at temple weddings , either .
Online , she read accounts from parents across the country .
It happened often : non-Mormons turned away from temple weddings , and also Mormon parents who had violated church standards .
" It is easy to understand how feelings of exclusion can develop , but exclusion is never intended , " says Farah , the church spokeswoman , citing the Mormons ' " deep concern for those of other faiths who cannot attend the temple marriage of a loved one . "
The church allows a family gathering , often called a " ring ceremony , " to be held before or after a temple wedding .
Rings are not a part of a temple wedding and can be exchanged informally inside or outside a temple , Farah says , as long as vows are not exchanged , also .
Cheri read enough about ring ceremonies to know the moment would feel forced and empty .
" I was livid , dumbfounded , " Cheri says .
Her son would n't want a wedding without his family .
" I thought , ' This is going to be the " aha " moment , the thing I can tell Chase that will make him see . ' "
The day she confronted him , Cheri remembers , her voice breaking , " he looked at me and said , ' I know , and that 's OK with me . ' "
Scriptures and video games
Chase was 17 .
Cheri repeated it to herself to salve her feelings .
" What does he know about parents wanting to be at a wedding ? " she thought .
Chase needed his parents ' permission to be baptized .
They declined .
Faced with his mother 's scorn , Chase felt embarrassed of his faith .
" I had a feeling that she would n't believe like I had believed , " Chase says .
" She thought of it as a phase - something I 'd get over , like a video game . "
He worked to strengthen his testimony so he could combat his mother 's objections .
He found a scripture in the Bible - " Hey , you believe this , too , " Chase told her - that he felt supported his plight .
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me .
Matthew 10:37 .
Chase had it memorized .
Cheri did n't think the scripture applied to weddings .
" I do n't believe that God is in support of separating families , " she maintained .
On weekends , working the weddings she 'd been hired to coordinate , Cheri liked to watch the groom 's face as his bride walked down the aisle .
This moment , she thought , this expression - awe and nerves , weightiness and love :
This was what she would miss if Chase was married in a temple .
Sometimes , during the processional , Cheri would tap the groom 's mother and tell her to look back at her son .
A mother should n't miss this , Cheri thought .
" It has n't happened yet , " she told herself .
" It 's not here yet .
There 's always a chance . "
Chase turned 18 .
He was baptized into the Mormon Church .
He went to the University of Arizona , turned 19 , and left for a church mission to Mexico City .
His mother e-mailed him every week : missives to challenge his faith , at first , and then mostly reminders that she loved him .
Chase wrote that he loved her , too .
He missed her cooking , her listening ear .
" I think about you every day , " he said .
While he was gone , Chase 's high - school girlfriend married someone else .
While he was gone , Cheri's Internet research turned up the Temple Wedding Petition , started in 2007 by former Mormons .
The petition asks church leaders to be more inclusive of families by allowing civil ceremonies before all temple weddings , on the same day , and not only in countries where required by law .
The petitioners have collected more than 250 signatures , says co-founder Jean Brodie , 66 , of Edmonton , Canada , and half are from faithful Mormons .
Cheri signed the petition .
After two years in Mexico , Chase came home in October 2008 .
He went back to school , got a job as a valet .
In May , at church , he met Annie .
The bride
At first , Chase loved Annie Fuge because she was pretty .
Then he loved her because she seemed to love him back .
In the end , he loved her because she reminded him of someone he'd loved for years .
" She 's everything that my mom is , really , " says Chase - driven , smart , sociable and sassy .
Cheri liked Annie , too : " the strength of her handshake , the way she looked me right in the eye . "
Chase proposed in November and was talking about a March wedding .
Annie was 20 , and Chase 22 .
Cheri and Steve thought they were too young to be married .
Chase was still in school .
So was Annie .
How would they afford rent ?
And then there was the location of the wedding ceremony itself , an unspoken pall hanging over all of them .
Cheri knew .
Chase knew she knew .
No one told her .
Cheri read about it on Annie 's Facebook page : Chase and Annie would be married on March 12 , 2010 , in the Mesa temple .
Beneath Annie 's announcement , a few friends from church had already responded with excitement : " We 'll be there ! "
Cheri did n't know them .
They 'd be at her son 's wedding .
She would n't .
Cheri hoped Chase and Annie would consider a civil ceremony .
She called her son , shouting into his voice mail through her tears .
" You have no idea what you 've done to me , " she cried .
Still , she was n't really angry at Chase , though she wished he had delivered the news himself .
" What is hurtful to me is that because of his beliefs , it feels like we 're being forced out , " Cheri says , " and the reason we can't be there is probably the most hurtful - that we 're deemed ' unworthy ' " by the church to enter the temple .
" You 're there for 3 a .m. feedings .
You 're there at every single game and headache and shot and broken bone and parent - teacher conference .
You hug him when he's got his heart broken for not making the basketball team , and to be told you 're not worthy to be there on his most important day ?
" He believes , " Cheri says , " in a different God than we do . "
That night , Chase came home to find his mother .
They sat on barstools in the kitchen and cried together .
Cheri told him about that moment ��� she loves at weddings , watching the face of the groom , and how she 'd miss having that memory of her son .
Chase said he was sorry .
Of course he wanted her to be at his wedding .
" I wish I could make everyone happy , but I can 't , " he told his mother .
" I love the Lord .
It 's a commandment , and I try my best to put him above everything .
" I 've had to , and it has been hard . "
But also , Chase explained , he had to honor his love for Annie .
This was her day .
" She has always wanted to get married in the temple , " Chase said , " and not only sealed in the temple , but married , and that 's what 's really important . "
His mother knew he was right .
Mercy
The velocity of the wedding took hold .
On the hardest days , Cheri clung to advice from her daughter , Danielle .
" Focus on the bond you and Chase have had for 22 years , " Danielle had said .
" The church is not going to take that away from you unless you let it . "
Cheri promised herself not to .
Steve and Cheri met Annie 's parents for dinner , lunch .
At one meeting with Cheri after an emotional week , Kent and Susan Fuge delivered a shock :
They had decided to spend Chase and Annie 's wedding with Cheri and Steve , waiting outside the temple .
They were Mormon and could attend , but would n't .
" We wanted to do whatever we could to help , " says Kent , 48 , of Phoenix .
" We wanted to support them , and help them understand that it was a concern for us , what they were going through .
" Also , we wanted to help them understand that from our perspective , the really important part was that ( Chase and Annie ) were getting sealed in the temple , and that was more important , even , than Susan and I getting to see the actual ceremony . "
Cheri was stunned by their mercy and integrity , but she insisted they attend .
Their absence would n't make her feel better , but worse .
It " felt like two wrongs , " Cheri said , and she had decided against waiting outside the temple .
It would feel as if the church had won , as if she were following its rules .
From January to March , Cheri steel - jawed her way through conversations about registries , bridesmaids , invitations .
She went to Annie 's bridal showers , wrote down Chase 's favorite recipes , did the calligraphy on place cards for the post - ceremony lunch she and Steve were hosting - the Mormon equivalent of a rehearsal dinner .
She ordered a dress for the reception - a party at a friend 's house the day after the wedding .
On the weekends , she worked other weddings , always watching the groom .
With a week left to go , Cheri invited Annie and Chase over for pasta .
During dinner , Cheri teased Chase for acting lovesick , his fingers in Annie 's hair .
" Chase Alan , " Cheri said , " Can you possibly keep your hands off of her ? "
Annie made everyone promise to cross their fingers it would n't rain .
Steve joked that he might bring his own alcohol to the reception .
Annie followed Cheri to the back of the house to go through old photos of Chase for the wedding slide show .
Cheri showed Annie her favorite , a black - and - white portrait .
Chase was 16 , smiling in a way that made his eyes look exactly like his mother's .
He looked so happy .
Cheri sighed .
" I love that face , " she said .
Vows
The rain stopped the day of Chase and Annie 's wedding .
Orange and pink poppies bloomed around the Mesa temple .
Chase and Annie arrived late , and still , he 'd forgotten his tuxedo .
He called his mom and caught her and his dad on their way out the door .
They were coming to the temple , to wait outside for their son .
The day before , on the phone , Cheri had heard something in Chase 's voice .
Loneliness , she thought .
" My heart was breaking for him , " Cheri says .
" Before he could even ask , I said , ' Please .
Please , Chase .
Do n't ask me .
Please .
You know I can 't . '
" He said , ' I understand , Mom , I really do , but do you think Danielle will come ? ' "
Cheri hung up , sobbing .
Chase called his sister , in tears .
" I know Mom and Dad want to be there , and I feel horrible that they can't , " he told Danielle .
" If they could just come , if they could just wait outside . "
After they hung up , Chase sought the comfort of Annie .
She realized , suddenly , how hard it all was - fighting his parents , committing to his beliefs , and doing it alone .
She had grown up in the church .
" I felt a little selfish - guilty , maybe , that I had all of that so easily , " Annie said .
" He does n't get to have them there , just as much as they do n't get to be there .
" I admired his certainty . "
Cheri and Danielle ran last - minute errands .
In the middle of Target , Cheri had a breakdown .
" I have to go , " she told her daughter .
" It 's the right thing to do . "
Danielle echoed her mother .
" You have to go , " she said .
Later , at home , Cheri thought about the wedding moment she had wanted for Chase , but also about the moment he would have - walking out of the temple holding Annie 's hand , looking for his mom .
" He 's still our son , " Cheri told Steve that night .
" He should have somebody there to share that moment , and we can't get it back .
It would be humiliating , she knew , " to stand outside that place , knowing what 's going on , knowing we 're not allowed in , and who 's judging .
" Putting aside the emotional part , " she said , " it is absolutely absurd . "
It would feel as if the church had won , Cheri said , had kept her from her son's wedding by leaning on a God she could n't believe required it .
" It 's the principle versus love , " Cheri told her husband , " but love should outweigh the principle every time . "
The next morning , when Chase walked out of the temple after his wedding , Cheri stood to one side , watching the groom 's smile .
It never faded .
She waited , wringing her hands , twiddling a silver cross she wore on her wrist , until he saw her .
" Mom , " he said .
" Come , stand right here . "
Cheri climbed the temple steps toward him , and he reached his arms out for a hug .
She cried into his jacket and held onto him as long as he let her .
There was no space between them .
" Thank you , " he whispered .
" I could n't not be here , " Cheri told him .
" I could n't not come . "
They turned to face the camera for a picture , the temple wall behind them .
Chase smiled , his arms around Annie .
His mother stood awkwardly at his side , her expression changing as she took in the moment .
It was on her face that onlookers could see everything : nerves - worry - anger - pain - relief , but also joy .
In today ’s Programming Praxis exercise we have to implement a run length encoding algorithm .
The provided Scheme solution weighs in at 27 lines .
Let ’s see if we can do any better in Haskell .
First , two imports .
import Data .
List import Data .
List .
Split
Compressing is easy : use group and chunk to separate the string into runs of the appropriate length and then apply tilde encoding as necessary .
compress :: String ->
String compress s = f =<< chunk 26 =<< group s where f xs = if length xs < 4 && take 1 xs /= " ~ " then xs else ' ~ ' : toEnum ( length xs + 64 ) : take 1 xs
Expanding is easier still and can be done entirely through pattern matching .
expand :: String -> String expand [ ] = [ ] expand (' ~ ' : r : c : xs ) = replicate ( fromEnum r - 64 ) c ++ expand xs expand ( c : xs ) = c : expand xs
And of course we have to test if everything works correctly .
main :: IO ( ) main = do print $ compress org == rle print $ expand rle == org where org = " ABBB~CDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
" rle = " ABBB~A~C~ED~ZE~DE "
Everything seems to be working and at 6 lines that ’s 4,5 times shorter than the Scheme solution .
Not bad .

So I am a visual effects ( VFX ) artist , putting fake things into movies with computers ( often referred to as CG effects ) .
You think you know me ?
You do n't know me !
You know that CG makes things like Gollum and dinosaurs and pretty much everything in Avatar , but most of the CG you 've seen in your life , you did n't know was CG at all .
For instance , did you know that there was only one real helicopter in Black Hawk Down ?
Or that most movie sports stadiums are filmed completely empty , or that no buildings were harmed in the filming of the Bourne trilogy ?
If not , then we know we did it right .
If you ever find yourself saying , " That 's a pretty cool CG effect there ! " , that means we fucked it up .
Everyone assumes VFX happen in an office that looks something like Mythbusters except with excited artistic types gathering around computers , talking about what kind of dinosaurs they want to make today .
And for the top ranking people , the ones who get to talk on the DVD special features , it might be .

In 1989 , ' cold fusion ' was hailed as a scientific breakthrough with the potential to solve the world 's energy problems by providing a virtually unlimited energy source .
But subsequent experiments largely failed to replicate the initial findings and the controversial concept was dismissed by most people in the scientific community .
" Although ' cold fusion ' is considered controversial , the scientific process demands of us to keep an open mind and examine the new results once every few years , " says Gopal Coimbatore , Ph.D. , of Texas Tech University , program chair of the American Chemical Society 's Division of Environmental Chemistry .
Now , some researchers say they have new evidence that the phenomena -- now called ' low energy nuclear reactions ' -- has evolved and is supported by rigorous , repeatable experimental data .
Selected highlights are shown below :
Cold fusion overview , update by New Energy Times editor -- Steven B. Krivit , editor of New Energy Times and author of " The Rebirth of Cold Fusion , " will present an overview of the field of low energy nuclear reactions -- aka cold fusion .
He will cover news and developments in the field as well as provide the historical and scientific context for the subject .
Krivit also will present a brief review of the reaction products and effects that are claimed in the field , and highlight research results for the strongest excess heat claims .
Study by Fleischmann , Miles offers new evidence of excess heat from cold fusion -- The original cold fusion experiment in 1989 by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons was dismissed by some scientists as ' bad ' science due to alleged errors in calorimetric systems , or heat measurement , that could have misled the scientists into thinking that the excess heat produced was nuclear in origin .
Using more precise calorimetric techniques , a new study by Fleischmann and colleague Melvin Miles reports evidence that the excess heat generated is nuclear and not the result of calorimetric errors .
" Our work shows that cold fusion effects are real , but we cannot assess if this excess heat can become useful .
Much more research work is needed to answer such questions , " says co-author Miles , a chemist at the University of LaVerne in Calif .
Illinois chemist documents nuclear reaction products in LENR experiments
Chemist George Miley is one of a handful of researchers who claims to have documented evidence of transmutations , or the production of new elements , resulting from low energy nuclear reactions ( LENR ) .
Transmutations are commonplace in high - energy physics and are considered clear evidence that some kind of nuclear event has occurred during the reaction .
Miley , a professor at the University of Illinois , Champaign - Urbana , will discuss his latest research as well as a new theory that may help facilitate the success of low energy nuclear reactions in the future .
Evidence of nuclear emission particles detected in new LENR study
In the field of low energy nuclear reactions ( LENR ) , scientists are challenged by one key question in particular :
Are the chemical environments of LENR experiments truly resulting in nuclear reactions ?
Analytical chemist Pam Mosier - Boss , Ph.D. , and her colleagues at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in San Diego , Calif. , believe that they have evidence that such nuclear reactions are occurring .
In a series of experiments , a standard radiation detector used in nuclear physics research was used to record evidence of high energy atomic particles , providing physical evidence to suggest that a nuclear event had occurred in the LENR experiments .
Efforts are ongoing to verify these results .
Overall nearly a dozen scientists will present their findings during a daylong symposium , " New Energy Technology , " on March 29 , at the 233rd national meeting of the American Chemical Society .

The following is based on a speech at the first annual Tenth Amendment Summit in Atlanta , GA on February 26 , 2010 .
How can a crazy  Californian and a conservative  Georgian be friends ?
It s simple  through the principles of  98 .
In 1798 , the John Adams administration signed into law that Alien and Sedition Acts , which made it a crime to publish false , scandalous , and malicious writing  against the government or its officials .
In practice , it was used to quell the freedom of speech in dissent against the sitting administration .
In the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , Thomas Jefferson responded :
 the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government 
But wait  that s not all .
He went on to say that all undelegated powers exercised by the federal government are unathoritative , void and of no force . 
And , that a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy . 
NULLIFICATION ?
Theres been plenty of people talking about nullification lately , but many people dont know what it really means .
I can think of no better way to define it than how my friend Derek Sheriff from the Arizona Tenth Amendment Center has done :
Nullification is not secession or insurrection , but neither is it unconditional or unlimited submission .
Nullification is not something that requires any decision , statement or action from any branch of the federal government .
Nullification is not the result of obtaining a favorable court ruling .
Nullification is not the petitioning of the federal government to start doing or to stop doing anything .
Nullification doesnt depend on any federal law being repealed .
Nullification does not require permission from any person or institution outside of ones own state .
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Nullification is something that s already happening around the country  and Derek explains the process :
Nullification begins with a decision made in your state legislature to resist a federal law deemed to be unconstitutional .
It usually involves a bill , which is passed by both houses and is signed by your governor .
In some cases , it might be approved by the voters of your state directly , in a referendum .
It may change your states statutory law or it might even amend your state constitution .
It is a refusal on the part of your state government to cooperate with , or enforce any federal law it deems to be unconstitutional .
At its very core , nullification is mass civil - disobedience to the federal government with the support of the state apparatus .
It s about  We the People exercising our rights whether the politicians or judges in Washington D.C. want to give us permission to exercise those rights or not .
ROSCOE FILBURN
During the Great Depression , while millions of people were out of work or starving , the FDR administration required American farmers to restrict production of wheat in order to raise prices .
As a farmer , Roscoe Filburn was told he could plant a little over 10 acres of wheat , which he did grow and sell on the market .
He also decided that it was in his best interest  possibly because he had less revenue due to the production limitations  to plant another 10 or so acres .
But , the excess  wheat grown was used at home to feed his livestock , among other things .
He never sold it , so he saw this as being outside the scope of Congressional power to regulate interstate commerce . 
What did the federal government do ?
The expected  they ordered Roscoe to destroy his crops and pay a fine .
Think about that for a moment and youll really understand the evil of having too much power in too few hands .
At a time when large numbers of people were starving , these thugs in government forced people to reduce production for the sake of raising prices .
From this , it seems clear to me that corporate bailouts have been going on a long , long time in America .
Roscoe sued , and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court .
In Wickard v Filburn , the Court ruled against him and the result was that the Federal Government assumed a power that was new in the history of this country .
It now had the power to control the growing and consuming of something that never left ones back yard .
Lies the Government To ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 4.46 ( as of 12:15 EST - Details )
LOST LIBERTY
John Adams , who as we can see from his signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts , was no saint , did give us a great warning on the growth of government power .
In 1775 he wrote , liberty once lost , is lost forever .
He went on to explain that when the People allow government to gain power and restrict liberty , it will never voluntarily give that power back .
Liberty given up to government power will never be returned to the people without a long and difficult struggle .
If we fast - forward to present times , we can see this principle at work .
ANGEL RAICH
In the 1990s , the People of California voted to legalize consumption of marijuana for medicinal purposes .
Angel Raich , who has a huge cancerous tumor in her brain was told by her doctor and California law that using marijuana to relieve some of the pain associated with her cancer was acceptable .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
The Feds dont take too kindly to states passing laws in direct contravention to theirs .
Marijuana , for example , is illegal on a federal level in all circumstances , and federal agencies have consistently said they dont recognize state laws .
You can probably guess what happened , right ?
Federal agents destroyed Angels homegrown marijuana plants without much resistance .
Like Roscoe before her , Angel sued , and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court once again ruled that growing and consuming a plant in ones own back yard qualified as interstate commerce .
And , because of that , the federal government was then authorized to control , regulate , or outright ban such activities under the threat of fine or prison .
Clarence Thomas , in his famous dissent , got it right when he wrote ,  If the majority is to be taken seriously , the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees , clothes drives , and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States .
This makes a mockery of Madisons assurance to the people of New York that the powers delegated to the Federal Government are few and defined ,  while those of the States are numerous and indefinite . 
PARTISAN CONSTITUTIONALISTS ?
The main problem we face is that much of the support for the 10th Amendment is little more than partisanship .
For many years , conservatives have rightly railed against policies such as the ones that FDR used against Roscoe Filburn .
But , at the same time , theyve turned a blind eye to those same policies when used against Angel Raich and her use of marijuana .
And on the other hand , liberals have done just the opposite .
The bottom line , though , is this .
When you allow politicians to bend the rules of the Constitution  even for things you may support  over a long period of time , sooner or later you re going to end up with politicians who feel that the rules dont apply at all .
And , if were not there right now , we re pretty darn close .
EVERY ISSUE , EVERY TIME
That s why we at the Tenth Amendment Center demand adherence to the Constitution  Every Issue .
Every time .
No exceptions .
No excuses .
That means that much of what the federal government does is unconstitutional , including :
The Department of Education , The Patriot Act , Federal Gun Laws and Regulations , National Health Care Mandates , and something that s been going on since 1941 , wars without a Congressional declaration of war from Congress .
LIBERTY
From this we can see that the Tenth Amendment is not about political parties .
It s not about political ideologies .
It s not even about political candidates .
It s about liberty .
It was designed to promote your liberty by strictly limiting the powers of the federal government .
Over the past year or so , Ive been interviewed by mainstream media sources literally dozens of times .
And whether its Fox News , or CNN , or the New York Times , the reporters invariably ask the same question ,  What political party do you support ? 
Each time , I give them the same answer ,  The Tenth Amendment Center is a non-partisan think tank that supports the principles of strictly limited constitutional government . 
They always have virtually the same follow up question too  what about you ?
As the founder of the Center , what s your political background , what political party do you support ?
 None ,  I tell them .
I dont know if they believe me , but its true .
Im no conservative , and I m no liberal .
Im not a Democrat or a Republican .
And Im not a green or a libertarian , or a socialist or an anarchist .
Im not even an independent .
All I am is me , and all I want is to live free .
Thank you .

The Best of Michael Boldin
The wave structure that supports a top at this time is Kenny 's ending diagonal , which I updated in the broadening top discussion .
There was a debate in the comments to those posts as to whether the expanding diagonal triangle is a recognized form to end a move , and a few days ago Kenny came back with an update himself supporting the expanding ED .
He shows this chart , which is from Prechter 's Elliott Wave Principle ( 10th Ed. , 2005 ) , p 39 .
It shows an expanding ED ending a pattern , and ( note to Vipul ) shows the swings of the expanding ED largers than the prior wave 4 of higher degree .
Kenny 's discussion of this topic is well worth the time .
He also points to a resource that I had mentioned in my longer treatment , A Slight Excursion into Ending Diagonals and Other Terminal Patterns that should be studied as well .
A footnote on terminology : what Prechter calls an ending diagonal , Neely calls a Terminal Triangle .
As is his wont , Neely adds more restrictive rules onto his Terminals .
He does n't label an expanding ending diagonal as an expanding terminal triangle , but he has a form called wave - 5 extended which fits .
It would give a target of Sp1275 by June .
Neely also allows for an expanding triangle to end a complex correction , a form which may fit the Kenny pattern and would support an end last week .
Orthodox wave theory teaches that triangles are almost always penultimate waves , typically in waves 4 and B , so it may surprise to hear of triangles ending complex corrections , but the concept is also there in Prechter 's EWP .
He also thought complex corrections would be sideways , whereas this Hope Rally is elongated upwards , yet he has been counting it as a complex correction with multiple X waves , not an impulse .
Orthodox theory also says that ending diagonals are rare , but Kenny and others have seen an increasing prevalence of ending diagonals / terminals lately .
Orthodox theory also expects expanding triangles in fourth waves , but Neely says he never sees them ; instead some other wave pattern is happening , likely a terminal fifth wave which looks like a triangle .
All of these points suggest an update of wave theory is overdue .

A full transcript of the above interview , conducted by Truthdig Managing Editor Peter Z. Scheer and podcast producer Joshua Scheer , begins on Page 2 .
By Narda Zacchino
Congressman Dennis Kucinich predicted Saturday that the health reform bill will win passage in the House on Sunday by just one vote .
In an exclusive interview with Truthdig minutes after President Obama personally lobbied the Democratic caucus , Kucinich likened the bill to “ the political equivalent of castor oil ” but said he has been working to get other holdout Democrats to vote for it .
“ The moment I made my decision , I knew I would be helpful with other members who have struggled with the contradictions of the bill … who knew how badly flawed the bill is and still wanted to see if there was any way to justify voting for it , ” Kucinich said .
He said President Obama made a “ powerful presentation to the caucus … where he outlined what he felt are the major benefits of the bill , and he also talked about ‘ the moment ’ that we have here .
And I think that tomorrow at this time , we should be on our way to seeing the bill passed . ”
Kucinich , long a proponent for Medicare coverage for all Americans or at least a public insurance option , had vowed not to vote for the bill without those reforms , and just days ago was considered a firm “ no . ”
After riding aboard Air Force One with Obama on a visit to the congressman ’s home state of Ohio on March 17 , he switched his opposition to the measure .
On Saturday , he said he did so for several reasons : out of concern for how a defeat would impact the Obama presidency , responding to his constituents , and primarily to remain a strong voice in the continuing debate for further health care reform .
“ I understood that any opportunity we have to impact health care policy after this bill is really going to depend on whether the bill passes or not .
If the bill goes down , we may not see another opportunity in our lifetime to have a serious discussion about expanding health care , about redefining it , about transforming it , about making it more comprehensive . ”
He noted that serious discussion about reform last took place in Congress 16 years ago during the Clinton presidency .
When he saw no support from the White House or congressional leaders for the reforms he advocated and was told that he could sink the bill , he asked rhetorically , “ Then do I want to be responsible for killing the only approach to health care that ’s been offered , no matter how far [ off ]
I think it is , do I just want to stop the discussion ?
“ I have to look at it from the standpoint that if the vote goes down , there ’s not hope for after to do anything that I want to do .
Who ’s going to pay attention ? …
Why would anyone want to hear anything I have to say about health care if I was the deciding vote against it ? …
Why would anyone want to hear about the needs about my constituents ? ”
Yet in the end , “ It ’s not whether somebody ’s ever going to listen to a bill of mine , that ’s the least of my worries , I ’m concerned — can we restart a health care decision in the Congress again ?
And I want to be part of it if we can , and I ’m going to be part of it when we do . ”
Speaking of his constituents in Cleveland , he said many who wanted a “ yes ” vote from him brought him the message that “ You ca n’t always get what you want , and when you ca n’t get what you want , you have to reflect maturely as to whether or not something is better than nothing .
…
I have a responsibility to the people of the district that sent me here , not to cling to some ideological purity . …
But there comes a point when you have to look at the real world and say , ‘ Is there anything that we can get out of here that would lead to something better ? ’
And that ’s ultimately where I came down . … ”
Kucinich acknowledged that he is “ usually the last one standing on a lot of issues ” and conceded , “ When you stake out a position that some see as ideologically intractable , you run the risk of marginalizing yourself .
“ But on this issue , “ I felt that the greater good was to be accomplished by permitting this bill to live and being part of an effort to continue to reshape health care . ”
A vegan whose wife is a vegetarian , Kucinich said he talked to the president about a “ missing dimension ” of the health care discussion , which is “ the choices that each person makes that creates health or disease ; the choice of diet , the food that we eat , paying attention to nutrition . ”
The congressman , who has taken heat from across the political spectrum for his vote switch , scoffed at right - wing radio commentators who suggest he got “ something ” from Obama for his vote , other than “ a firm commitment from him to work together ” on these broader issues of health care .
Kucinich said he would continue to press for single - payer health plans at the state level , because not - for - profit , government - run health care is likelier to be achieved by the states .
The congressman said that his “ concern about the president ” is another reason he switched his vote .
Although he has opposed Obama on his escalation of the war in Afghanistan , the financial industry bailouts and other issues , “ the potential of his presidency is still unfolding .
If this bill goes down , it also has an effect on his presidency . …
We have to be careful that we do n’t cripple his ability to deal with some of the broader issues that deal with the economy and jobs , education , peace . …
“ But it gets to a point where things lose coherence here .
And where the center is not holding anymore .
And there ’s a level of chaos building that actually works against principles of self - governance , so I ’m hopeful that if this passes , we can use this as momentum to get to a bill on a range of concerns .
Maybe it means that the Obama administration can hit the reset button and work on economic policy in a way that they have n’t been able to .
Maybe it will be a chance to give this presidency a boost so he can go back to help more people get jobs and more people stay in their homes and have a stronger hand in a wider range of things , not only domestically but [ in ] foreign policy as well .
So we ’ll see what happens .
But in the end , I ’m just trying to do the best I can . ” Rep. Dennis Kucinich was interviewed by Truthdig Managing Editor Peter Z. Scheer and podcast producer Joshua Scheer .
Peter Scheer : This is Peter Scheer , I ’m with Joshua Scheer and Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio .
Dennis , you ’re very much in the news this week for your switch on health care .
But before we get to that , you ’ve just come from a big meeting about the health care bill .
Are you in the Capitol now ?
Rep. Dennis Kucinich : I am .
Well , I just am back in my office , but I ’m in the Capitol complex in the Rayburn Building .
P.S. : And so how is the vote going ?
D.K. : I think it ’s going to be a very close vote .
There are members who have been going back and forth on the question , it ’s a tough decision for a lot of members .
And the president understands that .
And each of us know that this is a pivotal decision we ’re making with respect to health care .
P.S. : And has the president been addressing the caucus ?
D.K. :
He did and he made a very powerful presentation to the caucus just moments ago , where he outlined what he felt are some of the major benefits of the bill , and he also talked about the moment that we have here .
And I think that tomorrow , at this time , we should be on our way to seeing the bill passed .
P.S. : Have you been working to turn other members of the House who might have voted against the bill in favor of it ?
D.K. : Yes .
The moment I made my decision I knew I would be helpful with other members who have struggled with the contradictions of the bill , with other members who knew how badly flawed the bill is , and still wanted to see if there was any way they could justify voting for it , and so I ’ve had many discussions with members throughout the Democratic caucus about the bill .
P.S. : Can you give us an example of something you said ?
D.K. : Generally that my support for the bill was n’t because I was celebrating its merits .
I was not able to make the changes that I tried to make , and yet when it comes down to the vote , I understood that any opportunity we have to impact health care policy after this bill is really going to depend on whether the bill passes or not .
If the bill goes down , we may not see another opportunity in our lifetime to have any serious discussion about expanding health care , about redefining it , about transforming it , making it more comprehensive .
There are so many issues that are not addressed in this bill , and the whole debate occurs in the context of a for - profit health care system .
And so there ’s a lot of flaws here .
But to get past the flaws , you have to make it possible to show that you can make some progress on health care even on a bill that ’s flawed .
P.S. : So the big question , congressman , a week and a half ago or so you told us that you did n’t think there was much they could do to earn your vote on this bill , and now you ’re voting for the bill .
And more than that , working to get other representatives to vote for it .
How did you come to this decision ?
D.K. : Well , I do n’t retract or recant any of the criticisms I ’ve made of the bill .
In the end they really did n’t provide any kind of a compromise that I was looking for .
I could n’t get a public option in the bill , and I was literally the last person standing on that issue .
I could not get legal protection that would free the states to pursue single - payer .
And when I saw that there was absolutely no way that I was going to get anything out of the White House or anything out of the congressional leaders , specifically with respect to the two critical items that I felt were necessary in order to make this bill worth voting for , then I had to come to the conclusion , well , either the bill is going to rise or sink on my vote , and then do I want to be responsible for killing the only approach to health care that ’s been offered .
No matter how far [ off ]
I think it is , do I just want to stop the discussion ?
And that called for some very serious thinking .
And so I ’m aware of all the criticisms I ’ve made .
I ’ve been one of the foremost advocates of single - payer health care in this country in terms of anyone in Congress for the last 14 years .
And I ’m the co-author of the bill , H.R. 676 .
I ran twice for president on a single - payer platform .
I carried single - payer proposals to national platform committee meanings .
I ’ve been on the floor to get , one time we had 92 members supporting it .
I think now there are 87 .
The thing is , I knew this bill was n’t single - payer .
Single - payer was taken off the table .
I fought for a compromise in the public option ; it was so weak , but nevertheless it opened the door away from , there was opening away from the for - profit system .
But this for - profit system has basically been sealed off and protected by this bill , as one of the flaws .
However , when I understood that there was nothing I could do to change it , it goes back to having to make a decision whether or I wanted to be the one who would kill it , and in process stop any discussion about broader health care reform issues that must occur .
I ’m in a singular position here .
Because if I were voting no , and I basically said , “ Look , it does n’t have what I want .
It ’s not the bill I want .
I ’m not going to vote for it , ” and the bill dies , why would anyone want to hear anything I have to say about health care if I was the deciding vote against it ?
But why would anyone want to work with me .
Why would anyone want to hear about the needs about my constituents if I had taken it upon myself to kill the bill ?
You ca n’t always get what you want and when you ca n’t get what you want , you have to reflect maturely as to whether or not something is better than nothing .
At first I was offended of that kind of truism , but in fact many of my constituents who were calling supporting the bill began to tell me that , and in the end I ’m hoping that ’s true .
But I ’m taking another responsibility now on my shoulders now , and that is if the bill passes to fight again for expanding the meaning of health care to addressing the issues of diet , nutrition , complementary alternative medicine , and continuing to fight to allow states to have a legal right to a single - payer plan .
Joshua Scheer :
Do the insurance companies then win ?
D.K. :
They have been successful in the sense that there ’s no public option .
Do they win ?
Those who have crafted this bill would argue that the insurance companies are , for the first time , being made responsible by having to cover people with a pre-existing condition , and having to extend coverage to families who have young people to age 26 in the household or have them on the policy .
There are some reforms here , but I did n’t come at the conclusion because I said , well , there are some reforms and I ’m rethinking that proposition .
I have to look at it from the standpoint , if the vote goes down , there ’s not hope for after to do anything that I want to do .
Who ’s going to pay attention ?
P.S. : Sorry to interrupt .
It sounds like you ’re saying that you felt you came to the realization that it was your vote that would have sunk the bill , potentially .
Was that expressed to you by the leadership , by the president ?
D.K. : Well , it was n’t only expressed , but it was expressed to me in many different ways , including contacts with congressional leaders and published reports that suggested that the efforts that I was making could create momentum in the direction of killing the bill .
Look , I proceed on things always being mindful of what ’s happening in the moment and what direction things are going .
And I would liken this to driving a car and intending to go a certain route and as you ’re driving you hit a roadblock .
And you can try to go through the roadblock , and you can go over a cliff .
Or you can take a detour and then reconnect with the direction that you ultimately want to go in .
And very clearly , this is a detour , but I feel that it ’s better to keep moving than to cut and go through a roadblock and rest on a principled position which I continue to hold but which is not in this bill , and which does n’t have the support in the Congress that it needs .
And so I decided to continue to fight for the things that I believe in while at the same time , having a new compromise so we can move the ball so I can keep the possession going , and to preserve the hopes of an ongoing effort towards reform .
Again , if the bill goes down , forget any discussion about it .
And if it passes without my support , and with my active efforts to defeat it , I ’m not going to be given the chance to participate in those efforts .
And this is n’t about me , ultimately .
I have a responsibility to the people of the district that sent me here not to cling to some ideological purity , although I have very strong commitments and stand for economic justice , and stand for peace , and am willing to challenge groups and others .
But there comes a point when you have to look at the real world and say , “ Is there anything that we can get out of here that could lead to something better ? ”
And that ’s ultimately where I came down .
P.S. : Well , I think you can tell by Josh ’s sniffling that he ’s not entirely thrilled .
You ’ve gotten pressure from other groups that were disappointed with your decision .
Josh , do you have anything to ask the congressman ?
J.S. : I do have a quick question about the mandating of health care .
I know that it ’s going to take place in four years , when it ’s going to be implemented .
How are you going to enforce that , to make sure all Americans have health care ?
Is that going to be through fines ?
D.K. :
The bill has some penalty mechanisms in it .
And I ’m in a difficult position here because the letter of the bill is something that I can’t tell you that I ’m excited about .
I ’m not .
But what I see it as , the passage of it would be a breakthrough so that we can continue to work towards a more comprehensive approach .
This is not a comprehensive approach ; it is not the bill that I wanted .
And I ’m in a position where I ’m either going to be instrumental in blocking any discussions down the road , or help keep something going that I do n’t agree with .
I ’ve never really been in a situation like this that I can recall in my life , where something that I really did n’t like , that I found myself supporting in order to accomplish some better , higher good down the road .
P.S. : Do we run the risk of a situation where people like you try to improve and expand on health care coverage and health care reform and the public says , “ Did n’t we already spend a year doing this ?
Did n’t we just do this ? ”
D.K. :
This is something that will be the work of the rest of our lives , trying to make a health care system more just , more affordable .
After the bill passes , I ’ll be in touch with single - payer organizations around the country asking them , “ What can I do to help their efforts at a state level ? ”
The work of our lifetime will be to make the health care system one in which we cannot just have confidence for one in which every American is given an opportunity to take some measure of responsibility .
One of the things I ’ve talked about , and I talked to the president about this , too … a missing dimension of health care , a missing dimension of discussion , is the central element of individual responsibility : of the choices that each person makes that creates health or disease ; the choice of diet , the food that we eat , paying attention to nutrition .
These are real choices that people make that have real consequences .
That ’s something that we need to have a broad discussion on , and take America in a new direction on that .
And to look at things like children ’s nutrition , and Michelle Obama is doing that right now , to make sure that we have a path towards complementary and alternative medicine .
Because I know , from my own experience , a change in diet , a change in an approach to medicine , made all the difference in my own life .
And I know it does in others , too .
The responsibility that I take here is one that requires me to stay in the debate , but now I ’m clearly in a position to do it , whether the bill passes or fails .
Because no one can say to me that I spent my misgivings , did n’t give every opportunity for a bill to go forward , which is not within the context of a system that I approve of , but which , generally speaking and broadly speaking on health care , is an attempt to bring reform within the context of that for - profit system .
P.S. : When you were meeting with the president or the leadership , were you given any assurances about this kind of work going forward ?
D.K. :
The president said directly , “ I give you my word that I will work with you on these issues , ” meaning the broad range of issues that I just articulated , but he did not say , “ Work with me on single - payer . ”
It ’s not his cup of tea .
But I do think that I have a firm commitment from him to work together on some of the broad areas of health reform , including diet , nutrition , and some of the other things I articulated , as we go down the road .
There ’s no question about that , that that commitment is there .
J.S. : There ’s involvement , right , with your wife and Michelle Obama on eating plant foods ?
D.K. : That was a Rush Limbaugh story .
J.S. : She ’s supporting George Miller .
He has a big thing that ’s a push on healthy living ?
D.K. : George Miller , Jerry Powers has a bill on nutrition .
I ’ve had life - long interest in this .
Elizabeth is the public affairs director for the Physicians Committee on Responsible Medicine .
I do n’t believe she ’s ever talked to Mrs. Obama about this , but I know she ’s been working on that for quite some time .
So Elizabeth and I share an interest in health and nutrition .
I ’m vegan , she ’s vegetarian , and we both try to live a life that ’s consistent with what we talk about .
J.S. : It ’s just interesting to me .
I know what you ’re talking about , but it does seem like everyone talks about socialism and spending money .
This seems to have more of the idea of this big government and there ’s a lot of money on the line .
D.K. : What do you mean ?
J.S. : A trillion …
D.K. : Health care in America right now , Josh , approximately 2.4 , 2.5 trillion dollars a year is spent on health care in America .
It takes about 16 to 17 percent of our gross domestic product .
[ We had this wrong in our transcript .
This figure has been fixed .
- Ed . ]
P.S. : So when people talk about the difficulty of , one of these arguments against a single - payer system is that it ’s too big a part of our economy to reform health care .
But is n’t that what ’s so alarming ?
D.K. : Actually , we ’re not voting on single - payer tomorrow , to my regret , but one out of every three dollars goes for corporate profits , stock options , executive salaries , advertising , marketing , the cost of paperwork .
This is part of the waste that ’s inherent in a for - profit system .
It ’s going to take years to reconstruct that system .
Single - payer saves money , it covers more people , it ’s more comprehensive , but we ’re not talking about that , unfortunately .
We ’re talking about a for - profit system and the president has made the case for reform within the context of a for - profit system .
After the vote passes , I think we ’ll find a clarification across the board as to what this bill is .
One thing it is n’t , it ’s not socialized medicine , so whatever the Rush Limbaughs of the world have tried to do to depict this as a government - run system , no , it ’s not .
P.S. : Do you have a prediction for the vote ?
D.K. : I think it ’ll win by one vote .
P.S. : Really , it ’s that close ?
D.K. : Yeah .
P.S. : While you ’ve been lobbying other members to pass the bill , was there anything — you touched on this earlier — but was there anything that was expressed to you that was really an “ aha ” moment that made this a lesser evil ? …
What ’s in the bill that you ’re most excited about , eventually ?
We know what you do n’t like about it .
D.K. : Yeah , I wish I could tell you that I ’ve been going around saying “ Oh , this is great . ”
No , I have n’t done that because , you know what , this , to me , is a political equivalent of castor oil .
OK ?
Now somebody has told me , “ I ’ll take castor oil , I ’m going to feel about it , or I ’m about to find out .
I ’m not trying to sell the benefits of castor oil ; I made a decision based on a belief that by keeping this bill alive , and passing it , we create a space for not just an ongoing discussion , but for a more comprehensive approach towards health care reform .
P.S. : You said this was one of the most difficult moments in your political life .
I do n’t know if that ’s mischaracterizing it ? … .
D.K. :
It ’s a difficult moment , no question about it , because the criticisms I ’ve made of this bill are well known .
But not only that , it is my advocacy for health care has been for a totally different system .
P.S. : So how do you respond to these people on the left , lefty blogs , who ’ve been giving you heat over this ?
I do n’t know if that ’s even been on your radar … .
D.K. :
We think that if we are responsible for killing this bill , it is unlikely that we ’ll be in a position to have any influence on the debate later on .
And that while I reject , I fundamentally disagree with for - profit health care , this bill brings reforms within the context of a for - profit health care system .
And so I ’m going to continue to work to propel reforms at a state level because I think it will be very hard to do it nationally for a long time , but I think at a state level we can achieve a breakthrough that can one day result in a national system , but we should think about this .
Think about what happens .
This is what I had to come down to on this , as a decision .
Let ’s say we defeat it .
What do we do the day after ?
Do we go back and convince Congress that it ’s worth another try on health care ?
It ’s the best we ’ve been able to do in the last few decades : a 16 - year gap between the Clinton proposal and the Obama proposal .
And people need to think about that .
I have not in any way , shape or form abandoned my commitment to single - payer , but this is not the bill that I wanted .
But as it is , the only way that I can achieve any credibility on behalf of my constituents , and those who believe in progressive politics , is to , in these circumstances , is to help this bill stay alive , and create an opportunity to be part of a close and intense reshaping of the health care system as we move forward , and I think now I am in a much harder position than I was before , frankly .
J.S. : And I think ,
Peter , it ’s the life of a politician , because the congressman was getting attacked from the centrists , far worse by the way from the left and the right , not the right now .
Now you change your position , and other people hate you .
You always have someone who does n’t like what you do .
D.K. : I ’m always thinking about how does this affect people back home ?
I have a compass on my desk , it points north , and it reminds me where true north is , which is where my home is in Cleveland , Ohio .
And when I think about the decisions that I make , I have to think about people in the neighborhoods who are just struggling to make ends meet , and what kinds of hopes they may have for the future .
I know I ’ve got to be very careful about the implications of the decisions I make .
When you stake out a position that some see as ideologically intractable , you run the risk of marginalizing yourself .
Now there are times , and I ’ve really been in this position , because I ’m usually the last one standing on a lot of issues , and on this one , I felt that the greater good was to be accomplished by permitting this bill to live and being part of an effort to continue to reshape health care .
And people who I ’ve talked to in Congress or are involved in the leadership , have expected my intention to participate in that reshaping of it .
They essentially have , like it or not , brought in a partner in an endeavor to continue to reshape the nature of health care in America .
And again , I do n’t go back on anything I ’ve said , any criticisms of the bill .
But this is a moment when you ’re in a pivotal position you can decide to either go forward or sit tight and hope that somehow you can reshape that opportunity to bring something else forward , and that somehow there are going to be socioeconomic pressures that will bring things forward , and Congress does n’t necessary work that way here .
And there ’s one other thing that I wanted to mention .
Aside from the concerns I have about my constituents , I have a concern about the president , too .
President Obama and I have had difference of opinion on many , many issues , whether there are bailouts or cap - and - trade , he and I have our differences .
But the potential of his presidency is still unfolding .
If this bill goes down , it also has an effect on his presidency .
It ruins his capacity to be an effective president .
And it will have an adverse effect across the boards .
now some may say , well good , there are things he wo n’t be able to do … well , it ’s not good , because he has to function , he ’s the chief executive officer of the nation .
We have to be careful that we do n’t cripple his ability to deal with some of the broader issues that deal with the economy and jobs , education , peace , you know , again I reserve the right to object , to disagree with him on any and everything .
But there ’s a point at which you have to look at the broad implications of this pivotal decision on health care , because it ’s not only about health care .
It ’s about a lot of other things , too .
And there are lot of things that figure into my decision and that certainly was one of them .
P.S. : Well , congressman , I do n’t have to take too much of your time on a busy weekend .
Thank you so much for speaking with us .
D.K. : I appreciate it .
Josh ?
Are you there ?
P.S. : Do you have any other questions ?
J.S. : No , I mean …
D.K. : Last chance .
P.S. : I mean , you were pretty bummed about it .
J.S. : Well , we let the congressman say his peace and I respectfully disagree on a political level , but that ’s just me .
But I ’m not going to browbeat him or anything .
D.K. : You can do that .
Listen , I ’m inviting you to ask any other question about it .
Because I trust your integrity in this as well .
This is a tough decision .
But you know what ?
If people see something in it that is ill - advised , I ’m ready to listen to that too .
J.S. : I ’m not a politician , you need this people and I do n’t .
P.S. : Who are these people ?
The leadership ?
J.S. : Congress .
Down the line , he ’s right .
If he needs votes on bills , these people in power can do very bad things .
D.K. : See , I did n’t link this to anything else , by the way .
I did n’t ask for it , and I did n’t get anything .
It ’s a really unusual position .
Most times you do n’t anything you do n’t vote for it , right ?
But I ’m thinking that when you look at the bigger picture here of what it means if anything labeled health care goes down and you ca n’t get anything , if you ca n’t even make a reform within a context of a for - profit system , if they seal it so tight that you ca n’t get in anything that provides real competition … and what you have is this irreducible , for - profit system , and they ’re not even admitting reforms to that … oh , that ’s where I end up .
It ’s not whether somebody ’s ever going to listen to a bill of mine , that ’s the least of my worries .
I ’m concerned — can we restart a health care discussion in the Congress again .
And I want to be part of it if we can , and I ’m going to be part of it when we do .
J.S. : As a voter , my biggest problem with the bill is the mandate of insurance .
It ’s why I voted for Obama in the primary versus Hillary Clinton , because he attacked her plan which has a mandate for everybody and I do n’t like the Massachusetts plan , which is a mandate , and I have serious issues with it , and I have serious issues with the president .
I do n’t think that you should force people to buy insurance .
D.K. : You know what ?
I agree with that , and I will say that it ’s something else that I ’ve seen in this bill that ’s worth reporting , is that in my time in Congress , I have never seen a bill that was so universally criticized by its supporters as this bill .
This is for land where mutually contradictory premises exist simultaneously and you call it law .
And I would say that the reason , if it passes , I think it will , it ’s going to pass despite the provisions that you do n’t like , that I do n’t like , it ’s going to pass because people think this is a chance to create a new opening towards a broader type of health care reform .
Now there are those who say , “ Do it in this bill . ”
Yeah , right .
Of course , that ’s what I say .
That ’s what I said .
I got a letter last year that 77 members of Congress saying we ’re going to support this bill only if it has a robust public option .
Well , guess what happened when the bill went to the House floor ?
75 members of those members bailed .
I was the only one left standing besides then - Congressman Massa of New York .
And so he has left the Congress a month ago , so now I ’m standing alone , holding righteously my public option , which I was never a supporter of first place because it was step away from single - payer , but here I am .
Last person standing .
And then the question becomes , well , what do I lead ?
What direction do I lead in ?
Do I just say , “ This is a bad bill and we ’re going to kill it ” and then take responsibility if it goes down for all of the consequences and have people come who cheered it the next day say “ Yeah , way to go ” and then , a couple days later , they say “ Well , what are we going to get now ? ”
Well , it went down , we ’re not going to have anything , there ’s no more discussion , and they ’re going to move onto other things .
Or the alternative will be Eddie Goodblock .
It ’s a very , very tough situation .
I ’ll give you another analogy I was thinking about .
There ’s an old third - string quarterback , you go to the line of scrimmage and you ’re ready to call a play .
You think it ’s the play you ’re going to call , score a touchdown , you go to the line and look at the defense .
And you know if you call the play , you ’re not only going to thrown for a loss , but you may lose the game and may be injured and not play again .
So what do you do ?
Do you call the play that you were going to call to begin with ?
Or are you going to say , “ I ’m going to call a different play ” and try to do it so we still have a chance to still advance the ball .
I just think that those who have supported me over the years should know that I ’m not someone who backs down .
But people should also know that I always had my eyes open about developments to see if there ’s any danger out there .
I ’ll let people know about it .
And the danger that I see here is that if the thing goes down , we ’ll really going to be stymied .
And those of us who fought hard a good part of our lives , who , if we help send it down , in the end we ’ll not receive the gratitude to which we think we ’re entitled .
I appreciate talking to you because we ’re always able to have some free - flowing discussions .
I appreciate it .
P.S. : I appreciate it too , Dennis , because we know you as , of all the politicians in the country , you ’re really one of principle .
I was really genuinely curious because I could n’t see a deal , and I could n’t see what you were getting , and you were so strongly against this bill and I think that I do understand better now where you ’re coming from .
D.K. : Well , l appreciate it .
Some people were saying , he was on Air Force One and he sold out for a ride on Air Force One .
I do n’t need a big plane to make a big decision .
Others say , there was some kind of vegan conspiracy , that ’s what Limbaugh ’s latest line , or that Elizabeth is going to get a job at the White House .
She already has a job .
Or that Limbaugh ’s other lines is that my wife is a gazillionaire .
I do n’t know what a gazillionaire is , but if it means anything , anyone who has got a bank balance that goes beyond …
P.S. : It means you have gazillions .
D.K. : Four figures every month , my wife may not qualify .
But it gets to a point where things lose coherence here .
And where the center is not holding anymore .
And there ’s a level of chaos building that actually works against principles of self - governance , so I ’m hopeful that if this passes we can use this as momentum to get to a bill on a range of concerns .
If it passes , maybe it means that the Obama administration can hit the reset button and work on economic policy in a way that they have n’t been able to .
Maybe it will be a chance to give this presidency a boost so he can go back to help more people get jobs and more people stay in their homes and have a stronger hand in a wider range of things , not only domestically but foreign policy as well .
So we ’ll see what happens .
But in the end , I ’m just trying to do the best I can .
P.S. : Well , that ’s all we can ask .
J.S. : Thanks so much , Dennis .
D.K. : Thanks ,
Peter .
Thanks , Josh .
P.S. : Have a good day .
J.S. : Bye now .
D.K. : Take care .
The ghosts of some past presidents must have haunted the East Room of the White House on Feb .
9 .
As part of its Black History Month events , the White House celebrated the music of the civil rights movement in the East Room that day .
Smokey Robinson , Natalie Cole , the Freedom Singers , Bob Dylan , Joan Baez , Jennifer Hudson , John Mellencamp and others gathered to perform some of the great old songs of that era .
The songs that form a cultural foundation for much of the social change movements of the 20th and 21st century echoed through the White House that night .
Mellencamp performed a rocking version of “ Keep Your Eyes on the Prize , ” while Dylan growled out a lullaby rendition of his “ The Times They are a Changing . ”
A soulful “ ( Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody ) Turn Me Around ” by the Freedom Singers may have been the most moving performance of the night .
As the song began , singer Bernice Johnson Reagon stopped and urged the audience to join in .
“ You have to actually sing this song , ” she said .
“ You can never tell when you might need it . ”
A touching version of “ Abraham , Martin and John ” by Smokey Robinson evoked a mournful reflection on the loss of three leaders , two of whom were occupants of the White House , and their impact on the movements for equality and democracy .
Natalie Cole performed Marvin Gaye ’s anti-racist and anti-war song “ What ’s Going On , ” including a denunciation of the escalation of the war in Vietnam .
The line “ War is not the answer ” still resonates today .
The East Room is typically used for such public White House events .
But some 200 hundred years ago , President Thomas Jefferson used the room to temporarily house explorers Merriwether Lewis and George Rogers Clark after their return from crossing the country to the Pacific Ocean , essentially opening the U.S. government ’s nearly 200 - year war on this continent ’s indigenous peoples and nations .
Thomas Jefferson is most well known for penning the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , including the words “ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . ”
However from the way he lived his life and the ideas he held , we know that Thomas Jefferson really believed these words applied only to a portion of the people .
In 1785 , for example , he wrote a book called “ Notes on the State of Virginia , ” explaining his views on how his home state ’s government should be organized .
It would be his only published book , and it was probably the first book - length political treatise published in the U.S .
In that book , Jefferson took time out to explain and defend the racist ideology behind white supremacy and the separation of races .
People of African descent , he insisted , lacked imagination , the ability to reason or any significant artistic capacity .
They are incapable of meaningful and original artistic expression and are suited only for labor , Jefferson pontificated , in the pseudo - scientific manner racists typically adopt .
At best , Black and white people should always be kept apart , he concluded .
It was ideas like these that served as the foundation for the slave system .
Many occupants of the White House , up to Lincoln , would come to repeat these ideas and support the slave system they justified .
Even after the end of the slave regime , presidents like Andrew Johnson and Woodrow Wilson defended Jefferson ’s racial ideology .
Wilson invoked them when he described the brief overturning of white supremacy in the South during the Reconstruction period as “ a public crime . ”
Theodore Roosevelt mouthed his own updated version of Jefferson ’s theories of race when he described racial inter-marriage and the influx of immigrants as a form of “ race suicide . ”
The celebration in the East Room on Feb. 9 stands as a sign of the many struggles and deep changes the country has been through .
Massive painted likenesses of Theodore Roosevelt and George Washington could only stare silently as our country ’s first Black president and his beautiful family hosted this concert celebrating the voices and music and struggles of our country ’s Second Reconstruction .
What a change indeed !

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea threatened to attack South Korean and U.S. forces for scheduled joint military drills in March even as nuclear envoys picked up the pace of work to get stalled disarmament talks back on track .
A North Korean soldier looks south as a South Korean soldier ( R ) stands guard at the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas in Paju , about 55 km ( 34 miles ) north of Seoul , January 21 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
South Korea and the United States have held the drills for years without major incident .
North Korea regularly criticizes the exercises as a prelude to invasion and nuclear war .
The drills run from March 8 to 18 .
A spokesman for the North ’s army said the military drills by the South and United States troops were “ nuclear war exercises aimed to preempt a surprise attack on the ( North ) ” , despite assurance by the two allies that they were purely defensive .
“ If the U.S. imperialists and South Korean warmongers launch the joint military exercises for aggression , ignoring our repeated warnings , we will react to them with our powerful military counteraction , and if necessary , mercilessly destroy the bulwark of aggression by mobilizing all the offensive and defensive means including nuclear deterrent , ” the spokesman said .
The threat came as U.S. envoy for North Korea , Stephen Bosworth , held meetings in Seoul trying to push for the restart of talks with the North involving the two countries , Japan , Russia and China to end Pyongyang ’s nuclear ambitions .
North Korea has boycotted the talks since late 2008 and has demanded a peace treaty with the United States and the suspension of U.N. sanctions imposed after its nuclear test last year .
Washington has said North Korea ’s demands for aid and improved relations can be addressed only along with renewed nuclear disarmament steps by Pyongyang .
Bosworth said upon arrival in South Korea that he did not have a clear indication of whether or when the North would return to the table .
South Korea ’s envoy for the six - party talks , Wi Sung - lac , held talks with Bosworth on Thursday after returning from Beijing where he discussed the issue with the host of the six - way talks .
Bosworth goes to Japan on Friday .
Murky Motives Accused Auschwitz Sign Thieves Face Trial in Poland
Five Polish petty criminals are awaiting trial in the case of the Auschwitz sign stolen in December last year .
Prosecutors believe the theft was masterminded from Sweden by Anders Högström , a former neo -Nazi leader , and are trying to extradite him to Poland .
How to Read the QDR
If the annual budget is where the U.S. Defense Department lays out its needs for the coming year , the Quadrennial Defense Review is where the Pentagon lays out its vision of the years ahead .
It ’s an important guide to how military and civilian leaders see the world , and since the U.S. military plays such an enormous role in setting America ’s foreign policy , it ’s a document that demands careful study .
And it ’s also vital to examine the gap between the soaring ambitions of the QDR and the hard realities of the budget .
This year ’s QDR , the Obama administration ’s first , portrays the security challenges of the future as fundamentally different from those of the past .
In the 21st century , conventional U.S. military superiority will increasingly drive potential adversaries toward asymmetric responses to American power .
Recognizing this new state of affairs , the ./ QDR emphasizes the nontraditional threats posed by WMD terrorist attacks , hybrid warfare combining high - and low - tech tactics , and the loss of shared access to the global commons in air , sea , space , and cyberspace .
Even potential competitors like China are more likely to attack the United States using asymmetric means , such as by countering American power in cyberspace rather than in a blue - water naval battle in the middle of the Pacific Ocean .
Together , these asymmetric security challenges could erode America ’s freedom of action and ability to influence the course of world events in the years ahead — if the United States does not begin to prepare for them now .
While the new defense budget released alongside the QDR continues to reallocate resources in response to nontraditional threats , it is difficult to compel dollars and plans to follow words .
The quip about past QDRs — " Civilians propose and services dispose " — still holds true today .
In its innovative " Quad Chart , " the 2006 QDR masterfully sketched out the four main challenges facing the United States in the future .
However , the Government Accountability Office judged that the 2006 report did not comprehensively consider " different options for organizing and sizing its forces to provide needed capabilities . "
Similarly , the 2010 QDR concedes that further narrowing of the gap between vision and reality may be required .
In its own words , the new QDR " describes some of the tradeoffs that Defense Department leaders have identified to enable the rebalancing of U.S. mili­tary capabilities , " but admits , " More such tradeoffs could be necessary in the future . "
The new QDR and defense budget illustrate the challenge of matching vision to reality , even with more than $ 700 billion in annual funding for the Department of Defense .
Closing the distance between strategic priorities listed in the QDR and realistic budgetary plans to implement them will prove a major challenge in 2010 due to persistent structural constraints on reallocating defense spending .
Moreover , last year ’s overall success in reshaping the defense budget does not mean that members of Congress will unflinch­ingly accept and implement the vision illuminated by the new QDR .
Some lawmakers may favor the status quo during 2010 , thanks to the lingering economic recession and upcoming congressional midterm elections .
The Budget Squeeze
The strategic rebalancing called for by the 2010 QDR will confront structural constraints that will make change difficult to implement .
These impedi­ments , which are deeply rooted and long running , include :
Rising personnel costs for the Department of Defense ’s military forces and civilian employees , which are being compounded by 1 ) increases in the end - strength size of the Army and Marine Corps ; and 2 ) the addition of 19,200 new governmental acquisition workforce employees .
Growing DOD operations and maintenance costs .
Higher price tags for advanced weapons systems , including the additional acquisition costs associ­ated with design problems and schedule slippages .
The cost of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq , which 1 ) may not immediately decrease when troops are withdrawn if historical precedent is any guide ; and 2 ) will require future investments to bring depleted equipment stocks back to pre-war standards .
Steady growth in federal spending on mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare , which will increasingly squeeze discretionary spending in other areas , including national defense .
Taken together , these trends leave alarmingly little room to maneuver .
They present formidable obstacles to strategic flexibility , as well as budget­ary realignment when needed , in the pursuit of national security needs .
In the years ahead , fierce competition for federal budgetary resources may prevent the Pentagon from receiving enough money to do all of the things it has already committed to doing , let alone the things required to cope with emerging nontraditional security threats .
When combined with byzantine congressional and interagency budget processes , which are not conducive to " whole - of - government " approaches to national security , the structural constraints described above are a significant drag on responsive , forward - oriented strategies for overcoming the wide range of irregu­lar , disruptive , and catastrophic challenges to the United States laid out in the 2010 QDR .
In the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , political leaders may be reticent to increase defense spending and to keep it elevated for most of the next two decades , as would be required to execute existing initiatives .
Excluding costs for Afghanistan and Iraq , the Pentagon ’s base budget must average $ 567 billion per year between 2011 and 2028 in order to carry out current plans .
Defense policymakers should not delude themselves into thinking that it will be easy to secure this high level of funding over such a long period .
The Pentagon will struggle to obtain resources as it competes against ballooning interest on the national debt , non-defense domestic priori­ties , and a generation of baby boomers driving mandatory spending higher than ever .
Further , public opinion polls show that more than 70 percent of Americans think current defense spending levels are either " about right " or " too much . "
Even if the required funding were to be appropriated , the high costs for personnel , operations and maintenance , and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq threaten to crowd out investments in procurement and research and development , which together provide new solutions for today , such as mine - resistant ambush protected vehicles , and alternative options for tomorrow , such as unmanned aerial vehicles and the next generation bomber .
Thus , the Pentagon cannot rely on American taxpayers ’ future largesse .
Instead , the Department of Defense should concentrate on putting its own house in order by using the new QDR as a mandate to continue to bring strategic vision and force plans into closer alignment .
In making these tough deci­sions , however , Pentagon leaders must also clearly explain to Congress and the American people the attendant risks .
The U.S. military cannot alter its force plans without serious repercus­sions for the policies of U.S. allies , the strategies of potential U.S. adversaries , and the robustness of the defense industrial base .
Tradeoffs Still Required
Pre-existing budgetary commitments make it dif­ficult for the Pentagon to devote adequate resources to the new capabilities necessary for success in mis­sions U.S. troops are actually performing today and are likely to perform tomorrow .
Despite the persis­tent challenges of global terrorism and two ongoing wars , the Department of Defense still spends more each year on administrative activities like claims processing than on the special operations forces that are so important for success in Afghanistan , Iraq , and counterterrorism missions .
The Pentagon also continues to pay for major defense acquisition programs , initiated decades ago in some cases , that no longer serve current security needs .
Reforms to the defense budget made by Defense Secretary Robert Gates last year certainly brought the Department of Defense ’s priorities and plans into much closer alignment .
Indeed , last year ’s 2010 budget will likely go down in history as one of the most revolutionary budgets ever because of the specific programmatic changes made to approximately 50 weapons systems .
The new 2011 budget does not recreate the fireworks of last year .
Instead , it consolidates last year ’s gains within a long - term evolutionary framework in accordance with the future needs of the U.S. military .
Yet more hard tradeoffs are still required to ensure that the commitments of the past do not become a strategic drag on overcoming the challenges of the future .
The worst - case scenario going forward is that policymakers whistle past the graveyard by avoiding difficult choices today — only to discover five years from now that things have become even less fiscally sustainable and that the United States is still not prepared for the uncertain future that lies ahead .

YOU SEEM TO BE TRYING TO FIND YOUR WAY HOME
That , by at least one way of reckoning , makes them routine : From 1992 to 2008 , nearly 2,000 New York Police Department officers were arrested , according to the department ’s own annual reports of the Internal Affairs Bureau , an average of 119 a year .
The rarely seen internal reports were obtained last month by the New York Civil Liberties Union through the Freedom of Information Law .
They show that the number of tips logged each year by Internal Affairs has tripled since 1992 , a trend that top police officials attribute to an opening up of the process and more diligent cataloging of public response to police interactions — including compliments as well as complaints .
The number of investigations pursued over the same period has dropped by more than half , which Chief Charles V. Campisi , who runs the unit , called “ the truest reflection of the corruption the department faces . ”
Most of those investigations involved drugs , theft or crimes like fraud , bribery or sex offenses , on and off the job .
Inquiries in these categories have largely decreased in recent years , but cases involving abuse of suspects have risen significantly .
The 2006 report noted the “ unprecedented ” rise and gave an example : several officers followed a woman wanted for petty larceny into a store and one “ struck her in the head with his firearm for no reason . ”
“ History tells us there always will be bad cops , and the department will never be able to completely control that , ” said Christopher T. Dunn , associate legal director of the civil liberties union , who has spent weeks studying the documents .
“ But what it can control , and what it should be held accountable for , is how it responds to corruption . ”
For better or worse , the police are left to police themselves , and the reports , which together total more than 600 pages , provide the most comprehensive record available chronicling that imperfect science .
They tell a colorful story not only of officers who betray the badge but also of the little - known agency charged with rooting them out .
WALLACE : How hard do you think President Obama would be to defeat in 2012 ?
PALIN : It depends on a few things , say he played — I got this from Buchanan — say he played the war card .
Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decide to really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel–which I would like him to do .
That changes the dynamics of what we can assume will happen between now and three years .
Because I think if the election were today , Obama would not be elected .
WALLACE : You ’re not suggesting that Obama would cynically play the war card ?
PALIN : I ’m not suggesting that , I ’m saying if he did , things would dramatically change if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure our nation and secure our allies .
I think people would shift their thinking a bit .
The question Wallace asked was basically " what does Obama need to do to win in 2012 " .
The question Palin answered , also too , was " what does Obama need to do get votes from teabagging nutjobs like you ? "
Only if she were answering that question does her answer make any sense whatsoever .
Because God knows that every red-blooded teabagger loves them some war against Ay - rabs .
If it involves killin ' Ay - rabs , that 's okayfine by them , you betchya .
It 's a scary and depressing thought that there might , just maybe , be enough people in this country that a far right wing actress like Sarah Palin could earn the Republican nomination for president .
It 's enough to make you start taking German lessons .
Or French .
Or Spanish .
I 'm just sayin ' ...

The dinosaur had short powerful arms and a large claw on each hand A newly discovered fossil has shed light on why a group of dinosaurs looks like birds , say scientists .
Haplocheirus sollers may not be as charismatic as T. rex or as agile as a pterodactyl but it 's thought to solve a long standing puzzle .
Researchers believe its short arms and large claw show how bird - like dinosaurs evolved independently of birds .
The 3 m - long skeleton , found on an expedition to China 's Gobi desert , is described in the journal Science .
The fossil is a member of the Alvarezsauridae family , a group of bird - like dinosaurs .
The group shares features with birds , including fused wrist elements and a loosely structured skull .
But the researchers say the new fossil shows the Alvarezsauridae group split from birds much earlier on the evolutionary tree than was thought .
" Haplocheirus is a transitional fossil , " Jonah Choiniere from George Washington University told the BBC .
" Previously we thought the Alvarezsauridae were primitive , flightless birds .
This discovery shows they 're not and that the similarities between them evolved in parallel . "
The fossil is of a nearly complete adolescent dinosaur skeleton and was found in orange mudstone beds in the Junggar Basin , Xinjiang , China .
It 's like finding a great , great grandfather in your family which doubles the age of your family tree
Jonah Choiniere
It was spotted when a member of the team noticed the pelvis at the ground 's surface .
The rest of the skeleton was found only inches down .
The new dinosaur shows an early evolutionary step in the development of the short , powerful arm typical to the Alvarezsauridae group .
" The rest of the members of this group have really short forelimbs with huge muscle attachments , like body - builder arms .
The fossil shows the first step in the evolution of this weird arm and claw , " said Mr Choiniere .
Varied diet
The researchers believe the fossil shows development of the two diverged in the Late Jurassic period , about 160 million years ago .
Until now there was no evidence of this type of dinosaur living at that time .
" It 's like finding a great , great grandfather in your family which doubles the age of your family tree , " said Mr Choiniere .
Scientists believe that birds descended from theropods or bird footed dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic .
Theropods include alvarezsaurs , other bird - like dinosaurs including the well known Velociraptor , meat eaters like T. rex and modern birds .
Haplocheirus sollers means simple , skillful hand .
The fossil shows the dinosaur had small teeth and researchers believe the claw may have been used for digging termites .
" It may have had a very general diet , tackling smaller animals like lizards , very small mammals and very small crocodile relatives , " explained Mr Choiniere .
" It was a lightly built animal and could run very quickly . "

In late 2006 , students at a school in Turin , Italy filmed and then uploaded a video to Google Video that showed them bullying an autistic schoolmate .
The video was totally reprehensible and we took it down within hours of being notified by the Italian police .
We also worked with the local police to help identify the person responsible for uploading it and she was subsequently sentenced to 10 months community service by a court in Turin , as were several other classmates who were also involved .
In these rare but unpleasant cases , that 's where our involvement would normally end .
But in this instance , a public prosecutor in Milan decided to indict four Google employees — David Drummond , Arvind Desikan , Peter Fleischer and George Reyes ( who left the company in 2008 ) .
The charges brought against them were criminal defamation and a failure to comply with the Italian privacy code .
To be clear , none of the four Googlers charged had anything to do with this video .
They did not appear in it , film it , upload it or review it .
None of them know the people involved or were even aware of the video 's existence until after it was removed .
Nevertheless , a judge in Milan today convicted 3 of the 4 defendants — David Drummond , Peter Fleischer and George Reyes — for failure to comply with the Italian privacy code .
All 4 were found not guilty of criminal defamation .
In essence this ruling means that employees of hosting platforms like Google Video are criminally responsible for content that users upload .
We will appeal this astonishing decision because the Google employees on trial had nothing to do with the video in question .
Throughout this long process , they have displayed admirable grace and fortitude .
It is outrageous that they have been subjected to a trial at all .
But we are deeply troubled by this conviction for another equally important reason .
It attacks the very principles of freedom on which the Internet is built .
Common sense dictates that only the person who films and uploads a video to a hosting platform could take the steps necessary to protect the privacy and obtain the consent of the people they are filming .
European Union law was drafted specifically to give hosting providers a safe harbor from liability so long as they remove illegal content once they are notified of its existence .
The belief , rightly in our opinion , was that a notice and take down regime of this kind would help creativity flourish and support free speech while protecting personal privacy .
If that principle is swept aside and sites like Blogger , YouTube and indeed every social network and any community bulletin board , are held responsible for vetting every single piece of content that is uploaded to them — every piece of text , every photo , every file , every video — then the Web as we know it will cease to exist , and many of the economic , social , political and technological benefits it brings could disappear .
These are important points of principle , which is why we and our employees will vigorously appeal this decision .
The chancellor has conceded in an interview with me that if Labour is re-elected , public spending cuts will be tougher and deeper than those implemented by Margaret Thatcher .
I asked Alistair Darling to spell out how tough spending cuts could be :
Robinson : " The Treasury 's own figures suggest deeper , tougher than Thatcher 's - do you accept that ? "
Darling : " They will be deeper and tougher - where we make the precise comparison I think is secondary to an acknowledgement that these reductions will be tough . "
The independent think tank , the Institute of Fiscal Studies , has noted that that total public spending increased by an average of 1.1 % a year in real terms over the Thatcher era .
This is almost three times the increase of 0.4 % a year that Alistair Darling has pencilled in for the next Parliament .
The IFS went on to observe that :
" [ I ] f we subtract spending on welfare and debt interest then we estimate that the rest of public spending would be cut in real terms by an average of 1.4 % a year compared to an average increase of 0.7 % in the Thatcher era .
We have not seen five years with an average annual real cut as big as this since the mid-1970s . "
As the Conservatives wish to make bigger spending cuts than Labour , they have already accepted that they would have to be tougher than Margaret Thatcher .
Update 1753 : This is not the first time the chancellor has caused a stir by accepting reality .
It has not always been comfortable for him .
After he observed that the world faced the worst economic crisis for 60 years , he says the " forces of hell " were unleashed on him .
The problem Labour has , of course , is that while what Alistair Darling says is true , it is also totally at odds with the message the party is giving to the electorate .
Voters are being asked to focus on so - called efficiency savings in dull things like IT , procurement and reducing staff sickness rates .
Few actual cuts have been spelled out beyond the budget squeeze in universities which the chancellor sought to lessen in his Budget .
The reality , of course , will be job cuts , real pay cuts and freezes and service reductions in the public sector .
Meantime , tax rises on the rich are being put up in lights while the fact that every basic - rate taxpayer will soon be paying more is downplayed .
The chancellor - who is by instinct straight - has learned the lesson from the prime minister 's denial of cuts last year and can point to plenty of occasions when he has warned of how tough things will be and has set out figures and policies .
Nevertheless , all the polling suggests that few voters recognise the facts , believing something which no politician argues : that the deficit can be dealt with by efficiency savings alone .

Not to be confused with Breeding .
Pregnancy is a game mechanic and multiple - day event that begins after a successful " Try for Baby " interaction between two Sims of the opposite sex , and ends with the pregnant female Sim giving birth to one or more newborn babies .
[ 1 ]
Pregnancy primarily affects adult [ TS2 ] [ TS3 ] [ TS4 ] and young adult [ TS3 ] [ TS4 ] female Sims .
Pregnancy brings many physical and lifestyle changes to the pregnant Sim , including increasing body size , faster - decreasing motives , and forced maternity leave from work .
Pregnancy was introduced as a game feature in The Sims 2 , and has appeared in each subsequent game .
Prior to The Sims 2 , kissing or playing in bed [ TS:LL ] were the only interactions that could result in two Sims having a child - and the player could usually say yes or no to that .
If the player said " yes " , or was not given that option , a baby would immediately appear , forgoing any pregnancy period .
Under normal circumstances , only female Sims can become pregnant .
However , in The Sims 2 and in The Sims 4 : Get to Work , male Sims can be impregnated as well , either through alien abduction or by the use of cheats .
In The Sims 3 : Seasons , male Sims can experience a sort of pseudo - pregnancy as the result of alien abduction .
In The Sims 4 , as of patch 34 , a Sim 's ability to get pregnant or get others pregnant can be set with the optional Customize Gender menu in CAS , regardless of the Sim 's gender .
Pregnant Sims count as two Sims when it comes to household sizes .
As such , it is impossible to move a pregnant Sim into a household of seven ( unless another Sim is moved out ) or becomes pregnant in a full household .

Conception Edit
Conception Lullaby
The lullaby tune that plays when a Sim becomes pregnant .
Problems playing this file ?
See media help .
Trying for Baby Edit
To get a Sim pregnant , the two partners must " Try for Baby " .
When trying for a baby , there is a possibility that the Sim will not get pregnant , but if she does , the player will hear a lullaby song or jingle ; signaling a successful conception . [ TS2 ] [ TS3 ]
In The Sims 4 , the lullaby song was removed , and Sims can use the pregnancy test on the toilet for a cost of § 15 .
In The Sims 2 , only adults and elder males can initiate Try for Baby , although the InTeenimater mod can allow teens to become pregnant .
( While young adult males can father children with adult females , the " Try for Baby " interaction must be initiated by the adult female at her home . )
If the Sim is infertile , the player can testingcheatsenabled and spawn the Tombstone of Life and Death to impregnate a Sim .
The number of babies born is determined at conception , but the gender is determined at birth .
In The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 ( prior to Patch 34 ) , young adults , adults , and male elders can try for a baby , but only female young adults and adults can get pregnant .
Young adults that are pregnant and about to become adults will not age up until the baby is born . [ TS3 ]
Additionally , the chance of conception is lowered for older female Sims trying for a baby . [ TS3 ] [ TS4 ]
With the release of patch 34 for The Sims 4 , it is possible for a same - sex couple to have biological children without the use of mods or cheats .
Sims can be set so that they are able to become pregnant or to make another Sim pregnant , regardless of gender .
Some things that the player does or exposes the pregnant Sim to during pregnancy can affect either the gender or number of offspring the pregnancy will produce .
In The Sims Medieval , WooHoo between two Sims of the opposite gender always carries a chance of pregnancy ; there is no " Try for Baby " option .
Foreign romance Edit
In The Sims 2 : Bon Voyage , if a pregnant Sim goes on vacation before starting to show or becomes pregnant while on vacation , the pregnancy will be suspended until after they return home .
The Sim may , however , experience morning sickness when on the rental or hotel lot , especially on a longer vacation .
In The Sims 3 : World Adventures , it is possible for a Sim to have WooHoo with someone from the place they are visiting on their holidays .
If a male Sim were to WooHoo with a female Sim who lives in his holiday destination ( i.e. China , France or Egypt ) , it is possible for the female Sim to get pregnant .
But when the male Sim returns home , his offspring can be seen on the family tree as a child , even if the WooHoo occurred the previous day .
This jump in age occurs due to the fact that pregnant females , babies , and toddlers are not present in foreign destinations .
In addition , story progression is at a catch - up rate , meaning the offspring will not immediately show any age progressions through the family tree .
Meanwhile , a female Sim who does the same will return home and give birth to the child , and the family tree will show who the father is ; the baby will grow up in a normal pace .
A pregnant Sim cannot travel to the future .
[ TS3 :ITF ]
However , they can get pregnant and have a baby in the future , but the household will not be able to return home while the Sim is pregnant .
In The Sims 4 : Jungle Adventure , Sims have the option to try for a baby with Selvadoradian locals , provided they have a high enough relationship .
If a local is impregnated , they will give birth normally and the related household will be notified .
However , like all other townie births , babies will immediately age up into toddlers as they have no home for a bassinet to be placed in .
If someone in a playable household is impregnated by a Selvadoradian , they cannot give birth while on vacation , but their pregnancy will progress normally after they return home .
Meeting aliens Edit
Main article : Alien abduction
This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 2 , The Sims 3 : Seasons , and The Sims 4 : Get to Work .
The Sims 2 Edit
In The Sims 2 , when an adult male stargazes with the Farstar e3 telescope at night , there is a chance that he will be abducted by aliens .
If he is , he will return after a few Sim hours , and will soon learn that he is pregnant .
( Female Sims and male Sims of different ages can be abducted , but only adult males will become pregnant as a result of an abduction . )
If NightLife is installed , an adult male Sim abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere will return pregnant .
The Nightlife patch fixed a glitch which allowed young adult males abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere to return pregnant .
If FreeTime or later is installed , Knowledge Sims with the Summon Aliens aspiration benefit can use either telescope to attempt to summon aliens ; so an adult male Sim with that benefit can use it to attempt to become pregnant .
The Sims 3 : Seasons Edit
There 's a 33 % chance a young adult or older male who has been abducted by aliens may receive the " Unexpected Weight Gain " moodlet after the " Abducted " moodlet has expired .
While the Sim will give birth after the " Unexpected Weight Gain " moodlet has expired , he is not otherwise treated as pregnant .
He will not be given maternity leave , will not change into maternity clothes , will not be restricted from activities that pregnant Sims normally cannot do , and will not pass on any genetic information to the alien child .
It has been noted that this can only happen if the aliens performing the abduction are not residents of the neighborhood .
The Sims 4 : Get To Work Edit
There is a possibility that a Sim will be abducted during the 9 PM to 4 AM hours .
Male Sims may come back pregnant with an alien baby after abduction , as well as receiving the " Abducted " moodlet .
Female Sims cannot be impregnated by aliens , but will still receive the moodlet .
Things that pregnant Sims cannot do Edit
Some actions are not available to Sims who are pregnant .
In The Sims 2 and The Sims Stories , these actions are either disabled or will simply not show up .
In later games , these actions are disabled and the message " This interaction cannot be performed by a pregnant Sim . " [ TS3 ] [ TSM ] or " ( Sim name ) is not able to do this while pregnant . " [ TS4 ] will be appear if the player tries to perform any of them .
This section is in need of additional information .
You can help The Sims Wiki by expanding this section .
Duration Edit
Pregnancies last 75 Sim hours in The Sims 2 and 72 Sim hours in The Sims 3 though it 's common to refer to pregnancies as lasting 3 days in both games .
In The Sims 4 , pregnancies can last up to 3 –5 days .
In The Sims FreePlay , pregnancies last approximately 216 hours ( 9 days ) .
The Sims 2 has cheats which can be used to reduce the gestation period to a mere 2 hours of Sim time .
The lifespan setting in The Sims 3 does not normally affect the duration of a pregnancy .
The motives of a pregnant Sim will drop at an increased rate , even if the Sim is not visibly pregnant .
In The Sims 2 , Sims who are able to meditate will still be able to do so while pregnant .
In The Sims 2 , it is possible to calculate the time in which the Sim will expand each day and eventually give birth .
From the hour in which a Sim becomes pregnant , she will expand 25 Sim hours later each day until she gives birth .
So a female who becomes pregnant at one o'clock on Tuesday , will expand at two on Wednesday , three on Thursday , and give birth at four on Friday .
In The Sims 3 , a Sim who is at level 5 or higher in the Medicine career track can determine the gender of the baby .
First trimester Edit
The first trimester lasts one day only .
During this trimester the pregnant Sim will suffer from morning sickness , which usually leads them to throwing up in the toilet , with a thought bubble showing a pacifier and a question mark .
In The Sims 2 , Sims with high body skill may have a better chance of not throwing up , though they will still be visibly queasy , and their comfort meter may at times go into the red .
Sims do not always throw up when pregnant , but they may wake up in the middle of the night to vomit .
In The Sims 2 , the Sim will not be visibly pregnant .
In The Sims 3 , the bulge cannot be seen unless the player zooms in .
Sims with the grumpy trait will be aggravated by morning sickness .
During the first trimester , the pregnant Sim can't leap into other Sims ' arms and other Sims can't leap into their arms .
It is possible to customize the maternity clothes the Sim will wear at this stage , before they become visibly pregnant . [ TS3 ]
Pregnant Sims in The Sims 2 may have random drops in the hunger motive , which may take newer players by surprise .
Also if a Sim suffers from morning sickness , and there is no toilet on the lot , the Sim will throw up on the floor / ground instead .
In The Sims 4 , the player can have the prospective mother do a pregnancy test after trying for a baby .
This is done by selecting the action at the toilet .
If the Sim is pregnant , a " First Trimester " moodlet will appear , and will last 24 hours .
If a pregnancy test is not done , the Sim will appear pregnant around 24 hours after conception .
Second trimester Edit
The second trimester lasts one day .
At some point in the day , the pregnant Sim will attract the player 's attention and change appearance .
Their abdomen will expand and they will begin to wear maternity clothing .
[ TS2 ] [ TS3 ] [ 2 ]
In The Sims 3 , the bulge is nearly non-existent at first , but progressively grows larger .
If the pregnant Sim has a job , they will be placed on maternity leave , and the carpool will not appear .
In The Sims 2 , however , a pregnant Sim who has access to a car can drive to work .
In The Sims 2 , the Sim will be paid for these leave days even if they fall on one of their days off .
Also , in The Sims 2 , calling a Sim who is on maternity leave during his or her work hours will still result in the " ( Sim ) is working " messages , and a Sim who " brings a friend " home from work may bring a pregnant Sim .
There will be new social interactions , " Rub Belly " and " Talk to Belly " [ TS2 ] ; " Feel Tummy " , " Listen to Tummy " , and " Talk to Tummy " , and the pregnant Sim may " Ask to Feel Tummy " .
[ TS3 ] [ TS4 ]
The pregnant Sim and father can announce the pregnancy to others . [ TS3 ] [ TS4 ]
In The Sims 2 , a Sim at this point will no longer be able to do yoga or work out in front of a stereo , but will be able to work out in front of a television .
The Sim may be able to use some types of exercise equipment , but will not be able to use all types .
The combined effects of pregnancy and working out will be hard on the Sim 's motives , but this does not appear to pose any other risk .
A pregnant Sim will be able to swim , but will be unable to use a diving board or pool slide .
Pregnant Sims in the second and third trimesters can also expect to have cravings , in the form of more " Eat ... " wants / wishes ( depending on which game ) for specific foods .
These are easy to fulfill , since they 'll usually be a dish the Sim knows how to cook .
In The Sims 4 , a Sim in the second trimester may get a morning sickness moodlet upon waking from sleep .
This will make them uncomfortable , and possibly even make them throw up .
Third trimester Edit
The third trimester lasts one day .
The expectant Sim will get the attention of the player and the abdomen will enlarge again .
They can no longer drive , take a taxi [ TS3 ] [ confirmation needed ] , use the swing , or use the electro - dance sphere from Nightlife .
They will suffer from mood swings , in which the outcome of Social interactions between the pregnant Sim and another will change .
In The Sims 3 , they will get negative moodlets , such as the " Sore " moodlet , and may no longer run .
In The Sims 4 , the third trimester can last one or more days , as birth can happen at any time rather than at a set time as in previous games .
While normally Sims give birth within 3 days of the start of the third trimester , it can be extended indefinitely by preventing the Sim from entering their lot or a hospital .
Birth Edit
On the last day of the pregnancy the Sim will attract the viewer once again and go into ' labor ' .
This is an autonomous action and all Sims on the lot or nearby will be drawn to the Sim to ' panic '
( This includes the Grim Reaper if he is on the lot . )
In The Sims 3 and in The Sims 4 : Get to Work , the pregnant Sim can be taken to the hospital when clicked on while in labor , or they can stay at home , and have a safe and comfortable birth .
The advantages of giving birth at the hospital are that the baby 's bassinet will be provided free of charge and the all of pregnant Sim 's motives will be replenished .
In The Sims 2 , a screen will come up with the message " There 's a new family member on the way ! " or " There 's TWO new babies in the family ! " ( if the Sim is having twins ) at which time the genetics and gender of the new baby ( or babies ) are determined .
If the special camera is enabled , a cinematic will commence showing the birth of the baby , otherwise the Sim will turn around on the spot and a new family member is born .
If the Sim has a job , they will get additional leave in the form of three vacation days , regardless of the number of vacation days they already have .
These work like ordinary vacation days ; if the Sim is scheduled to work , the carpool will come , and the Sim will get in unless the player cancels that action .
These vacation days will not be lost if they are not used while the new family member is a baby .
If another family member can stay home with the baby , the player may want to let the Sim go to work in order to save a leave day for later .
A Sim who gives birth to twins will change out of maternity wear after the first baby is born .
In The Sims 3 a little pop-up will say : " The baby is coming !
Make sure ( Sim ) is at home or in the hospital so she can have a safe and comfortable birth ! "
If the Sim goes to the hospital , the player wo n't be able to see anything , but can still hear the birth taking place .
If the father of the unborn child is on a different lot or at work when a Sim goes into labor , he will go to the hospital to be with the mother .
If the Sim stays at home , the Sim will turn on the spot , and the baby will be born there .
In The Sims 4 labor lasts several hours .
The Sim can continue to do things while in labor but will be continuously uncomfortable .
If the player bought a bassinet previously , the Sim will go to the bassinet to give birth when the time comes .
If they did n't or the Sim is blocked from accessing a bassinet , a bassinet will spawn spontaneously when the baby is born .
After the birth of the baby ( or babies ) , the player will then be able to name them .
In The Sims 3 , depending on how happy the mother was during her pregnancy , the player might be able to choose both traits for the baby , just one , or none at all .
Paid time off Edit
Pregnant Sims will get a few days off work as maternity leave .
In The Sims 2 , the days off are counted as calendar days ; the Sim is paid regardless of they were scheduled to work that day , so it is effectively bonus pay .
In addition , any vacation days the Sim had accumulated will not be used up while on maternity leave .
Sims can still choose to go to work by driving or walking [ TS2 : AL ] to work , and will receive their usual paycheck in addition to the bonus pay .
In The Sims 3 , the days off are counted as work days and not calendar days .
This means that a female astronaut Sim who gets pregnant winds up getting weeks off ( 27 days off ) in maternity leave due to there only being one working day a week .
In The Sims 4 , fathers will also get days off as " Family Leave " if they live on the same lot as the mother .
Multiple births Edit
See also : List of twins in The Sims series
The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 allows for the birth of both twins and triplets .
The Sims 2 only allows for twins , though there are third - party hacks which can produce triplets and quadruplets .
Some players have also had a glitch producing triplets in The Sims 2 and quadruplets in The Sims 4 .
Twins Edit
Twins are conceived the same way as single babies , so they will look about as much like each other as normal siblings do — from nearly identical to widely different .
With , for example , a light - skinned mother and dark - skinned father , the twins can have different skin colors .
However , some pre-made twins , such as the Pleasant twins , are identical ; and it's possible to simply make Sims that look identical in Create a Sim.
Create a Sim in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 has an option to create a twin , which creates an identical copy of a Sim .
Every pregnancy has a low chance of producing natural twins .
Most Sims have about a 10 % chance of having twins , although if a parent is a twin themselves , the chances increase slightly .
This is decided at the moment of conception , so , unlike gender and genetics , exiting and reloading the lot will not change the number of babies born .
However , with the Open for Business expansion pack for The Sims 2 , EA did include a " forcetwins " cheat ; using it when a pregnant Sim is selected will result in that Sim having twins .
If a pregnant Sim eats cheesecake , also added in Open for Business , they will have twins , as if the " forcetwins " cheat had been used while they were selected .
This is different from what is stated in the Prima guide for Open for Business ; the guide states that eating cheesecake while pregnant increases the chance of twins , not that it ensures them .
There was a myth that eating cheesecake prior to conception would increase the chance of having twins .
Whether or not this is what EA originally intended , it is not true . [ 3 ]
Enabling testingcheatsenabled and shift - clicking a pregnant woman allows the player to force twins by clicking on DEBUG : force twins .
Under normal circumstances , it is impossible to have triplets , quadruplets or more in The Sims 2 .
Players may download third - party hacks to obtain the option of having triplets or quadruplets .
When having triplets or quadruplets , the game informs players that the Sim in question has given birth to two babies , despite the actual number .
Players are still able to name each child , though , as the option pops up twice .
In The Sims 3 , a player can use the fertility treatment to get twin and triplets , but not quadruplets .
Players may download third - party hacks to obtain the option of having quadruplets .
In The Sims 4 , players can buy the " Fertile " trait from the satisfaction reward store to increase the chances of getting twins or triplets .
In City Living , players may also use the " On Ley Line " lot trait to boost the chances of conceiving twins .
Increasing Multiple Birth Odds Edit
The Sims 2
The cheat " forcetwins " will give the Sim a 100 % chance of twins .
A pregnant Sim can eat cheesecake , which gives a 100 % chance of twins .
[ TS2:OFB ]
The ultimate Lifetime Aspiration Benefit for Family Sims is Super Fertility , [ TS2 : FT ] which greatly increases the chance of having twins for the rewarded Sim and their spouse .
The benefit will decide the number of children born 25 hours after conception ( at the time of the first belly expansion ) .
, which greatly increases the chance of having twins for the rewarded Sim and their spouse .
The benefit will decide the number of children born 25 hours after conception ( at the time of the first belly expansion ) .
There is also a chance that twins will carry down in the family tree such as the case of Antonio Monty with his children as Antonio may , himself , be a twin to his deceased brother .
With the InSimenator , a player can buy the Reproductive Adjustor , which looks like a microwave oven .
If the player selects a pregnant Sim and clicks on the Reproductive Adjustor , one of the options will be to select the number of babies .
The Sims 3
Watching the kids channel on TV or listening to the children 's music station on the stereo can increase the chance of multiple children .
Doing either slightly increases the chance for multiples .
Doing both at the same time more than doubles the chances of having twins or triplets as either alone .
Reading the pregnancy book .
One or both parents can read it to have a better chance of outcome .
Having the " Fertility Treatment " lifetime reward .
Fertility Treatment makes it more likely that " Try For Baby " will work , and also increases chances of twins and triplets .
Sims can wish for Large Family from the genie and get the " Feeling Fertile " moodlet , which will give them twins or triplets when trying for baby .
[ TS3:ST ]
Sims can use the Procreation Elixir .

Stopping A Pregnancy Edit
The Sims Edit
There is no pregnancy in The Sims , but if a family is evicted while there is a baby in the house , the baby will be lost .
The Sims 2 Edit
Miscarriage per se does not occur in The Sims 2 , but if a pregnant Sim dies , the baby will effectively be lost , as in the case of Olivia Monty 's unborn baby .
Family members will not get a memory of losing the baby , only the Sim who died .
If the pregnant Sim is resurrected , their pregnancy will continue as normal .
The only exception to this is Olivia Monty , who lacks a pregnancy token and merely has the appearance of being pregnant .
If a pregnant Sim becomes an elder , the baby will be lost .
Normally , a Sim who is close enough to elder - hood for that to happen cannot become pregnant .
However , negative effects of drinking the Elixir of Life can age a pregnant Sim to the point where it becomes possible , or even move the Sim into the elder life stage .
In addition , there are hacks which can be used to end a pregnancy .
The InTeenimater Edit
With the InTeenimater , a mod for The Sims 2 , the player can make a miscarriage when a Sim is pregnant .
She will have a miscarriage in her memories .
The PlumbBob will glow red , and the Sim will start grasping for her stomach .
A thought bubble with a pacifier and a question mark will come up .
The Sim will then be in her normal clothes , and start crying .
The pregnancy may even end with a miscarriage ( autonomously ) , if the pregnant Sim 's motives are low , specifically hunger and energy .
The player may also choose an option known as " End Pregnancy " which will stop the pregnancy completely , meaning that the Sim will lose the baby but will have no emotional distress or memories of losing the baby .
The InSimenator Edit
With the InSimenator , a player can buy the Reproductive Adjustor , which looks like a microwave oven .
If the player selects a pregnant Sim and clicks on the Reproductive Adjustor , one of the options will be " Abort Pregnancy " .
Aborting a pregnancy sometimes makes the mother depressed .
Another option on the Reproductive Adjustor is " Suspend Pregnancy " , which will pause the pregnancy until the Reproductive Adjustor is used to resume it .
The Sims 3 Edit
In The Sims 3 , it is not possible for a pregnant Sim to lose the baby , without any cheats .
In The Sims 3 , if a Sim is impregnated or turns pregnant before becoming an elder , the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born .
It also appears that pregnant Sims in The Sims 3 cannot die , and will avoid or survive events that would normally result in death , even if those events are arranged by the player .
Sims who have successfully conceived , but have n't realized they are pregnant , cannot die as well .
There are many mods that will stop a pregnancy , however most of them do n't have any negative effects on the Sim .
If the player clicks on the pregnancy moodlet while pressing the Ctrl key with testingcheatsenabled on , it will not stop the pregnancy but simply deny the mother a happy moodlet during her entire pregnancy .
If this happens to the " Baby Is Coming ! " moodlet , the mother will remain pregnant but never give birth until the game is restarted .
In several pregnancy mods , there are varying " End Pregnancy " options , some giving moodlets such as " Broken Heart " or " Strained " .
Increasing Specific Gender Odds Edit
The Sims 2 Edit
There is currently no definitely known way to influence the gender of an unborn child in The Sims 2 .
The only way to change the outcome is if the player saves while the mother is going through the labor animation , ( or any time during pregnancy ) before the " new baby on the way " popup comes up and the birth cutscene begins .
If , after the birth , the baby is not the desired gender , the player can exit the lot without saving and go through the sequence again ; this can be repeated until the baby is the desired gender .
Since the chance of getting either gender is about 50 % , this can take any number of tries to succeed .
No Maxis cheat or fan - made hack exists to force a gender , though there have been many rumors , none of which are true .
These include a fake " boolprop force [ gender ] 100 " or the " twinsr2cute " cheats .
Another rumor is that if a pregnant Sim eats gelatin it will increase the chance for a girl .
It has also been rumored that the baby will be a boy if the father initiates the " Try For Baby " action , and will be a girl if the mother initiates it .
However , this has been disproven .
Making a Sim pregnant by themselves using the Tombstone of Life and Death will result in a baby that is always the opposite gender of the Sim giving birth .
The Sims 3 Edit
In The Sims 3 , there are ways to increase the chance of having male or female babies .
Eating 3 or more apples during the pregnancy in each trimester will greatly increase the chances for the baby being a boy , while 3 or more watermelons during each trimester will greatly increase the odds of having a girl .
If the Sim is carrying twins or triplets , there is still a chance that both boys and girls will be born .
Also , if a mother asks a Level 5 Medical Career Sim for the gender and eats the fruit for the opposite gender ( e.g. hears from the Medical Sim that she 's pregnant with a boy and then eats watermelon ) there is a possible chance for fraternal twins born with different genders .[ confirmation needed ]
Patch 1.3 of The Sims 3 keeps the apples for boys , watermelons for girls system , however eating these in prepared foods will not affect the gender .
For example , watermelon pancakes will not increase the chances for a girl .
There are many mods that allow the players to choose a baby 's gender or tweak the chances in one direction or the other , but these mods all have their own rules and may not be subject to information given here .
The Sims 4 Edit
Patch 17 introduced a method for influencing the gender of offspring .
Eating strawberries or listening to pop music will increase odds for having a girl , while eating carrots or listening to alternative music increases the likelihood of having a boy .
This does not affect babies conceived via alien abduction , however .
Pets Edit
Main article : Breeding
Like Sims , female pets are able to become pregnant and give birth .
Pets , like Sims , cannot become pregnant per se .
However , if a male and female pet have a good relationship , they can " snuggle " , which can lead to the player being asked whether or not they should have a kitten / puppy .
Once the kitten / puppy is born , there will be a small box with a sheet over it near the mother , and the Sim(s ) will " welcome " it by clapping at it .
The kitten / puppy cannot be fed or played with , only viewed by Sims ( while pets watch it ) , so when it comes to taking care of it , the player has to make sure the mother is doing okay .
If not , then animal control will come to take the kitten / puppy away .
After 3
Sim days , the kitten / puppy becomes fully grown .
Pets born in - game have no personality points .
In The Sims 2 , a Sim can command a pet to WooHoo in a large pet house with another pet of the opposite gender , provided that the Sim has a good relationship with the pet being commanded and the two pets have a good relationship with each other .
The female pet will be pregnant for two to four days , and then has the kittens / puppies .
Kittens and puppies in The Sims 2 can do things , and Sims can interact with them , unlike in Unleashed .
Kittens and puppies cannot get jobs nor learn commands , but they can learn behaviors .
Pet pregnancy in The Sims 3 is mostly the same as in The Sims 2 , with the exception of horses , as they are a new addition .
Horses can breed in a box stall or be taken to the equestrian center and bred with a horse of the player 's choosing .
There is also a lifetime reward available for all cats and dogs that will increase the number of kittens or puppies that they have at once .
Like previous games , pets can attempt to try for kittens or puppies .
Pets will get moodlets depending on whether they succeeded or not .
A notification will appear if the pets become pregnant ; however , the notification may sometimes appear even if the WooHoo was not successful .
Pregnancy lasts around one Sim day .

Other Edit
In The Sims 2 , a visibly pregnant Sim can get a job , but the " new job " pop -up notice will say that the Sim should not start work until after the baby is born .
The Sim will not receive paid maternity leave for this time , but will otherwise be treated as a Sim on maternity leave .

Pregnant Sims experience nausea and backaches , shown as negative moodlets .
[ TS3 ]
Fulfilling a pregnant Sim's wishes improves the chances of a " happy " pregnancy , which will give the child better traits or even allow the player to select the traits .
If a pregnant Sim and the father read pregnancy books the chances of a " happy " pregnancy improve , in addition to the improvement given by any wants the Sim may have to do so .
[ TS3 ]
A Sim in the medical career ( level 5 or above ) can " Determine the Gender of Baby " of the pregnant Sim and can " Give Medical Advice " .
Clicking on the hospital allows the interaction " Get Medical Advice " .
They will enter the hospital and then come out after a while .
This option is not available with Sims that are not pregnant . [

Player tips Edit
Speed up pregnancy with the Tombstone of Life and Death and it will take about three Sim hours ( minutes in real time if at speed 1 ) for the baby to be born .
[ TS2 ]
You can save your game before a Sim gives birth and then exit and reload if you want to try getting a baby of a different gender .
This may not work however if the player saves the game too late , because the game may already have confirmed the baby 's gender by that time .
[ TS2 ] [ TS3 ]
The quickest and easiest way to get a female Sim pregnant is by making her tour the Theater with her spouse / boyfriend .
Once they are inside click the option " Try for Baby Backstage " and " WooHoo Backstage " .
There is the rare occasion of which the couple will be caught and thrown out .
This is the best way to get your Sims pregnant because there is no flirting and kissing , so it does n't take as long .

Al Snyder 's son died in Iraq in May of 2006 .
Members of the rabidly anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church picketed his son Matthew 's funeral , causing immense personal , emotional pain for him , his family and their friends .
Snyder won a $ 5 million civil lawsuit against the church and the Phelps family , but it was recently tossed out of a federal court .
To add insult to injury , the court has now ordered Snyder to pay all of the church 's legal fees :
BALTIMORE — Lawyers for the father of a Marine who died in Iraq say a court has ordered him to pay legal costs for the anti-gay protesters who picketed his son's funeral .
The protesters are led by Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church .
Albert Snyder of York , Pa. , had won a $ 5 million verdict against Phelps , but it was thrown out on appeal .
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed earlier this month to consider whether the protesters ' provocative messages , which include phrases like " Thank God for dead soldiers , " are protected by the First Amendment .
Lawyers say Snyder already is struggling to come up with the fees associated with filing the brief with the high court .
Read on ...
I really hate to waste Mr. Amato 's bandwidth on these despicable people , but Mr. Snyder needs our moral support as well as help with legal costs .
I hope he does n't pay one thin dime to these people , but he 'll need lawyers to help continue the fight .

Suppose you ’re proofreading a book .
If you ’ve read 20 pages and found 7 typos , you might reasonably estimate that the chances of a page having a typo are 7/20 .
But what if you ’ve read 20 pages and found no typos .
Are you willing to conclude that the chances of a page having a typo are 0/20 , i.e. the book has absolutely no typos ?
To take another example , suppose you are testing children for perfect pitch .
You ’ve tested 100 children so far and have n’t found any with perfect pitch .
Do you conclude that children do n’t have perfect pitch ?
You know that some do because you ’ve heard of instances before .
Your data suggest perfect pitch in children is at least rare .
But how rare ?
The rule of three gives a quick and dirty way to estimate these kinds of probabilities .
It says that if you ’ve tested N cases and have n’t found what you ’re looking for , a reasonable estimate is that the probability is less than 3/N .
So in our proofreading example , if you have n’t found any typos in 20 pages , you could estimate that the probability of a page having a typo is less than 15 % .
In the perfect pitch example , you could conclude that fewer than 3 % of children have perfect pitch .
Note that the rule of three says that your probability estimate goes down in proportion to the number of cases you ’ve studied .
If you ’d read 200 pages without finding a typo , your estimate would drop from 15 % to 1.5 % .
But it does n’t suddenly drop to zero .
I imagine most people would harbor a suspicion that that there may be typos even though they have n’t seen any in the first few pages .
But at some point they might say “ I ’ve read so many pages without finding any errors , there must not be any . ”
The situation is a little different with the perfect pitch example , however , because you may know before you start that the probability cannot be zero .
If the sight of math makes you squeamish , you might want to stop reading now .
Just remember that if you have n’t seen something happen in N observations , a good estimate is that the chances of it happening are less than 3/N .
What makes the rule of three work ?
Suppose the probability of what you ’re looking for is p .
If we want a 95 % confidence interval , we want to find the largest p so that the probability of no successes out of n trials is 0.05 , i.e. we want to solve ( 1 - p ) n = 0.05 for p.
Taking logs of both sides , n log ( 1 - p ) = log( 0.05 ) ≈ - 3 . Since log ( 1 - p ) is approximately –p for small values of p , we have p ≈ 3/n .
The derivation above gives the frequentist perspective .
I ’ll now give the Bayesian derivation of the same result .
Then you can say “ p is probably less than 3/N ” in clear conscience since Bayesians are allowed to make such statements .
Suppose you start with a uniform prior on p .
The posterior distribution on p after having seen 0 successes and N failures has a beta ( 1 , N+1 ) distribution .
If you calculate the posterior probability of p being less than 3 / N you get an expression that approaches 1 – exp ( - 3 ) as N gets large , and 1 – exp ( - 3 ) ≈ 0.95 .

In the Unite 2009 conference keynote we promised you that Unity would be picking up speed , and it has : Unity has become a powerhouse in the game industry and beyond .
Nobody else is as active in democratizing sweet game technology to as many developers , and enabling them to target as many consumers .
Unity has been used by well over 100,000 developers of all shapes and sizes to create thousands of games and other interactive 3D content that has touched over 40 million people .
We ’re moving fast .
Our engineering team now consists of 36 people ( up from some 12 or so a year ago ) , and they are firing on all cylinders .
We ’ve continually released major updates with tons of features over the last years .
We also started working on an Xbox 360 port , and recently blogged that our iPhone team is working on iPad support .
But those teams are just a handful of our people !
So what else have we been up to ?
Thousands of code check ins have been done , many subsystems reworked , leading technologies integrated in Unity , and a massive automated testing suite implemented so that we can move as fast as we can .
In fact , here ’s a historical graph of our code checkins :
Until today it was all hush - hush , but now we ’re finally ready to announce our plans .
Let it be known : for the last year we ’ve been working on the next major release : the uber-cool Unity 3 : unity3d.com/unity/coming-soon/unity-3
So far the only time frame we ’ve promised is “ summer 2010 ″ , but we ’ll be giving early beta access – and a discount – to anyone who pre-orders .
Also , we ’ve just announced that Unity will add support for iPad , Android , Xbox 360 , and PS3 !
That ’s the kind of “ author once , deploy anywhere ” that has remained a developer ’s wet dream for years .
And not just from “ one codebase ” , but from one heck of a unified and polished IDE paired with the industry ’s best asset pipeline !
I hope you ’ll stick around with us , we ’re only just getting started !
PS .
Because we ’re unifying the core Unity products with Unity iPhone ( and all the other deployment targets too ) the upgrade rules are a bit complicated and we have n’t done the best job at explaining them .
We are working on this , please bear with us as we are inundated with questions – we will sort this all out and make it as clear as it can be in the near future .

Update 12 March .
Six more dimwits signed .
An‘early day motion1 ( EDM 908 ) has been tabled in parliament which opposes the conclusions of the science and technology committee report on the evidence for homeopathy .
After two weeks it has been signed by an amazing 55 MPs .
That is 8.5 % of all 646 MPs .
Nothing shows more clearly the scientific illiteracy that prevails in the House of Commons ( and , perhaps , the results of the mass mailing of MPs by homeopaths , who are clutching at straws ) ..
These MPs are all people who have difficulty with the idea that pills which contain nothing can have no effect above placebo .
It is n’t rocket science .
Those of us who spend quite a lot of unpaid time trying to communicate the joy of science to the public , rather resent having our efforts undermined by these members of parliament .
But at least we now have a handy list of them .
In case this seems a bit harsh , it is only necessary to point out that the EDM was tabled by David Treddinick ( Cons , Bosworth ) .
Mr Treddinick is renowned as the most extreme advocate of magic medicine
in the House of Commons .
The EDM twists and distorts the evidence in exactly the way the committee ’s report condemned so sternly .
Nothing is too barmy for Treddinick to espouse .
His education at Eton and Oxford has led him to advocate homeopathic borax for the treatment of foot and mouth disease , and he has backed homeopathic treatment of AIDS and malaria .
He is a major danger to public health .
By way of background , Tredinnick was suspended for a month without pay for taking a £ 1000 bribe in the cash for questions scandal .
And he was again in trouble during the expenses scandal .
It was reported that
“ The MP for Bosworth struck a deal with the parliamentary standards commissioner to pay back the £ 755 which he claimed for a computer programme that states it can help users to predict their health via the stars . ”
Yes , really , astrology !
You could n’t make it up .
One would think that , with a reputation like this , nobody with half a brain would want to sign an EDM proposed by Treddinick .
Well , not so .
The list of signatories is amazing , and shocking .
The state of the parties is interesting .
Unionists ( Northern Ireland ) : no fewer than 77 % ( 7 out of 9 MPs ) signed , including the infamous Ian Paisley and the recently famous Peter Robinson .
Disheartening though this is , perhaps it is n’t so surprising from a group noted for religious belief , and consequently predisposed to believing things that are n’t true .
The seriously sad thing is that second place in the stupid race is held by – wait for it – the Liberal Democrats , with 15.9 % ( 10 of their 63 MPs ) .
That is tragic in the light of the fact that two of the very few MPs in the House with any appreciation of evidence are also Lib Dems , Phil Willis and Evan Harris ( both on the Science and Technology Committee ) .
After them Conservatives with 8.3 % ( 16 out of 193 ) , and the best is Labour 5.8 % ( 20 out of 346 MPs )
Here is the roll of shame , updated on 12 March ( the last six signed in the last 24 hours )
Tredinnick , David Con Simpson , Alan Lab Russell , Bob LibDem Pound , Stephen Lab Dismore , Andrew Lab Simpson , David Democratic unionist McDonnell , John Lab Campbell , Gregory Democratic unionist Cohen , Harry Lab Corbyn , Jeremy Lab Drew , David Lab Gray , James Con Hancock , Mike LibDem Hermon , Lady Ulster unionist Key , Robert Con Hemming , John LibDem Bone , Peter Con Davies , Dai Independent Mates , Michael Con Dodds , Nigel Democratic unionist Wyatt , Derek Lab Sarwar , Mohammad Lab Hamilton , Fabian Lab Winterton , Nicholas Con Davies , Philip Con Leigh , Edward Con Barlow , Celia Lab Ellwood , Tobias Con Leech , John Lib Dem Main , Anne Lab Robinson , Peter Democratic unionist McCrea , Dr William Democratic unionist Paisley , Ian Democratic unionist Brady , Graham Con Cook , Frank Lab Hall , Patrick Lab Binley , Brian Con Pugh , John Lib dem Davey , Edward Lib dem Weir , Mike Scottish Nationalist Sharma , Virendra Kumar Lab Abbott , Diane Lab Williams , Mark Lib dem Horam , John Con Widdecombe , Ann Con Browne , Jeremy Lib dem Spicer , Michael Con Maclean , David Con McCafferty , Chris Lab Buck , Karen Lab George , Andrew Lib Dem Vis , Rudi Lab Walter , Robert Lab Whittingdale , John Con Farron , Timothy Lib Dem
I have n’t contacted most of these MPs , and of those I have only two have replied .
I had a rather curt reply from one of the most surprising signatories ( John Hemming , who was a Scholar in Theoretical , Atomic and Nuclear Physics at Magdalen College , Oxford .
Mark Twain ’s letter
Thanks to @Count_Stuff on Twitter for reminding me about
a letter written in 1905 by Mark Twain .
It refers to an Elixir of Life .
By curious coincidence this popped up a week after I saw Donizetti’s L’Elisir d’Amore at ENO ( and a couple of days after I bumped into its producer , Jonathan Miller , in the RADA café ) .
I ’d love to quote Kelly Rourke ’s witty translation of the quack ’s song , but ca n’t find the libretto .

You ’re an idiot of the 33rd degree
In November of 1905 , an enraged Mark Twain sent this superb letter to J. H. Todd , a patent medicine salesman who had just attempted to sell bogus medicine to the author by way of a letter and leaflet delivered to his home .
Nov. 20 . 1905 J. H. Todd
1212 Webster St .
San Francisco , Cal. Dear Sir ,
Your letter is an insoluble puzzle to me .
The handwriting is good and exhibits considerable character , and there are even traces of intelligence in what you say , yet the letter and the accompanying advertisements profess to be the work of the same hand .
The person who wrote the advertisements is without doubt the most ignorant person now alive on the planet ; also without doubt he is an idiot , an idiot of the 33rd degree , and scion of an ancestral procession of idiots stretching back to the Missing Link .
It puzzles me to make out how the same hand could have constructed your letter and your advertisements .
Puzzles fret me , puzzles annoy me , puzzles exasperate me ; and always , for a moment , they arouse in me an unkind state of mind toward the person who has puzzled me .
A few moments from now my resentment will have faded and passed and I shall probably even be praying for you ; but while there is yet time I hasten to wish that you may take a dose of your own poison by mistake , and enter swiftly into the damnation which you and all other patent medicine assassins have so remorselessly earned and do so richly deserve .
Adieu , adieu , adieu !

Lyle Langlois makes 80 look like the new 40 .
Truth is , the soon - to - be octogenarian has been running circles around men less than half his age for years .

Enlarge Lynn DeBruin Lyle Langlois , with his wife Kay , has accomplished some incredible athletic achievements .
The retired computer professor ( Glendale College ) from Arizona , who has a second home in Colorado , has run a marathon in every state , completed an Ironman , bicycled across the country four times , and in mid-March attained yet another goal -- finishing 100 races between ages 70 and 80 , including about 30 triathlons .
He 's already bicycled the circumference of New Zealand 's South Island , run around the Sea of Galilee and ascended 14,110 - foot Pikes Peak in Colorado seven times .
That 's where he 'll celebrate the big 8 - 0 in June , ascending to a bed - and - breakfast at 10,200 feet with a legion of family and friends .
Right there with him will be third wife Kay Martin , who stole his heart when he saw the petite , gray - haired lady cross- training via what athletes call " the brick : " biking then running in the same workout .
" It 's like the chicken and the egg .
Do we do it because we 're healthy or are we healthy because we do it ?
I do n't know which , but it works , " said the Kansas - born Langlois , who is seven years older than Martin .
The couple most recently backpacked together up Machu Picchu in Peru ( country No. 64 on his list ) and hiked halfway up the Matterhorn .
In April , they are headed back to Costa Rica for a zip - line adventure .
Tan and fit , with a ready smile and a quick wit , Langlois knows how to live life to the fullest .
He was creating bucket lists before the term was even coined .
One of his first involved riding all the subways of the world -- a quest that has taken him from Hong Kong to Cairo , but still has plenty of stops left to make .
Another was to finish a marathon in all 50 states -- a goal he accomplished in Burlington , Vt. , at age 70 .
To this day , Langlois still counts qualifying for the Boston Marathon as one of his greatest accomplishments , right up there with being married for 42 years and setting up small trusts for each of his 13 grandchildren .
" If I ever write my memoirs , the opening line will be , ' I took three wives to Africa ' -- in different decades of course , " he quipped .

Enlarge Lynn DeBruin Langlois is still looking for mountains to climb as he prepares to turn 80 .
Widowed after 42 years , Langlois remarried in 1997 to a vivacious woman he met while bicycling in Phoenix .
Her life ended tragically in 2002 after she was hit by a motor scooter while biking in Vietnam during one of their many adventures .
Though he had lost a soul mate , he kept riding and racing , and eventually met Martin , leaving his number on her windshield after a workout several years ago .
Martin , a former nun but also a widow , jokes that she finally found a man who could keep up with her .
So far , they 've met each other 's challenges .
They 've done the Milford Trek in New Zealand , the bike - and - barge in Amsterdam , and together backpacked the last 300 miles of the Pacific Coast Trail -- completing what has been a 22 - year , 3,000 - mile quest for Langlois .
Ironically , Langlois failed his first racing goal , when at age 50 he tried to complete a marathon in Honolulu in less than four hours .
A year later , in a Tucson marathon , it was mission accomplished .
Not bad for a guy who started this wild journey the year he turned 50 , running a mile a day every day in January , then two miles a day every day in February , three in March and four in April , until he was ready to give marathon races a shot .
Some think he 's crazy , but others are inspired .
Recently , he raised some eyebrows when he walked into a Colorado bike shop and picked out his 80th birthday present -- an 18 - pound carbon fiber road bike .
" It 's nice , " Martin said .
" But he is n't going to be able to beat me . "

Venus and Earth have long been thought of as sister planets .
Given its similar size and proximity to Earth in the inner Solar System , Venus might seem like a promising candidate for having a surface that evolves through a tectonic process similar to what occurs on Earth , where rigid plates slowly shift across the underlying mantle .
But a recent analysis by Peter James , a graduate student in the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , highlights the fact that Earth ’s plate tectonics seem to be the exception rather than the rule for rocky planets like Venus , Mars and Mercury .
James provides new evidence that the generation and recycling of the surface on Venus occurs through a process that is actually quite different from what happens on Earth .
His finding supports a theory that first arose in the early 1990s , when NASA ’s Magellan spacecraft orbited Venus and took radar images of the planet ’s surface .
Before Magellan , most scientists assumed that the surface of Venus was influenced by some form of plate tectonics or volcanism .
The Magellan images revealed a distribution of craters that suggest that most of Venus ’ surface was formed around the same time — about 500 million years ago , which is young considering that the planet ’s age is estimated at about 4.6 billion years .
As a result of this uniform age of the surface , scientists hypothesized that the Venus surface is not made of moving plates like Earth , nor is it inactive like the moon .
Instead it evolves through a periodic resurfacing process , possibly caused by volcanic activity .
Probing the crust
Geologists study features of a planet ’s crust , such as its thickness and composition , for clues about that planet ’s history .
These clues shed light on the physical processes that made the crust , which is usually produced by partial melting of mantle material .
To study Venus ’ crust , James used gravity and topography data collected by Magellan between 1990 and 1994 .
Analyzing these data , James mapped the thickness of the planet ’s crust , which he calculated to be about 30 kilometers ( Earth ’s is about 20 kilometers , on average ) .
He could identify regions where Venus ’ convecting mantle is pushing or pulling on its crust as the planet cools .
While these results provide a better picture of the Venus crust , what is most compelling about the analysis , which James presented on March 1 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference , is the discovery that there are no large mass concentrations , or “ mascons , ” buried beneath the surface of Venus .
Existing on Mars and the moon , mascons are gravity anomalies that correspond to large craters and basins created billions of years ago by massive impacts from large meteoroids .
These mascons exert a slightly stronger gravitational pull — detected by spacecraft or satellites — than that of a smooth surface .
While the process of mascon formation is not well understood , James explained that the extra gravitational pull likely comes from two sources : dense rock in the craters from volcanic flow and the placement of denser mantle material near the surface .
James expected to find remnants of these crustal structures on Venus , given that they are prominent features on Mars and the moon .
He believes that the absence of mascons is consistent with the idea that the Venus surface experienced some sort of “ catastrophic overturning ” at least 500 million years ago .
“ If the mascons were erased in the event 500 million years ago , that would require a mechanism that more thoroughly reworks the crust , ” he explained .
Brown University geologist Marc Parmentier agreed with James that the lack of mascons indicates that some sort of mechanism — perhaps large - scale volcanic activity — periodically creates a new surface on Venus .
He praised the analysis for ensuring that research about Venus remains an active area in planetary science , which is currently heavily focused on Mars and the moon .
“ His work lets us continue to address one of the questions of Venus , which is how this so - called resurfacing process took place , ” he said .
James hopes to address this question in future research by using more finite element modeling to understand how mascons are formed and evolve .
He said that NASA ’s upcoming GRAIL mission to the moon will gather unprecedented gravity data that will provide some basis for comparing the lunar and Venus crusts .

Der Balken im Auge Peter Mühlbauer
Die Zensur durch die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " ist weniger sichtbar , aber umfassender als die Zensur durch traditionelle Religionen
Das Feuilleton setzte im Karikaturenstreit den " Westen " mit Presse - und Meinungsfreiheit gleich , die es durch den Islam bedroht sah .
Dabei blieb auffällig ausgeblendet , dass es auch in dem was Huntington1 die westliche Zivilisation nennt eine weniger sichtbare aber weitaus umfassendere systemeigene Zensur gibt .
Würden Moslems ihren Propheten als Markenzeichen eintragen , hätten sie gute Chancen , die Karikaturen sofort und fast überall qua WTO und andere internationale Organe zu unterbinden .
Scientologen begriffen diesen Effekt eher : 1995 konnte die Church of Scientology wegen einer von ihr als Verletzung des Urheberrechts eingestuften Weitergabe von religiösen " Geheimnissen " in Scientology - kritischen Newsgroups die Herausgabe des Namens eines Benutzers eines anonymen Remailers in Finnland erzwingen und leitete damit das Ende das Mythos vom unzensierbaren Internet ein2 .
Nun wird sich mancher fragen ob eine 1436 Jahre alte Figur nicht gemeinfrei sein sollte .
Doch erstens gibt es neben dem Urheber - auch noch das Markenrecht , und zweitens schützt Alter vor Monopolrechten nicht , wie jüngst wieder am Fall der " Himmelsscheibe von Nebra " deutlich wurde , auf die das Magdeburger Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Monopolrechte beansprucht .
Die etwa 3600 Jahre alte Bronzescheibe , wegen der die Verlage Piper und Heyne vor Gericht stehen , weil sie sie stilisiert auf Buchdeckeln darstellten , ist nur ein Beispiel dafür dass auch ältere Kulturgüter mit ein bisschen argumentativem Aufwand und eifrigen Anwälten der Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " unterworfen werden können .
Gerade das Markenrecht , das eigentlich den Konsumenten schützen soll , entwickelte sich zu einer Hochburg der Zensur .
Medienkonzerne benutzten erfinderische Anwendungen um sich Exklusivrechte auf alles von Spocks Ohren bis hin zum Supermann - Cape zu sichern3 .
So konnte unter anderem eine geplante schwule Olympiade in San Francisco aus Markenrechtsgründen verboten werden - " möglicherweise auf Grundlage der Theorie dass den Traditionen der alten Griechen nichts ferner sein könne als Homosexualität " wie James Boyle süffisant anmerkte4 .
Die Pasdaran des Westens
Die Macht der Religion von " Geistigen Eigentum " sorgt dafür , dass Anwälte die Meinungsfreiheit im Westen wesentlich umfassender einschränken , als dies die Mullahs fordern .
Kaum jemand stößt bei seiner täglichen Arbeit so an die Beleidigungsgrenzen traditioneller Religionen , dass er Repressalien fürchten müsste .
Wer jedoch eine Website betreibt , Software schreibt , Musik macht , sich einen Loginnamen bei eBay zulegt oder einfach nur in einem Forum postet ist jeden Tag den Zensurangriffen jener ausgesetzt , die in der Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " den Pasdaran in Iran entsprechen .
Medienkonzerne wie Time Warner gingen gegen minderjährige Fans vor , die nichts anderes verbrochen hatten , als Fanseiten ihrer Lieblinge zu betreiben5 .
Der Fernsehsender
Fox verlangte von einer Fanseitenbetreiberin nicht nur , dass sie aufhören solle , Figuren zu zeichnen , an denen er Markenrechte beanspruchte , sondern forderte auch noch , dass sie sämtliche Speichermedien mit " all related art work or any other materials at hand " herausgeben solle - ebenso wie Namen und Adressen aller Personen welche die Zeichnungen heruntergeladen hatten6 .
Besonders effektive Mittel der Zensur sind Cease - and - Desist - Aufforderungen nach dem amerikanischen DMCA : Dieser hält auch die Mittler von Informationen für potentielle Copyrightverletzungen verantwortlich , solange sie die Information nicht sofort nach einem Hinweis herausnehmen oder sperren7 .
Würden sich die Mullahs auf den DMCA berufen , könnten sie mit einer Aufforderung von einem Hotmail - Account binnen drei Stunden die Karikaturen von 70 % der Server ohne Prüfung der Rechtmäßigkeit entfernen lassen , wie ein Test der Bürgerrechtsgruppe Bits of Freedom nahe legt8 .
Ein Klima der Selbstzensur
Zensur geschieht auch über ein Klima der Überwachung und der Angst das die Abmahnungen , Klagen und Gesetzesänderungen schaffen .
Hier findet sich die von der dänischen Zeitung Jyllands - Posten beklagte Selbstzensur in weitaus größerem Ausmaß statt als anderswo .
Im allgemeinen schrecken Privatleute , auch wenn sie sich im Recht fühlen , vor langwierigen und kostspieligen juristischen Verfahren zurückt - ein Effekt der unter Firmenanwälten bekannt ist und ausgenutzt wird .
Sie mahnen ab , drohen und klagen , auch wenn die Rechtslage für ihr Begehr nicht ausreicht .
2002 etwa " warnte " Hewlett - Packard unter Berufung auf den DMCA die Sicherheitsspezialisten SnoSoft davor , Sicherheitslücken im HP - UX zu veröffentlichen ( vgl. Gamespy droht mit US - Copyright - Gesetz ) .
Ein anderes Beispiel ist das Phänomen der sogenannten SLAPP Suits ( " strategic lawsuits against public participation " ) .
In ihnen werden Kritiker von Untenehmen in den Ruin geklagt - dabei kommt es nicht auf Erfolgsaussichten an , sondern nur auf die Dauer ( und damit auf die Kosten ) des Prozesses9 .
Neben Verleumdungsklagen wurden seit den 1990er Jahren auch Urheberrechts - SLAPPs immer beliebter .
Technologieverbote statt Bilderverbote
Technologieverbote , wie sie die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " im amerikanischen DMCA und in der Europäischen Urheberrechtsrichtlinie durchsetzen konnte , sind wesentlich einschneidendere Maßnahmen als etwa ein Bilderverbot - man stelle sich nur einmal vor was wäre , wenn die " Mullahs " ein Verbot von Photoshop , Gimp und von Malstiften in Europa fordern würden .
Und nicht zu vergessen natürlich das Weitersagen , wie man zeichnet :
So wie es im amerikanischen und im EU - Urheberrecht festgelegt ist , was der - in dieser Hinsicht - " kulturfremde " Dmitry Sklyarov schmerzlich am eigenen Leib erfahren musste : Der Russe hatte in einem Vortrag in den USA vorgeführt , wie simpel sich der Kopierschutz von Adobes eBook Reader umgehen lässt .
Daraufhin wurde er auf Veranlassung von Adobe inhaftiert und erst nach massiven Protesten und Boykott - Aufrufen wieder freigelassen .
Die Zustände im Zeitalter von bestehenden Technologieverboten und dräuenden Softwarepatenten werden mittlerweile von vielen Programmierern ähnlich denen empfunden , die Samuel Pepys im England des 17 .
Jahrhunderts beschreibt : " it [ is ] very unsafe at this time to write , or almost do any thing " 10 .
Deshalb führt die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " - wie andere Religionen auch - zu Vertreibungseffekten : Deutsche DVD - Produzenten gehen nicht vorwiegend wegen Steuern oder gar Lohnnebenkosten ins benachbarte Osteuropa , sondern wegen mehr Rechtssicherheit - weil osteuropäische Länder nicht den Standortnachteil Abmahnrecht aufweisen .
Eine Abmahnung kann in Deutschland weitaus mehr kosten als anderswo ein Gerichtsprozess und sie kann jeden treffen .
Täglich .
Leute , die ahnungslos einen Login - Namen wählten , den sich eine Firma schützen ließ ( vgl. Abmahnen im Cartier - Stil ) , Links auf kostenlose Stadtpläne setzte ( vgl. Ihr Weg zu uns ... erer Abmahnung ) oder alte CDs auf eBay versteigerten , deren Programme mittlerweile einem Technologieverbot zum Opfer fielen ( vgl. Teurer Spaß ) .
Deutschland ist durch dieses Abmahnrecht und durch den mangelnden Schutz vor Hausdurchsuchungen bei der Durchsetzung der Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " die rigideste Nation der Welt - weitaus rigider noch als die USA , was sich etwa am Beispiel von Regionalcodehelfern zeigt .
Eine Software wie DVD Region
Free wurde überall auf der
Welt frei verkauft - außer in Deutschland .
Die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum "
Die Anwendung des Religionsbegriffs auf das Phänomen " Geistiges Eigentum " ist keine Metapher , sondern nur der konsequente Gebrauch eines funktionalistischen Religionsbegriffs .
Allgemein wird Religion als ein " System von Vorstellungen über die Existenz von Gegebenheiten jenseits des sinnlich Erfahrbaren " definiert .
Solch ein System formuliert nach Clifford Geertz Ideen einer allgemeinen Seinsordnung und umgibt sich mit einer " Aura von Faktizität " :
Die Vorstellung von der
Welt wird zum Abbild der tatsächlichen Gegebenheiten einer Lebensform . [...]
Religion stimmt demnach menschliche Handlungen auf eine vorgestellte [...]
Ordnung ab .
Die ethischen [...]
Präferenzen der Kultur werden dadurch objektiviert und erscheinen als Notwendigkeit , die von einer bestimmten Struktur der Welt erzeugt wird .
Das heißt , dass die Gläubigen eine Religion nicht als solche wahrnehmen müssen .
Im Gegenteil : Je selbstverständlicher Glaube , Riten und Regeln im Alltag erscheinen , desto mehr entspricht sie der obigen Definition aus der Völkerkunde .
Traditionelle Religionen und die vom " Geistigen Eigentum " ähneln sich teilweise verblüffend in ihren Glaubensvorstellungen .
Viele Religionen möchten Menschen etwas glauben machen was für Außenstehende oft dem gesunden Menschenverstand widerspricht : Etwa , dass eine mit Allmacht ausgestattete Entität Wert darauf legt , dass man Quasten an seinen Gewändern befestigt ; oder dass die Nennung eines bestimmten Namens verboten ist und dass nur Auserwählte mit einer bestimmten " Lizenz " dies dürfen - wie bei der Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " .
Noch stärker ist die Ähnlichkeit bei Basalreligionen .
Ein von Marcel Mauss behandeltes Phänomen erinnert stark an die DRM - und Lizenzökonomie des beginnenden 21 .
Jahrhunderts : Bei den Toradja auf Sulawesi herrschte die Vorstellung , dass bestimmte Gegenstände nicht wirklich ihrem Besitzer gehören , sondern in Wirklichkeit Geistern , von denen er jeweils das Recht " kaufen " muss , wenn er es gebraucht11 .
Protestantismus - ein nicht lizenzierter Remix des Katholizismus
Ähnlich wie bei der Natur der Lehre von " Geistigen Eigentum " ein blinder Fleck vorliegt , lag er beim Phänomen Zensur lange Zeit vor , wenn diese nicht von Nationalstaaten , sondern von Unternehmen initiiert wurde12 .
Das änderte sich erst zu Anfang dieses Jahrzehnts mit dem Sichtbarwerden zahlreicher privater Zensurinitiativen vor allem der Medienindustrie13 .
Tatsächlich ist diese Form der Zensur auch keine reine Privatzensur , sondern vielmehr eine " Achse " mit dem Staat als willfährigem Gesetzgeber und als Sanktionsmacht14 .
Eine Lösung für diese Zensurprobleme läge möglicherweise ebenfalls im Bereich der Religionsrechts : Artikel 4 des Grundgesetzes , der die Religionsfreiheit regelt , könnte anhand eines funktionalistischen Religionsbegriffs der Realität angepasst werden .
Aus der Religionsfreiheit würde so eine allgemeine Informationsfreiheit .
Sie ist der Kern der Religionsfreiheit : Der Protestantismus war im Grunde nichts anderes als ein nicht lizenzierter Remix des Katholizismus .
Der Zugang zu den geheimen , lateinischen und Priestern vorbehaltenen Texten wurde durch Luthers Übersetzung aufgebrochen , spätere Reformatoren und Religionsgründer änderten auch die Botschaft , bedienten sich im Fundus , zitierten und setzten neu zusammen : " Rip , Mix & Burn " .
( Peter Mühlbauer )
( Natural News ) Elderly dementia patients are being subjected to " scandalous abuse " by being drugged with dangerous antipsychotic drugs , according to a letter by ten influential health organizations , published in " [ One hundred thousand ] people with dementia in care homes are being inappropriately prescribed a damaging chemical cosh of antipsychotic drugs and new research suggests that there is a significant problem in hospitals too , " the letter reads .
" Antipsychotics should only ever be a last resort .
This over prescription is abuse and it must stop .
...
We cannot stand by while this scandalous abuse of vulnerable citizens continues .
" Although antipsychotic drugs are intended for people with medical conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and are not approved for the treatment of dementia , studies show that nursing homes and hospitals regularly prescribe them to these patients as sedatives , in order to make them easier for doctors and nurses to handle .
Research has shown , however , that antipsychotic drugs can double a patient 's risk of death if used for three years .
Another study found that dementia patients are three times more likely to suffer a stroke if given antipsychotic drugs .
A 2008 report by British Minister of Parliament Paul Burstow concluded that 23,500 dementia patients are being killed every year by inappropriate prescription of antipsychotics in nursing homes .
However , a recent survey by the Alzheimer 's Society marks the first time that researchers have looked into the prevalence of the problem in hospitals .
The trust found that three - quarters of nurses surveyed said they had seen antipsychotics used to sedate dementia patients , while one - quarter said they had seen the drugs used inappropriately .
"
The massive over prescription of antipsychotics to people with dementia is an abuse of human rights , causing serious side effects and increasing risk of death , " said Neil Hunt of the Alzheimer 's Society .
" The government must take action to ensure that these drugs are only ever used as a last resort . " " While the Department of Health prevaricates , thousands of people are being put at risk through the misuse of antipsychotics , " said Rebecca Wood of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust .

THEY say a picture says a thousand words - and if we were Kevin Federline we'd be very worried indeed .
Pregnant Britney Spears has posted an extraordinarily rude message to her waste - of - space hubby on her website ... giving him a one - fingered salute .
After days of speculation that their stormy 20 - month marriage has hit the rocks - with no denials from either side - she seems keen to display her anger and bitterness .
And , in yet another sign that Federline 's meal ticket has expired , we 're told that mum - of - one Brit has asked her own mother Lynne to move into her mansion to keep her company .
But none of this seems to worry the ferret - faced freeloader .
Feds has been telling friends : " Do n't worry , she ain't got the balls to leave me . "
Charming !
Brit , 24 , has slapped the bizarre photo of herself on her website under her poem Remembrance Of Who I Am - a thinly veiled confirmation that her marriage to would - be rapper Federline , 28 , is all but over .
It reads : " No more chains that you gave me .
My crown is back and it's way too high for you to be in my presence . "
We told last week how the couple - who have an eight - month - old son , Sean Preston - had drifted apart after a series of furious rows .
Brit despaired of the ex-dancer smoking dope and drinking with his friends , who she loathes , and banished him to a selfcontained bachelor flat in the basement of their Malibu home .
A source tells us : " Britney is at her wits ' end .
She 's furious with Kevin .
And as usual , when things go wrong for her , her mum Lynne has stepped in to offer support .
" Brit has some very serious decisions to make and she knows her mum is the best person to help her make them .
She really wanted the marriage to work for her family , but it seems harder by the day . "
Despite all signs to the contrary , arrogant Federline believes she will come crawling back for him .
He has told pals : " She does n't have the guts to leave me , she 's been threatening to divorce me since the honeymoon . "
The former dancer has already planned his next career move .
We hear he 's launching his very own urban street fashion line .
" Kev thinks that because he shops so much and gets his picture taken by paparazzi that people would want to dress like him , " our Californian confidante spills .
" He has already had talks with a number of companies to get his clothes range out there . "
Well , he 'll need all the money he can get when Brit finally kicks him to the kerb !
