" Enough electric power for the entire country could be generated by covering about 9 percent of Nevada — a plot of land 100 miles on a side — with parabolic trough systems . "
You could build a couple more plants of the same size to generate hydrogen , and the United States would be completely energy self - sufficient .
This is not advanced technology -- it is a bunch of mirrors .
This map shows a 100 mile x 130 mile plot of land in Texas :
With two or three solar energy plants of this size , America becomes completely energy self - sufficient .
And our carbon output would drop very close to zero .

" Concentrating solar power technologies currently offer the lowest - cost solar electricity for large - scale power generation ( 10 megawatt - electric and above ) .
Current technologies cost $ 2 – $ 3 per watt .
This results in a cost of solar power of 9 ¢ – 12 ¢ per kilowatt - hour ...
Future advances are expected to allow solar power to be generated for 4 ¢ –5 ¢ per kilowatt - hour in the next few decades . "
Two weeks ago I ran three articles here that talked about " peak oil " :
The gist of these articles is simple :
As oil gets more expensive , we will replace it with less - expensive technologies in a completely natural way .
Therefore , peak oil will be a non-event .
Then I started collecting a large quantity of material showing all of the different energy technologies that are currently being researched and deployed .
You can find the material here : What you can see is that the United States can be completely energy self - sufficient within a decade .
We simply need to make the decision to do it .
We do not have to create any new technological magic .
Here is one example that uses some of the simplest technology possible .
The technology is called CSP ( Concentrating Solar Power ) .
And this technology is incredibly simple -- you use mirrors to reflect lots of sunlight at a single focal point .
The mirrors can be arranged in a trough configuration , a dish configuration or a tower configuration .
At the focal point , you use the heat of the sunlight to create steam , and use the steam to drive a steam turbine and electrical generator .
This page provides a very nice , easy - to - understand overview of the concepts :
There are two great quotes in this article : Clearly , if we make the decision to do so and put our minds to it , the United States can become energy self - sufficient in a decade or so .
This problem is much , much simpler than putting a man on the moon , and we did that in about the same amount of time .
The fact that we are not actively doing this already is sad
In all likelihood we will never make that decision .
What will happen instead is that normal economic forces will cause the transition to happen in a natural way .
The cost of electricity and gasoline will rise as oil gets more expensive .
The cost of solar electricity , nuclear power , wind energy , etc. will fall as technology advances and economies of scale kick in .
There will come a point where companies find it quite profitable to build power plants using these other technologies rather than fossil fuels .
So they will .
Oil will come to play less and less of a role in our economy , and peak oil will be a non-event .

Feeding Cars , Not People
The adoption of biofuels would be a humanitarian and environmental disaster
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 22nd November 2004
If human beings were without sin , we would still live in an imperfect world .
Adam Smith ’s notion that by pursuing his own interest a man “ frequently promotes that of … society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it ” and Karl Marx ’s picture of a society in which “ the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all ” are both mocked by one obvious constraint .
The world is finite .
This means that when one group of people pursues its own interests , it damages the interests of others .
It is hard to think of a better example than the current enthusiasm for “ biofuels ” .
Biofuels are made from plant oils or crop wastes or wood , and can be used to run cars and buses and lorries .
Burning them simply returns to the atmosphere the carbon which the plants extracted while they were growing .
So switching from fossil fuels to biodiesel and bio-alcohol is now being promoted as the solution to climate change .
Next month the British government will have to set a target for the amount of transport fuel that will come from crops .
The European Union wants 2 % of the oil we use to be biodiesel by the end of next year , rising to 6 % by 2010 and 20 % by 2020 .
(1) To try to meet these targets , the government has reduced the tax on biofuels by 20 pence a litre , while the EU is paying farmers an extra 45 euros a hectare to grow them .
Everyone seems happy about this .
The farmers and the chemicals industry can develop new markets , the government can meet its commitments to cut carbon emissions , and environmentalists can celebrate the fact that plant fuels reduce local pollution as well as global warming .
Unlike hydrogen fuel cells , biofuels can be deployed straight away .
This in fact was how Rudolf Diesel expected his invention to be used .
When he demonstrated his engine at the World Show in 1900 , he ran it on peanut oil .
“ The use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today , ” he predicted .
“ But such oils may become in course of time as important as petroleum . ” (2) Some enthusiasts are predicting that if fossil fuel prices continue to rise , he will soon be proved right .
I hope not .
Those who have been promoting these fuels are well - intentioned , but wrong .
They are wrong because the world is finite .
If biofuels take off , they will cause a global humanitarian disaster .
Used as they are today , on a very small scale , they do no harm .
A few thousand greens in the United Kingdom are running their cars on used chip fat .
But recycled cooking oils could supply only 100,000 tonnes of diesel a year in this country , ( 3 ) equivalent to one 380th of our road transport fuel .
It might also be possible to turn crop wastes such as wheat stubble into alcohol for use in cars – the Observer ran an article about this on Sunday .
(4) I ’d like to see the figures , but I find it hard to believe that we will be able to extract more energy than we use in transporting and processing straw .
But the EU ’s plans , like those of all the enthusiasts for bio-locomotion , depend on growing crops specifically for fuel .
As soon as you examine the implications , you discover that the cure is as bad as the disease .
Road transport in the United Kingdom consumes 37.6 million tonnes of petroleum products a year .
(5) The most productive oil crop which can be grown in this country is rape .
The average yield is between 3 and 3.5 tonnes per hectare .
(6 ) One tonne of rapeseed produces 415 kilos of biodiesel .
(7) So every hectare of arable land could provide 1.45 tonnes of transport fuel .
To run our cars and buses and lorries on biodiesel , in other words , would require 25.9 m hectares .
There are 5.7 m in the United Kingdom .
(8 ) Switching to green fuels requires four and half times our arable area .
Even the EU ’s more modest target of 20 % by 2020 would consume almost all our cropland .
If the same thing is to happen all over Europe , the impact on global food supply will be catastrophic : big enough to tip the global balance from net surplus to net deficit .
If , as some environmentalists demand , it is to happen worldwide , then most of the arable surface of the planet will be deployed to produce food for cars , not people .
This prospect sounds , at first , ridiculous .
Surely if there was unmet demand for food , the market would ensure that crops were used to feed people rather than vehicles ?
There is no basis for this assumption .
The market responds to money , not need .
People who own cars have more money than people at risk of starvation .
In a contest between their demand for fuel and poor people ’s demand for food , the car - owners win every time .
Something very much like this is happening already .
Though 800 million people are permanently malnourished , the global increase in crop production is being used to feed animals : the number of livestock on earth has quintupled since 1950 .
(9 ) The reason is that those who buy meat and dairy products have more purchasing power than those who buy only subsistence crops .
Green fuel is not just a humanitarian disaster ; it is also an environmental disaster .
Those who worry about the scale and intensity of today ’s agriculture should consider what farming will look like when it is run by the oil industry .
Moreover , if we try to develop a market for rapeseed biodiesel in Europe it will immediately develop into a market for palm oil and soya oil .
Oilpalm can produce four times as much biodiesel per hectare as rape , and it is grown in places where labour is cheap .
Planting it is already one of the world ’s major causes of tropical forest destruction .
Soya has a lower oil yield than rape , but the oil is a by - product of the manufacture of animal feed .
A new market for it will stimulate an industry which has already destroyed most of Brazil ’s cerrado ( one of the world ’s most biodiverse environments ) and much of its rainforest .
It is shocking to see how narrow the focus of some environmentalists can be .
At a meeting in Paris last month , a group of scientists and greens studying abrupt climate change decided that Tony Blair ’s two big ideas – tackling global warming and helping Africa – could both be met by turning Africa into a biofuel production zone .
This strategy , according to its convenor , “ provides a sustainable development path for the many African countries that can produce biofuels cheaply ” .
( 10 ) I know the definition of sustainable development has been changing , but I was n’t aware that it now encompasses mass starvation and the eradication of tropical forests .
Last year the British parliamentary committee on environment , food and rural affairs , which is supposed to specialise in joined - up thinking , examined every possible consequence of biofuel production – from rural incomes to skylark numbers – except the impact on food supply .
( 11 )
We need a solution to the global warming caused by cars , but this is n’t it .
If the production of biofuels is big enough to affect climate change , it will be big enough to cause global starvation .

You may have heard about global warming .
It seems that in the last 100 years the earth 's temperature has increased about half a degree Celsius .
This may not sound like much , but even half a degree can have an effect on our planet .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) the sea level has risen 6 to 8 inches ( 15 to 20 cm ) in the last 100 years ( see How do they measure sea level ? ) .
­ This higher temperature may be causing some floating icebergs to melt , but this will not make the oceans rise .
Icebergs are large floating chunks of ice .
In order to float , the iceberg displaces a volume of water that has a weight equal to that of the iceberg .
Submarines use this principle to rise and sink in the water , too .

But the rising temperature and icebergs could play a small role in the rising ocean level .
Icebergs are chunks of frozen glaciers that break off from landmasses and fall into the ocean .
The rising temperature may be causing more icebergs to form by weakening the glaciers , causing more cracks and making ice mo­re likely to break off .
As soon as the ice falls into the ocean , the ocean rises a little .
If the rising temperature affects glaciers and icebergs , could the polar ice caps be in danger of melting and causing the oceans to rise ?
This could happen , but no one knows when it might happen .
The main ice covered landmass is Antarctica at the South Pole , with about 90 percent of the world 's ice ( and 70 percent of its fresh water ) .
Antarctica is covered with ice an average of 2,133 meters ( 7,000 feet ) thick .
If all of the Antarctic ice melted , sea levels around the world would rise about 61 meters ( 200 feet ) .
But the average temperature in Antarctica is - 37 °C , so the ice there is in no danger of melting .
In fact in most parts of the continent it never gets above freezing .
At the other end of the world , the North Pole , the ice is not nearly as thick as at the South Pole .
The ice floats on the Arctic Ocean .
If it melted sea levels would not be affecte­d .
There is a significant amount of ice covering Greenland , which would add another 7 meters ( 20 feet ) to the oceans if it melted .
Because Greenland is closer to the equator than Antarctica , the temperatures there are higher , so the ice is more likely to melt .
But there might be a less dramatic reason than polar ice melting for the higher ocean level -- the higher temperature of the water .
Water is most dense at 4 degrees Celsius .
Above and below this temperature , the density of water decreases ( the same weight of water occupies a bigger space ) .
So as the overall temperature of the water increases it naturally expands a little bit making the oceans rise .
In 1995 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report which contained various projections of the sea level change by the year 2100 .
They estimate that the sea will rise 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) with the lowest estimates at 15 centimeters ( 6 inches ) and the highest at 95 centimeters ( 37 inches ) .
The rise will come from thermal expansion of the ocean and from melting glaciers and ice sheets .
Twenty inches is no small amount -- it could have a big effect on coastal cities , especially during storms .

An extraordinary family who walk on all fours are being hailed as the breakthrough discovery which could shed light on the moment Man first stood upright .
Scientists believe that the five brothers and sisters found in Turkey could hold unique insights into human evolution .
The Kurdish siblings , aged between 18 and 34 and from the rural south , ' bear crawl ' on their feet and palms .
Study of the five has shown the astonishing behaviour is not a hoax and they are largely unable to walk otherwise .
Researchers have found a genetic condition which accounts for their extraordinary movement .
And it could provide invaluable information on how humans evolved from a four - legged hominid into a creature walking on two feet .
Two of the daughters and a son have only ever walked on two palms and two feet , but another son and daughter sometimes manage to walk upright .
The five can stand upright , but only for a short time , with both knees and head flexed .
Their remarkable story is told in a television documentary , to be screened next week , which shows scientists studying their movement , but also their struggle to fit in with modern society .
Professor Nicholas Humphrey , evolutionary psychologist at the London School of Economics , visited the family twice .
He said : " It 's amazing as an example of a strange , strange aberration of human development .
But their interest is how they can live in the modern world . "
The five are all mentally retarded .
Their mother and father , who are closely related are believed to have handed down a unique combination of genes which result in the behaviour .
Some researchers argue the genetic fault has caused the brothers and sisters to regress to a form of ' backward evolution ' .
Others believe it has led to brain damage which has allowed them to develop the walk .
Rather than walking on their knuckles , like gorillas or chimpanzees , they walk on the palms of their hands , with their fingers spread upwards .
Scientists believe this may be the way hominids moved to protect their fingers for more delicate movements .
Prof Humphrey said he thought the family had reverted to an instinctive form of behaviour encoded deep in the brain but abandoned during evolution .
He said : " I do not think they were destined to be quadrupeds by their genes , but their unique genetic make - up allowed them to be .
' It has produced an extraordinary window on our past .
It is physically possible , which no one would have guessed from the modern human skeleton . "
Study of their hands has shown they are heavily callused and have been walking like this for years .
Prof Humphrey said : " However they arrived at this point , we have adult human beings walking like ancestors several million years ago . "
The five siblings spend most of their time sitting outside the family 's basic rural home .
However , one brother travels to the local village where he engages in basic interactions with people .
The documentary , to be shown on BBC2 on Friday , March 17 , is called The Family That Walks On All Fours .
Call for testing : magic - removal branch
If you 've been involved at all in the Django community over the past few months , you 're no doubt familiar with a sexy , yet elusive , phenomenon known as the " magic - removal branch . "
It 's a new version of Django , begun a couple of months ago , that makes several sweeping changes to the framework to improve its usability and remove unnecessary " magic . "
That branch has been marked as " for developers / hackers only " -- until now .
Today we 're freezing feature additions to it and encouraging people to start using it as a brief beta test .
Come one , come all -- check out magic - removal and let us know if you find any bugs or other issues .
Over the next week , we 'll be concentrating on fixing any remaining bugs and -- more importantly -- updating ALL of the documentation .
Documentation is one of Django 's strongest selling points , and we do n't want to risk having inaccurate docs .
We 're aiming for a merge to trunk on next Friday , April 28 .
( For you non-techies , that means we 'll convert the main Django code repository to use the magic - removal code and switch all development permanently to that Django code base . )
That should give us enough time to work on documentation and iron out last - minute bugs .
We should release Django 's next official release -- 0.92 -- shortly thereafter , assuming all is well .
The RemovingTheMagic wiki page has all you need to know about the magic - removal branch .
Or , you can just Google for " magic removal " .
Number one hit , baby !
Yes , it 's even above this strange magic carpet removal video and a host of Web sites for " magic " stain - and hair - removal products .
Please feel free to ask questions in IRC ( #django on irc.freenode.net ) or the django - developers mailing list .
Continuing power problems at a Los Angeles telecom building have caused more outages for hosting companies , who are working to reassure frustrated customers about the extended downtime .
The Garland Building ( 1200 W. 7th ) lost power for the second time in five days last Friday , causing significant downtime for both Dreamhost and Media Temple .
A July 24 outage at the building that knocked MySpace offline was subsequently blamed on malfuctions in a power transfer system and UPS unit .
On July 28 , the building suffered another loss of power , attributed to an electrical short .
The problems have been most acute for DreamHost , which has been struggling with network troubles in between outages .
DreamHost , which hosts about 285,000 hostnames , provided a detailed summary of the problems in a blog post titled Anatomy of a (n Ongoing ) Disaster .
" We never want to have another July 2006 again , " Josh Jones writes in the blog , which provides technical details of the problems but also sought to use humor to lighten the mood , illustrating the post with photos from notable disasters .
" Our number one priority right now is getting this nagging network problem understood and fixed .
...
We ’re also going to be buying our own UPSes , since we have learned we ca n’t trust our data center OR our building to do it . "
MediaTemple indicated that it had lost patience with the uptime problems at 1200 W. 7th .
" This incident is clearly an unacceptable situation for our company and our customers , " the company said in a message to customers ( posted here ) .
" Media Temple has decided to accelerate its plans to move all customers in ( IDC - LA2 ) to a new data center which has undergone exhaustive testing to insure such power issues will not be a problem in the future . "
Media
Temple also said it would be making its CEO available to speak by phone with concerned customers .
Mission statement :
On this blog we explore why homeschooling can be a better option for children and families than a traditional classroom setting .
We 'll also explore homeschooling issues in general , educational thoughts , family issues , and some other random stuff .

• “ I have n't heard as good an account of what I 've been up to as the one Fred Turner supplies in this broad , readable analysis . ” — Kevin Kelly “ Fred Turner connects the dots of the dot.com era's true technological , cultural , and spiritual pioneers with scholarship , grace , and a storyteller 's passion . ” — Douglas Rushkoff
The introduction to From Counterculture
to Cyberculture Stewart Brand , the Whole Earth Network , and the Rise of Digital Utopianism Fred Turner Introduction
In the mid-1990s , as first the Internet and then the World Wide Web swung into public view , talk of revolution filled the air .
Politics , economics , the nature of the self — all seemed to teeter on the edge of transformation .
The Internet was about to " flatten organizations , globalize society , decentralize control , and help harmonize people , " as MIT 's Nicholas Negroponte put it .
The stodgy men in gray flannel suits who had so confidently roamed the corridors of industry would shortly disappear , and so too would the chains of command on which their authority depended .
In their place , wrote Negroponte and dozens of others , the Internet would bring about the rise of a new " digital generation " — playful , self - sufficient , psychologically whole — and it would see that generation gather , like the Net itself , into collaborative networks of independent peers .
States too would melt away , their citizens lured back from archaic party - based politics to the " natural " agora of the digitized marketplace .
Even the individual self , so long trapped in the human body , would finally be free to step outside its fleshy confines , explore its authentic interests , and find others with whom it might achieve communion .
Ubiquitous networked computing had arrived , and in its shiny array of interlinked devices , pundits , scholars , and investors alike saw the image of an ideal society : decentralized , egalitarian , harmonious , and free .
But how did this happen ?
Only thirty years earlier , computers had been the tools and emblems of the same unfeeling industrial - era social machine whose collapse they now seemed ready to bring about .
In the winter of 1964 , for instance , students marching for free speech at the University of California at Berkeley feared that America 's political leaders were treating them as if they were bits of abstract data .
One after another , they took up blank computer cards , punched them through with new patterns of holes — " FSM " and " STRIKE " — and hung them around their necks .
One student even pinned a sign to his chest that parroted the cards ' user instructions : " I am a UC student .
Please do not fold , bend , spindle or mutilate me . "
For the marchers of the Free Speech Movement , as for many other Americans throughout the 1960s , computers loomed as technologies of dehumanization , of centralized bureaucracy and the rationalization of social life , and , ultimately , of the Vietnam War .
Yet , in the 1990s , the same machines that had served as the defining devices of cold - war technocracy emerged as the symbols of its transformation .
Two decades after the end of the Vietnam War and the fading of the American counterculture , computers somehow seemed poised to bring to life the countercultural dream of empowered individualism , collaborative community , and spiritual communion .
How did the cultural meaning of information technology shift so drastically ?
As a number of journalists and historians have suggested , part of the answer is technological .
By the 1990s , the room - sized , stand - alone calculating machines of the cold - war era had largely disappeared .
So too had the armored rooms in which they were housed and the army of technicians that supported them .
Now Americans had taken up microcomputers , some the size of notebooks , all of them available to the individual user , regardless of his or her institutional standing .
These new machines could perform a range of tasks that far exceeded even the complex calculations for which digital computers had first been built .
They became communication devices and were used to prepare novels and spreadsheets , pictures and graphs .
Linked over telephone wires and fiber - optic cables , they allowed their users to send messages to one another , to download reams of information from libraries around the world , and to publish their own thoughts on the World Wide Web .
In all of these ways , changes in computer technology expanded the range of uses to which computers could be put and the types of social relations they were able to facilitate .
As dramatic as they were , however , these changes alone do not account for the particular utopian visions to which computers became attached .
The fact that a computer can be put on a desktop , for instance , and that it can be used by an individual , does not make it a " personal " technology .
Nor does the fact that individuals can come together by means of computer networks necessarily require that their gatherings become " virtual communities . "
On the contrary , as Shoshanna Zuboff has pointed out , in the office , desktop computers and computer networks can become powerful tools for integrating the individual ever more closely into the corporation .
At home , those same machines not only allow schoolchildren to download citations from the public library ; they also turn the living room into a digital shopping mall .
For retailers , the computer in the home becomes an opportunity to harvest all sorts of information about potential customers .
For all the utopian claims surrounding the emergence of the Internet , there is nothing about a computer or a computer network that necessarily requires that it level organizational structures , render the individual more psychologically whole , or drive the establishment of intimate , though geographically distributed , communities .
How was it , then , that computers and computer networks became linked to visions of peer - to - peer ad - hocracy , a leveled marketplace , and a more authentic self ?
Where did these visions come from ?
And who enlisted computing machines to represent them ?
To answer these questions , this book traces the previously untold history of an extraordinarily influential group of San Francisco Bay area journalists and entrepreneurs : Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network .
Between the late 1960s and the late 1990s , Brand assembled a network of people and publications that together brokered a series of encounters between bohemian San Francisco and the emerging technology hub of Silicon Valley to the south .
In 1968 Brand brought members of the two worlds together in the pages of one of the defining documents of the era , the Whole Earth Catalog .
In 1985 he gathered them again on what would become perhaps the most influential computer conferencing system of the decade , the Whole Earth Lectronic Link , or the WELL .
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s , Brand and other members of the network , including Kevin Kelly , Howard Rheingold , Esther Dyson , and John Perry Barlow , became some of the most - quoted spokespeople for a countercultural vision of the Internet .
In 1993 all would help create the magazine that , more than any other , depicted the emerging digital world in revolutionary terms : Wired .
By recounting their history , this book reveals and helps to explain a complex intertwining of two legacies : that of the military - industrial research culture , which first appeared during World War II and flourished across the cold - war era , and that of the American counterculture .
Since the 1960s scholarly and popular accounts alike have described the counterculture in terms first expressed by its members — that is , as a culture antithetical to the technologies and social structures powering the cold - war state and its defense industries .
In this view the 1940s and 1950s are often seen as a gray time shaped by rigid social norms , hierarchical institutions , and the constant demands of America 's nuclear face - off with the Soviet Union .
The 1960s seem to explode onto the scene in a Technicolor swirl of personal exploration and political protest , much of it aimed at bringing down the cold - war military - industrial bureaucracy .
Those who accept this version of events tend to account for the persistence of the military - industrial complex today , and for the continuing growth of corporate capitalism and consumer culture as well , by arguing that the authentically revolutionary ideals of the generation of 1968 were somehow co-opted by the forces they opposed .
There is some truth to this story .
Yet , as it has hardened into legend , this version of the past has obscured the fact the same military - industrial research world that brought forth nuclear weapons — and computers — also gave rise to a free - wheeling , interdisciplinary , and highly entrepreneurial style of work .
In the research laboratories of World War II and later , in the massive military engineering projects of the cold war , scientists , soldiers , technicians , and administrators broke down the invisible walls of bureaucracy and collaborated as never before .
As they did , they embraced both computers and a new cybernetic rhetoric of systems and information .
They began to imagine institutions as living organisms , social networks as webs of information , and the gathering and interpretation of information as keys to understanding not only the technical but also the natural and social worlds .
By the late 1960s , so too did substantial elements of the counterculture .
Between 1967 and 1970 , for instance , tens of thousands of young people set out to establish communes , many in the mountains and the woods .
It was for them that Brand first published the Whole Earth Catalog .
For these back - to - the - landers , and for many others who never actually established new communities , traditional political mechanisms for creating social change had come up bankrupt .
Even as their peers organized political parties and marched against the Vietnam War , this group , whom I will call the New Communalists , turned away from political action and toward technology and the transformation of consciousness as the primary sources of social change .
If mainstream America had become a culture of conflict , with riots at home and war abroad , the commune world would be one of harmony .
If the American state deployed massive weapons systems in order to destroy faraway peoples , the New Communalists would deploy small - scale technologies — ranging from axes and hoes to amplifiers , strobe lights , slide projectors , and LSD — to bring people together and allow them to experience their common humanity .
Finally , if the bureaucracies of industry and government demanded that men and women become psychologically fragmented specialists , the technology - induced experience of togetherness would allow them to become both self - sufficient and whole once again .
For this wing of the counterculture , the technological and intellectual output of American research culture held enormous appeal .
Although they rejected the military - industrial complex as a whole , as well as the political process that brought it into being , hippies from Manhattan to Haight - Ashbury read Norbert Wiener , Buckminster Fuller , and Marshall McLuhan .
Through their writings , young Americans encountered a cybernetic vision of the world , one in which material reality could be imagined as an information system .
To a generation that had grown up in a world beset by massive armies and by the threat of nuclear holocaust , the cybernetic notion of the globe as a single , interlinked pattern of information was deeply comforting : in the invisible play of information , many thought they could see the possibility of global harmony .
To Stewart Brand and later to other members of the Whole Earth group , cybernetics also presented a set of social and rhetorical resources for entrepreneurship .
In the early 1960s , not long after graduating from Stanford University , Brand found his way into the bohemian art worlds of San Francisco and New York .
Like many of the artists around him at the time , and like Norbert Wiener , in whose writings on cybernetics they were immersed , Brand quickly became what sociologist Ronald Burt has called a " network entrepreneur . "
That is , he began to migrate from one intellectual community to another and , in the process , to knit together formerly separate intellectual and social networks .
In the Whole Earth Catalog era , these networks spanned the worlds of scientific research , hippie homesteading , ecology , and mainstream consumer culture .
By the 1990s they would include representatives of the Defense Department , the U.S. Congress , global corporations such as Shell Oil , and makers of all sorts of digital software and equipment .
Brand brought these communities together in a series of what I will call network forums .
Drawing on the systems rhetoric of cybernetics and on models of entrepreneurship borrowed from both the research and the countercultural worlds , Brand established a series of meetings , publications , and digital networks within which members of multiple communities could meet and collaborate and imagine themselves as members of a single community .
These forums in turn generated new social networks , new cultural categories , and new turns of phrase .
In 1968 Brand founded the Whole Earth Catalog in order to help those heading back to the land find the tools they would need to build their new communities .
These items included the fringed deerskin jackets and geodesic domes favored by the communards , but they also included the cybernetic musings of Norbert Wiener and the latest calculators from Hewlett - Packard .
In later editions , alongside discussions of such supplies , Brand published letters from high - technology researchers next to firsthand reports from rural hippies .
In the process , he offered commune - based subscribers a chance to see their own ambitions as commensurate with the technological achievements of mainstream America , and he gave technologists the opportunity to imagine their diodes and relays as tools , like those the commune dwellers favored , for the transformation of individual and collective consciousness .
Together , the creators and readers of the Whole Earth Catalog helped to synthesize a vision of technology as a countercultural force that would shape public understandings of computing and other machines long after the social movements of the 1960s had faded from view .
In the 1980s and 1990s , as computers became ever smaller and more interconnected , and as corporations began to employ increasingly flexible modes of production , Brand and his colleagues repeated this process at the WELL , in the Global Business Network , through Wired , and in a series of meetings and organizations associated with all three .
In each case , a network entrepreneur ( often Brand himself ) gathered members of multiple communities within a single material or textual space .
The members of those networks collaborated on the various projects at hand and developed a shared language for their work .
Out of that language emerged shared understandings — of the potential social impact of computing , of information and information technologies as metaphors for social processes , and of the nature of work in a networked economic order .
Often enough , the systems on which network members appeared became models in their own right of these new understandings .
Even when they did not , members often took the insights they had gleaned back into their social and professional worlds .
In this way ideas born within Whole Earth–derived network forums became key frames through which both public and professional technologists sought to comprehend the potential social impact of information and information technologies .
Over time , the network 's members and forums helped redefine the microcomputer as a " personal " machine , computer communication networks as " virtual communities , " and cyberspace itself as the digital equivalent of the western landscape into which so many communards set forth in the late 1960s , the " electronic frontier . "
At the same time , and by means of the same social processes , members of the Whole Earth network made themselves visible and credible spokesmen for the socio- technical visions that they had helped create .
Traditionally , sociologists have depicted journalists in terms set by the professional norms of newspapers and magazines : as reporters of a consensus achieved among communities from which they were analytically , if not actually , separated .
In this view , a reporter 's prestige depends on her or his ability to dig up new information , report it in a compelling way , and make it visible to a broad public ( which itself is seen as analytically distinct from either the community of sources or the community of journalists ) .
Brand and other writers and editors associated with the Whole Earth publications developed extraordinary reputations as journalists , winning , among other prizes , the National Book Award ( for the Whole Earth Catalog ) and the National Magazine Award ( for Wired ) .
They did so , however , by building the communities on whose activities they were reporting .
Within Whole Earth–sponsored network forums , and within the books and articles they spawned , representatives of the technological world met leaders from politics and business , as well as former counterculturalists .
Together , their conversations turned digital media into emblems of network members ' own , shared ways of living , and evidence of their individual credibility .
Again and again , Brand , and later Kevin Kelly , Howard Rheingold , John Perry Barlow , and others , gave voice to the techno - social visions that emerged in these discussions .
As they did , they were welcomed into the halls of Congress , the boardrooms of major corporations , and the hotels of Davos , Switzerland , home of the World Economic Forum .
By the mid-1990s , throughout much of the mainstream press and in business and government as well , the networked entrepreneurship of the Whole Earth group and its self - evident financial and social success had become evidence for the transformative power of what many had begun to call the " New Economy . "
According to a raft of politicians and pundits , the rapid integration of computing and telecommunications technologies into international economic life , coupled with dramatic rounds of corporate layoffs and restructuring , had given rise to a new economic era .
Individuals could now no longer count on the support of their employers ; they would instead have to become entrepreneurs , moving flexibly from place to place , sliding in and out of collaborative teams , building their knowledge bases and skill sets in a process of constant self - education .
The proper role of government in this new environment , many argued , was to pull back , to deregulate the technology industries that were ostensibly leading the transformation , and , while they were at it , business in general .
Proponents of this view included telecommunications executives , high - tech stock analysts , and right - wing politicians .
Kevin Kelly , a former editor of the quarterly Whole Earth Review , which had grown out of the original Catalog , helped to bring them all to the pages of Wired .
As the magazine 's executive editor , he argued that the world was a series of interlocking information systems , all of which were working to corrode the bureaucracies of the industrial era .
To Kelly and the other creators of Wired , the suddenly public Internet appeared to be both the infrastructure and the symbol of the new economic era .
And if it was , they suggested , then those who built their lives around the Net and those who sought to deregulate the newly networked marketplace might in fact be harbingers of a cultural revolution .
In the pages of Wired , at least , this new elite featured the citizens of the WELL , the members of the Global Business Network , and the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation — all groups well woven into the fabric of the Whole Earth community — as well as Microsoft 's Bill Gates , libertarian pundits such as George Gilder , and , on the cover of one issue , conservative Republican Congressman Newt Gingrich .
To those who think of the 1960s primarily as a break with the decades that went before , the coming together of former counterculturalists , corporate executives , and right - wing politicians and pundits may appear impossibly contradictory .
But as the history of the Whole Earth network suggests , it is n't .
As they turned away from agonistic politics and toward technology , consciousness , and entrepreneurship as the principles of a new society , the communards of the 1960s developed a utopian vision that was in many ways quite congenial to the insurgent Republicans of the 1990s .
Although Newt Gingrich and those around him decried the hedonism of the 1960s counterculture , they shared its widespread affection for empowering technologically enabled elites , for building new businesses , and for rejecting traditional forms of governance .
And as they rose to power , more than a few right - wing politicians and executives longed to share the hip credibility of people like Stewart Brand .
This book , then , does not tell the story of a countercultural movement whose ideals and practices were appropriated by the forces of capital , technology , or the state .
Rather , it demonstrates that the New Communalist wing of the counterculture embraced those forces early on and that in subsequent years , Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network continued to provide the intellectual and practical contexts within which members of the two worlds could come together and legitimate one another 's projects .
At the same time , however , this book is not a biography of Stewart Brand .
Brand certainly deserves a biography , and one will no doubt be written in the years to come , but this book makes relatively little effort to understand Brand 's personal history except insofar as it illuminates his role in reshaping the politics of information .
Brand has had a substantial influence in other areas , especially ecology and architectural design , as well as a fascinating personal life , but these will have to wait for other chroniclers .
My aim here is to make visible Brand 's impact , and that of the networks he helped build , on our understandings of computing and its possible relations to social life .
Within this story , Brand is both an influential actor in his own right and an exemplary promoter of a new , networked mode of techno - social life ; so too are the journalists , consultants , and entrepreneurs of the Whole Earth network , which is by now far - flung .
My challenge in writing this book has been to keep in view simultaneously Brand 's unique individual talents , the networking tactics he employed , and the increasing influence of the networks he helped build .
For that reason , I begin with an overview of the broad transformation in popular perceptions of computing that has occurred over the past forty years , and a reminder of the forgotten affinities between cold - war research culture and the counterculture of the New Communalists .
I then turn to following Stewart Brand , first into the early 1960s art scene , then to the communes of the Southwest , into the back rooms of Bay area computer science in the 1970s , and on into the corporate world in the 1980s and 1990s .
Along the way , I pause to examine in some detail the networks and network forums that Brand has built .
As these explorations suggest , Brand 's influence on popular understandings of technology has depended not only on his considerable talent for spotting the forward edges of social and technological change , but also on the richness and complexity of the networks he has assembled .
I conclude by arguing that Brand 's entrepreneurial tactics , and the now - widespread association of computers and computer - mediated communication with the egalitarian social ideals of the counterculture , have become important features of an increasingly networked mode of living , working , and deploying social and cultural power .
Although it is tempting to think of that mode as a product of a revolution in computing technology , I argue that the revolution it represents began long before the public appearance of the Internet or even the widespread distribution of computers .
It began in the wake of World War II , as the cybernetic discourse and collaborative work styles of cold - war military research came together with the communitarian social vision of the counterculture .
SEBASTOPOL , Calif . - AUTHORS struggle , mostly in vain , against their fated obscurity .
According to Nielsen Bookscan , which tracks sales from major booksellers , only 2 percent of the 1.2 million unique titles sold in 2004 had sales of more than 5,000 copies .
Against this backdrop , the recent Authors Guild suit against the Google Library Project is poignantly wrongheaded .
The Authors Guild claims that Google 's plan to make the collections of five major libraries searchable online violates copyright law and thus harms authors ' interests .
As both an author and publisher , I find the Guild 's position to be exactly backward .
Google Library promises to be a boon to authors , publishers and readers if Google sticks to its stated goal of creating a tool that helps people discover ( and potentially pay for ) copyrighted works .
( Disclosure : I am a member of the publisher advisory board for Google Print .
As the name implies , it is simply an advisory group , and Google can take or leave its suggestions . )
What 's causing all the fuss ?
Google has partnered with the University of Michigan , Harvard , Stanford , the New York Public Library and Oxford University .
Google will scan and index their library collections , so that when a reader searches Google Print for , say , " author 's rights , " the results point to books that contain that term .
In a format that resembles its current Web search results , Google will show snippets ( typically , fewer than three sentences of text from each page of each book ) that include the search term , plus information about the book and where to find it .
Google asserts that displaying this limited amount of content is protected by the " fair use " doctrine under United States copyright law ; the Authors Guild claims that it is infringement , because the underlying search technology requires a digitized copy of the entire work .
I 'm with Google on this one .
It would certainly be considered fair use , if , for example , I circulated a catalog of my favorite books , including a handful of quotations from each book that helps people to decide whether to buy a copy .
In my mind , providing such snippets algorithmically on demand , as Google does , does n't change that dynamic .
Google allows click - through to the entire book only if the book is in the public domain or if publishers have opted in to the program .
If it 's unclear who owns the rights to a book , only the snippets are displayed .
French Week : On School Lunches
Day four of French Week !
Today 's post will be another long one , but we only have a week , and there are very many good things left to say about France , so I hope you will bear with me .
Take a look at these two school lunch menus , both for the week of March 24 - 28 , 2003 .
The menu on the left [ full version ] is from a school in the town of Montigny le Bretonneux , just southwest of Paris ; the menu on the right [ full version ] comes from a school in Pittsford , New York .
For the American menu , children are allowed to choose three additional items from the following list : milk , chocolate milk , salad , ' hot vegetable ' , fresh fruit , canned fruit in syrup , crackers .
They can also purchase a dessert .

I chose these school menus at random from a large pool - you can run the searches yourself and see that they are representative .
A Google query on restauration scolaire menu will get you a long list of French and Belgian school menus .
Note that not only do the French students eat more interesting meals than the American kids , but they get a different message from mealtime , too .
You get the sense that a French school lunch is considered part of the child 's education .
Students learn that there are many kinds of foods and many kinds of main courses .
They notice that meals have a structure , and consist of an appetizer , main dish , vegetable , cheese , and dessert .
And most importantly , kids ( who are not dumb ) see that thought and care has gone into designing their school menu , and that what they eat at school is considered important by the school administrators .
Contrast this with the American school , where the kids are fed a monotonous diet of pizza , burgers , chicken parts and meat .
The school this menu was taken from actually has weekly Domino 's pizza day .
Although children are ostensibly allowed to pick healthy foods as side dishes , anyone who 's been through public school in the States knows that the ' fresh fruit ' and ' garden salads ' are unappetizing and unpalatable .
Finally , notice how hard it is to eat a healthy diet at the American school .
You would be relegated to a ghetto of garden salads , ' soups of the day ' , and whatever nutritious innards you could pull out of the breaded main dish .
The message American kids get is that healthy food is second - rate and tastes bad , that they should eat lots of meat , cheese and potatoes , and that eating fast food every day is a normal diet .
There is no suggestion ( like in the French schools ) that a palate is something that must be nurtured and formed over time .
Instead , kids are taught to favor sweet , fatty , salty foods and treat eating as just another source of entertainment .
School administrators ( along with many parents ) will argue that they have no choice in what they can offer , because kids just wo n't eat healthy food .
But that is Lord of the Flies logic .
If you applied it in the classroom , you would be forced to teach English from comic books and math not at all .
In fact , some schools do take this line of thinking it to its logical conclusion , and allow fast food franchises to take over their lunch programs .
Many more set up vending machines that give kids unrestricted access to candy , soda , and snacks .
The dirty fact about American school lunches is that they are a dumping ground for surplus and substandard beef , chicken and dairy products .
Many of these foods cannot be served fresh because they would be too dangerous to eat .
This is especially true for ground meat , which is at times so contaminated with bacteria that it would not be legal to sell it in a supermarket .
A couple of hundred years ago , Louis Pasteur ( a Frenchman , of course ) discovered that you can kill bacteria in many foods by heating them to an elevated temperature for a certain period of time .
Pasteur 's discovery was revolutionary .
Pasteurized foods ( like milk , honey , cider or wine ) could be stored longer without going off .
And of course pasteurization can render dubious foods safe .
But the legacy of Pasteur 's invention , in this country , has been perverted .
Instead of improving the quality of our food supply , we 've used techniques like pasteurization and antibiotic prophylaxis to make it possible to create food on an industrial scale , artificially fighting back the disease and contamination that would otherwise make modern factory farming impossible .
The process shows no signs of slowing , either .
The current push for irradiating meat ( under the euphemism of ' cold pasteurization ' ) is an attempt by the beef industry to make meat safer not by improving hygiene at the slaughterhouse , but by rendering contaminated meat harmless .
Presumably , it does n't matter whether meat in school lunches has been in contact with cowshit , as long as it is no longer infectious .
At the same time , we take great pains to ban certain natural foods like raw milk cheeses , on the dubious grounds that they could carry pathogens .
As a culture , we Americans tend to fixate on certain exotic dangers ( unpasteurized cheese will kill our children ! ) while completely ignoring real and pervasive dangers ( there 's shit in our meat ; our schools are feeding children swill ) .
And we have a strangely Calvinist attitude to our food : healthy eating has to be dour , and unpleasant , an almost unattainable ideal .
Sin surrounds us , and often we fall .
The French attitude seems to be much healthier .
Food is one of life 's many pleasures , there is an elaborate ( of course ) intellectual superstructure to its proper preparation and enjoyment , and French children are introduced to the intricacies of good eating from an early age .
And as they grow to adulthood , they find themselves in a country where one is expected to eat well , and where there are many opportunities to do so .
I had this difference in sophistication vividly demonstrated some years ago , when I was a student in Paris .
I had been hired to babysit a five - year - old boy twice a week , in the hopes of teaching him a little English .
One evening , as I was preparing a snack , I held up a piece of cheese .
" Nicolas , in English this is called cheese .
Can you say that ? " " Cheeeese ! " " Very good !
Cheese .
What would you call this in French ? " " Reblochon . "
Five years old , and he knew his cheeses by name .
I checked him on every one in the fridge .
He even knew the names of the ones that were unpasteurized .
So tonight we lift our glasses ( of Orangina ) to Nicolas , and to all the other miniature gourmets who will be eating lunch in a French school tomorrow .

I know , I know ...
I sound like a broken record with the “ get a life ” rant .
But I see the wasting of life as a crime .
You know , many subscribers tell me they always wished they ’d started a band way back when , or had a few more unseemly adventures before settling down .
And I say , yeah , I hear you .
But many other subscribers eagerly tell me about their own history of being in bands , of pursuing a crazy dream before they finally decided to get after bidniz .
And I say , yeah , it ’s fun when you ’re immersed in life , is n’t it .
Because it is fun .
The lessons may be painful , but if you learn them , they can take you a long way toward being a person of substance ... and substance is the elixir that attracts great things .
Take , for example , the rather brutal lessons about business I learned while playing poker with steel - eyed professional gamblers .
( How ’s that for a segue ? )
As a young man , I always had one foot in the “ normal ” world ( college , steady jobs , meet the parents ) ... and the other foot in the “ darker ” world outside most folks ’ radar ( smokin ’ in the boysroom , hangin ’ with thieves , hipsters , and hustlers , especially if they could play drums ) .
One of the “ adult ” pleasures I decided to pursue for awhile was cards .
A drink , a stack of chips , the slippery coolness of the deck , the sense of time standing still .
Just like in the movies .
I learned the game the hard way , which is also the best way :
Getting fleeced by pros .
At first , you ’re too consumed with the rules ( “ seven card stud , high low , roll your own , the bug is aces , straights and flushes ” ) to do much but hang in there and pray for a better hand .
Soon , however , you start thinking about developing a “ poker face ” , and pulling a little schoolyard psychology to put the odds in your favor .
I remember the first time I bluffed .
We ’d been playing five - card stud , and the hands were sucking all around the table .
I was dealt another rotten hand , but kept my face calm ... and bet the max .
Everyone folded , and I collected the pot .
Hey , it was easy .
Just act like you have a good hand , and you ’ll scare the others into folding .
So I bluffed the next hand , too .
Same result .
A few curses , cards slammed on the table , suspicious stares .
I did n’t say a word .
Cocky now , I bluffed a third time , despite being dealt a hand I should have buried .
Pushed in the max bet , kept my face stoic .
Three of the guys folded again ... but ol ’ Pistol Pete – the grizzled veteran sitting across the table – looked at me with a strangely pleasant expression .
He called my bet , and I was forced to lay down my pathetic hand , exposed for a bluffer .
He beat me with cards only slightly better than mine – but still good enough to win -- and raked in the moolah with a chuckle .
For the rest of the game , he seemed to be able to read my mind -- he would fold if I truly held a good hand , call me when I tried to bluff , force me to fold in fear when he bluffed .
He cleaned me out .
I learned two very important lessons that night .
They work in business , as well as cards :
First :
Never fool yourself into thinking something is easy , when you KNOW it ’s difficult .
Take the diet market .
I recently saw a series of TV ads making outrageous claims like “ lose weight while you dream ” , and “ eat all the pie and candy you want , and still lose 20 pounds a week without exercise ” .
I have a little experience in this market -- if an ad works , it can bring in aton of orders .
But the feds watch diet advertising like a hawk ( especially ingestible products that promise magical results ) .
I ’ll bet the guys running those ads thought , at first , that they ’d just discovered a secret passage into Fort Knox with their cute exaggerations and outright lies .
( “ Hey !
This iseasy ! ” )
Until they got that dreaded visit from a bunch of guys with badges rudely asking them to put their hands on their heads .
The diet game is not easy -- there are critical rules to learn that , violated , will get you slammed in the hoosegow .
Second :
You can bluff your way along for a while ... but if you really do n’t have the chops to back it up , you ’ll eventually end up being exposed .
I know of many people out there touting themselves as “ marketing experts ” ... and they ’re just flat out writing checks their ass can’t cash .
I remember one guy calling me in a panic -- he was being interviewed that afternoon on some national business show as a “ marketing genius ” , and he desperately wanted me to share some secrets with him so he would n’t sound like a fool .
( “ A little late for that , ” I told him . )
His brazen act had gotten him into the studio .
Now , forced to back up his claims , he was about to be exposed .
Listen carefully :
The world is awash in bullshit ... and starved for substance !
For products that really perform as advertised .
For experts who can provide the service they promise .
For teachers who can reveal honest secrets .
We have too many idiots who think thatattitude is a good substitute for substance .
They get away with it for a time , but in the end , you ’re far better off knowing you can back up every promise you make .
And that ’s the Big Secret to making a killing in marketing :
Have substance .
So you can make seemingly - outrageous promises with total confidence ... because you know you can back it up .
It really is that simple .
By the way ... that pro who cleaned me out did me a huge favor after the game .
He took me aside and explained what I ’d done wrong .
I had my poker face in place during my first bluffs ... but when everyone folded , a slight flicker of relief appeared .
That small “ tell ” was all the pro needed to be able toread me like a book the rest of the night .
I was all nerves and bluff , and he knew he could beat me with just a little real substance in his own hand .
I have never again regarded poker -- or any other adult endeavor -- as “ easy ” .

Only a Republican would think that the horrors of 9 - 11 needed to be doctored for a campaign commercial .
The controversial video of the burning World Trade Center towers in a television campaign ad for Ohio Sen .
Mike DeWine is doctored , U.S. News has learned .
The television spot , which has been lambasted by critics as a political exploitation of the Sept. 11 , attacks Democrat challenger Rep. Sherrod Brown for being weak on national security .
On the air in major Ohio markets since last Friday , the ad shows the towers , with the south building billowing smoke , which gradually drifts upward .
In the video , the north tower , which was struck first on September 11 , is undamaged .
" This particular image is impossible , " says W. Gene Corley , a stuctural engineer who led FEMA 's building performance study on the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks .
Corley reviewed the ad at www.brownvotes.com for U.S. News .
" The north tower was hit first [ so ] the south tower could not be burning without the North Tower burning . "
Corley also says , " the smoke is all wrong . "
The day of the attacks , the plumes of ash were drifting to the southeast .
" The smoke on 9/11 was never in a halo like that , " Corley says .
Reclusive Linux founder opens up Linux founder Linus Torvalds now makes his base in Portland , Oregon .
GLOBAL OFFICE ON CNN TV
You can watch the Linus Torvalds interview on Global Office on CNN International at these times :

13:30 ET / 18:30 BST /0130 ( Monday ) HKT /2300 New Delhi YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Global Office Linus Torvalds Microsoft Corporation or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- Portland , Oregon is the unlikely capital of a global software revolution .
The revolution is called Open Source .
And its leader ?
Linus Torvalds , the reclusive founder of Linux .
Linux is the free software code developed by a global community of programmers .
It 's also the world 's fastest growing operating system and number two behind Microsoft .
Torvalds works full time overseeing the development of Linux which he created back in 1991 while at university in Helsinki .
Usually media shy , the 36 - year - old Finn invited Kristie Lu Stout and the Global Office team into his home for an insight into life at the helm of the operating system that is giving Microsoft some serious headaches .
Kristie Lu Stout :
What role do you play in the development of Linux today ?
Linus Torvalds :
Well today what I do mostly is actually communication .
I started out as the main developer but these days what I do is act as the central point for other people who do a lot of development and I gather it all together and basically communicate with people what needs to be done and so on .
KLS : What 's your ballpark figure in terms of how many Linux developers there are out there ?
LT : I actually only work with a few handfuls so I tend to directly interact with maybe 10 - 20 people and they in turn interact with other people .
So depending on how you count , if you count just the core people , 20 - 50 people .
If you count everybody who 's involved ; five thousand people -- and you can really put the number anywhere in between ...
Almost , pretty much all , real work is done over e-mail so it does n't matter where people are .
KLS : So you have the core people , you have the developers and you have the testers .
What do you think motivates everyone , drives everyone to create the best work possible to create a good product ?
LT : A lot of the core people just feel excited about the technology .
And that 's why a lot of people just start ; that 's where I started from , it was just the excitement of doing something yourself .
It 's kind of like a hobby .
You can tinker with cars , you can tinker with computers .
There are a lot of technical issues that are just very exciting if you 're that kind of person ... At least from the developers ' standpoint , nobody does it because they hate Microsoft .
None of the people I work with do it for that reason .
They do it because they love doing what they do .
Tremendous growth KLS :
In the last year we 've seen tremendous growth in Linux usage especially on desktop computers , especially with stuff out there like Open Office , especially the Firefox browser .
Do you think we 're nearing a tipping point where Linux is becoming mainstream ?
LT : Well as far as I 'm concerned it 's actually been pretty mainstream .
Already I 've been doing this for 15 years and you have to realize that I 've got a slightly different viewpoint on the whole thing .
KLS : I understand , but let 's say your mom or my mom , they 're surfing the Internet but maybe they 're not surfing with Firefox just yet or they do n't really know what Linux is just yet .
LT : Open source is definitely getting to the point where a lot of people who do n't actually know about the technology start to know about the notion of open source and start to use the products .
Not just Linux , I mean Firefox is certainly the one that a lot of people will have seen because they prefer it , because it 's better or because it 's more secure or for any other number of reasons .
KLS : Another reason , because it's an alternative to Microsoft ?
LT : Well that is , I think , played up more than it necessarily needs to be .
Because there is a very vocal side to this which is the whole anti Microsoft thing .
I think it makes a better story than is necessarily true in real life .
KLS : Now let 's go back to the beginnings when Linux first started in the early 1990s .
What motivated you to give away the source code ?
LT : I did n't start thinking I want to give out the source code .
What I started doing , already at that point I was 21 , I was at Helsinki University and for half my life I 'd been doing programming .
All the projects I 'd ever done had been projects for my own enjoyment -- technical challenges , but also to just solve issues that I had .
And Linux really was nothing different from that .
So open source was not really a conscious decision of " I want to make this open source . "
To a large degree open source was just a way to allow others to look at this and say , " Hey , this is what I 've done -- I 'm proud of this . "
KLS : Do you think there was a little bit of bragging involved ?
LT : Absolutely .
There was a bit of bragging , there was also a bit of , hey , I still , the way I do my work is I sit these days downstairs in my basement alone .
And it 's nice to just talk to people and a lot of it was probably just social , just saying , hey this is a way to interact with other geeks who are probably also socially inadequate in many ways .
KLS : And you have a mascot for all this which is the penguin .
How did that happen ?
LT : I felt that Linux wanted and needed a very nice kind of friendly mascot to kind of offset some of the geekiness and the hard technology .
So selecting an animal was a pretty obvious thing to do .
And at the same time you want something that is exotic ; you do n't want a dog or a cat because that 's just too everyday .
And everybody likes penguins , so I actually decided I want a penguin as my mascot .
I want it to be cuddly , I want it to be a plush toy kind of penguin and I could do that myself .
So we actually farmed out that design too and we just had a small competition for who could make the nicest penguin .
Now you can see the winning end result everywhere on the web .
KLS : Did you ever think about getting into the money game , getting insanely rich from the operating system , which is now the fastest growing operating system in the world that you created ?
LT : Well I got rich enough .
This is n't bad .
It was n't what I was interested in .
In many ways I am very happy about the whole Linux commercial market because the commercial market is doing all these things that I have absolutely zero interest in doing myself .
The commercial market is how I actually get a pay check every month .
And I get it for doing what I want to do and that is the technical side .
I do n't want to have anything to do with the commercial marketing stuff .
I think everybody is actually quite happy about this arrangement , that people can do what they specialize in , not just on the technical side but overall .
KLS : Over the years , Linux has spawned other open technologies and even an open source spirit or open source philosophy .
It has engendered stuff like Wikipedia , the online open source encyclopedia or even , some could argue , citizen journalism .
What are your thoughts about that ?
LT : We should n't give credit to Linux per se .
There were open source projects and free software before Linux was there .
Linux in many ways is one of the more visible and one of the bigger technical projects in this area and it changed how people looked at it because Linux took both the practical and ideological approach .
At the same time I do n't think this whole " openness " notion is new .
In fact I often compare open source to science .
To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples ' ideas and making it into what science is today , and the incredible advances that we have had .
And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy , where openness was something you did n't do .
So openness is not something new , it is something that actually has worked for a long time .
KLS : What is your favorite offshoot of the open source philosophy ?
LT : That is an unexpected question .
I do n't even know .
I think the nicest part of it is not really the open source side but the whole community side which was to me not really expected at all .
But it is really what keeps me motivated these days .
KLS : Now you are something of a rock star in tech circles ...
LT : I do n't notice that in normal life .
I do n't actually go to that many conferences .
I do that a couple of times a year .
Normally I am not recognized , people do n't throw their panties at me .
I 'm a perfectly normal person sitting in my den just doing my job .
KLS : How often do you get the chance to see your fellow Linux contributors face to face ?
LT : Not very often .
There are a few of them that are local .
I meet with them very occasionally .
We go out for beer or breakfast or something .
We have two conferences a year that people go to and those are largely social .
I mean sometimes you also work out issues face to face during the conferences .
Maybe it is easier to agree , but most of it really is about the social side when you go to conferences and you will find people sitting at the same table with laptops and they will send each other emails , because it is often a better way to communicate when you have a technical issue ; you can write it down more , you can point to the code .
KLS : So the face to face thing is a little bit overrated ?
LT : I think so .
For example I long ago decided I will never go to meetings again because I think face to face meetings are the biggest waste of time you can ever have .
I think most people who work at offices must share my opinion on meetings .
Nothing ever gets done .
When things get done , you usually have someone come into your office to talk about it .
But a lot of the time the real work gets done by people sitting , especially in programming , alone in front of their computers doing what they do best .
KLS : What are your thoughts about the future of Linux and whether or not it can continue to survive without you ?
LT : It has grown so much bigger than me .
Ten years ago it needed me , both personally and as a figurehead .
These days , there are tons of companies , there are lots of people who know the technology .
I end up being the central gathering point but it 's because people know me , people trust me .
I am neutral .
I really like doing Linux .
I like the technical challenges , I like the interaction and as long as I am the best person for it I want to do it .
KLS : So it sounds like , going forward you are still going to do the job , be the as you put it , the central focus point of the Linux development process ?
LT : Right .
At the same time I will also try to farm out as much as possible .
I still want to be the central point , but I do n't want to be the bottleneck for anything and that does require that you trust a lot of other people and you just say , " hey , you make the decision , I am not going to micro- manage , " because that really does n't work .
That drives people wild and when you do n't even pay them they wo n't accept it , so I can't afford to be that type of bottleneck either .
KLS : Is there anything else you want to accomplish going forward ?
LT : No , but on the other hand I am not the kind of person that really plans ahead a lot .
When I started Linux it was n't because I wanted to be where I am today .
I am more of an " everyday as it comes " type of person .
I am very happy that I feel like I do something meaningful , that has made a difference , that actually a lot of people use .
But at the same time I do n't have and I never have had any big visionary goals .

This weekend I travelled to Las Vegas on Southwest Airlines and I noticed a very simple principle at work .
If you do n’t know , SWA does n’t have assigned seating .
Instead , you get a letter ( A , B or C ) and they board everyone with A , then everyone with B and so on .
Southwest created this “ competition for letters ” to get people to the airport early and to ensure on - time departure .
But for me , it demonstrates something else .
You might think that the SWA gates would be a madhouse , but in fact they are very orderly .
People arrive and begin to lineup into three lines ( A , B and C ) in a quite orderly fashion .
People in each row are cordial to each other asking “ is this the line for B to san diego ? ” and exchanging niceties and often that question allows people to break into a friendly conversation .
If you were to look at the gate area from above , you ’d see what looks like three branches on a tree , they curve around the furniture and the walls , but they are a line .
Contrast this with what I saw at an America West Gate .
A throng of people surrounded the doorway to their gate , each trying to push past each each other so they could get to their seat earlier ( even though they know they are guaranteed to sit in the same seat no matter how quickly they board ) .
If you looked down from above , it ’d look like a half circle completely filled with people .
It struck me that this is a lot like community on the web , if you give people a little guidance and a benefit , they ’ll actually organize themselves just fine .
On SWA , the benefit of being orderly is a smoother travel experience and a good seat and the guidance is telling people where they stand — those that are in line C know that no amount of pushing will get them good seats and those in A know that they are gonna be in a seat they like no matter what .
On AW , they do n’t ask anything of the traveller , they do n’t trust the travellers to line up , they treat travel as a solitary experience “ every man for themselves ” .
And it shows .
On the web , we ’ve seen some really interesting communities grow : flickr , delicious , craigslist .
All of them give benefits to people in the community ( tags make it easier to find stuff , the tools allow you to connect with friends or meet new people or sell stuff , etc ) and all give a simple amount of guidance “ to get those benefits , we ’d like you to tag , post , rate , report bad stuff , etc ” .
And you know , the community organizes itself .
Those communities police themselves a bit .
There ’s abuse ( “ people cutting line ” ) , but its buried deep down in the site because the community wo n’t rate it or will report it .
Those communities help me find where the good stuff is , because , that ’s what they ’d want someone to do for them .
And the sites actually ask people to do it and reward people for doing it right .
Really quite simple .
So if you are working on an online community , are you trusting the community to organize itself ?
Are you giving them a clear benefit ?
Are you simply asking for what you ’d like to see ?
When you see good behaviour , do you email the person and say “ thanks ? ” .
If not , go take a flight on SWA , then re-think your answers …

Zopa matches up borrowers and lenders in a peer - to - peer online lending service .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) -- The Disruptor : Zopa
The Innovation : Peer - to - peer lending
The Disrupted : Traditional banks
Any industry making a huge profit margin off its customers is a good candidate for disruption .
Banking is a classic case -- just think of the 19 percent interest you pay on credit cards and the 2 percent you earn on your savings account .
Zopa is closing that gap by using the Web to allow personal lending on a massive scale .
The startup was the first company to introduce peer - to - peer lending in the United Kingdom 18 months ago and is about to launch in America .
" What Skype did to telecoms , this could do to banks , " says David Cowan of Bessemer Venture Partners , which contributed some of the $ 31 million in funding the startup has attracted to date .
Scott Anthony , a managing director of Clayton Christensen 's consulting firm , Innosight , is intrigued by the disruptive potential of peer - to - peer lending .
" Are there ways to loan amounts that banks wo n't lend because they 're too small , " he asks , " or to serve customers who would otherwise never be served ? "
The idea is simple .
People join Zopa online as either borrowers or lenders .
The lenders proffer money not to individuals but to a pool of people grouped together because of similar creditworthiness .
Zopa assesses the credit risk of the borrowers , pools the capital , and matches consumers who need money with consumers who want to lend it .
Since Zopa is not technically a bank and does n't lend money itself , the capital requirements to run the business are relatively small .
The average interest rate on a Zopa loan is 7 percent .
For the lenders , that 's much better than even a CD , and for the borrowers , it sure beats a credit card or most bank loans .
Zopa takes a 1 percent fee , split between the borrower and the lender .
So far , about 90,000 people have signed up , and more than $ 100,000 is lent every day ( totaling more than $ 10 million so far ) .
And only 0.05 percent of Zopa 's loans have turned into uncollectible debts .
" We are moving from a consumer society of mass production to a society where we are defined more as individuals , " says Zopa CEO Richard Duvall .
Yet in banking , Duvall points out , " there are still enormous corporations controlling our money . "
Duvall believes that a nimble Zopa can trounce banks in assessing credit by gauging things that banks typically do n't review , such as a person 's eBay ratings .
And he 's injecting a social aspect into lending .
Just as in a social network , lenders can read the online profiles of the people borrowing their money .
" If I borrow from real people , " Duvall says , " I 'm more likely to pay back than if I borrow from a faceless bank . "

Cute Kate was on Letterman last night to promote You , Me and Dupree .
So far the movie has made over $ 21 million .
The comedy did not come close to Pirates which scored $ 62 million this weekend making it the year 's top - grossing film .
Funny thing was she was talking about Disney and Pirates and joked about how she was promoting that movie instead of her own .

Record temperatures have been recorded in California and Europe over the past week , with power outages returning to the Golden State for the first time since the Enron era .
But it is n't only the electricity supply that 's failing .
A commodity that 's as rare online as water in the desert , irony , appears to be suffering severe shortages too .
Here are two examples .
Are they a trend ?
Our first example is a witty prank by John Graham - Cumming , chief scientist at Electric Cloud .
He mimicked a programming technique known as recursion to post the same entry to two news aggregators at the same time , each referencing the other .
Recursion is when a function calls itself .
If the " stop condition " is n't met , the function calls itself indefinitely - until the computer runs out of stack space .
So a submission headlined " Recursion defined - see Reddit " was posted to Digg , while one headlined " Recursion defined - see Digg " was posted to Reddit .
Digg claims to harness " the collective wisdom " of the crowd , but in this case it appears men behind the curtain intervened to hide the post , which was one of the most " Dugg " , or popular , of the day .
Graham - Cumming then discovered that his Digg user account had been cancelled .
He was barred .
On his blog , John describes it as sense of humor failure , but it 's more than that .
Inadvertently , it 's a delightful satire of the Digg groupthink that we 've encountered before .
A crowd with one mind has no room for self - awareness , humour or irony - and can be remarkably thin - skinned .
But groupthink is n't just an accidental by - product of the " Web 2.0 " sites , it 's designed into the system .
As one Reddit poster noted :
" When the latest Digg redesign launched , it started spiralling down towards the farthest depths of idiocy .
Digg commenters were always on the juvenile side , but the final straw for me was forty - odd comments just sniggering about the number sixty - nine .
" With Slashdot , maybe a joke like that would get +5 , Funny , but the rest of the people making the same stupid joke would be at - 1 where I do n't see them .
With Digg , some kid sees a stupid joke , mods it up , sees the same joke underneath , and mods that up too , and carries on modding up dozens more . "
Now , to our concern , the condition of humorlessness has even affected some of you .
Yesterday we reported on Wikipedia , the comic institution .
A school in Nebraska has filed suit to identify who made disparaging remarks about it on Wikipedia .
Elite administrators swiftly deleted the old entry , and replaced it with a new , fault - free entry which only registered users could edit .
After only six days , the clean entry already contained a seriously howler - placing Nebraska in Canada .
Which prompted us to run this infographic : .
It was n't long before sharp - eyed readers spotted something was amiss .
" You screwed up the map in your Skutt article , " Christopher Bowen advised us .
" The red is labeled as ' Canada ' , and green as the ' USA ' .
Only one problem : " he said , before smacking the Enter key twice for added emphasis :
" You have them reversed . "
The corrections continued to pour in .
" Is your ' handy reference ' an obscure joke ? " asked reader Teemu Leisti .
" If so , I certainly do n't get it . "
He had similar advice :
" In reality , Canada is the country you 've coloured in green , and USA the one coloured in red . "
A Wikipedian discovers a geographical discrepency [ click for link ]
" Whoops .
Where 's Canada again ? " asks Chris Noble , who continues -
" Unfortunately there appears to be some confusion in the labelling .
Of course , if this error had occurred in Wkipedia I would have been able to nip straight in there and fix it up .
Since it is in a publication controlled by professionals , I guess we 'll have to wait for the correction . "
Yes indeed .
But doubt creeps in seconds later .
" I full [ sic ] acknowledge that there may have been some über - ironic intent here , but if so , you hide it well . "
That , Chris , is the core of the problem .
Irony should n't be hidden - it should be standing in the middle of an open cornfield , on top of a large step ladder , with large purple flares attached to each ironic arm .
Then no one could miss it .
We had high hopes for an idea suggested by former journalist Dan Gillmor , who mooted the idea of an " honor tag " for online writing .
An honor tag could prove everything the writer wrote could be taken at face value , free of all those messy ambiguities .
See Are you trying to be funny ?
If so check [ ] this box .
This , we believe , was inspired by our earlier suggestion of marking different attempts at humor in different colours , which we suggested more than five years ago .
See The Color of Irony .
Alas , it was never implemented , and like Gillmor 's honor tags , lies sadly neglected in the exciting world of Web 2.0 .
In the intervening years , there have been some tragic misunderstandings .
Have you experienced sudden sense of humour failures in your online neighbourhood ?
They 're usually accompanied by equally sudden surges of self - righteousness .
Let us know .
And stay cool out there .®
Mr Blair said the Labour conference in two weeks ' time would be his last as Labour leader - but he did not name a precise date for his departure .
He also apologised for Labour 's conduct in recent days , admitting it " has not been our finest hour , to be frank " .
Allies have suggested Mr Blair will announce a timetable early in the New Year and hand over power in May .
Mr Blair and his supporters will be hoping his statement will end the civil war that has broken out in the past week among Labour MPs over his departure .
International Development Secretary Hilary Benn said he wished " people would understand what is required " and get on with the business of governing .
But some Labour MPs are already saying Mr Blair 's statement will not be enough to quell dissent .
When I met the prime minister yesterday , I said to him - as I 've said on many occasions and I repeat today - it is for him to make the decision
Gordon Brown
Analysis : Blair 's final gamble
In full : Blair statement
In full : Brown statement
Manchester Blackley MP Graham Stringer said he did not think Mr Blair 's statement " took us any further forward " .
And he called on Mr Blair to " fire the starting pistol on a leadership election " at Labour 's conference later this month .
Newcastle North MP Doug Henderson , a close ally of Gordon Brown , said : " It does n't seem to me that the public knows any more about the PM 's retirement plans .
" People keep saying to me that the Labour party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the May 2007 elections . "
BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said there was still a lot of " poison " emanating from Labour MPs - and allies of Mr Blair and Mr Brown were continuing to fight behind the scenes .
' No precise date '
In his brief statement , made during a visit to a London school , Mr Blair said : " I think what is important now is that we understand that it 's the interests of the country that come first and we move on .
I think that Labour has had its moment of madness this week and I hope it will now move on
Peter Mandelson
Political reaction Special report : Blair succession
" I would have preferred to do this in my own way but it has been pretty obvious from what many of my Cabinet colleagues have said earlier in the week .
" The next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader , the next TUC conference next week will be my last TUC - probably to the relief of both of us .
" But I am not going to set a precise date now .
I do n't think that 's right .
I will do that at a future date and I 'll do it in the interests of the country and depending on the circumstances of the time . "
He also had a message for warring Labour MPs , saying : " It 's the public that comes first and it's the country that matters , and we can't treat the public as irrelevant bystanders in a subject as important as who is their prime minister . "
Speaking earlier , Chancellor Gordon Brown said it was for Mr Blair to decide when he quit .
" When I met the prime minister yesterday , I said to him - as I 've said on many occasions and I repeat today - it is for him to make the decision , " he told reporters during a visit to a Glasgow athletics track .
Mandelson reaction
Giving his reaction , EU trade commissioner and key Blair ally Peter Mandelson said : " I think that Labour has had its moment of madness this week and I hope it will now move on and that the plotting and the shenanigans will be put behind them once and for all .
KEY LABOUR DATES 25 - 26 Sept : Mr Blair and Mr Brown make speeches at the Labour Party conference in Manchester 15 Nov : State opening of Parliament including the Queen 's speech outlining the government 's agenda 2 May 2007 : Tenth anniversary of Mr Blair 's election as prime minister 3 May 2007 : Elections for Scottish and Welsh assemblies , and most local authorities in England
" They 've got to concentrate on the needs of the country , not themselves . "
He said he always thought Mr Blair would step down after 10 years in office , as " it was as much as someone could do that job for " .
Speaking earlier , Commons leader Jack Straw said he would expect Mr Blair to stay " to the halfway point of a normal four - year parliament " , which would be May .
But Downing Street rejected suggestions a deal had been struck to hand over power on 4 May , three days after Mr Blair notches up 10 years in power and the day after the local elections .

Mr Blair has been under pressure to quit earlier than May in order to get a new leader in place before the elections in England , Scotland and Wales - which are expected to be disastrous for Labour .
Mr Brown - the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair - was also thought to be unhappy at the prospect of taking over at the end of a Parliamentary session .
The two men were reported to have to have had an acrimonious meeting over the issue on Wednesday morning .
It was followed by a day of open warfare between supporters of the chancellor and Mr Blair - and a string of government resignations - over when the prime minister should quit .

structures for representing more general relationships between data elements ; hash tables for the efficient retrieval of strings and other objects ; and finally
for the efficient retrieval of strings and other objects ; and finally trade - offs between the structures , and strategies for picking the most appropriate ones .
To understand the material in this book you should be comfortable enough in a programming language to be capable of working with and writing your own variables , arithmetic expressions , if - else conditions , loops , subroutines ( also known as functions ) , pointers ( also known as references or object handles ) , structures ( also known as records or classes ) , simple input and output , and simple recursion .
Because many different languages approach the construction of data structures differently , we use pseudo - code so that you can translate the code into your own language .

No Word for Thank You
A recurring theme here on Language Log is the claim that such - and - such a language has no word for this - or - that .
Such claims are easy to make fun of as they 're often wrong and even when true do n't have the implications people think they do .
There are , however , some serious points to make about these claims .
Not only do they rest on false linguistic premises , but they can be quite damaging .
One false premise is the Whorfian one on which we have often commented : not having a word for something does not mean that one lacks the concept .
Indeed , there is some very good evidence that people have covert categories , classes of things for which we have concepts but no terms .
The evidence for this is nicely presented in Brent Berlin 's wonderful book Ethnobiological Classification : Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies .
If you have n't read it , you should do so immediately .
Not only is it fascinating , but it has lovely illustrations by one of the Tzeltal people whose ethnobiology Berlin has studied extensively .
( And if you 're the person who has my copy , please return it . )
Among other examples , Berlin points out that in Tzeltal there are no words corresponding to " plant " and " animal " , but there is a variety of evidence that Tzeltal speakers nonethless classify living things into categories that correspond to " plant " and " animal " .
One such piece of evidence is the fact that there are classificatory suffixes that reflect these categories .
Another false idea is that if people have borrowed a word that implies that they previously lacked a word for the same idea .
There is some truth to the converse of this idea - if a new idea is introduced , people are likely to create a term for it , and a common way to do this is to borrow the word from the language of the people from whom the new idea comes - but people borrow words for reasons other than the absence of an equivalent term in their own language .
This is easily seen in the history of languages like Japanese which have vast numbers of doublets , one native , the other borrowed , for the same meaning .
In the case of Japanese most of the loans come from Chinese .
There is typically both a native Japanese word for something and a loan from Chinese .
Usually , though not invariably , the loan from Chinese belongs to a more formal , literary register .
One of the difficulties of reading Japanese is that if both words are written in Chinese characters it may be impossible to know which word is intended .
Often you can figure this out from the morphology , but sometimes you can't .
For example , if you encounter 村人 " villager " , a compound of 村 " village " and 人 " person " there is no way to be sure whether to read it as murabito , which is the native Japanese word , or sonjin , the loan from Chinese .
You can guess , since sonjin is much more formal than murabito , but you can't be sure .
A particularly damaging example of the No word for X fallacy is one that one hears here in Northwestern Canada .
Many of the Athabascan languages of Canada have a word for " thank you " that is borrowed from French merci .
In Carrier it is [ mʌsi ] .
This fact has suggested to the ignorant that these languages previously had no word for " thank you " , from which they draw the further conclusion that their speakers had no concept of gratitude .
Such a people , of course , must have been sub - human savages .
The conclusion is that it's a good thing that white people came to rescue them from their degraded traditional way of life .
This claim is so well known that it figured in an episode of the television program North of 60 , which was set in a Slave village in the Northwest Territories .
The fact is that the loan was not motivated by the lack of a native way to say " thank you " .
In Carrier , there are actually two different verbs for expressing thanks , one for giving thanks for what someone has said , the other for giving thanks for what someone has done .
Both verbs are conjugated for both the subject ( the one thanked ) and the object ( the one giving thanks ) .
Here are the paradigms for giving thanks for what someone has done and for giving thanks for what someone has said .
( These are in the Stony Creek ( s aik 'ʌ z ) dialect . )
snaʧailja I thank you ( one person ) snaʧaɬʌja I thank you ( two or more people ) nahnaʧailja We ( two ) thank you ( one person ) nahnaʧaɬʌja We ( two ) thank you ( two or more people ) nenaʧailja We ( more than two ) thank you ( one person ) nenaʧaɬʌja We ( more than two ) thank you ( two or more people )
snaʧadindlih I thank you ( one person ) snaʧadahdlih I thank you ( two or more people ) nahnaʧadindlih We ( two ) thank you ( one person ) nahnaʧadahdlih We ( two ) thank you ( two or more people ) nenaʧadindlih We ( more than two ) thank you ( one person ) nenaʧadahdlih We ( more than two ) thank you ( two or more people )
The reason that the subject is the one thanked is that these verbs literally mean something like " you have done me a favour " .
The verb for giving thanks for what someone has said is the appropriate verb for saying " No , thank you " .
Since you are refusing what is being offered to you , you are not giving thanks for receiving something .
Rather , you are giving thanks for the offer , which is something that someone has said .
Far from lacking a way of saying " thank you " , Carrier had , and has , a more highly articulated , finer - grained way of doing so than English or French .
The loan from French is used for relatively casual thanks , and increasingly by semi-speakers and non-speakers , but truly fluent speakers still use the traditional verbs when seriously expressing gratitude .

Faucets of Manhattan

The speed of the excavation process " varies based upon the hardness of the rock it encounters .
The task of determining what type of rock lies in its path falls to Eric Jordan , a geologist hired by the city .
By drilling down and hand - picking rocks from the tunnels , Mr. Jordan has created a precise map of the type of rock under Manhattan .
His involvement in the tunnel project makes his geologist friends jealous .
' For a geologist , ' he said , ' this is like going to Disneyland . ' "

The New Yorker published an excellent article by David Grann called " City of Water , " about , yes , City Tunnel No. 3 .

Until Grann actually accompanied the tunnel workers – called sandhogs – underground , he " had only heard tales of New York City 's invisible empire , an elaborate maze of tunnels that goes as deep as the Chrysler Building is high .
Under construction in one form or another for more than a century , the system of waterways and pipelines spans thousands of miles and comprises nineteen reservoirs and three lakes .
Two main tunnels provide New York City with most of the 1.3 billion gallons of water it consumes each day , ninety per cent of which is pumped in from reservoirs upstate by the sheer force of gravity .
Descending through aqueducts from as high as fourteen hundred feet above sea level , the water gathers speed , racing down to a thousand feet below sea level when it reaches the pipes beneath the city . "
Two main tunnels , he writes – and , thus , City Tunnel No. 3 .
But I 'll stop there – after I point out that toward the end of the ludicrously bad
( For more tunnels : See BLDGBLOG 's London Topological or The Great Man-Made River ; then check out The Guardian on London 's so - called CTRL Project , with a quick visit to that city 's cranky old 19th - century sewers , the " capital 's bowels " ... Enjoy ! ) .
" About 600 feet deep in the bedrock that supports Midtown Manhattan , " we meet " a 450 - ton tunnel - boring machine known as the Mole .
" The Mole is " digging City Tunnel No. 3 far beneath Manhattan 's street level , part of a 50 - year , $ 6 billion project to upgrade New York City 's water system .
"
As the New York Times describes , this is actually the " second phase of City Tunnel No. 3 , a 60 - mile tunnel that began in the Bronx in 1970 and is scheduled for completion in 2020 .
By then , the tunnel will be able to handle the roughly one billion gallons of water a day used in New York City that originates from rural watersheds to points throughout the city . "
And though the tunnel " is one of the largest urban projects in history , few people will ever see it .
But beginning next week , many New Yorkers will certainly feel and hear the construction .
" The speed of the excavation process " varies based upon the hardness of the rock it encounters .
The task of determining what type of rock lies in its path falls to Eric Jordan , a geologist hired by the city .
By drilling down and hand - picking rocks from the tunnels , Mr. Jordan has created a precise map of the type of rock under Manhattan .
His involvement in the tunnel project makes his geologist friends jealous .
' For a geologist , ' he said , ' this is like going to Disneyland .
'" Jordan 's " precise map " of Manhattan bedrock would indeed be something to see ; but until then , we can make an educated guess about the rock his tunnel will find by turning to Richard Fortey .
In his highly recommended book , Earth , Fortey visits Central Park .
First you notice the skyline of towers , he writes .
" Then you notice the rocks .
Cropping out in places under the trees are dark mounds of rock , emerging from the ground like some buried architecture of a former race , partly exhumed and then forgotten ...
That New York can be built so high and mighty is a consequence of its secure foundations on ancient rocks .
It pays its dues to the geology .
This is just a small part of one of those old seams that cross the earth ... relics of a deeper time when millennia counted for nothing .
" John McPhee picks up this lithic line of thought in Annals of the Former World .
Archipelago New York , he writes , is made of " rock that had once been heated near the point of melting , had recrystallized , had been heated again , had recrystallized , and , while not particularly competent , was more than adequate to hold up those buildings ...
Four hundred and fifty million years in age , it was called Manhattan Schist .

Comment " Because my background is physics and economics , I tend to go for data rather than speculation and hand waving , " Chris Anderson told an interviewer recently .
[ * ]
Anderson 's Long
Tail looks like a hit - and has already achieved the first stage of glory that buzzword - based marketing book authors aspire to - being mentioned on daytime TV .
Many authors dream of this , but few achieve it , and the " long tail " is on its way to becoming this year 's " surface area " or " tipping point " .
Or so we thought .
But now that the book is out , and Anderson 's figures are under some critical scrutiny , he 's engaging in quite a flurry of speculation and hand waving .
The subtitle of The Long Tail is " How Endless Choice Is Creating Unlimited Demand " , but his numbers do n't appear to justify such hyperbole .
There 's a knack to getting the buzzword book formula right .
The idea can't be false - but it should n't be falsifiable either .
The idea should be simple enough to be explained by the subtitle , but vague enough to suggest applicability to all kinds of different markets - like a bland , all - occasions scent .
And it must flatter the reader into thinking they are cleverer , and much more special than they were when they began reading the book .
And for the most part , Anderson succeeds .
There is a Tail .
But it 's over the beguiling idea that misses can be profitably aggregated , where it begins to falter .
And as for justifying the subtitle , as Anderson tells it , he 's wildly overstated his case .
Slow selling products have always been successfully aggregated , and in an era when distribution or storage costs can be lowered because the stock no longer consists of physical product , or these costs can be passed on to the consumer , it 's even more true .
The internet , we 've known for some time , allows buyers to find sellers much more easily .
For music lovers , this has resulted in a resurgence of the independent labels ( who pulled off a historic antitrust victory two weeks ago , by thwarting the EMI merger in a European Court ) , and a golden era for small label reissues .
It 's also a boom time for purveyors of specialist pornography - and how much more interesting The Long Tail would have been if it had tackled the economics of digital filth .
The real question raised by Anderson 's 2004 essay for Wired magazine , but not answered by his book , is not whether the " tail " exists , or even how big it is , but " where can it be profitably mined ? "
But now economists suggest that Anderson 's more dramatic extrapolations - for example , " hits matter less " - are barely supported by the evidence he cites , and for this we have the Wall Street Journal 's Lee Gomes to thank .
Anderson 's initial Long Tail essay claimed that 57 per cent of Amazon.com 's sales lie beyond the 100,000 books that make up a typical book store 's physical inventory .
This startling claim was revised downward , because the data was " funky " .
The published book now states " about a quarter of Amazon 's book sales come from outside its top 100,000 titles . "
Lee Gomes ' piece entitled It May Be a Long Time Before the Long Tail Is Wagging the Web shows there are other examples that demonstrate power tipping in the wrong direction , wrong if you 're a Long Tail true believer , to the best - sellers .
eCast , quoted by Anderson , told Gomes that the number of songs that never get played is increasing .
And , as the cost of carrying unplayed inventory rises as a proportion of total costs , the potential profitability declines .
Where there 's a tail , it may not be worth mining .
The Long Tail , then , is n't snake oil .
Rather its restorative properties have been exaggerated .
Who wants to let facts get in the way of a buzzword bestseller good thesis ?
Anderson 's response to Gomes ' analysis has been surprisingly brittle , and quite possibly dishonest , Gomes replies .
For Harvard professor Anita Elberse , who consulted on the book , there 's little more evidence than a " slight shift " .
" MIT 's Erik Brynjolfsson , who told me that there indeed is a shift occurring as things move online , but it's on the order of an 80/20 distribution moving to a 70/30 one , " notes Gomes .
So the Long Tail does n't , as Trackback # 1 on Anderson 's response echoes , show that " supply and demand have been turned upside down . "
As usual , much more interesting evidence has been ignored in the bid to invert conventional economics .
And the author has become a prisoner of his own metaphor .
Take digital music .
As we noted last week , what may be profitable for one model does n't necessarily apply to another model in the same market , subtleties that Anderson saw , but ignored in his eagerness to sell us his paradigm shift .
For example , eMusic CEO David Pakman again pointed out last week that Apple 's iTunes Music increases the importance of the hit : 90 per cent of revenues come from 10 per cent of the catalog .
" It 's made the music industry more reliant on hits .
...
If iTunes was the sole model , it would wildly exacerbate the problem , " he said .
By comparison , eMusic is a subscription service , which invests heavily in editorial expertise , by employing 120 writers .
Profits from the Long Tail do n't just fall out of trees , and attracting subscribers to the niches and obscurities requires care and attention .
Rhapsody , which is correctly cited by Anderson as an example , is a subscription service like eMusic .
But stressing these important points may ruin the Panglossian thesis .
As much of the music business now acknowledges , a bundle , or subscription , is the best way forward .
In Anderson 's defence , he may argue that he 's merely satisfying a demand for feelgood marketing books , and the true purpose of " The Long Tail " is perhaps as a psychological prop .
" The teenager who spends his weekends updating a blog that nobody reads and shooting silly videos to post on YouTube.com ...
He is , as Anderson ’s chapter on ' The New Producers ' tells us , a valiant citizen of the long tail , " the New Yorker 's John Cassidy observed .
And that 's who needs the comfort blanket the most .
Metaphors of heads and tails can also lead us in foolish directions .
Segmenting the market into two leaves no room for a " middle " , and yet it 's from the midlists and indies that much of our cultural richness flows .
Despite the success of the indies mentioned above , it 's far from clear that the net is creating as many small , sustainable businesses here as it is destroying .
For the Long Tail and its true believers , who have a tendency to devalue expertise and creativity , this is heresy - amateurs will surely fill the gap .
Here 's an economics question we'd love to see tackled in the successor to " The Long Tail " , for there must surely be one .
Do False Hopes have an opportunity cost ?
Do Bad Metaphors , too ? ®
Bootnote :
For a facts and figures man who is wary of speculation , Anderson can be quite reckless .
The Wired editor lost a wager with your reporter recently , which he made three years ago .
Anderson bet that by spring of 2006 the sales of WLAN chipsets would exceed sales of cellular ( GSM and CDMA ) chipsets .
He fell short by around a billion units .

Turn on the radio this week and a ghoulish voice from the bowels of the former World Trade Centre seeks to curdle your blood and chill your bones .
It is yet another BBC trailer evoking the horror of the twin towers and the monster of evil , Osama bin Laden .
The corporation is desperate to outdo other media outlets in their commemorations of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 .
They include movies by Oliver Stone and Paul Greengrass , and American and British 9/11 specials from stars such as Harvey Keitel and Kevin Costner called The Millionaire Widows , The Miracle of Staircase B , On Native Soil and numerous variants on twin towers .
There are comic strips and videos and where - was - I - then memoirs .
The weekend is to be wall - to - wall 9/11 .
Not glorifying terrorism ?
You must be joking .
The favourite line from the war on terror 's military - industrial complex is that in 2001 Osama bin Laden " changed the rules of the game " .
( Forgotten is that he attacked the same target in 1993 , his only error being one of civil engineering . )
George Bush repeated the change thesis again on Wednesday in confirming his secret interrogation camps and excusing the five - year delay in bringing al - Qaida suspects to justice .
Tony Blair cites the change with every curb on civil liberty .
The " new " terrorism requires a new approach to public safety .
The security industry cries amen .
Most of this is self - serving drivel .
Nervous rulers have colluded with soldiers and businessmen throughout history to cite some ethnic or religious menace when needing more power and higher taxes .
Political violence has become more promiscuous with suicide bombing and a consequent rise in kill rate per incident , but - as Matthew Carr shows in his book on terror , Unknown Soldiers - the change is one of degree .
Forty years after Alfred Nobel 's invention of dynamite , Russian terrorists tried to pack a plane with the stuff and fly it into the tsar 's palace .
In 1883 Chicago - financed Fenians exploded bombs on the London underground , leading the Times to wonder if the tube could ever be safe .
There has been little change in the preferred weapon of terror , the explosive device , or in the psychopathology of the bomber .
The causes remain the same : separatism , and religious nationalism dressed up as holy war .
What has changed , grotesquely , is the aftershock .
Terrorism is 10 % bang and 90 % an echo effect composed of media hysteria , political overkill and kneejerk executive action , usually retribution against some wider group treated as collectively responsible .
This response has become 24 - hour , seven - day - a - week amplification by the new politico - media complex , especially shrill where the dead are white people .
It is this that puts global terror into the bang .
While we take ever more extravagant steps to ward off the bangs , we do the opposite with the terrorist aftershock .
We turn up its volume .
We seem to wallow in fear .
Were I to take my life in my hands this weekend and visit Osama bin Laden 's hideout in Wherever - istan , the interview would go something like this .
I would ask how things have been for him since 9/11 .
His reply would be that he had worried at first that America would capitalise on the global revulsion , even among Muslims , and isolate him as a lone fanatic .
He was already an " unwelcome guest " among the Afghans , and the Tajiks were out to kill him for the murder of their beloved leader , Ahmed Shah Massoud ( which they may yet do ) .
A little western cunning and he would have been in big trouble .
In the event Bin Laden need not have worried .
He would agree , as did the CIA 's al - Qaida analyst in Peter Taylor 's recent documentary , that the Americans have done his job for him .
They panicked .
They drove the Taliban back into the mountains , restoring the latter 's credibility in the Arab street and turning al - Qaida into heroes .
They persecuted Muslims across America .
They occupied Iraq and declared Iran a sworn enemy .
They backed an Israeli war against Lebanon 's Shias .
Soon every tinpot Muslim malcontent was citing al - Qaida as his inspiration .
Bin Laden 's tiny organisation , which might have been starved of funds and friends in 2001 , had become a worldwide jihadist phenomenon .
I would ask Bin Laden whether he had something special up his sleeve for the fifth anniversary .
Why waste money , he would reply .
The western media were obligingly re-enacting the destruction and the screaming , turning the base metal of violence into the gold of terror .
They would replay the tapes and rerun the footage ad nauseam , and thus remind the world of his awesome power .
Americans are more afraid of jihadists this year than last .
In a Transatlantic Trends survey , the number of them describing international terrorism as an " extremely important threat " went up from 72 % to 79 % .
As for European support for America 's world leadership , that has plummeted from 64 % in 2002 to 37 % this year .
Bin Laden might boast that he had achieved terrorism 's equivalent of an atomic chain reaction : a self - regenerating cycle of outrage and foreign - policy overkill , aided by anniversary journalism and fuelled by the grim scenarios of security lobbyists .
He now had only to drop an occasional CD into the offices of al - Jazeera , and Washington and London quaked with fear .
The authorities could be reduced to million - dollar hysterics by a phial of nail varnish , a copy of the Qur'an , or a dark - skinned person displaying a watch and a mobile phone .
A feature of democracy is freedom of information and speech .
News of violence cannot be concealed since concealment fuels the climate of fear .
The state should not censor news of terrorist incidents .
As Milan Kundera asserted , " the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting " .
But there are ways of not forgetting .
A feature of democracy is also to reject arrest without trial , reject the use of torture , and reject retaliatory violence against people or groups .
Democracy can apparently sacrifice these legal principles to guard against the 10 % of terrorism that is bang .
Why not restrain the publicity that fuels the other 90 % , the aftershock ?
The boundary between news and scaremongering may be hard to define .
But so is any boundary between liberty and security .
What is so sacred about publicising terror as against habeas corpus ?
Conceding the kudos of state censorship to jihadists should be as unthinkable as conceding arrest without trial .
That does not excuse the politico - media complex from any responsibility for caution , a sense of proportion and self - restraint .
The gruelling re-enactment of the London bombings in July and this weekend 's 9/11 horror - fest are not news .
They exploit grief and horror , and in doing so give gratuitous publicity to Bin Laden and al - Qaida .
Those personally affected by these outrages may have their own private memorials .
But to hallow the events with repetitious publicity turns a squalid crime into a constantly revitalised political act .
It grants the jihadists what they most crave , warrior status .
It more than validates terrorism as a weapon of war , it glorifies it .
The best way to commemorate 9/11 is with silence .
Instead , Bin Laden must be laughing .

When we first saw Levere ’s photographs from his book New York Changing — reshooting Berenice Abbott ’s 1930s pictures of New York City — we were amazed , blown away by how modern Manhattan has changed .
From the introduction to Levere ’s book :
Rephotography is a tricky idea — at least it was for me .
Ours is a culture that prizes originality ; I grew up believing that inspiration had to come from within .
While it was fine to pay homage to the acknowledged giants , stalking a ghost would be the act of an obsessive .
I reacted quite negatively in 1994 when my friend Ellen Carey , professor of art at Hartford College , introduced me to the idea of choosing a photographic mentor and taking his work “ beyond his life and into ours . ”
Three years later , I began to understand what she meant .
I was at an auction preview filled with images by Man Ray , Ansel Adams , Weegee , Avedon — all brilliant ; but what stopped me in my tracks was Abbott ’s vintage contact print Broadway near Broome Street , photographed in 1935 , from “ Changing New York . ”
I lived on Broome Street .
Here I stood , unexpectedly looking at the view outside my building , taken six decades before .
I could not help but compare and contrast .
And before long I was imagining what my camera would see .
Almost every building Abbott had photographed still stood , but Broome Street back then was a two - way street paved with cobblestones .
The trendy shoe store I passed every day was once the Bank of Sicily Trust .
The kosher dairy restaurant in the lower right - hand corner of the photograph revealed that observant Jews in black suits populated the area that was now a major retail location .
I realized I had been living in the illusion of a permanent now .
My ultra - happening Broome Street would look quaint and dusty six decades into the future .
As you can see in the gallery , nothing in New York remains fixed , all stores ( except Macy ’s ) are replaced , even the bridges are up for tinkering .
We asked Levere about the project and his process .
* * *
Did you have trouble tracking down the different locations shot in the book ?
Not really .
Abbott had listed the addresses of the locations often with cross streets named as well .
Were any scenes impossible to rephotograph ?
I decided to photograph only when there was “ something ” that remained .
Even just a fire hydrant or a manhole cover .
So that the viewer could look and see in the pair something that remained to “ author ” or confirm the relationship between the images in comparison .
By spending so much time with Abbott ’s pictures , are there aspects of New York life in the 30’s that you feel nostalgic for ?
I have a great appreciation for the architecture of the 30’s .
And with having studied American architectural history of the 19th and 20th century , New York City is like an open book for me every time I walk down the street .
I would n’t say nostalgic as much as appreciative of the craft and quality that was created during that time period .
New Yorkers are used to seeing buildings torn down and then replaced in a few months — what do you think are the subtler changes we miss ?
What shows up after 70 years ?
My interests are connected to how buildings change and are reused throughout their lives .
A cornice is removed , a door or window removed .
An extra floor added or subtracted .
Commercial becomes residential — the life beyond the original architect ’s vision .
So when good buildings are just removed and replaced by newer bigger “ better ” structures in NYC , too often the results sadden me .
I miss the texture , depth , hand - craft , and human relationship of older buildings .
I realize to stand still is to move backwards , but architecture today in NYC today too often feels like it is only creating wealth and almost nothing to do with creating community .
The Nobel Peace Prize vs. Peace and Prosperity
Last Friday , the Grameen Bank and its founder , Bangladeshi banker and economist Muhammad Yunus , were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “ for their efforts to create economic and social development from below . ”
The Nobel Peace Prize committee is certainly right in asserting that lasting peace requires the breaking out of poverty of large population groups .
The devastating effects of foreign development aid in the past decades have also demonstrated the need for economic development from below .
Is the Grameen Bank thus an important contribution to this kind of development and to the end of poverty and war ?
The causes for war and poverty can in most cases be traced back to state activities .
The case of Bangladesh is no exception .
The Bangladesh Liberation War , which led to the birth of Bangladesh in 1971 , claimed up to three million civilian casualties according to some estimates .
It is the direct result of the British rule in India .
After India gained independence , Muslim - majority areas in the east and west of the Indian subcontinent were joined in a separate country , Pakistan .
The Eastern zone was subsequently treated much worse by the central government than the Western zone .
This finally resulted in the Bangladesh Liberation War .
During the decade following the creation of Bangladesh , the country experienced a series of bloody coups and counter - coups .
Today , some of the main obstacles to economic growth in Bangladesh include inefficient state - owned enterprises , slow implementation of economic reforms , political infighting and corruption .
Furthermore , Bangladeshi agriculture is also threatened by intellectual property laws on seeds , granting benefits to transnational corporations at the expense of local farmers .
This clearly shows that the State cannot be trusted to defend peace and prosperity .
However , the Grameen Bank is , contrary to popular belief , an institution which relies heavily on state subsidies and its methods are not as much of an example of development from below as one would hope .
The Grameen Bank received its first major loan of $ 3.4 million from the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development .
Since then , it has received grants and subsidized loans from the governments of Canada , Germany , Norway , and Sweden and from the IMF and the World Bank .
The high repayment rates by the debtors are achieved through methods which could be called coercive .
The borrowers are grouped into cells of five .
Future loans , which are much higher than the first one , are only granted if each member of the cell has repaid his or her first loan .
This creates an incentive for each member of the cell to make sure everyone pays back their loans — how they do this is up to them .
The repayment rates for second - time borrowers are much lower even though employees of the Grameen Bank monitor all borrowers door - to - door on a weekly basis .
In addition to these unusual methods , the borrowers have to chant the “ Sixteen Decisions ” during parades , which express the worldview of the Grameen Bank .
Decision 16 reads as follows : “ We shall take part in all social activities collectively . ”
Other Decisions emphasize the attempt of the Grameen Bank to emancipate Bangladeshi women from the traditionally patriarchal structures .
This seeming emancipation and financial independence come at the price , though , of dependency on the Grameen Bank , which turns out to be less of a bank and more of a cult .
Thus , Muhammad Yunus ’ Grameen
Bank is not so much an example of economic and social development from below as of control from above , subsidized by various states and institutions .
Real economic and social development from below can only take place when people are allowed full liberty , when fully voluntary market transactions can replace control from above .
This , of course , requires the abolition of the State as one of the main causes of poverty brought about by its open aggression against its citizens and more subtle forms of aggression such as its relations with transnational corporations .
Only when the State ’s central monopoly of force is abolished can humanity live in peace and prosperity .

This graph shows that the probability of observing a value of lambda equal to or greater than the measured value ( dashed vertical line ) is very small .
The three lines represent the anthropically predicted probability density distribution as a function of R , the ratio of the cosmological constant in another part of the multiverse to that in our Universe in Starkman and Trotta ’s MANO scheme .
T controls the cosmic time when intelligent life emerges , with T=1 representing our Universe .
Credit : American Physical Society .
Many scientists never liked it anyway , and now Glenn Starkman from Oxford / Case Western and Roberto Trotta from Oxford show that too many details — and too many unknowns — mean that anthropic reasoning gives inconsistent values of the cosmological constant , some that are far from current estimates .
In their recent paper , “ Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Lambda ” ( Physical Review Letters ) , Starkman and Trotta find that different ways of defining the probability of observers in different universes leads to vastly different predictions of the cosmological constant .
“ The significance of our work is to offer a concrete example of how anthropic methods of reasoning can be used to reach conclusions contradictory to those usually arrived at , ” Starkman told PhysOrg.com .
“ This suggests to us that anthropic explanations of fundamental questions should be treated very cautiously . ”
According to the Anthropic Principle , the fact that we are here to observe the universe explains why the laws of nature are what they are .
Some scientists point to a great deal of coincidences to support this idea : the perfect strength and relation of the four forces ; the many components producing carbon - based life ; and the energy density of the universe driving its expansion ( aka “ lambda ” ) .
Add all this up , proponents argue , and it ’s pretty unlikely that you should be here today .
Not to mention that the Anthropic Principle seems to fit nicely with many popular theories , such as string theory and the multiverse .
Prior to Starkman and Trotta , people have taken issue with anthropic reasoning , although most of these arguments have been qualitative ( with exception of a few very recent studies ) .
For instance , explaining that things are what they are because of the way things are , does n’t seem to get us anywhere .
In addition , anthropic reasoning narcisstically ignores the possibility of non-carbon - based life .
And why must the universe have been created to support life — why not see it as humans adapting to the universe , since natural selection decides which types of life are the best survivors ?
“ The less we rely on anthropic reasoning , the better , ” is Starkman ’s opinion .
“ But on the other hand , in using anthropic reasoning , we might , with great caution , agree on what makes life absolutely impossible .
However , we should be entirely skeptical of arguments about what life makes more probable . ”
In their study , Starkman and Trotta attempt to use anthropic reasoning to explain the value of the cosmological constant , which controls the universe ’s expansion rate .
What is the probability that an observer makes a measurement of this value in a given universe ?
they ask .
First , one must find the number of observers in that universe ( automatically eliminating those universes incompatible with intelligent life ) .
Then one must figure out how many measurements each one
could make .
The question of the paper , then , is how to determine the number of observers in a universe and the number of measurements they could make — a number that cannot be measured directly , but which one must try to deduce despite the large number of unknown contributing factors .
There are so many factors ( e.g. number density of galaxies , baryons in halos , holographic arguments ) , in fact , that Starkman and Trotta argue that one ’s prediction of the cosmological constant with anthropic reasoning depends “ enormously ” on the different ways of weighting all the factors .
Because no single weighting scheme provides a fundamental advantage over any others , they argue , this lack of definition disqualifies anthropic reasoning .
To demonstrate , Starkman and Trotta introduce a new weighting factor called the “ maximum number of allowed observations ” ( MANO ) in a universe .
“ This maximum number is the product of two factors — the number of observers and the maximum number of observations that each observer can make , ” the scientists write in their study .
Starkman and Trotta limit the number of observations per observer by calculating the maximum number of thermodynamic processes a living thing could perform in a lifetime under ideal conditions .
Based on this energy - consuming picture , the scientists then limit the number of observers so that each can utilize all the energy in its surroundings without having to share ( called the “ rare observer limit ” ) .
They explain that if the number of observers increased , the energy per observer would decrease due to competition , waste , warfare , and thus wasted energy .
Of course , the real outcome of overpopulation is unpredictable — but , the paper argues , this inability to predict the results of higher observer density further compromises the abilities of anthropic reasoning .
Finally , the result which this anthropic reasoning gives : Starkman and Trotta measure that the probability of the anthropically predicted lambda being greater than or equal to the currently observed value ( about 0.7 ) is one in 100,000 .
This result differs dramatically from the anthropic predictions proposed by Steven Weinberg , in predictions from 1989 ( in his seminal paper on anthropic reasoning ) , to the present .
Weinberg predicted a result larger than ( though more similar to ) current observations .
Still other approaches have predicted much larger values .
Starkman and Trotta explain that at least two assumptions of anthropic reasoning contribute to its flawed results .
At its most basic level , anthropic reasoning uses the concept of probability to place limits on lambda .
Perhaps , though , probability cannot apply to the entire universe , as the universe is not a lab where repeatable experiments are performed .
Secondly , as the scientists write , anthropic reasoning depends heavily “ on poorly understood microphysical processes involved in the evolution of life , especially of conscious beings interested in making observations of the fundamental constants . ”
Even expert biologists can hardly be sure of the various intelligence levels of animals on this planet .
As a far - fetched illustration , we ca n’t eliminate the possibility that ants ( or more aptly , aliens ) will one day make their own measurements of the cosmological constant , can we ?
However , just because scientists have not found a weighting factor that would give an accurate prediction of lambda , might not rule out the possibility that a “ correct ” weighting factor could , in principle , exist .
Starkman and Trotta have their doubts , though , not only on this possibility , but also on how valuable knowing the factor would be .
“ I think that , if such a possibility exists , then it has to be explored from the point of view of probability theory as logic , i.e. starting from fundamental reasoning principles and working our way upward toward a physical prediction , ” said Trotta .
“ As our work demonstrates , attacking the problem from the other end will only give us answers that depend completely on the assumptions we put into our calculations .
As such , those answers would probably have little relation with the physical reality and origin of our Universe . ”
“ If there is a correct weighting factor ( and I doubt that there is ) I think we 're unlikely to be able to know what it is for such a very long time that we'd be better off trying to actually explain the universe we see , ” said Starkman , “ rather than arguing that it is the way it is so that we could be here to observe it . ”

" What ’s that Hissing Sound ? ” headlines a piece in the Economist :
“ The boom has lifted the ( U.S. ) economy in three ways : it has boosted residential construction : it has made people feel wealthier and so encouraged them to spend more ; and it has allowed homeowners to use their property as a gigantic cash machine , taking out money by borrowing against their capital gains .
Merrill Lynch estimates that the three together accounted for more than half of America ’s total GDP growth since last year .
“ Counting construction , finance , and estate agency , the housing boom has been responsible for one - third of all the jobs created since 2001 .
If house - price rises level off , GDP growth could dip below 2 % in 2007 .
If prices fall , expect a steeper slowdown . ”
Since it is now in the Economist , it ’s official — housing is in trouble .
But will prices actually go down ?
We have a report directly from one of the hottest markets in the country , south Florida :
“ We just missed it .
The time to sell was a year ago .
A guy came along and offered us $ 500,000 for that place we bought .
We paid $ 450,000 for it two years ago .
Our timing could n’t have been worse .
We expected to tear down the house and build a new one … and we were sure we ’d make a couple hundred thousand in profit .
Minimum .
But you warned us .
And we did n’t listen .
And then , we got that offer for $ 500,000 and turned it down .
We thought we could get much more .
But that was then and this is now …
I ’d be happy to get back what we have in it .
But we ca n’t even get anyone to look at it . ”
Paul Kasriel says it ’s the worst supply / demand equation of residential real estate in 34 years .
Sales in July were down more than a fifth .
Inventories were up more than a fifth .
And a lot of real estate investors are now going to the liquor store to get another fifth .
They wish they could turn the clock back a few months and unload properties at last year ’s prices .
But maybe the situation is not as bad as it looks .
The New York Times reported the news last week that real estate downturns in England and Australia have been surprisingly mild .
And now , Business Week has a big story entitled “ Housing : The Roof Wo n’t Collapse On The U.S. Economy . ”
According to Business
Week , housing can go a little soft without damaging the economy too severely .
That view has become the mainstream dream .
What do we know ; maybe it will turn out to be true .
As our friend John Mauldin points out , we usually muddle through .
Usually , tomorrow is like today .
Usually , nothing too bad or too good … happens .
Usually , things are average , ordinary , common , and regular .
But wait , there is nothing ordinary about this housing bubble .
In the space of less than 10 years , according to Robert Shiller ’s index , the real value of residential property doubled .
And householders doubled up their debt , too .
Neither are things that happen every day ; in fact , they ’ve never happened before !
We are not looking into a crystal ball here .
We are just putting two and two together .
If things are usually usual , then when they are unusually unusual , they are probably more likely to become usual again , rather than become more unusually unusual .
That seems so obvious to us , we wo n’t bother to explain it .
And when housing prices become usual , then the poor sap who has bet his house on something extraordinary is likely to be in a tight spot .
And since the entire U.S. economy , and by extension the entire world economy , depends on him being able to continue to spend , then they ’re all in a tight spot .
Yes , the whole world economy now depends on a man who spends money he does n’t have — money of no sure value — on what he surely can’t afford , and which he probably does n’t need anyway .
He can only do so as long as his house rises in price .
And now , that the rise in housing prices has come to an end .
What next ?
Everyone has come to expect slowing real estate gains .
The boom is over ; everyone seems to think so .
So , where is the surprise ?
Where ’s the money to be made …or lost ?
Again , we do n’t know .
But in August 1982 , Business
Week famously predicted that the equity market was finished .
Now , in August 2006 , BW tells us not to worry : the roof will not collapse .
BW might not be right , but it might be consistent ; the roof might blow up .

What ’s one of the simple joys of life on the Farmlet ?
Kevin and I relish the freedom to line - dry our laundry in the fresh air .
For much of my life , I might have taken an outdoor clothesline for granted .
That was before I went to live in Irvine , Southern California .
Can you ever be too far away from Irvine ?
Back in Irvine , the student housing complex where I lived forbade subversive practices like air - drying laundry .
( Such rules are commonplace around Irvine , and not just in student housing . )
One was supposed to use the expensive coin - operated tumble dryers they ’d supplied , of course .
Coming to New Zealand from Southern California , we really think it ’s nice to be able to dry our laundry
a ) without wasting energy ,
b ) without being threatened with sanctions by angry bureaucrats , and
c ) without fearing we ’ll be branded as enemy combatants .
Recently , we have had to build a new clothesline .
Our old clothesline died a sad death when we cut down the gum trees that were threatening to fall on our roof every time the wind blew .
With no clothesline , we resorted to hanging our laundry to dry on the fences .
This was fine for small items , but did n’t work so well for big items like sheets .
I was afraid we might end up with no clean sheets and a very stinky bed if we did n’t make a new clothesline soon .
We are pleased with the new clothesline .
It ’s made with scavenged timber and rope , but we had to buy a bit more rope , as well as the concrete for the post holes .
In the end , it was very inexpensive to make — especially compared with a tumble dryer .
And then there ’s the matter of the electricity it does n’t use .
. .
Kevin and I do not have a washing machine or tumble dryer here on the Farmlet .
Our laundry setup is very basic :
One large plastic tub
One plunger
One garden hose
Water
One bottle of plant - based non-toxic laundry soap
One clothesline
One basket of clothes pegs
Wash cycle
Closeup of our washing “ machine ”
Originally , we were using a toilet plunger ( it had n’t been used in a toilet ) to plunge our laundry .
Lo and behold , when we were helping my parents to move , we unearthed a fine copper laundry plunger !
Mum says she thinks it may have belonged to my great grandmother .
My parents have very generously allowed us to bring the laundry plunger to the Farmlet for safekeeping — and for much enthusiastic use !
Believe me , it ’s much easier to use and does a better job than the toilet plunger .
We now feel that we have a deluxe laundry system .
There is one more aspect of the laundry system that still needs to be put in place : Back in February , I bought an antique hand wringer .
We have it here in the garage , but need to find a suitably sturdy bench or stand to mount it on .

The pods have been designed so four people can dine inside
It has two bedrooms , a lounge , a dining room , a kitchen and a bathroom , and it is just 9ft by 9ft by 9ft .
The mini-home is already being looked at by a number of local authorities in Britain as way of dealing with short term shortages in accommodation .
It could also be a self - contained home for elderly relatives or teenagers and can be sited in a garden .
Inside the cube , the entrance lobby also doubles as a shower and a toilet .
A double bed folds down over the lounge area which within seconds can be turned into a dining room that can seat four people or even a spare bedroom .
The seats are also storage cupboards and can be cleared away to create a space in which three or four people can dance to the inbuilt surround sound system .
Small village
The structure has been designed around ideas from 200 architecture students and a small village is now being set up in the campus of Munich University .
It 's very comfortable , a maximum of comfort in this minimal cube
Dieter Massberg
Munich University
The university is keen to test the idea as it has around 90,000 students and only around 10,000 apartments .
It has already tried using sea containers as flats but the new micro-house is half their size .
The pods can be stacked on one another or laid out in small colonies .
The architects behind the scheme say they are perhaps too small to live in permanently but can offer everything someone would need for a few months before they find a permanent home .
The buildings can be carried on the back of a truck and it is hoped they will provide local authorities with a way of using plots of land that are vacant for a few years , especially those awaiting development .
The head of the university 's student accommodation , Dieter Massberg , said : " I am sure I can live in this house , not for some years but for some months .
" It 's very comfortable , a maximum of comfort in this minimal cube .
It 's a very intelligent construction . "

His latest book , Linux Phrasebook , is in stores now .
Players of Blizzard 's incredibly popular World of Warcraft are reporting the outbreak of a virtual plague that is spreading across major cities in the virtual land of Azeroth , infecting player characters at an alarming rate .
The trouble started when Blizzard programmers added a new instance , which is a separate area connected to the outside world that players can enter and attempt unique quests .
One of these instances , Zul ' Grub , contained the god of blood , Hakkar .
Hakkar was a powerful foe that could cast spells of his own , including a spell called Corrupted Blood .
This spell did a large amount of damage to any player within the vicinity of the casting , and the effects lingered on after the spell was over .
What happened next was something Blizzard did not expect .
Some of the players who had gone into the instance emerged back into the main world of Azeroth , and started spreading the Corrupted Blood disease to others who they came into close contact with .
The infection soon spread into many of the cities and towns in the virtual world .
Since the disease was intended to be a danger to powerful players , it tended to kill those less than level 50 almost instantly .
Game masters ( GMs ) tried to quarantine certain players from moving into new areas , but they kept escaping the quarantine and moving on to infect other people .
A patch was issued to try and mitigate the damage , but it did not have the desired effect .
According to a Blizzard poster on the WoW forums :
It appears that the hotfix remedy concocted to combat the recent Azerothian outbreak has not yielded desired results .
At this time , our medical staff is continuing to develop an effective cure .
We look forward to ensuring the health and vitality of the citizens of Azeroth in the near future .
The most interesting thing about this " outbreak " is perhaps the reaction it has provoked among WoW players .
Instead of being angry about the deleterious effects of a bug , many are treating this as an exciting and unprecedented event in the WoW universe .
It would be even more interesting if epidemiologists in the real world found that this event was worthy of studying as a kind of controlled experiment in disease propagation .
Squash player Vicky Botwright has been advised against wearing a thong at this year 's British Open Championships in Birmingham .
The 16th seed , who revealed her choice of outfit at the championships , has had to abandon plans to wear her preferred choice of clothing - a sports bra and thong - on court .
Women 's International Squash Players ' Association ( Wispa ) rules stipulate the players must wear either a skirt or a dress - but does not mention underwear .
But squash officials believe the 23 - year - old 's revealing outfit would prove to be too much of a distraction for referees .
Speaking to Radio Five Live , Botwright said : " I approached Andrew Shelley , who is the chairperson of the Wispa , if us girls were allowed to wear skimpier clothing .
" Squash always seemed to be skirt and top or dress - it 's quite boring really , we need to attract a wider audience
Vicky Botwright
" He saw the clothing and said ' not really ' , but he said he would put it to the board and see what they said .
" The board had a meeting but they still came back and said ' no ' . "
Botwright denied accusations of copying tennis pin-up Anna Kournikova , the Russian star who has made her name with her looks and racy outfits .
But the Manchester - born squash player believed allowing more revealing clothing would inject a renewed enthusiasm for the sport .
" Squash sometimes gets left behind the times , " she added .
" You look at other sports like athletics where they wear little bra tops and running knickers and you look at tennis and they are all trendy - they are becoming more revealing .
" Squash always seemed to be skirt and top or dress - it 's quite boring really , we need to attract a wider audience . "
And if wearing less is the way forward for squash to become a mainstream sport , then Botwright is in full support .
" I do n't think squash can complain about what anyone takes an interest in because we are a minority sport - any interest is good interest . "
So , we ’ve been denied our insurance claim .
When we were kids , we used to take great pleasure in writing A.C.A.B on our knuckles as if we were dead hard bovver boys .
That sweeping generalisation of the local ( and probably national ) constabulary ( A.C.A. B stands for all coppers are bastards ) can now be applied to insurers , or more specifically one : Direct Line .
Related Direct
Line are paying up
This evening I received a phone call from UK Assistance , Direct Line ’s claims advisors , the upshot of which is that we will be getting our …
So , having endured the fact some other little shysters have been in our flat and nicked several grands worth of gear , we ’ve had our insurers turn down our claim .
Why Loz , why ?
Well , I ’ll tell you , just as soon as I finish scribbling A.I.A.B on my knuckles …
The claim
Having reported our recent break in trauma to the coppers ( who were definately not bastards ) we went about alerting the Insurance company , which in our case is Direct Line .
They said they would send a nice man round the following Friday .
Friday arrives and so does the claims advisor .
We sit for an hour or so as I show him credit card reciepts , manuals , boxes and other things to prove that we actually owned the stuff that was nicked .
At the end of the conversation he tells me that it wont be a problem , and suppliers would be contacting me to replace the stolen items .
Brilliant I think – what a relief .
Later in the day ( around 6ish ) I check my voice mail on my mobile to discover a message from the insurance claims advisor telling me that , in actual fact , we were not covered because of an endorsement on the policy .
A ‘ wringing ’ endorsement : ‘ forced ’ but not ‘ violent ’
This endorsement turns out to be one that states our policy is only valid if the break in is ‘ forced and violent ’ .
What does that mean then ?
Thumbing through the handbook , I found no description , so I tried the Direct Line website .
Still nothing .
Even a Google search yielded nothing to give us any clarity .
Phoning the guy back , I got the description ( he read it to me , so it exists somewhere ) , which basically boils down to this : if someone enters your flat , even with a key , it can be argued that it is forced as they are unauthorised , but for it to be violent there was to be visible damage to either the door or frame .
As our locks had been slipped with whatever bit of plastic they used , there was no damage to door nor frame , and as a result of the criminals being good at their jobs , a denial of our claim .
In the end then , it boils down to one word – ‘ violent ’ .
That ’s what ’s stopping us getting our money .
So what next ?
Well clearly we are going to appeal .
We are drafting a letter to send to Direct Line at the end of this week hopefully .
I also spoke to a very friendly woman on Monday about the taking ‘ forced and violent entry ’ endorsement off , to which she replied ‘ Are you having any building work done ?
Otherwise I do n’t understand why it ’s there ’ .
When I told her no , she said that she could n’t understand why it was on the policy in the first place .
She then put me on hold and went to talk to her boss .
When she came back she told me that they had removed it as they saw no reason for it to be there in the first place .
I asked if it was a standard clause and she told me no , and reiterated that it ’s usually only on properties that are having building work undertaken on them .
Also , the nice lady told me that there should have been a note detailing why the endorsement was placed on the policy , but there was n’t one , so she could n’t tell me why it had been put on .
Great .
So the one thing that is stopping us getting our money is n’t actually supposed to be there .
Loyal or stupid ?
I ’ve been a loyal customer with Direct Line for about seven years now , both at my current flat , and when I used to live with Sissop .
It sounds cheesy , but being a designer I am easily swayed by such things as good solid branding , especially if you can pull of the masterstroke of sonic branding , without turning into an irritant – that ’s you Intel .
As such , that ’s about 1.5 grand of money paid out to them for cover , that when it came down to it , was worth nothing .
Add the price of the replacement locks and we ’re looking at more like 2 grand .
And that ’s without adding in the stuff that was half inched and the loss of a days contracting for me to stay at home to meet the claims advisor .
If anyone reads this , I would advise you to go and check your policy documents asap and make sure that you ’re not going to get shafted in the same way we have been .
Home De-Scheming MIT ?
Will freshman scheming be the same if their schemes are more about robots and less about Scheme ?
The MIT is going to change its curriculum structure that was famous for teaching Scheme in introductory courses .
One force behind the reform is no one else than Harold Abelson , famous for his marvelous Scheme opus SICP .
But why changing ?
The new curriculum is designed with three goals in mind : greater flexibility in requirements , better integration of electrical engineering and computer science , and more depth to better prepare students for graduate school or real - world design challenges , he said .
And programming language wise : Content - wise , the class is a mix as well .
The first four weeks of C1 will be a lot like the first four weeks of 6.001 , Abelson said .
The difference is that programming will be done in Python and not Scheme .
A sign of the times ?

Burj Dubai Tower Update
The Burj Dubai tower in the United Arab Emirates is quietly progressing on its goal of being the tallest building in the world .
I thought their website was a bit over the top ( " only a few structures have had the power to change history " ) , but then I read this interesting statement :
" At the crossroads of India and the Middle East , equidistant between Europe and Asia , Dubai is fast becoming the financial and cultural hub for over a billion people .
At the centre of that hub stands the most exclusive address in the world . "
You can't say they do n't have a vision .
Remarkably , the inspiration for the tower comes from - a flower .
The Hymenocallis is a plant widely cultivated in Dubai , India and around the region .
It 's harmonious structure is one of the organizing principles for the design .
The building is now springing upward from its foundation , which consists of 192 piles constructed to depths of more than 50 meters , bound together by a 3.7 meter thick concrete raft across 8,000 square metres , and encompasses the towers entire footprint .
The total concrete poured into the foundation ( over 45,000 cubic meters ) weighs more than 110,000 tons .
The high performance exterior cladding system will be employed to withstand the extreme temperatures during the summer months in Dubai .
Primary materials include reflective glazing , aluminum and textured stainless steel spandrel panels and the vertical stainless tubular fins accentuating the height and the slenderness of the tower .
When completed Burj Dubai will hold the record in all four categories as recognized by the New York - based global authority - Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat  highest structure , roof , antenna and occupied floor .
Science fiction writers have created vast structures ; for example , in Tower of Glass , a 1970 novel by Robert Silverberg , a six kilometer - high tower is constructed .
( This novel also has the first use of the cyberpunk term " jack in . " ) .
SF writers also create structures that are not only based on animals or plants , but which actually incorporate living animals or plants .
The float - home from Frank Herbert 's 1969 novel Whipping Star is actually constructed using a very large mammalian lifeform .

Thanks to Petter Nilsson , a candidate of the Swedish TV show Toppkandidaterna ( Top candidates ) , the Piratebay just won over 6000 $ .
Petter Nilsson said earlier that he would donate over 6000 $ ( 20 % of the total prize money ) to The Piratebay if he won .
The contestants of the show had to pretend they were a politician and convince the public of their ideas .
Petter was pro-filesharing , and won .
Petter said :
“ So when I donate my money to Pirate Bay , it ’s because I also want to be able to download music and movies for myself . ”
The Piratebay is planning to invest the money in a new database ( HP DL145 G2 , 4 gig RAM , 2 x Optron DualCore 2.2 GHz ) and an new search ( HP DL145 G2 , 4 gig RAM , 1 x Optron DualCore 2.2 GHz ) server .
Petter would be a good candidate to lead the Swedish Pirate Party “ piratpartiet ” and pursue his political aspirations .
Good job Petter !

The new device allows people to read on the move
Called the K - NFB , it is the latest product to be developed by American inventor Raymond Kurzweil .
Until now , scanning and text - to - speech output meant having to take the printed material to the hardware .
The K - NFB , which combines a PDA and a digital camera , means that people will be able to read menus , train timetables and product labels in shops .
High price tag
The new handheld device is the latest in a long line of hardware and software developed by Raymond Kurzweil .
His first Reading Machine in 1981 was the size of a washing machine and cost £ 35,000 .
For the first time , you 'll be able to take the scanner to the print rather than the other way around
Mark Prouse , RNIB
" This has probably taken something like three years ' effort by some fairly diligent scientists , " explained Mervin Robertson , managing director of Sight & Sound Technology , who will be selling the device in the UK .
" Effectively , it 's a software cost that makes up the vast majority of this . "
The K - NFB gives the user an initial " situation report " , describing what it can see .
The user then makes a decision about whether to take a picture .
After a few seconds to process the image , the contents of the document are read aloud .
A set of earbuds come as standard , but the sound could also be routed through a Bluetooth headset or a set of speakers .
Sight & Sound says it will help with the ad - hoc reading of documents such as bills and receipts , instructions on food packaging or medication or emergency evacuation notices in hotels .
According to Mr Robertson , the biggest limitation is the power of the host PDA .
" It 's never going to be the powerful device that the PC is , " he said .
The prototype has also experienced difficulties reading inverted text , for example white text on a black background .
But Sight & Sound is confident that bugs will be ironed out before the production version goes on sale .
Good reception
Manufacturers have decided not to use the Pocket PC 2003 platform and have opted for Mobile 5 instead .
In the early eighties the hardware was bulky
" That is challenging in itself for a blind person . "
Using Mobile 5 will effectively keep the device intact if the battery goes dead .
The K - NFB received an enthusiastic initial welcome from a member of the Royal National Institute of the Blind 's ( RNIB ) products and publications team , Mark Prouse .
" This is fantastic .
For the first time , you 'll be able to take the scanner to the print rather than the other way around , " he said .
" The price is a bit of an issue , it is with all of these things .
But to be able to read as and when you want is very exciting and very tempting . "
There has been much said and written about work / life balance .
As a father of three long grownup children , I have had all those struggles with my own conscience , and with the various family members .
But each person has to manage that in their own way .
For a person in an operating company , personal life and work are the two elements that need balance .
But for a venture capitalist , there is often as great a need for work / work balance .
I am often involved in several dozen companies at any time of my life .
Whether as a board member , investor , or evaluating for potential investment , I have to balance the extent of my resources given to each of them .
One thing I have learned after all these years is that my own time is by far the scarcest resource .
Balancing the various demands on that time among the various companies is never simple .
The nature of venture investing , and the psychic reward , comes from nurturing the management team and the product .
The best venture capitalists are always emotionally invested in the companies and people they back .
My wife has often commented of my speaking about " my " companies , even though I may only have 1 or 2 % economic ownership .
How should one balance working on one company versus another ?
If you do not actively manage the time , you become a crisis manager , responding only when there is a crisis .
This is often way out of proportion to what an economically rational being should do .
The crises in early stage companies often revolve around running out of cash - increasing the probability of zero return .
But spending most of your mental energy on these events keeps you from putting time into those that can become big winners and more than pay for the one or two you reluctantly have to shut .
I recommend keeping a sorted list of all the companies you are working on .
I use a spreadsheet listing the company , CEO 's name and phone contacts , ownership , quick assessment ( A , B , C ) , and potential value ( market capitalization - subjective assessment ) and contact frequency ( daily , weekly , monthly , board only ) .
I try to allocate my time so that I touch base with each company at the appropriate frequency .
This increases with both success and problems .
If success , I try to help maximize it , since that will improve my overall return for investors ,
If big problems , I try to help solve or head them off .
By doing both , I do n't get psychically drained by focusing only on troubled situations .
Email has made for maximum availability to the various CEOs and investors - and I try to keep my inbox to fewer than 30 items at any time .
This often means late hours ( work / life balance issue ) , or cleaning things up on weekends .
It means getting people used to interacting via email so that the physical meeting time can be spent about 1 / 4 on looking at new situations and investments and not as much on the telephone .
Managing work / work balance also means managing my own guilt when I 'm not able to respond quickly or incisively enough .
And some of the entreprenuers play on that guilt to tip the balance in their favor when the rational me says I 've spent enough time of their problem .
Does it work ?
It 's a lot better now than it was when I started as a VC 25 years ago , even though I have 3 times as many investments .
Technology ( email , cellphone , web ) , air travel ( costs are half of what they were in the 80s ) , and the savvy of entreprenuers have all contributed to making it possible .
Do I allocate to maximize investment or psychic rewards ?
I think I have erred a little on the pyschic reward side , but only a little .
And the investment rewards have been substantial .
Are all " my " CEO 's happy about the fraction they get ?
Probably not , but I think most understand the cost / benefit equation of working with me .
The final key to making it work is the ability to delegate .
Having great partners at Idealab and FirstRound means that I can turn to others when the true overload sets in - a luxury I did not have 1989 - 1998 .
And that provides the best work / work balance .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In testing the most expensive group of cars the magazine has ever purchased , Consumer Reports rated the Porsche 911 as the top high - performance sports car .
The 911 was tested against the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 , the Dodge Viper and other performance vehicles in a competitive test of luxury sports cars .
The prices of the eight cars in the magazine 's most recent tests ranged from $ 45,545 for a Lotus Elise to $ 105,855 for a Mercedes - Benz SL550 .
In the magazine , those results are combined with those of six other luxury performance cars tested previously to provide a 14 - car ranking of high - priced performance cars .
Consumer Reports , published by the non-profit Consumer 's Union , purchases all the vehicles it tests for the magazine .
The vehicles are bought anonymously from retail auto dealers .

Cars are tested on public roads as well as at the magazine 's test track facility in Connecticut .
Cars are put through a variety of tests , including high - speed maneuvering , braking and cornering .
The scoring system used for these cars was different from that generally used by the magazine for minivans and sedans , said David Champion , senior director of Consumer Reports ' Auto Test Center .
While the scoring was still heavily weighted toward safety , including emergency handling , factors like acceleration were given more importance than , for instance , trunk space , Champion said .
Comfort , convenience and day - to - day drivability were still factors in the rankings , though .
Performance battle
" The 911 wowed us enough with its acceleration , handling , and braking for us to rate it our top sports car , " said Champion .
" The 911 is also easy to drive , but its much less expensive Boxster sibling performed almost as well . "
The 911 cost about $ 87,500 as tested .
The Corvette Z06's price was about $ 77,000 .
The Corvette impressed the magazine 's test drivers with its powerful acceleration and stable feel .
The magazine called its handling " less precise " than the 911's , though .
The magazine called the Corvette Z06's predicted reliability " Poor , " which prevented them from actually recommending the car in spite of high scores for performance and comfort .
Consumer Reports gauges " predicted reliability " based on survey data .
The Corvette 's " Poor " rating was based on results for the current version of the car , which debuted in 2005 as a 2006 model , and for the previous version , which shared many major components and features with the current version .
The V - 10 - powered Viper ranked as the fastest car ever tested by the magazine with a 0 - 60 time of 4.2 seconds .
But it was only a tenth - of - a- second quicker than the Corvette Z06 and beat the 6 - cylinder 911 by just two - tenths .
In other performance measures , it was no better than those cars , according to the magazine , in spite of a price that was $ 15,000 higher than the second - ranked Corvette Z06 .
Ultimately , the Viper ranked second - to - last out of the 14 in the magazine 's point system .
The Viper was rated as " Poor " in most " Comfort and Convenience " areas including " Ride , " " Noise , " and " Front seat comfort . "
Still , Champion said , " I really liked the Viper . "
The V - 10 - powered Viper has the kind of personality that 's lacking from more coolly competent cars like the top - ranked Porsche 911 .
" It 's brutal , " he said .
" Everything about it is brutal . "
The Lotus Elise , the cheapest car on the list , ranked last because of its extreme nature .
The Elise 's ride is extremely harsh and getting in and out of the tiny , low - slung car is difficult .
If pushed behind its high handling limits , the Elise resists attempts to get it back under control .
" We thought it was a little too tricky for most people to drive , " said Champion .
Of the 14 cars tested , only three actually got a " Recommended " check mark from the magazine .
To be recommended a car must have good crash test scores and good " Predicted Reliability . "
The Nissan 350Z , BMW Z4 and Lexus SC430 were recommended .
Those cars finished in the bottom half of the point rankings , however .
The magazine did n't have sufficient data to gauge reliability for seven of the 14 cars .
Of the other seven , three had " Poor " reliability .
Those were the Corvette Z06 , the Corvette convertible and the Mercedes SL550 .
The Mercedes SLK350 was rated as having " Fair " reliability .
Results of the test will appear in the magazine 's October issue .

Feedback
Back around the turn of the century , when the biggest business story going was the Microsoft antitrust trial , I found myself one afternoon in conversation with Bill Gates on the topic of his legacy .
Even more than most multibillionaires , Gates had always , it seemed to me , been prone to caricature : first as the original golden geek , a brilliant , nonthreatening nebbish ; then as the far - seeing avatar of the PC revolution ; and now , with the government threatening to break his company into pieces , as the postmodern robber baron , the New Economy ’s John D. Rockefeller .
And so I asked Gates if he thought about how history would judge him .
“ No , ” he said flatly .
“ I ’m sure history will simplify things by taking a few people and talking about their role in personal computing .
But it does n’t matter ; it does n’t motivate me .
If we ’re all forgotten or remembered , it does n’t change what we do every day — but that has n’t really changed in the last 25 years . ”
The memory of Gates ’s comments came flooding back to me the week before Christmas , when a pair of events thrust him and his company into the holiday headlines .
The first , of course , was his selection by Time — along with his wife , Melinda , and U2 ’s front man , Bono — as one of its Persons of the Year , a selection based entirely on his charitable endeavors .
And the second was the decision by AOL to abandon , at the eleventh hour , a planned corporate commingling with Microsoft , and instead climb into bed with Google , Gates ’s bête noire du jour .
Coincidence ?
Sure .
But the contrast is revealing nonetheless .
By all accounts , Gates has emerged as the most influential philanthropist on the planet ; with a $ 29 billion endowment , his foundation is setting new standards for both generosity and rigor in tackling an assortment of the world ’s most dire maladies , from malaria to HIV .
At the same time , Gates no longer cuts the profile he once did as a high - tech titan .
While he ’s still respected , he ’s no longer scary — and the totemic company he built from scratch seems increasingly ordinary , even irrelevant .
Thus will 2005 be remembered as the year Gates ’s public persona shifted once again : from Bill the Software Barbarian to Bill the Bighearted Benefactor .
But this time the shift is about more than Gates ’s image .
It ’s about the changing nature of his power — and the fact that he ’s playing for history now .
And while Time ’s cover story was conspicuously free of any robber - baronial parallels , Gates ’s commendable burst of noblesse oblige has set him up , today more than ever , as the inheritor of the two - sided mantle once donned by Rockefeller , Carnegie , and Vanderbilt .
Gates , naturally , would recoil at the comparison — and yet in private moments he must be aware of how snugly it fits .
Despite once claiming that neither he nor Steve Jobs “ will merit an entry in a history book , ” Gates has never suffered from a lack of self - regard .
As far back as 1993 , after Bill Clinton ’s election , he informed a friend at a dinner party , “ I have as much power as the president . ”
( Melinda , evidently aghast , kicked him under the table . )
Indeed , it strikes me that it must be faintly galling to Gates that he had n’t been named Time ’s Person of the Year before now .
( Especially since the honor was bestowed , at the height of Microsoft ’s hegemony in the nineties , on both Intel founder Andy Grove and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos . )
Gates , in fact , was the in - house front - runner in 1996 — until a burst of late - year publicity around progress in treating HIV prompted Time ’s then–managing editor Walter Isaacson to choose aids researcher Dr. David Ho instead .
And Gates would have been an equally natural pick in 1997 — until that fall , when the Department of Justice launched its historic lawsuit against Microsoft .
For much of the next four years , the company was consumed with its battle against the Feds .
And Gates was subjected — or , more accurately , subjected himself — to a brutal drubbing in the court of public opinion .
But this was also the period in which Gates took up philanthropy in earnest , abandoning his previous inclination to wait 20 or 30 years , until after he had retired , to begin the process of dispensing the bulk of his massive fortune ( as he had indicated he would ) .
“ When you have the resources that could make a very big impact , ” he said later , “ you ca n’t just say to yourself , Okay , when I ’m 60 , I ’ll get around to that . ”
Inevitably , some of Gates ’s critics suspected that he was attempting — as Rockefeller biographer Ron Chernow once wrote about one of the objectives behind the philanthropic activities of Standard Oil ’s chief — to “ fumigate his fortune . ”
( Not to mention fumigating Microsoft in its moment of legal jeopardy . )
At the time , I put the question of Gates ’s motives to his friend Patty Stonesifer , who had taken on the position of the Gates Foundation ’s CEO .
“ Why is he doing this ? ” she said .
“ Frankly , who cares ?
If our money helps speed the development of an effective aids vaccine by a few years , it would mean saving tens of millions of lives . ”
Placed in that context , Stonesifer concluded , Gates ’s intentions were irrelevant .
“ When people impugn his motives , Bill just says , ‘ You ’ve got to take the long view — history will get this right . ’ ”
In 2000 , Gates stepped down as CEO and assumed his current title : chairman and chief software architect .
The official line at Microsoft was that he was reenergized , reinvigorated , up to his elbows in the company ’s future , shepherding new products and formulating new strategies .
But by the time I saw him a couple of years later at a conference in California , it was clear to all in the auditorium that software no longer got Gates ’s juices pumping the way his work at the foundation did .
Technology questions were answered quickly , without passion , whereas questions about global health elicited lengthy disquisitions full of detail and emotion .
The way he talked about wiping out malaria was how he used to talk about wiping out Netscape .
Ever since then , Microsoft has noticeably been drifting .
Not that the company is n’t still enormously profitable and does n’t exercise terrific clout in the markets where its products are entrenched .
But there ’s no escaping the impression of an outfit beset by strategic blurriness and lumbering middle age — or disguising the fact that , despite countless fervent if flailing efforts , Microsoft is getting its ass kicked handily in the race to rule the Internet .
Here you have Yahoo , trouncing MSN as an all - purpose Web portal .
And there you have Apple , crushing it in online music .
Here you have poor , doom - struck AOL , beating it in e-mail and instant messaging .
And there , most glaringly , you have Google , whipping Gates ’s company in Web search and advertising — and the crucial competition for top - drawer talent .
Nowhere is Microsoft ’s decline more keenly felt ( or warmly welcomed ) than in Silicon Valley .
“ Ten years ago , ” observes Joe Kraus , one of the founders of Excite , “ if you were starting up a company , you assumed that Microsoft already had ten engineers working full - time on the same thing , and they were probably going to eat your lunch .
But you do n’t say that anymore about Microsoft .
You say it about Google .
They ’re the 10,000 - pound gorilla now . ”
For Gates , then , losing out on the AOL deal to Google — a deal he ’d personally been involved in negotiating , courting Time Warner CEO Dick Parsons at last year ’s Allen & Co. summer retreat in Sun Valley — would have been all the more painful for what it represents .
For 25 years after Microsoft ’s founding in 1975 , Gates labored furiously to see that his company would escape the fate that befell his archrival IBM , along with every other technology outfit that rose to dominance in one era , then slid into senescence in the next .
Yet now he sees his precious baby veering dangerously in the direction of becoming the new Big Blue : large , profitable , and stuffed with happy employees , but feared or followed by no one .
Unimportant , in a word .
Rockefeller ’s life traces essentially the same arc on which Gates appears to be traveling .
Gates ’s consolation is that his opportunity to be a transformational figure is n’t lost with Microsoft ’s abeyance .
This is not a trivial thing .
Gates has already changed the world once ; now , through his foundation — which is not only disgorging a gusher of funds but inventing a new model for philanthropy , driven by statistics , leverage , and an insistence on accountability — he has a chance to do it again .
And as Bono told Time , “ The second act for Bill Gates may be the one that history regards more . ”
Which brings us back to J. D. Rockefeller .
Now , Gates and Rockefeller are very different animals in many respects — starting with Rockefeller ’s devout Baptism ( Gates has never emitted any visible sign of believing in any omnipotent being other than himself ) .
But with respect to philanthropy , Rockefeller ’s life essentially limns the arc on which Gates appears to be traveling .
After a career in which he was accused of a panoply of predatory behavior , Rockefeller retired in 1910 — a year before the Supreme Court voted to break up Standard Oil , but , interestingly , a few years after its market share began to shrink — and devoted himself to good works , notably the founding of the Rockefeller Foundation , which was as much an innovator in its time as the Gates Foundation is today .
By the time of his death , in 1937 , Rockefeller had attained an image in the public mind of a kind of secular saint .
Today he ’s remembered as much for his acts of charity as for his earlier acts of commercial treachery .
As precedents go , it ’s a heartening one for William Henry Gates III .
Although , as I said , I ’d wager big money that he does n’t see it that way .
Above all , Gates would probably object that there ’s no way Microsoft is in danger of being rent asunder these days .
And he’d be dead right — because the company , by and large , has ceased to be a menace to anyone .
That itself might pain Gates to hear , though in truth he should see it as a blessing .
For if Microsoft were still the Beast from Redmond circa 1997 , there ’s not a chance in hell he’d be a Person of the Year , let alone one that Time would have ever seen fit to label a “ Good Samaritan . ”

For the past few years , the Recording Industry Association of America has battled file sharing by threatening those it suspects of illegally downloading music with lawsuits .
Many potential defendants opt for expensive settlements with the RIAA , others decide to fight it out in court .
In the case of Sony BMG et al. v. Kim Arellanes , the RIAA is using another tactic : strenuously arguing ( PDF ) against the defendant 's request that a neutral , third - party perform a forensic search of the defendant 's hard drive to find evidence that she engaged in activities frowned upon by the music industry .
Claiming a right to rely on an expert of their own choosing , Sony BMG says that Arellanes " should be ordered to produce her computer hard drive for inspection subject to Plaintiff 's proposed protective order . "
As one might expect , Arellanes is n't too keen ( PDF ) on the idea of sending her hard drive to an RIAA star chamber for examination .
Citing the RIAA 's numerous missteps in its ill - conceived crusade against music fans , she requests that the court require a " neutral computer forensics expert and a protocol protective of non-relevant and privileged information " be used to conduct the examination .
Recently , RIAA target Delina Tschirhart found herself in a mess of hot water when she disobeyed a judge 's orders and used a secure file deletion utility to wipe potentially incriminating files off her hard drive .
In this case , the RIAA obtained a mirrored copy of her hard drive , on which its forensics expert found the incriminating evidence .
The result was a default judgment in the RIAA 's favor .
That case aside , the RIAA 's history does n't inspire much confidence in its ability to objectively examine what could be a piece of crucial evidence .
Remember , this is an organization that has tried to skirt due process by trying to force ISPs to hand over subscriber information ( e.g. , names associated with IP addresses ) .
A late 2003 ruling put an end to the practice , requiring the RIAA to look to the courts to compel ISPs to turn over the information .
The organization has also sued the deceased along with those who do n't even own computers .
Neither plaintiffs or defendants are objective parties in a legal dispute .
That 's all the more reason to have third parties involved in examining the evidence .
When one of the parties has a history of bullying witnesses into perjury and is seemingly incapable of admitting they were wrong and clearing the names of those they wrongfully accused , it becomes even more crucial .
Jennifer Aniston has just revealed that in the last two years , she thought about stepping away from acting .
Why ?
Because a job she had completed “ sucked the life ” out of her !
“ I would have to say the last two years that has crossed my mind , ” she said about wanting to quit .
“ It was after a job I had completed , and I was like , ‘ Whoa , that was really … that sucked the life out of me .
And I do n’t know if this is what interests me , ” she said during an episode of Jason Bateman , Will Arnett and Sean Hayes ‘ podcast , SmartLess .
“ It was an unprepared project .
We ’ve all been a part of them .
You always say , ‘ I ’ll never [ do it ] again !
Never again !
I will never back up into a start date ! ’ ”
She added that she had never before considered quitting acting , but if she did , she ’d become an interior designer .
“ I love it .
It ’s my happy place .
It ’s really a happy place for me , ” she said about design .
Jennifer recently starred in 2019′s Murder Mystery and the TV show The Morning Show .

When I saw this , I actually looked to make sure it was n’t an April Fool ’s joke .
I ’ve been hearing about Monad for some time , it was yet another promised feature that Vista wo n’t have .
It sounded impressive , for once Microsoft was going to create a command line interface , and they were going to clean up the cruft that has accumulated in the past 40 years of computing .
It was / is supposed to be completely object oriented , a cut above the poor UNIX text interfaces .
I was just impressed they had finally listened to their customers pleading and begging for a way to script and use the command line to admin Windows boxes .
Then I run across an idiot on Slashdot where someone was using this example to brag about Monad !
Most of the time when people type LOL , they are n’t really laughing out loud , but this time , my lungs hurt from laughing so hard .
Have these people actually used a command line interface ?
The reason the commands are so small in UNIX is that they are faster to type !
This syntax in Monad looks like it was dreamt up by someone that saw a UNIX shell a couple times and said , “ wow , these commands do n’t make much sense , how would a new user know what cd or ls or ps means ? ”
If this is the state of Monad , I ca n’t imagine ever using it .
The whole point of a command line interface is that I can ssh to a machine over any kind of network and quickly type and do useful work .
I was ready to give them a shot , but if they ’ve missed this most basic point , I do n’t see how it would be useful .
Probably not a surprise that Microsoft ca n’t get a text interface right , but I was hoping .
I leave with a quote : [ ebnf ] is monad pronounced like gonad ?
Analysis Today , 19 January is the 20th anniversary for the appearance of the first PC virus .
Brain , a boot sector virus , was let loose in January 1986 .
Brain spread via infected floppy disks and was a relatively innocuous nuisance in contrast with modern Trojan , rootkits and other malware .
The appearance of the first Windows malware nonetheless set in train a chain of events that led up to today 's computer virus landscape .
Boot sector viruses ceased to appear when floppy discs went out of fashion but they continued to be a nuisance between 1986 to 1995 , when internet technology started to penetrate the consumer market .
These types of viruses relied on people to exchange infected discs and virus outbreaks often took months to spread .
The creation of macro viruses , which exploited security weaknesses in Microsoft word and other applications , meant that malware outbreaks peaked after days instead of weeks and months .
Macro viruses ruled the roost for around four years between 1995 and 1999 before email became the main vector for viral distribution .
Harnessing the internet meant that the time it took the first email worms , such as the Love Bug , to spread dropped from days to hours .
Email worms such as the Love Bug and Melissa caused widespread disruption and confusion in 1999 before they were brought to heel .
By 2001 , network worms such as Blaster were created that automatically and indiscriminately infected Windows PCs without adequate protection .
Email and network worms remain a problem today but the greatest problem these days is posed by key - logging Trojans designed to snoop on user 's private information , such as online account details , and the many strains of malware that turn infected PCs into zombie drones under the control of hackers .
The biggest change over the last 20 years has been in the motives of virus writers rather than in the types of malware they 've cooked up , according to anti-virus firm F - Secure .
" The most significant change has been the evolution of virus writing hobbyists into criminally operated gangs bent on financial gain , " said F - Secure 's chief research officer Mikko Hypponen .
“ This trend is showing no signs of stopping . "
" There are already indications that malware authors will target laptop WLANs as the next vector for automatically spreading worms , " he added . ®

If there were an enhanced guerrilla version of , for example , Mail.app , that did message - selection correctly and had a next - unread button , both these fixes being provided by a community member , some things would happen .
First , I ’d use it .
Second , the vast majority of Mac users would n’t .
Third , when the Leopard release of Mail.app , presumably with new goodies , came out , it would be back - ported to Tiger .
Fourth , I and most of the other people using the variant Mail.app would upgrade to Leopard anyhow .
If there ’s a hole in this logic , I ’d say it ’s with the “ vast majority of Mac users would n’t ” part .
( Justin Blanton makes a similar argument . )
I agree that most Mac users would not install these enhanced guerrilla versions and that they probably would n’t even know they existed — but there are , what ? , 10 to 20 million total Mac users ?
The “ vast ” majority could ignore them and it would still leave a sizable number of Mac users .
Many — not most , just many —
Mac users occupy a slot in the computer user spectrum that is often overlooked : that of the non-technical enthusiast .
These are people who do n’t really understand how a computer works from a computer science perspective , but who do understand quite a bit about how a Macintosh works , from the perspective of the Mac OS UI metaphors .
I.e. they ’re Mac nerds but not computer nerds .
Back in 2002 , responding to a Joel Spolsky piece regarding whether or not the Mac is a big enough market for commercial software developers , I wrote about this :
Sure , some Macs are used in corporate settings , and some are used at home by the “ I just use the web and email ” crowd .
But Macs are much more likely to be used by computer enthusiasts .
You pretty much have to go out of your way to end up with a Mac on your desk ( or lap ) .
If you walk into CompUSA and say , “ I ’d like to buy a computer ” , you ’re probably going to walk out with a Wintel box .
If you do that at Wal - mart , you definitely will .
Let ’s divide computer users into two groups — people who think computers are fun , and people who just happen to use a computer .
Which group do you think buys more software ( even including all the Linux nerds in the first group ) ?
Which group do you think most Mac users are in ?
Mac users may only constitute four percent of the total number of computer users ; but they constitute a significantly higher percentage of the total number of users who do things like install and purchase third - party application software .
Considering that these users already do things like installing plug-ins and unsupported system extensions like APE haxies and input manager hacks , I find it hard to believe many of them would n’t install enhanced guerrilla versions of these apps , too , if Apple were to release them as open source .
Again , not most Mac users , but , I think , more than Bray ( or Blanton , or many of you who emailed me about this ) suspect .
And thinking about the practical implications of this idea , there would be some tricky technical problems that would arise in Bray ’s scenario .
For example , what happens if someone releases a patched version of Mail that replaces the system ’s official version from Apple ?
What happens then when the next software or security update from Apple contains an updated version of Mail from Apple ?
Collision .
So , one might argue , there ’d be some sort of rule in place that open source guerrilla versions would not be allowed to replace Apple ’s official versions in / Applications / .
But how would such a rule be enforced ?
By stating it as a rule in the license ?
Good luck with that .
Section 2c of the Mac OS X software license agreement , for example , explicitly forbids reverse engineering or disassembling the software , but that does n’t seem to have kept anyone from using reverse engineering in order to create input manager hacks and haxies .
( Of course , it should n’t have kept anyone from reverse - engineering the system , because it ’s not illegal to reverse engineer software just because it says you ca n’t in the EULA ; software license agreements are full of bullshit restrictions that are n’t enforceable and are contrary to established copyright law .
I ’m just saying you ca n’t count on a rule being obeyed just because it ’s stated in a license . )
And even if developers did release their guerrilla offshoots with unique names ( and more importantly , unique bundle identifiers ) , you ’d run into other problems .
Like , say , if you decide to switch to an offshoot derived from Mail , which does n’t replace Mail in your Applications folder because it ’s named , say , “ JoeMail ” .
But now what would happen when you clicked the email button in iPhoto ?
It would still fire up Mail , is what would happen .
1
Or if you were to switch to a modified offshoot of iCal but were still using Apple ’s standard version of Mail , and then receive a message with an event invitation , and you click the button to agree to attend —
Mail would send you to iCal , not FooCal or whatever the name is of your guerrilla version of iCal .
Point being that unless you switch from all of Apple ’s official apps to an integrated and coordinated suite of offshoot derivations which have been rejiggered to interact with each other in all the various ways that Apple ’s own apps do , there are going to be holes in the user experience .
And so thus there ’d be a strong temptation for developers to just produce apps that are meant to replace Apple ’s .
At which point you run into the aforementioned problem where Software Update is going to make things go haywire .
I Knew She Was Gonna Meet Her Connection
The question I ’ve been pondering the last few weeks , though , is why I ’m not as bothered by the status quo as Bray .
I can write a little code , and my brain is chockablock with niggling little complaints and feature requests regarding the software I use .
But I feel no strong urge to see any of the closed source apps I use released as open source .
Why ?
The other day , while tinkering with a small project in Script Debugger , the answer hit me — I already do hack together tiny little additions and modifications to the software I use , with scripting .
And for more serious extensions , many of the apps I depend on have plug - in APIs .
Mac OS
X is a very hackable platform ; it just is n’t hackable by means of the raw source code to the software .
This is one area where Mac OS X inherits good aspects from both sides of its family .
From the classic Mac OS , it inherits AppleScript and a tradition of rich plug - in APIs for major applications .
From Next , it inherits both the entire ( highly scriptable )
Unix layer and the eminently hackable and modular Objective - C runtime system .
A big part of the magic in Cocoa , and a major aspect of its appeal to developers , is that it ’s dynamic — Cocoa apps can be changed on - the - fly after they ’re launched , in very significant ways .
That ’s how input manager hacks work , for example .
Check out F - Script — a Smalltalk - based open source scripting layer for Cocoa — for an example of just how dynamic it really is .
Popular examples abound :
The entire desktop publishing software industry revolves around the plug - in APIs provided by the 800 - pound gorilla 2 applications : QuarkXPress , InDesign , Photoshop , and Illustrator .
( My complete switch from QuarkXPress to InDesign , for example , was made possible only through the use of Em Software ’s outstanding Xtags and InFlow plug-ins for InDesign .
I ’d rather switch back to Quark than use InDesign without Xtags .
Kinkless GTD is Ethan Schoonover ’s free set of AppleScripts and outliner templates for OmniOutliner Pro that turns it into a task management app for implementing David Allen ’s mega- popular Getting Things Done system .
Has there ever been a successful text editor that was n’t richly scriptable ?
That ’s certainly the key to BBEdit ’s success , and it ’s also the key reason why TextMate has emerged as a worthy arch -rival .
Neither is open source ; both are deeply extensible in numerous ways .
( E.g. : BBEdit does n’t support a built - in auto - complete feature , but Michael Tsai ’s excellent BBAutoComplete gives you one that works via AppleScript .
Plus , because it works via AppleScript , I can use it just about any properly scriptable editor , including Mailsmith , too . )
Apps like Quicksilver and LaunchBar can radically alter the way you launch applications and open documents .
Quicksilver , particularly — it ’s more of a framework for plug - in interface hacks .
Some of Apple ’s apps are in on it too : Frasier Speirs ’s FlickrExport is a plug - in for iPhoto that adds Flickr integration ; MailTags is a plug - in for Apple Mail that adds tagging and task management features .
Safari does n’t have a plug - in interface3 and I ’ve been griping for over three years now about Safari ’s shitty AppleScript support , but thanks to Cocoa ’s dynamic runtime , there are a slew of Safari modification hacks .
Plus , it ’s worth noting that WebKit is enabling developers to use HTML rendering views for purposes far beyond web surfing .
Apps like NetNewsWire and Adium provide anyone who knows HTML and CSS the ability to design and customize portions of the application UI .
And because they do so by means of simple bundles containing HTML and CSS files , their work is as easily shared as scripts or plug-ins .
I stated earlier that there ’s a long history of this sort of scriptability , extensibility , and hackability on the Mac ; but these are by no means Mac - specific tenets .
The aforementioned desktop publishing apps are all cross-platform with Windows , as are their plug - in APIs .
And even in the open source Unix world , there ’s a high correlation between popularity and extensibility .
Tim Bray ’s own preferred text editor ( as well as Mark Pilgrim ’s , for that matter ) , Emacs , is richly scriptable via its internal Lisp implementation .
Yes , Emacs is open source , but Emacs hackers do n’t typically tweak their editor by writing C code and compiling their own custom emacs binary — no , they write Lisp extensions .
Same goes for Firefox .
Open source , yes , but when users add new features to Firefox , they do n’t download the source code and compile their own web browser .
They write extensions .
Or , more commonly , they install the meta - hack Greasemonkey extension and then write scripts in JavaScript that run through Greasemonkey .
( Which brings us right back to Mark Pilgrim again . )
That ’s not to say that being open source is irrelevant , of course .
Occasionally people do compile their own Emacs binaries — e.g. the famous Emacs / XEmacs fork ) , and things like the Carbon Emacs port for Mac OS X .
And with regard to Mozilla and Firefox , there are offshoots like Camino and Flock .
But those examples only help make my point : Camino and Flock are n’t just minor deviations from Firefox ; they ’re entirely separate and different applications .
The same goes for Carbon Emacs : the whole point of it — offering some measure of integration with the standard Mac OS X GUI environment — is inherently beyond the scope of Emacs ’s insular Lisp extension mechanism .
Opening the source code for an application makes it possible to modify or tweak the app .
Creating a plug - in or scripting API not only makes it possible , but makes it relatively easy .
Open source offshoots such as Flock and Camino are about radical changes to the architecture or user interface of their parent app , and are n’t the sort of thing Bray is talking about .
Plus , doing your guerrilla UI hacking by way of scripting and plug-ins solves all the forking issues mentioned earlier — you ’re not modifying the application itself , on disk , so you wo n’t interfere with system updates or the interaction between the app and the rest of the system .
And it ’s easier to share your work with others — “ try my script ” is a lot more appealing than “ try my custom binary of iCal ” .
Singing , ‘ We ’re Gonna Vent Our Frustration ’
And so now we ’ve arrived at a way of looking at Bray ’s gripe with Apple that I can sign onto — by restating it from “ Apple should open source their apps ” to “ Apple should enable someone like me to make small tweaks to their apps by writing a few dozen lines of code ” .
Because for all of the good things about Mac OS X ’s culture of scriptability and extensibility , there ’s a lot of room for improvement .
Apple ’s support for AppleScript in its own applications is all over the map .
I mentioned earlier that Safari ’s AppleScript support is poor , but it ’s certainly better than Preview , which does n’t even have a scripting dictionary , so you ca n’t even do something as simple as ask Preview for the path to the document of its frontmost window .
I mentioned the MailTags plug - in for Mail earlier , but the plug - in API that it uses is completely undocumented and officially private - to - Apple .
And input manager - based hacks for Safari are about as unsupported as a hack can get .
But while there is n’t any documentation or sanctioned support for these techniques , I thoroughly doubt there ’d be any documentation or support for the source code dropped out of Cupertino in Bray ’s hypothetical open source scenario , either .
Scripting and ( officially sanctioned ) plug - in APIs are implicit commitments ; once you release an API , the developer of the app is pretty much on the hook to continue supporting it going forward .
Whereas if , say , the next version of Apple Mail completely breaks the APIs currently used by MailTags , tough noogies for MailTags ( and its users ) .
That ’s not necessarily bad , though .
Apple has limited resources , and even if the entire company were fully committed to adding as many supported , documented scripting and plug - in APIs to its software as possible , there ’s only so much time in the day .
There are always going to be holes in the official , supported coverage .
It ’s better that some of those holes are accessible through unofficial , unsupported means than if they were n’t accessible at all .
Support for AppleScript at Apple seems to vary from team to team .
Unlike with , say , visual user interfaces , there ’s apparently no mandate for any sort of standards regarding minimal scriptability in Apple software .
When I speak of “ visual user interface standards ” here , I ’m not talking about visual consistency — which is obviously no longer a priority at Apple — but rather the fact that all of their teams apply time and effort to their software ’s appearance .
You might not like the user interface of every app from Apple , but I do n’t think you can point to one and argue that no thought or effort has been applied to it at all .
Whereas with AppleScript , there are numerous apps from Apple that do n’t support AppleScript at all , but which clearly should .
One common argument from the pointy - haired - boss contingent against spending the time to design and develop good scripting interfaces is that most users never write scripts .
That ’s true , but it ’s not a good argument against supporting scripting .
The benefit of good scripting support is n’t derived only by those users who write scripts , but also by those who use them .
It only took one Ethan Schoonover to write kGTD , but there are now thousands of OmniOutliner Pro users using it .
Even great scripting support is n’t a panacea — some seemingly minor tasks just are n’t possible , because no API can anticipate all possible needs .
For example , one of Tim Bray ’s gripes about Mail is about multiple - message selection via the keyboard : that if you use Shift - Down to select multiple messages in a mailbox but accidentally overshoot and go one too far , and so then hit Shift - Up to compensate for overshooting , what happens is that instead of shrinking the selection by one it instead grows the selection in the other direction .
But this is n’t a beef with Mail ; it ’s actually a beef with the system ’s standard list controls ( Data Browser in Carbon , NSTableView in Cocoa ) .
I agree with Bray that the behavior is both wrong and endlessly frustrating , 4 but that ’s how list item selection works in any app that uses the standard list control with default behavior ( including the Finder , iCal , and the system - wide Open and Save dialogs , just to name a few instances ) .
Could it be fixed with access to Mail ’s source code ?
Of course — it ’s all just typing .
But I suspect it could n’t be fixed easily , because it is n’t Mail that ’s providing the list selection .
In other words , this is a slightly harder problem to solve than it may seem , and I admit that a superior scripting interface would n’t help you change it .
( Whether you can hack this via Mail ’s undocumented plug - in interface , I do n’t know . )
But as for Bray ’s other complaint about Mail — that it should have a “ Go to Next Unread Message ” command — that ought to be possible with AppleScript .
I do n’t know that it can be done ( because I do n’t use Mail I have n’t bothered to investigate ) but if it is n’t possible , it should be .
( LazyWeb fame and fortune to the first DF reader to implement this for Mail .
Update : Here ’s a good implementation by Bruce Phillips and “ Qwerty Denzel ” on the MacScripter forum . )
But nothing is a panacea , including open source .
Firefox would be a lot more hackable if its source code were closed but the extension interface remained than it would be if the source were kept open but the extension interface were removed .
For Apple and Mac OS X , the sweet spot is providing simple , clear , consistent default features and behaviors for typical users , but providing as much extensibility as possible for hackers to play with .
Mac OS
X has improved in this regard with each successive major release .
And Apple ’s unscriptable apps do n’t always remain unscriptable ; Apple Remote Desktop added a very decent scripting dictionary in the recent version 3.0 upgrade .
( You know it ’s good if John C. Welch likes it . )
Who knows , maybe one of these years Safari will give us scripting access to tabs .
It behooves Apple to satisfy users who want to write small chunks of code to customize their environment , and who would be not just willing , but eager , to share their work with others .
I do n’t want the source code to their software ; I just want to be able to script the hell out of it .
The Alibaba deal ends Yahoo's independent China operations
The US company will now hold a 40 % stake - and 35 % of the votes - in the Chinese firm , which runs the country 's biggest auction and trading sites .
The investment positions Yahoo to compete with world auction leader eBay in a key market .
Chinese internet firms are in demand after the rip-roaring flotation of search engine Baidu.com a week ago .
The firm 's shares have more than tripled in value since the start of trading , to more than $ 90 a share .
Auction rivalry
Yahoo is to merge its Chinese search engine operations with Alibaba .
The Chinese firm , in which Yahoo is now the biggest single investor - as well as the biggest investor in the sector in China to date - employs some 2,000 people in the eastern city of Hangzhou .
It is best known for its online auction site Taobao.com , as well as flagship trading site Alibaba.com which helps small and medium - sized companies find customers at home and abroad .
Its business model puts it in direct competition with eBay .
Yahoo already leads eBay in Japan via its relationship with Softbank .
Softbank - one of Japan 's pioneer internet start - ups , and now a success despite finding itself in dire financial straits after the dot - com collapse in 2001 - is thought to have helped broker the Alibaba.com deal .
But Alibaba.com is also competing in the field of online payments , an area in which eBay has a huge stake thanks to its ownership of US payment broker Paypal .
Online surge
The Chinese government last month reported that the number of people in the country using the internet had reached 103 million , putting it second only to the US .
Leading overseas companies have recently been investing heavily in China 's booming online market .
EBay paid $ 180 m for Shanghai - based Eachnet and US web firm Interactivecorp - which owns Expedia - paid $ 168 m for a majority stake in Chinese online retailer Elong .
And online book retailer Amazon bought Chinese rival Joyo for $ 75 m .
Other entries included Clinton and Fidelity streets and Zzyzx Road
Psycho Path won first prize in a competition run by an American website .
Divorce Court ( off Easy Lane ) in Pennsylvania and Farfrompoopen Road in Tennessee were runners - up in the Wild , Weird and Wacky Street Names contest .
In the US , owners of private roads can register whatever name they choose with the local authorities .
Marty Padgett , editor of thecarconnection.com , said " Psycho Paths " were apparently popular in the US , after receiving several similar entries .
" I do n't think they 're mad on Psycho Path .
If it is your property you can name private roads whatever you want .
" Psycho Path was that person 's personal expression , " he said .
Heading for Divorce Court
Some of the top entries occurred where two streets intersected - for example Stroke and Acoma streets in a retirement area of Wisconsin , or Lonesome and Hardup roads in Georgia .
TOP FIVE STREET NAMES 1 . Psycho Path 2 . Divorce Court 3 . Farfrompoopen Road 4 . Clinton and Fidelity streets
5 . Unexpected Road Source : thecarconnection.com
Mr Padgett said his favourite was the intersection of Clinton and Fidelity streets in Houston , Texas .
" As far as bodily functions are concerned , you would probably not want to pass by Farfrompoopen Road .
" We are told it is the only way to get to Arkansas ' Constipation Ridge . "
All the street names were checked to ensure they were registered and not made up , including the macabre Shades of Death Road and the unpronounceable Zzyzx Road .
Mr Padgett said one reason for the bizarre listings could be that in some communities , developers simply ran out of names .
Jeff Zellar has lived in Pennsylvania 's Divorce Court with his second wife for a few years .
" People laugh when they hear it .
They ask : ' Are you planning on staying married ? '
" In Divorce Court , there are seven homes - and probably six of us have been divorced already once .
When we first moved in , my wife said : ' This sounds like trouble . ' "
Mr Zellar is still married .

If you 're like us , the few times a year that you do have to print things out often involve stressful moments -- like when you 're running late for your flight and the 30 seconds that it takes to print out your boarding pass feel like a lifetime .
We 're here to tell you that new printer technology is on the way that may make those harrowing 30 seconds as obsolete as that ImageWriter II that you had back in 1987 , if a new technology makes it out of the lab and onto store shelves .
Two Israeli researchers at The College of Judea and Samaria have come up with a new type of inkjet printer dubbed the JeTrix , which they hope will be to the inkjet printer what the ink - jet was to dot - matrix devices .
Moshe Einat , one of the engineers involved , described his invention as being " like an ' ink - emitting screen , ' " in the sense that ink would flow point by point -- and all at once -- instead of waiting for the cartridge to fully scan line by line -- theoretically reaching a speed of 1,000 pages in a single minute .
Einat says that the printer should begin commercial production within two years , but do n't expect them to come as freebies with your PC purchase anytime soon .
The global spread of democracy since the 1970s , especially after the collapse of communism , has been impressive .
According to Freedom House , an American organisation that tracks global trends in political freedom , at the end of 2005 there were 122 “ electoral democracies ” ( 64 % of the world 's states , compared with 40 % in the mid-1980s ) .
On a more stringent criterion , 89 of these were rated as “ politically free ” — 46 % of all states , compared with only 25 % in 1975 .
However , the spread of democracy appears to be coming to a halt .
Negative examples abound .
The weak response in the Middle East to pressures for democratisation , as well as the experience with imported political change in Iraq , is making a mockery of George Bush 's “ freedom ” agenda .
In Asia , the coup in Thailand was a reminder of democracy 's fragility .
The promise of the multi-coloured revolutions around the former Soviet Union remains unfulfilled , and a slide into authoritarian ways in Vladimir Putin 's Russia continues .
Political crises in central Europe have raised questions about the strength of the region 's democratic transition .
In Latin America populist forces with dubious democratic credentials have come to the fore , in Venezuela and elsewhere .
Even in the developed West , a lack of interest in politics and security - related curbs on civil liberties are having a corrosive effect on some long - established democracies .
A new democracy index devised by the Economist Intelligence Unit illustrates some of these trends .
Compared with Freedom House 's measure , it delves “ deeper ” into the texture of democracy , looking at 60 indicators across five broad categories : free elections , civil liberties , functioning government , political participation and political culture .
Free elections and civil liberties are necessary conditions for democracy , but they are unlikely to be sufficient for a robust democracy if unaccompanied by transparent and at least minimally efficient government , adequate participation in politics and a supportive culture .
It is not easy to build a sturdy democracy .
Even in long - established ones , if not nurtured and protected democracy can corrode surprisingly quickly .
The index provides a snapshot of the current state of democracy for 165 independent states and two territories .
( Click here for a complete list of countries and a full explanation of the methodology . )
Although almost half of the world 's countries can be classified as democracies , the number of “ full democracies ” is low ( only 28 ) .
Almost twice as many ( 54 ) are rated as “ flawed democracies ” .
Even a flawed democracy is better than no democracy at all ; of the remaining 85 states , 30 are considered to be “ hybrid regimes ” and 55 are authoritarian .
As could be expected , developed OECD countries ( with the notable exception of Italy ) dominate among the full democracies , although there are also two Latin American countries , two from central Europe and one African country .
Sweden , a near - perfect democracy , comes top , followed by a bevy of similarly virtuous northern European countries .
More surprising are the relatively modest scores for two traditional bastions of democracy — Britain and the United States .
In America there has been a perceptible erosion of civil liberties related to the fight against terrorism .
Long - standing problems in the functioning of government have also become more prominent .
In Britain , too , there has been some erosion of civil liberties but also a shocking decline in political participation .
Britain 's score in this area is the lowest in the West and is reflected across all dimensions — voter turnout , membership of political parties , willingness to engage in politics and attitudes towards it .
Why the setbacks in democracy 's spread and quality ?
The pace of democratisation was bound to slow after the easy gains that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall .
China and Middle Eastern autocracies were always going to be a more difficult proposition .
Many autocrats preside over energy - rich states and have been strengthened by high oil prices .
And America , which should be a shining example , has damaged its liberty - enlarging cause : its military intervention in Iraq is deeply unpopular around the world , Mr Bush is widely loathed and Guantánamo and other cases of prisoner - abuse have led to charges of hypocrisy against the United States .
There have been reversals before — a wave of democratisation after 1945 ended with more than 20 countries sliding back into authoritarianism .
We are not witnessing that sort of regression , but in 2007 the threat of backsliding outweighs the likelihood of further gains .
Accompanying our new index is a watchlist of significant changes in 2007 : nine countries are on negative watch and only one ( Hong Kong ) on positive watch .
Nevertheless , it would be wrong to be too pessimistic .
Democracy as a value retains strong universal appeal .
Creating democracy by external intervention has not gone smoothly .
But trends such as globalisation , increasing education and expanding middle classes favour its organic development .
These underlying forces suggest that any retreat from democracy will be temporary .

Sitting in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Grand Krapolinsky Krasnapolsky in central Amsterdam , at yet another conference .
This is the third in three weeks , and I ’ll be glad when next week comes and I do n’t have to think about writing a presentation .
Well , for a few weeks at least .
First up :
Paul Graham – How American are Startups ?
I ‘m here to talk about start - ups .
Well , if I was giving a talk about start - ups in the US , there ’d be a lot more people here , so maybe that says something , or maybe I ’m reading too much into it .
Could you recreate Silicon Valley elsewhere ?
With the right 10,000 people , yes .
It used to be that geography was important , but now it ’s having the right people .
You need two kinds of people to create a start - up : rich people and nerds .
Towns become start - up hubs when there are rich people and nerds .
NYC could not be a start - up hub because there are lots of rich people but no nerds .
Result : no start - ups .
Pittsburgh has the opposite problem – lots of nerds , no rich people .
Uni of Washington yeilded a hi-tech community in Seattle , but Pittsburgh has a problem with the weather , and no beautiful old city , so rich people do n’t want to live in Pittsburgh .
Do you need rich people ?
Would it be best if the gov’t invested ?
no .
You need rich people , because they tend to have experience and connections , and the fact that it ’s their money makes them really pay attention .
The idea of gov’t beaurocrats making start - up decisions is comic , it ’d be like mathmaticians running Vogue … or editors of Vogue running a maths journal .
Start - ups funded by burocrats would be competing with start - ups run by rich people who have their own money on the line .
Start -ups are people , not the buildings .
Creating business parks does n’t help start - ups , because start - ups do not use that kind of space .
Where a start - up starts it stays , so all you need your three guys sitting round a kitchen table .
If you can get rich people and nerds together , you can recreate Silicon Valley .
Smart people like smart people and will go where they are , so universities are good .
First rate compsci depts are important to this , preferably one of the top handful in the world , and has to stand up to MIT and Stanford .
Professors consider one factor only – they are attracted by good colleagues .
So if you can attract the best people then you will create a chain reaction which would be unstoppable .
Just takes about half a billion , which is within the reach of any developed country .
But you need a place where investors want to live and students want to live when they graduation .
It needs to be a major air travel hub so people can travel easy .
Investors and nerds have similar taste because most investors used to be nerds .
Taste ca n’t be too different , but also ca n’t be too mainstream .
Like the rest of the creative class , nerds want to live somewhere with personality , that ’s not mass produced .
To create a start - up hub , you need a town that does n’t have mass development of large tracts of land [ so , no Milton Keynes then ? ] .
Most personality is found in older towns .
Pre -war apartments are built better , and people like them more .
You ca n’t build a Silicon Valley , you let it grow .
Any town ’s personality needs to have a good nerd personality .
Nerds like towns where people walk around smiling , so not LA because people do n’t walk around , or NYC where people do n’t smile .
Nerds will pay a premium to live where there are smart people .
They like quiet , sunlight , hiking .
A nerd ’s idea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder .
The start - up hubs in the US are very young - feeling , but not new towns .
Want a place that tolerates oddness .
Get an election map and avoid the red bits .
To attract the young , you need a city with a live centre .
None of the start - up hubs have been turned inside out like some Americans have .
Young people do not want to live in suburbs .
Within the US , Boulder and Portland have the most potential .
They are both only a great university short of being a start - up hub .
The US has some significant advantages :
1. Allows immigration .
Would be impossible to reproduce Silicon Valley in Japan , because most of the people there speak with accents and the Japanese do n’t allow immigration .
It has to be a Mecca , and you ca n’t have a Mecca if you do n’t let people in .
2 . Wo n’t work in a poor company .
India might one day produce a Silicon Valley , because it has the right people but it ’s still very poor .
US has never been as poor as some countries are now , so we have no data to say how you get from poor to Silicon Valley .
There may be a ‘ speed limit ’ to the evolution of an economy .
3 . The US is not ( yet ) a police state .
China might want to create a Silicon Valley , but their tradition of an autocratic central gov’t goes back a long way .
Gets you efficiency but not imagination .
Can build things , but not sure it can design things .
Hard to have new ideas about tech without having new ideas about politics , and many new tech ideas do have political implications so if you squash dissent you squash new ideas .
Singapore suffers a similar problem .
4 . Need really good unis , and their US has those .
Outside of the US , people think of Cambridge in the UK , then pause .
The best professors seem to be all spread out , instead of concentrated , so that hinders them because they do n’t have good colleagues , and their institutions do n’t act as a Mecca .
Germany used to have the best universities , until the 30s .
If you took all the Jews out of any university in the US , there ’d be a huge hole , so as there are few Jews in Germany , perhaps that would be a lost cause .
5 . You can fire people .
One of the biggest obsticles are the rigid labour laws in Europe , which is bad for start - ups because they have the least ability to deal with the beurocracy .
Start - ups need to be able to fire people because they need to be flexible .
EU public opinion will tolerate people being fired in industries where they care about performance , but that seems limited to football .
6 . Work is less identified by employment in the US .
EU has the attitude that the employer should protect the employee .
Employment has shed these paternalistic overtones , which makes it easier for start - ups to hire people , and easier to start start - ups .
In the US , most people still think they need to get a job , but the less you identify work with employment the easier it is to start your own company .
All you have to do is imagine it .
A year after the founding of Apple , long after they had sold their stuff , Steve Wozniak was still working for HP .
When Jobs found someone to give them venture funding , on the condition that Woz quit , he initially refused .
7. America is not too fussy .
If there are any laws regarding businesses , you can assume that start - ups will break them because they do n’t know them and do n’t care .
They get run out of places that they should n’t be run out of , like garages or apartments .
Try that in Switzerland and you ’d likely get reported .
To get start - ups you need the just right amount of regulation .
8. US has a huge domestic market .
Start - ups usually begin by selling locally , which works because their is a huge domestic market .
In Sweden , for example , the market is smaller .
The EU was created to form an international market , but everyone still speaks different languages .
But it seems as if everyone educated person in Europe now speaks English , if present trends continue , more will .
9. Funding .
Start - up funding does n’t only come from VCs , but also from business angels .
Google might not have got where they were without angel funding of $ 100 k .
All you need to do to get that process started is to get a few start - ups going , but the cycle is slow .
It takes five years for a successful start - up to produce a potential angel investors .
You need angels as well as VCs .
10 . America has a more relaxed attitude to careers .
In the EU , the idea is that everyone has a specific occupation , but in the US things are more haphazard .
That ’s a good thing .
A start - up founder is not the type of career a high - school kid will choose – they choose conservatively .
Start - ups are not things you plan , so you are more likely to get them in a society that allows career changes on the fly .
Compsci was supposed to provide researchers , but in actual fact most students are there because they are curious .
Americas schools might be a benefit – they are so bad , that people wait til college before they make their decisions about what their career will be .
This list is not meant to suggest America is the best place for start - ups .
It should be possible not to duplicate , but improve on Silicon Valley .
what ’s wrong with SV ?
– It ’s too far away from San Francisco .
You either live in the Valley , or commute from SF .
Would be better if the Valley was actually interesting , but it ’s the worst sort of strip development .
– Bad public transportation .
There ’s a train , which is not so bad by American standards but by Eu standards , its ’ awful .
So design a town for trains , bikes and walking and cars last , but it ’ll be a long time before the US does that .
– Have lower capital gains taxes .
Low income tax is n’t so much of an issue , but capital gains is .
Lowering the tax instantly increases returns on stocks , as opposed to real estate , so to encourage start - ups , have low cap gains .
But decreases in cap gains disproportionately favour the rich .
Belgium as cap gains of 0 .
– Smarter immigration policy .
People running Silicon Valley are aware of the shortcomings of the US immigration system , and since 2001 it has become very paranoid .
What fraction of the smart people who want to come to the Valley want to actually do get in ?
Half ?
The US policy keeps out most smart people and puts the majority in crap jobs .
A country which got immigration right coudl become a Mecca for smart people simply by letting them in .
So basic recipe for a start - up hub is a great university and a nice town .
You could improve on Silicon Valley easily .
Just let people in .

The neoconservative Bush administration will attack Iran with tactical nuclear weapons , because it is the only way the neocons believe they can rescue their goal of U.S. ( and Israeli ) hegemony in the Middle East .
The U.S. has lost the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan .
Generals in both war theaters are stating their need for more troops .
But there are no troops to send .
Bush has tried to pawn Afghanistan off on NATO , but Europe does not see any point in sacrificing its blood and money for the sake of American hegemony .
The NATO troops in Afghanistan are experiencing substantial casualties from a revived Taliban , and European governments are not enthralled over providing cannon fodder for U.S. hegemony .
The " coalition of the willing " has evaporated .
Indeed , it never existed .
Bush ’s " coalition " was assembled with bribes , threats , and intimidation .
Pervez Musharraf , the American puppet ruler of Pakistan , let the cat out of the bag when he told CBS ’ 60 Minutes on Sept. 24 , 2006 , that Pakistan had no choice about joining the " coalition . "
Brute coercion was applied .
Musharraf said Assistant Secretary of State Richard Armitage told the Pakistani intelligence director that " you are with us " or " be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . "
Armitage is trying to deny his threat , but Dawn Wire Service , reporting from Islamabad on Sept. 16 , 2001 , on the pressure Bush was putting on Musharraf to facilitate the U.S. attack on Afghanistan , stated : " ’ Pakistan has the option to live in the 21st century or the Stone Age ’ is roughly how U.S. officials are putting their case . "
That Musharraf would volunteer this information on American television is a good indication that Bush has lost the war .
Musharraf can no longer withstand the anger he has created against himself by helping the U.S. slaughter his fellow Muslims in Bush ’s attempt to exercise U.S. hegemony over the Muslim world .
Bush cannot protect Musharraf from the wrath of Pakistanis , and so Musharraf has explained himself as having cooperated with Bush in order to prevent the U.S. destruction of Pakistan : " One has to think and take actions in the interest of the nation , and that ’s what I did . "
Nevertheless , he said , he refused Bush ’s " ludicrous " demand that he arrest Pakistanis who publicly demonstrated against the U.S. : " If somebody ’s expressing views , we cannot curb the expression of views . "
Bush ’s defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel ’s defeat by Hezbollah in Lebanon have shown that the military firepower of the U.S. and Israeli armies , though effective against massed Arab armies , cannot defeat guerillas and insurgencies .
The U.S. has battled in Iraq longer than it fought against Nazi Germany , and the situation in Iraq is out of control .
The Taliban have regained half of Afghanistan .
The king of Saudi Arabia has told Bush that the ground is shaking under his feet as unrest over the American / Israeli violence against Muslims builds to dangerous levels .
Our Egyptian puppet sits atop 100 million Muslims who do not think that Egypt should be a lackey of U.S. hegemony .
The king of Jordan understands that Israeli policy is to drive every Palestinian into Jordan .
Bush is incapable of recognizing his mistake .
He can only escalate .
Plans have long been made to attack Iran .
The problem is that Iran can respond in effective ways to a conventional attack .
Moreover , an American attack on another Muslim country could result in turmoil and rebellion throughout the Middle East .
This is why the neocons have changed U.S. war doctrine to permit a nuclear strike on Iran .
Neocons believe that a nuclear attack on Iran would have intimidating force throughout the Middle East and beyond .
Iran would not dare retaliate , neocons believe , against U.S. ships , U.S. troops in Iraq , or use their missiles against oil facilities in the Middle East .
Neocons have also concluded that a U.S. nuclear strike on Iran would show the entire Muslim world that it is useless to resist America ’s will .
Neocons say that even the most fanatical terrorists would realize the hopelessness of resisting U.S. hegemony .
The vast multitude of Muslims would realize that they have no recourse but to accept their fate .
Revised U.S. war doctrine concludes that tactical or low - yield nuclear weapons cause relatively little " collateral damage " or civilian deaths , while achieving a powerful intimidating effect on the enemy .
The " fear factor " disheartens the enemy and shortens the conflict .
University of California Professor Jorge Hirsch , an authority on nuclear doctrine , believes that an American nuclear attack on Iran will destroy the Nonproliferation Treaty and send countries in pell - mell pursuit of nuclear weapons .
We will see powerful nuclear alliances , such as Russia / China , form against us .
Japan could be so traumatized by an American nuclear attack on Iran that it would mean the end of Japan ’s sycophantic relationship to the U.S .
There can be little doubt that the aggressive U.S. use of nukes in pursuit of hegemony would make America a pariah country , despised and distrusted by every other country .
Neocons believe that diplomacy is feeble and useless , but that the unapologetic use of force brings forth cooperation in order to avoid destruction .
Neoconservatives say that America is the new Rome , only more powerful than Rome .
Neoconservatives genuinely believe that no one can withstand the might of the United States and that America can rule by force alone .
Hirsch believes that the U.S. military ’s opposition to the use of nuclear weapons against Iran has been overcome by the civilian neocon authorities in the Bush administration .
Desperate to retrieve their drive toward hegemony from defeat in Iraq , the neocons are betting on the immense attraction to the American public of force plus success .
It is possible that Bush will be blocked by Europe , Russia , and China , but there is no visible American opposition to Bush legitimizing the use of nuclear weapons at the behest of U.S. hegemony .
It is astounding that such dangerous fanatics have control of the U.S. government and have no organized opposition in American politics .
Unlucky PC users could lose important files
Infected PCs will also be used as launch platforms to help the virus seek out fresh victims .
Because the virus is known to be lurking on more than 300,000 PCs , this scanning could generate large amounts of net traffic as it activates .
The Nyxem - E virus has been racking up victims since it emerged on 16 January .
A website associated with the virus has been keeping count of the machines it has managed to infect and now this counter stands at more than 300,000 victims .
Unlike many other recent Windows viruses , Nyxem - E has been built to delete many popular types of file .
Security firms suggest it was written to target businesses because many of the file types it deletes , spreadsheets and presentations , are more common in firms than homes .
However , because many companies have good security systems in place home users are more likely to be caught out .
The virus only affects Windows users who must open an infected attachment on an e-mail message to fall victim .
NYXEM FILE TARGETS DMP - Oracle files DOC - Word document MDB - Microsoft Access MDE - Microsoft Access / Office PDF - Adobe Acrobat PPS - PowerPoint slideshow PPT - PowerPoint PSD - Photoshop RAR - Compressed archive XLS - Excel spreadsheet ZIP - Compressed file
Security firm Lurhq has analysed the data sent to the website counting victims and found that most are in Peru , Turkey and India .
Many other nations are reporting infected machines too .
Some unlucky users have already fallen victim to Nyxem - E because the clock on their machine is set to the wrong time .
When the virus strikes it will also start scanning local computer networks for other machines to infect .
This could cause problems for some users as the data generated swamps net links .
UK net service firm Easynet has started telling customers if they are using an infected computer and urging them to clean it up and remove the bug .
Security firms said users needed to be vigilant but not panic because many other Windows viruses have been far more successful at infecting machines but have not caused significant problems for the net .
Despite the furore over Nyxem - E , Microsoft said it was not planning to update its malicious software removal tools before the date that the virus is set to strike .
Instead , the next version of the tool which is due to be released on 14 February will spot and remove the worm if it finds it on a PC .
In an advisory Microsoft said users should not open unusual attachments from unfamiliar sources .
Nyxem - E is also known as Nyxem - D , Blackworm , MyWife , Kama Sutra , Grew and CME - 24 virus .

Incarceration Again
The comments in “ my recent post ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2006/05/23/incarceration-rates/ about U.S. incarceration rates got a little bad tempered : some people ( I ’m looking at you , jet ) did n’t like the figure , because it included countries that are not exactly model states .
Some followup below the fold .
The point of the figure was to bring home that the U.S. has the highest rate of incarceration in the world , bar none .
To illustrate this is not to explain it .
So sure , many countries with lower incarceration rates are also not nice places to live , to put it mildly .
If you have the highest rate of incarceration _in the world_ that leaves a lot of countries looking better on that measure , even if many of them do so for bad reasons ( such as being a failed state , or having the whole country be a kind of prison instead ) .
So , just for the sake of it , here is the same data again , with the comparison restricted this time to basically well - functioning advanced capitalist democracies .
( “ PDF available also . ” : http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/incarceration-oecd.pdf)
By the standards of comparable countries , the U.S. ’s rate of incarceration is frankly astonishing .
A second objection was , this only tells a little bit of the story , to which we can say , of course .
Jet asks , “ Yeah , and where would the US fall in a graph showing percentage of the population victimized by crime ? ”
Cross-national comparisons of crime statistics are hard , because of reporting and definitional issues .
( This is true in the U.S. between states , too , or even between different cities and neighborhoods . )
Your best bet is crimes involving a dead victim , because that ’s most often reported .
So here is the same list of countries ordered this time by the rate of deaths due to assault in 1999 , the most recent year I have available .
( “ PDF available also . ” : http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/assault-deaths-99.pdf)
As you can see , the U.S. is again a remarkable outlier .
If you want to look at the time series for this statistic from 1960 to 2000 or so , “ here it is ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2005/03/24/violent-societies/
from a post last year .
As you ’ll see there , the U.S. is not only always # 1 on this measure , it is also by far the most variable : the 1999 value is actually the lowest since the mid ’60s .
I would n’t post this if I had n’t seen similar before ( we love to watch FBI Files ) .
In this case a University of Central England , Birmingham student killed his wife after using Google to figure out how .
killed his wife with a baseball bat because she became too independent for him .
The incident is now dubbed the â€œGoogle Murderâ€ because the day before the killing , Anurag logged onto a university computer and carried out a Google search which â€ “ in the words of prosecuting lawyer Gareth Walters â€ “ involved â€œtips with killing with a baseball bat and how to murder someone and not get caught.â€ 
I hate to help a criminal , but please people — do n’t search for how to murder someone on a computer .
You are not searching in privacy you think you are .
I donâ€™t know how Anuragâ€™s searches were uncovered â€ “ maybe the university logs all traffic and handed over the data to the prosecutors
See ?
Handing data over to anyone that asks seems pretty common these days , too common IMO .
If you think so too try our tips on search privacy , clearing your searchÂ history , and even how to keep desktop searches safe .
Hit tip to Blogoscoped .
Hated by Democrats , demonised by leftwing blogs and worshipped by the right , Fox News is 10 years old this week , but the channel has no plans to grow old gracefully
It was the best birthday present Fox News could have asked for : a juicy on - air punch - up with Bill Clinton .
The former president agreed to appear on America 's brashest 24 - hour news channel a few days ago .
Within minutes , the interview had become a slanging match , with Clinton telling interviewer Chris Wallace : " You did Fox 's bidding on this show .
You did your nice little conservative hit job on me . "
Clearly agitated , Clinton added : " You 've got that little smirk on your face and you think you 're so clever . "
Result !
More controversy for the channel ; another liberal seemingly floundering after a pounding from one of Rupert Murdoch 's anchors .
Fox News Channel ( FNC ) is 10 years old this week and , though ratings are not as high as they were , there is little doubt that the channel - hated by the Democrats , demonised by leftwing bloggers and worshipped by the right - is a success story .
With its in - your - face attitude , melodramatic " breaking news " whooshes and sexy urgency , Fox is America 's number one cable news channel , a title it claimed from CNN four years ago .
As a result , it is highly profitable : according to the most recent accounts of parent company News Corporation , its operating income is up 25 % on last year .
So the company is celebrating by taking its " Thank you , America " tour around the country ( including a yah - boo stop right outside CNN's headquarters in Atlanta ) .
Back in 1996 , the flag - flying station received mixed reviews .
It also found itself without many viewers - following an effort by Ted Turner , the creator of CNN , to keep the new channel off the cable systems .
Such opposition from the established players in the TV market helped to play into Fox 's hands .
Even today , while it leads the rolling news market , it still likes to portray itself as the " underdog " , at war with America 's " elite media " .
And this from a company that is owned by the world 's most powerful media entrepreneur .
What infuriates Fox 's critics is the fact that the network - run by Roger Ailes , a one - time strategist to Presidents Nixon , Reagan and the elder George Bush - continually repeats its slogan " fair and balanced " while broadcasting output its critics claim is blatantly pro-Republican .
Such critics do appear to have ammunition .
For example , what fair - and - balanced on - screen caption did Fox News use a few years back to describe the fact that more than a million people had taken to the streets of London to protest against the Iraq war ?
" March Madness . "
Meanwhile , the network 's Washington bureau is so closely aligned with the Bush administration that , according to someone who has worked there , it is known as " White House West " .
So is the station as biased as its critics claim ?
MediaGuardian set out to conduct a " fair and balanced " investigation .
Alas , we were not helped by the fact that one side of the argument - Fox itself - refused to take part in the debate once it was explained that we would also be seeking opinions from outside the organisation .
" So you 're using someone else 's opinions of Fox News also ? " asked an aghast media relations executive , Diana Rocco .
" What sort of critics are you looking to ? "
The case for the defence thus falls to radio presenter Nick Ferrari , a Brit who ran a local Fox - affiliate station in New York in the early 90s and now is a presenter on LBC 97.3 in London .
" Do they show bias ?
Yes of course they do - and it's fantastic , " says Ferrari .
" They show bias in a patriotic way to counter a never - ending sea of dissent , lies and anti-government crap that swims around much of liberal America . "
Britain should follow America 's example and allow TV , like newspapers , to deliver the news with a point of view .
" What 's the danger ? " he asks .
" Are you saying that people are so damn thick that they watch Fox News and they are automatically going to be brainwashed ? "
Such sentiments are not going to quieten Fox 's critics .
Two years ago , documentary maker Robert Greenwald released a polemical film , Outfoxed , which revealed the existence of a daily memo - since discontinued - sent to staff by John Moody , a senior Fox executive , setting the tone for the day 's reporting .
Thus came an instruction in the midst of the 2004 presidential election to focus on the " flip - flopping " of the Democrat candidate John Kerry , and the order to reporters covering the 9/11 commission : " Do not turn this into another Watergate . "
And the directive in the early days of the Iraq war : " Let 's refer to the US Marines we see in the foreground as ' sharp - shooters ' not ' snipers ' , which carries a negative connotation . "
Roy Gutman , foreign editor at the liberal New York newspaper Newsday , praises Fox News for being swift on its feet - " I watch it more than I expected to because they are faster off the mark than CNN , " - but appears to hate himself for doing so .
Ailes has " introduced opinion and he 's calling it fairness " .
By abolishing the division between fact and comment , Fox , he says , has " established a kind of paradigm that is antithetical to news coverage " .
Fox is sister network to Sky News , Murdoch 's British rolling news channel .
Staff at the politically - neutral UK channel have mixed feelings about the US network .
A well - informed Sky source says : " I like Fox - I just think it 's totally biased . "
The source adds , " I said to a Fox executive once : ' You 're so bloody one - sided , it 's unbelievable . '
And he said : ' No we 're not .
We 've got a stable of Republican pundits and Democrat pundits . "
Aha !
Fair and balanced !
" But , " added the Fox executive to the Sky source , " we have all the bright Republicans and we set them against stupid Democrats . "
' It 's entertaining but it 's not news '
Robert Greenwald , director of Outfoxed
" My argument is not with what Fox News does , my beef is that they call themselves a news channel .
The station exists for one reason : to propagate the Republican party approach to politics .
And they do a good job of that .
But instead of regularly boasting on air that they are " fair and balanced " and that " we report - you decide " , they should say what they are : a Republican party news station .
The pretence means they 're either ashamed of what they do or they 're trying to manipulate the public .
In 2004 , I made a documentary called Outfoxed .
In the film , we revealed the existence of daily memos sent by John Moody , Fox 's senior vice president for news , to his staff .
These editorial instructions revealed how Fox has a very specific agenda .
For example , Moody wrote : " Do not fall into the easy trap of mourning the loss of US lives and asking out loud why are we there ?
The US is in Iraq to help a country brutalised for 30 years , protect the gains made by Operation Iraqi Freedom and set it on the path to democracy .
Some people in Iraq do n't want that to happen .
That is why American GIs are dying .
And that 's what we should remind our viewers . "
The point is that the station stands for whatever the Bush administration 's policy is at any particular moment .
So it spent months trying to show us that everything 's going swimmingly in Iraq .
All because this is Bush 's policy .
Fox News is very entertaining - but so is wrestling .
It 's fun to watch - you 've got the good guys , the bad guys , the boos , the yells and the cheers - but one thing it 's not is news . "
Robert Greenwald was talking to Vincent Graff .
His latest film is Iraq for Sale - see www.iraqforsale.org
Many survivors need shelter and food before winter hits
The rare donation , Delhi 's largest to Pakistan since the 1960s , was made at a UN donor conference on Wednesday .
The pledge was part of $ 580 m ( £ 327 m ) promised by donors following a UN warning of an impending catastrophe .
The UN says with winter looming , more than 3 m people in mountain villages lack food and shelter .
Line of Control
Indian foreign ministry spokesman , Navtej Sarna , said in Delhi : " The government of Pakistan will be welcome to use this contribution for rebuilding homes and rehabilitating people , reconstructing the infrastructure and restoring essential services . "
India previously passed three consignments of relief material to Pakistan but an offer to send helicopters into Pakistan - controlled Kashmir was turned down because of " military sensitivities " .
The nations have fought two wars over Kashmir , which both claim in its entirety .
Almost half of the money pledged ... wo n't save a single one of the thousands of lives currently hanging in the balance
Oxfam
Dangers facing survivors
This is one of the biggest aid pledges India has made to Pakistan .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says India has been keen to be seen to contribute to the relief effort .
However , our correspondent says that both sides have yet to agree on how to open the Line of Control , the de facto border in Kashmir .
Such a move would greatly ease relief efforts .
Talks between Indian and Pakistani officials are expected on Saturday .
Pakistan says more than 54,000 people died in the quake in its northern region and Pakistan - administered Kashmir .
More than 1,300 died in Indian - controlled Kashmir .
India 's pledge followed a warning from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said a " winter without pity " was looming .
Relief workers say they face a race against time to provide shelter and food stocks for hundreds of thousands of people , particularly in Pakistani - administered Kashmir .
" All humanitarian organisations are acutely aware that our window of opportunity for action is closing with the onset of the severe winter , " UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland said in Geneva .
On Thursday , UN data revealed only two percent of $ 95 m needed for shelter and non -food supplies had been received and only four percent of $ 58 m for food .
Oxfam criticism
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said on Thursday his country was " eternally grateful " with the additional pledges made in Geneva and the aid previously given .

" We are very encouraged .
Naturally we hope the process will continue .
It is a major human tragedy we are dealing with , " he said .
Also on Thursday , Iraq said it was sending several hundred soldiers from its new army - an engineering battalion - to help relief work .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has said the financial cost of the quake will be more than $ 5bn .
Before the Geneva conference , charity Oxfam suggested some Western countries had given less than their " fair share " to the UN appeal .
Afterwards it said much of the new funding was " too little , too late " , with only three weeks of good weather left to get aid into affected regions before winter hits .
" It appears that almost half of the money pledged is for longer - term reconstruction work which , although vital , wo n't save a single one of the thousands of lives currently hanging in the balance , " Oxfam said in a statement .

To keep up with its critics , Wal - Mart " has to run a campaign , " said Robert McAdam , a former political strategist at the Tobacco Institute who now oversees Wal - Mart 's corporate communications .
" It 's simply nonsense for us to let some of these attacks go without a response . "
Wal - Mart 's aggressive new posture is a departure from its tradition of relying on an internal staff to manage the company 's image .
The war room , which is part of a larger Wal - Mart effort to portray itself as more worker - friendly and environmentally conscious , runs counter to the philosophy of the chain 's founder , Sam Walton .
Believing that public relations was a waste of time and money , the penny - pinching Mr. Walton would not likely have hired a public relations firm like Edelman , Wal - Mart 's choice to operate its war room .
So what has changed ?
For one thing , Wal - Mart 's critics have become more sophisticated .
For years , unions hurled little more than insults at the chain .
But over the last year , two small groups -- Wal - Mart Watch and Wake Up Wal - Mart -- set up shop in Washington with the goal of waging the public relations equivalent of guerilla warfare against the company .
Wal - Mart Watch received start - up cash from the Service Employees International Union ; Wake Up Wal - Mart is a project of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union .
Unions have tried , unsuccessfully , to organize Wal - Mart 's employees .
At the suggestion of Wake Up Wal - Mart , members of the nation 's largest teachers ' unions staged a boycott of Wal - Mart for back - to - school supplies this fall .
Wal - Mart Watch , meanwhile , set up an automated phone system that called 10,000 people in Arkansas in June seeking potential whistle - blowers willing to share secrets about the retailer .
Wal - Mart did not rebut such attacks , even when Wal - Mart Watch released a 24 - page report blasting the company 's wages and benefits .
Wal - Mart Watch said the report had been downloaded from its Web site 55,000 times .
Once a darling of Wall Street , Wal - Mart 's stock price has fallen 27 percent since 2000 , when H. Lee Scott Jr. became chief executive , a drop that executives have said reflects , in part , investors ' anxieties about the company 's image .
Sales growth at stores open for more than a year has slowed to an average of 3.5 percent a month this year , compared with 6.3 percent at Target .
And Wal - Mart is facing growing resistance to new urban stores , with high - profile defeats in Los Angeles , Chicago and New York .
There is some evidence that criticism is influencing consumers .
A confidential 2004 report prepared by McKinsey & Company for Wal - Mart , and made public by Wal - Mart Watch , found that 2 percent to 8 percent of Wal - Mart consumers surveyed have ceased shopping at the chain because of " negative press they have heard . "
Russia recently conducted a flight test of a new warhead that can change course in midflight , which U.S. and Russian officials are calling part of Moscow ’s efforts to defeat U.S. missile defenses .
The warhead was tested Nov. 1 and tracked by U.S. intelligence technical monitors , including satellites , the officials said .
An analysis of the flight test by U.S. intelligence agencies revealed that it was a further test of a maneuverable warhead that Moscow has been developing for several years in response to U.S. missile defenses .
The warhead was flight tested on a Russian Topol - M missile , designated by the Pentagon the SS - 27 , that flew from the Kapustin Yar launch complex in southern Russia near Volgograd .
The missile booster fired for a shorter - than - usual duration in placing the dummy warhead and re-entry vehicle into space .
The warhead then dropped down to a lower trajectory and was able to maneuver .
Kremlin officials were quoted in Russian press reports as saying the new warhead was designed to thwart the new U.S. missile - defense system of interceptors deployed in Alaska and California .
U.S. officials confirmed some characteristics of the new missile warhead based on an analysis of the Nov. 1 flight test , which was first reported earlier this month by several Russian news organizations .
Unlike current ballistic warheads that do not alter their flight paths sharply once they reach space , the new warhead can change course and range while traveling at speeds estimated at about 3 miles per second , the officials said .
Maneuvering warheads represents a difficult physics challenge because changing course at such high speeds normally would cause a warhead to disintegrate .
Maneuverability would let a warhead thwart missile defenses , because such countermeasures rely on sensors to project a warhead ’s flight path and impact point so that an interceptor missile can be guided to the right spot to knock out a warhead .
Rick Lehner , a spokesman for the Pentagon ’s Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) , declined to comment on U.S. intelligence assessments of the latest Russian warhead test because data is classified .
But Mr. Lehner would say that U.S. missile defenses aim to counter a limited number of warheads from a small nuclear power such as North Korea , not a major strike from a nation with hundreds of missiles , such as Russia .
However , Moscow believes future U.S. defenses , including plans to deploy anti-missile interceptors in Europe or the East Coast of the United States , could be used against Russian strategic missiles .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a year ago that the new strategic - missile system “ will have no analogues , ” a reference to the hypersonic warhead .
Meanwhile , the Pentagon announced yesterday the Navy ’s Aegis missile - defense system conducted the sixth successful test of an anti-missile interceptor hitting a target warhead .
It was the first time that a ship - based SM - 3 interceptor missile hit a warhead that had been separated from its booster , the MDA said in a statement .
The test was carried out near Hawaii from the Aegis - equipped cruiser USS Lake Erie .

Two - thirds of people in Asia with HIV are in India
It found the incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in 25 years .
UNAids said improved funding and access to drugs appeared to be producing results - but said HIV remained " an exceptional threat " .
It warned the infection rate was still rising in some countries , and record numbers now live with the virus .
The agency , which surveyed 126 countries , estimated that 38.6 m people are living with HIV worldwide .
It found that approximately 4.1 m people were newly infected with the virus during 2005 , and approximately 2.8 m people died of Aids - related illnesses during the year .
The report warns young people and children are increasingly affected by the epidemic , and efforts to protect these groups are not keeping pace .
It found some countries were doing well on treating people with HIV , but poorly on HIV prevention efforts , while in others the opposite was true .
The report said there was still a need for improved planning , sustained leadership and reliable long - term funding - with current levels of spending still below what was required .
The report was released on the eve of a UN General Assembly meeting on Aids in New York to review progress in the five years since a major international declaration setting goals for tackling the virus .
Dr Peter Piot , UNAids executive director said efforts to combat HIV appeared to be starting to produce results .
He said : " The actions we take from here are particularly important , as we know with increasing certainty where and how HIV is moving , as well as how to slow the epidemic and reduce its impact . "
Africa worst hit
Sub -Saharan Africa remains the epicentre of the Aids pandemic , with two - thirds of all people living with HIV coming from the region .
Two million people died of Aids in the region last year and there were 2.7 m new infections .
However , the numbers affected in Eastern Europe and Asia continue to rise .
India , Ukraine and the Russian Federation are particularly badly affected .
India overtook South Africa as the world 's worst - affected country in terms of the absolute number of people with HIV - although not as a proportion of the population .
The report says the " 3x5 " target to get anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) to three million people by 2005 was missed , but access to treatment has significantly improved .
In 2001 , just 240,000 people in developing countries had access to ART .
By 2005 , that had risen to 1.3m .
However , UNAids said that means only one in five people around the world who need the drugs gets them .
The report calls for the price of ART drugs to be cut to widen access to treatment .
Prevention
The report found HIV prevention programmes are failing to reach those most at risk .
The UN's Declaration of Commitment on HIV / Aids said 90 % of young people should know about the disease by 2005 .
But surveys suggest fewer than 50 % have comprehensive knowledge .
Just 9 % of men who have sex with men received any type of HIV prevention advice , and only 20 % of intravenous drug users .
However , there has been some success .
Six out of 11 African countries reported declines of at least 25 % in HIV prevalence among 15 - 24 - year - olds in capital cities .
Rates of sex among young people declined in nine of 14 sub -Saharan countries .
And condom use with a non-regular partner increased in eight of 11 countries in the same region .
The report also called for a significant increase in funding .
It said $ 8.3 bn was made available in 2005 , more than five times the funding available in 2001 .
However , it warns that over $ 20bn will be needed annually from 2008 .
UNaids also called for world leaders to fulfil their commitment made at the 2005 G8 Summit to achieve universal access to HIV treatment by 2010 .
Deborah Jack , of the UK's National Aids Trust , said : " Behind the shocking statistics there has been progress in improving access to drugs and in rolling out prevention programmes in developing countries .
" This shows that interventions can and do work .
But such efforts must be accompanied by the promotion of human rights . "
Nick Partridge , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " Governments and businesses across the world must continue to do more to increase access to anti-retroviral treatments , good sex education and condoms , which we know are vital in reducing the spread of HIV . "

The CIA field commander for the agency ’s Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora , Gary Berntsen , has finally got approval to publish his book , which will hit the streets on December 27 , 2005 .
The CIA has sat on the book for more than a year and tried to stop its publication .
Although the book is not intended as a criticism of President Bush , it will land another body blow to the beleaguered Bush Presidency .
Bernsten ’s key point in the book is his testimonty that he and other U.S. commanders did know that bin Laden was among the hundreds of fleeing Qaeda and Taliban members .
According to NEWSWEEK , “ Berntsen says he had definitive intelligence that bin Laden was holed up at Tora Bora–intelligence operatives had tracked him–and could have been caught .
He was there . ”
Look for General Tommy Franks image as the great commander to be further tarnished .
This book will have the unintended effect of reminding all Americans that George Bush did not finish the job of tracking down Bin Laden .
Instead , he shifted key military and intelligence resources and started a war of choice in Iraq .
At the current fatality rate more than 2100 Americans will have died in Iraq when this book is available in bookstores .
Put on your list for belated Christmas and Hanukkah shopping .
Happy Holidays .

More than a year before the invasion of Iraq the CIA devised a plan , codenamed Anabasis , to use Iraqi exile fighters to seize an air base and declare a revolt against Saddam Hussein in the hope that his response would create a pretext for war , according to a book published tomorrow .
The plan was ultimately rejected by General Tommy Franks , who led the invasion in March 2003 , but the CIA - backed fighters carried out sabotage operations and assassinations of Ba'athist officials in the run-up to the war , the book , called Hubris , reports .
Hubris , by investigative journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn , adds more weight to a body of evidence that the White House was determined to go to war from early 2002 .
Planning on Anabasis , which cost $ 400 m ( £ 210 m ) , started at the end of 2001 and was approved by President Bush in February 2002 .
CIA agents entered Iraq to recruit volunteers two months later .
Talking to his spokesman , Ari Fleischer , in May 2002 , President Bush made clear his intentions towards Saddam when he said : " I 'm going to kick his sorry motherfucking ass all over the Mid East , " according to another press aide , Adam Levine , who witnessed the conversation .
The covert CIA preparations for war have been previously reported , but this is the first time details of the plan have been made public .
According to the book , the CIA flew 80 former Iraqi soldiers into the US in the summer of 2002 , and trained them at an energy department nuclear test site , 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas .
They rehearsed seizing an Iraqi airbase at Nukhaib , near the Saudi border , and broadcasting a call to Iraqi units to join a revolt against Saddam .
The CIA expected Saddam to strike back and violate the no-fly zone , creating a pretext for US - British military intervention .
" The idea was to create an incident in which Saddam lashes out , " John Maguire , a CIA agent who ran the operation told the authors , adding that if the plan worked " you 'd have a premise for war : we 've been invited in " .
The CIA - trained fighters were flown to Jordan in January 2003 to wait for a green light which never came .

When city officials contact urban expert Joel Kotkin for guidance on how to attract people to their locales , they often ask about things that make him cringe .
Instead of improving schools or infrastructure , they want to construct performing arts centers and pump up cultural offerings to lure the artsy and the hip .
That 's not the way to revitalize cities , argues Mr. Kotkin , author of " The City : A Global History . "
To him , attracting and keeping people in urban environments is less about projecting an image of " cool " and more about providing the basics that encourage and support a strong middle class : jobs , schools , churches .
Kotkin's skepticism about relying on cultural enticements - which is not shared by all urbanists - is informed in part by his latest work , which looks back at the evolution of cities .
" No urban civilization has flourished long without middle - class families , " he says in a recent interview in New York .
The key to keeping people interested in city living is the idea of upward mobility .
" That aspiration is very critical to urban life , it 's important to the social order that people feel they can go somewhere . "
By looking at the history of the city , from its origins in the Middle East to today 's metropolises , he 's observed that as cities evolved , their health typically rested on three factors : " the sacredness of place , the ability to provide security and project power , and ... the animating role of commerce , " he writes .
He argues that to be successful , today 's cities must still be places that are " sacred , safe , and busy . "
Without the idea of sacred space , for example , it 's unlikely cities anywhere could have existed , Kotkin suggests .
Religious leaders not only set the calendars that organized life , they also helped groups of people who were not related learn how to get along together .
In today 's secular cities , it is financial and cultural buildings that dot skylines , and religion and moral cohesiveness are more muted , in part , he says , because families are increasingly less common in major cities .
" Who 's got time for babies ? " he asks , arguing that the high cost of living and small apartments are contributing to low birthrates in some cities .
The challenge for megacities is that they 're competing with places that are smaller and more manageable - and from which people can telecommute .
With diverse eateries and culture spreading to smaller towns and suburbs , there 's less reason to stay in cities , the author argues .
Kotkin has high hopes for places like Des Moines , Iowa , which he says could provide a good urban experience if it continues to blend amenities such as nice restaurants with its middle - class character .
He 's less impressed with Cleveland , which tried to take the " hip " approach : " They did the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , they built lofts , they created this kind of new and improved downtown ... [ and ] what 's the result ?
Poorest city in America , highest percentage of poverty in the country . "
Another of his concerns is places with transient populations that build themselves up as centers of culture and entertainment as industry departs .
These " ephemeral cities , " as he calls them , appeal to the single and the young , but those people will leave when they 're ready to settle down , he says .
" One of the things that worries me is that cities are going to become like giant ... campuses or hotels , [ where ] somebody will come and use it for a period of time , as opposed to saying , ' This is where I live . ' "
The opposite is happening in Las Vegas , for example , where casino workers can afford houses .
New residents are also flocking to Phoenix and Charlotte , N.C. " Not what you would call the hip , cool capitals of the world , " notes Kotkin .
As for the author , he resides in Los Angeles , where he appreciates living in an urban setting while still having a house with a backyard and trees .
" People think of it as Tinseltown , but it 's ... a very real city with a big working class , a big poor population , a big middle class . "
Kotkin says that with a few exceptions , this is a time of muted vision on the part of city officials , perhaps because the path of cities is currently unclear .
" Maybe we 're in the early stages of an epoch , " he suggests .
" It took 30 , 40 , 50 years into the Industrial Age until we started to correct some of the basic problems . "
He suggests that civic leaders follow the example of Julius Caesar - who made Rome , the first megacity , less congested by ordering that the carts crowding the streetsbe used only at night .
" You have to understand what the problems are , " says Kotkin , " and then you have to have a willingness to act on them . "
I innadvertantly became the owner of a copy of a HUGE list of email addresses used by spammers .
The list includes about 23 1/2 million addresses .
This is quite and interesting Conundrum .
Ethically
Do I alert the spammers of their mistake , which allowed one of our customers to download these files ( open directory browsing ) .
Do I do nothing ?
Should I write an email that states “ I represent the following people attatched to this email , and they demand they are removed from your list at once ”
I find the latter part quite amusing .
Although I do n’t truly represent them , and it would be a lie .
I doubt a single soul on that list would really argue .
but 1 out of 23 million is actually quite possible 😉
Interestingly a little more than half of those people on the list are refered to as ‘ adult ’ customers .
What would you do ?
Or rather should I do with this list ?
I cringe at the thought of what a friend had told me .
“ Start a torrent and post it to mininova ” – I ’m glad he did n’t end up with the list !
The research may mean computers shuffle data faster
Intel researchers have solved a manufacturing problem that has delayed the creation of devices that can both generate and route light .
The breakthrough could mean cheaper and higher speed computer networks and help to speed up the transfer of data inside computers .
Intel said commercial versions of the hybrid chip may not appear until 2010 .
Light speed
The breakthrough revolves around the fusing of the two materials commonly used in computer chips and high - speed optical networks .
Silicon has been the mainstay of computer chip making for decades and its ability to move , amplify and detect light is well known .
However , silicon is not very good at generating light .
As a result high - speed continent - spanning networks often use components made from an exotic material known as indium phosphide that possesses very good light generating properties .
Intel researchers , working with Professor John Bowers from the University of California , Santa Barbara , have found an easy way to unite silicon and indium phosphide .
The researchers discovered that the use during manufacturing of an oxygen plasma acts as a " glass glue " that tightly bonds the two materials into one device .
Applying a voltage makes the indium phosphide generate light which can then be manipulated by the silicon elements of the hybrid chip .
The close mating of the two materials could mean that data can get on and off computer chips far more quickly than it can via conventional connections .
It should also mean much closer links between computers and data networks .
Intel envisages a day when silicon chips sport dozens of the tiny lasers and their light - manipulating machinery .
The fact that it uses the relatively low - cost manufacturing techniques used to make silicon chips could slash the cost of making components for high - speed telecommunications networks .
" This marks the beginning of highly integrated silicon photonic chips that can be mass - produced at low cost , " said Prof Bowers .
The research builds on earlier Intel research on making silicon generate light and on improving its ability to direct it .
Via Bob Geiger , the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America took a look at 324 legislative votes in the last five years which affected American troops and veterans .
Legislative proposals included veterans ' benefits , healthcare , and medical research dedicated towards injured soldiers ( head injuries , etc . )
Based on these votes , IAVA calculated which senators and congressmen had a history of supporting the troops , and which did n't , and graded them on a curve .
You can see the full results at the IAVA website , here .
But Bob has put the Senate rankings in order of letter grade , and produced this handy chart .
As you 'll note , based on the over 300 votes the IAVA used in its calculation , all Senate Democrats have been more supportive of the troops -- when it comes to their actual votes , over the past five years -- than any of the Senate Republicans .
The IAVA is a nonpartisan organization .
That the results -- who supports the troops , and who does n't -- are so strikingly partisan is another demonstration of Republicans talking the talk , and the Democrats walking the walk .

For years now , Mick Hartley ’s blog has often linked to and summarized journalism that covers the horror and absurdity of life under the North Korean regime .
Not only are its subjects prisoners , but the story of their suffering is hidden from the outside world , both by the paranoia and secrecy of the country ’s rulers and by the indifference of many outside the country .
A post on Hartley ’s blog this week includes a depressing reminder of what can happen outside the prison walls when tyrants take care to kill their victims discreetly : nothing much :
Title : Gone
Name : Linda Bergkvist
Country : Sweden
Software : Painter , Photoshop
I ’ve decided to share my final piece for the Furiae book , since I ’ve submitted it to Exposé 4 , anyway :]
I ’ve no inclination to go into the story behind it right now … but the painting took me ages to complete .
I had such a vision of how I wanted it  peaceful yet sad , because the character depicted is no longer alive … and it was hard .
It was very hard .
A friend of mine , Johan , posed for the references almost half a year ago , and I tried to finish the picture on many occasions without ever quite ‘ getting ’ it .
I could n’t achieve the look I wanted no matter how hard I tried .
Then , a while ago , I sat down and finally I caught the feeling for it .
I think it was in the skintone that made the difference .
Or perhaps the textures .
Something ‘ clicked ’ , anyway , the way things do very rarely .
The piece is done about 50 % in Photoshop , 50 % in Painter … with a lot of different textures applied chiefly to the foliage to give it the right look .
The skintone is painted almost exclusively in Photoshop as I still blend colours best there
The face , some people tell me , resembles my own  but for once I was n’t using myself as the reference !
Not fair !
My Dior perfume modelled for the bottle , so I guess I sort of snagged the general shape of that bottle from J’adore  if you ’ve seen the bottle , you know what I mean .
In the end , I think the hands and the bottle took by far the longest to make .
After , I ’ve refrained from painting any other detailed hands , hehe , I guess these just took the spirit out of me .
And for the close - ups :
For a full size detail :
Mikołaj Cholewicz
Wikinews prezentuje rozmowę z Mikołajem Agatonem Cholewiczem , obserwatorem tegorocznych wyborów prezydenckich na Białorusi z ramienia OBWE .
M. Cholewicz jest politologiem specjalizującym się w stosunkach międzynarodowych oraz bezpiecze ństwie narodowym .
Obserwator [ edytuj ]
Masz już duże doświadczenie w obserwacji wyborów i referendów krajowych , byłeś również obserwatorem w Kosowie ( 2001 ) i dwukrotnie na Ukrainie ( 2004 ) .
Powiedz , kto może zostać obserwatorem - czy wymagane jest wykształcenie takie , jak Twoje ?
Mikołaj Cholewicz
Nie ma wymogów formalnych co do wykształcenia obserwatora .
Praktycznie może nim zostać każdy , kto spełnia podstawowe wymogi : bardzo dobra znajomość języka misji - angielskiego , atutem jest też oczywiście znajomość języka kraju w , którym ma odbyć się obserwacja .
Dodatkowym elementem branym pod uwagę przy rekrutacji obserwatora jest jego doświadczenie związane z wyborami , najlepiej za granicą , ale to w kraju może być również docenione .
Na pewno istotnym czynnikiem jest znajomość specyfiki danego kraju - można tu zaliczy ć choćby pobyty turystyczne czy orientację w lokalnej historii .
WN Czy według Twoich obserwacji wybrani u nas obserwatorzy spełniali te warunki ?
M.Ch . Jak najbardziej !
Wszyscy z nas mieli doświadczenie międzynarodowe , bądź z obserwacji wyborów , bądź z praktyk za granicą , bądź z wyjazdów zagranicznych .
WN A obserwatorzy zagraniczni ?
Czy dawało się odczuć różnice wynikające chociażby z większego , niż w przypadku Polaków , oddalenia kulturowego ?
M.Ch .
Muszę powiedzieć , że się miło zdziwiłem na tej misji znajomością u wielu obserwatorów z zachodniej Europy i języka rosyjskiego i podłoża społeczno - politycznego Białorusi .
WN Można więc zdecydowanie powiedzieć , że obserwatorzy byli osobami nieprzypadkowymi , kompetentnymi .
M.Ch . Głęboko w to wierzę , że tak jak w Polsce dzięki intensywnej selekcji wybrano najlepszych .
Wyjazd [ edytuj ]
WN Czyli w praktyce nie jest łatwo zostać obserwatorem ?
Wiadomo z nieoficjalnych źródeł , że z Polski na w roli obserwatora wyborów Białoruś wybierało się 500 osób ; pojechało tylko 40 ...
M.Ch .
Tak , z Polski wytypowano grupę 40 obserwatorów , a ostatecznie pojechało 37 osób .
Jednej osobie odmówiono wizy ( Ambasada Białorusi ) już w Warszawie , dwie kolejne zostały cofnięte z pociągu w Brześciu przez białoruską służbę graniczną ...
WN Dlaczego ?
M.Ch. Prawdopodobnie osoby te ( jedna kobieta , dwóch mężczyzn ) znaleźli się na czarnej liście władz białoruskich .
Widocznie byli aktywnie zaangażowani w proces demokratyzacji Białorusi lub mieli kontakty z nieuznawanymi przez władze organizacjami pozarz ądowymi .
Niemniej jednak ja swój wjazd na Białoruś uważałem za pewny , gdyż nigdy nie byłem wcześniej w tym kraju , a także nie kontaktowałem się nigdy z przedstawicielami tamtejszej opozycji .
WN Nie mieli na Ciebie " haka " ?
M.Ch .
Z pewnością mieli informacje o wielu z nas , niemniej jednak tamte 3 osoby wydały im się szczególnie niebezpieczne .
WN Skąd mieli takie informacje o obserwatorach ?
M.Ch .
Wydaje się , że władze białoruskie maja dość dobre rozeznanie co do tego , co dotyczy ich kraju poza jego granicami - a szczególnie już , jeśli chodzi o graniczącą z nimi Polskę - członka NATO i Unii Europejskiej .
WN Oprócz kwestii wizy i zawrócenia z granicy , były jeszcze jakieś problemy z wjazdem ?
M.Ch .
Wielką niewiadomą było , czy w ogóle oficjalni obserwatorzy międzynarodowi zostaną wpuszczeni na teren Białorusi !
WN Jak to ?
M.Ch .
To samo zresztą dotyczyło całej społeczności międzynarodowej .
Niemniej jednak szczęśliwie zgodzono się na " pełny " monitoring wyborów , gdyż sama Białoruś jest przecież członkiem OBWE .
Niewpuszczenie przedstawicieli innych państw byłoby jawnym przyznaniem się do chęci sfałszowania wyborów ...
Wybory [ edytuj ]
Lokal wyborczy
WN Wspomniałeś w raporcie o innym - bardziej negatywnym - nastawieniu Białorusinów do obserwatorów z Polski niż z krajów bardziej na zachód .
M.Ch . No cóż ... jak pokazują zdarzenia po wyborach , Polska jest krajem , z którym stosunki należą do jednych z najgorszych .
Jednak ja osobiście nie doznałem żadnego uszczerbku .
Generalnie spotkałem się z dobrym przyjęciem przewodniczących i sekretarzy komisji .
Nawet było trochę żartów , w stylu oj , bo załatwię panu dłuższy pobyt na Białorusi ! - ale właśnie w tonie żartobliwym .
WN Skąd więc opisane w raporcie wrażenie niechęci ?
M.Ch .
Po prostu pechowy zbieg okoliczności .
Większość zespołów jest dwuosobowa , a tymczasem mój partner , obserwator z Anglii , zgubił swoją kartę akredytacyjną ... całą papierkową pracę i wszystkie kontrole musiałem więc wykonywać ja .
Wyglądało to tak , że Polak monitoruje białoruską władzę , stąd takie wrażenie , być może subiektywne i spowodowane okolicznościami ...
WN A co kontrolowałeś ?
Jakie były
Twoje zadania jako obserwatora ?
M.Ch . Obserwator w sposób bezstronny przygląda się sposobowi przeprowadzania głosowania w danym kraju .
Pod żadnym pozorem nie może okazywać sympatii dla żadnej ze stron biorących udział w wyborach , zabronione jest też wyrażanie własnych poglądów na tematy objęte obserwacją .
WN A konkretnie ?
M.Ch .
Naszym zadaniem było monitorowanie wczesnego głosowania , wypełnienie raportu zamknięcia ( podliczenia głosów ) tych lokali wyborczych , w których zagłosowało 100 % uprawnionych , obserwacja otwarcia lokalu wyborczego w niedzielę , kontrola przebiegu procesu wyborczego w około 10 lokalach wyborczych oraz , najważniejsze , obserwacja zamknięcia lokalu wyborczego i podliczania głosów .
WN Jakie macie praktyczne środki " przyglądania się sposobowi przeprowadzania wyborów " ; z jak bliska można patrzeć ?
M.Ch .
Pytanie jest bardzo właściwe , gdyż aby móc określić , czy liczenie głosów przeprowadzane jest w sposób uczciwy , należy stać możliwie blisko " stołu liczenia " , tak żeby móc ujrzeć oddane głosy na poszczególnych kartach do głosowania .
komisja , trzech funkcjonariuszy , czterech obserwatorów krajowych ...
Negatywnie oceniłem ten etap pracy - w moim przypadku nie pozwolono na zbliżenie się bliżej niż na 3 metry do stołu komisji !
WN Jak to uzasadniając ?
M.Ch . Uzasadnienie było zawsze to samo : Nie wolno nam ! , Nie możemy ! ,
Nie mamy prawa ! , Obserwatorzy muszą siedzieć ( spokojnie ) i patrzeć z daleka !
I nieważne , że nie widzą , na kogo oddano głos ...!
WN Próbowałeś z tym dyskutować ?
M.Ch .
Sam przeciwko całej komisji , trzem funkcjonariuszom i czterem obserwatorom krajowym niewiele bym zdziałał .
Jedyne , co mogłem zrobić , to odpowiednio opisać te sytuacje w moim raporcie .
WN To poważne uchybienie .
Masz jeszcze inne zastrzeżenia do przejrzystości wyborów ?
M.Ch. Owszem .
Do głównych uchybień nale żała odmowa odpowiedzi na pytania dotyczące liczby otrzymanych kart do głosowania , oddanych głosów ( nawet w przybliżeniu ) , liczby osób biorących udział we wczesnym i domowym głosowaniu , jak też uniemożliwienie nam obejrzenia listy wyborców pod kątem ( nie ) powtarzalności podpisów i występowania oryginalnych dat .
W dwóch ostatnich przypadkach okazywano mi często pusty ( wzorcowy ) zestaw wyborców .
Na powyższe pytania szefowie nie udzielali odpowiedzi zasłaniając się nakazem władz zwierzchnich , w tym wypadku terytorialnej komisji wyborczej .
Złamano również zasadę podania do publicznej wiadomości wyników głosowania po otwarciu każdej z urn , tłumacząc się , że zostanie pokazane zbiorcze zestawienie po obliczeniu głosów z każdej z trzech urn .
WN Czy widać było wybory na ulicy ?
Milicja ?
Plakaty wyborcze ?
M.Ch .
Co ciekawe , nie było aż tylu plakatów informujących o wyborach , ilu się spodziewałem , za to często widoczne były reklamy społeczne typu Głodnym chleba !
i plakaty serii Za Białoruś !
WN A obecność milicji ?
Widziało się ją ?
M.Ch . Najwięcej podczas samego głosowania , a przed wyborami niespecjalnie .
Co innego po - o tak , wtedy było ich jak mrówek , tajniaków również .
WN Jak z było poczuciem bezpiecze ństwa ?
W mediach pisano o pobiciu czeskiego dziennikarza , aresztowaniu polskiej reporterki ; w duńskiej telewizji rozmawiano z młodzieżą , która pojechała jako " nieoficjalni " obserwatorzy : zostali oni przetrzymani w hotelu bez możliwości kontaktu ze światem , byli przesłuchiwani przez KGB , potem wydaleni .
Czy więc czuło się nerwowość ?
M.Ch .
Szczerze mówiąc , ja czułem podniosłość misji , wagę tej obserwacji .
W hotelu , gdzie ulokowano obserwatorów z kilkudziesięciu państw świata w ogóle nie czuło się tego typu nerwowości .
Proszę pamiętać , że zostaliśmy niejako zaproszeni przez prezydenta Łukaszenkę , wydano nam stosowne karty akredytacyjne , zatem nasz pobyt był całkowicie legalny .
Natomiast przed samymi wyborami NA PEWNO żadnego napięcia wśród ludności nie byłem świadkiem .
WN Ale informacje o tych zdarzeniach docierały do Was , kiedy tam byliście ?
M.Ch .
Właśnie o to chodzi , że zupełnie nie .
Trzeba pamiętać , że na Białoruś narzucona jest pętla cenzury i wszelkie wiadomości są skutecznie filtrowane ...
WN Czy naiwnością jest liczenie na dostęp do mediów zachodnich ?
Internet , polskie radio przez granicę , zagraniczna tv ...?
M.Ch. Zwykli obywatele nie mają do tego dostępu .
Wszystko jest pod kontrolą , wiadomości np .
z CNN są tłumaczone na język rosyjski , a na pewno w oficjalnej tv nie można uświadczy ć nieprzychylnych opinii z innych krajów na temat systemu w Białorusi .
WN Z tego , co mówisz , wynika , że oficjalni obserwatorzy czuli się bezpiecznie ; ewentualne represje dotykały raczej dziennikarzy i obserwatorów " niezrzeszonych " .
M.Ch .
Tak , nasz status był zupełnie inny , wyższy nawet niż posłów z dyplomatycznymi paszportami .
Powtarzam : może nie byliśmy pożądani , ale tolerowani .
Po wyborach [ edytuj ]
WN Miałeś kontakt z ludnością ?
M.Ch. Nie .
Wręcz zakazano nam podejmować jakichkolwiek czynności , które mogłyby skazić naszą obiektywność - kontakty z mieszkańcami z pewnością do takich czynności należą ...
WN Trudno
Ci więc powiedzieć czy ludność ma jakieś oczekiwania wobec Polski , UE , świata zewnętrznego ?
M.Ch .
Nie rozmawiałem z obywatelami na temat ich stosunku do państw zachodnich .
Ale wiele osób wydawało się nie zainteresowanych wyborami , choć przecież ogromna większość zagłosowała !
WN Tak , według oficjalnych statystyk ...
A sam , jako politolog , czy możesz powiedzieć , czy Polska i Unia coś powinny robić " w kwestii Białorusi " ?
M.Ch .
Nie chcę się narażać wszystkim tym , którzy przenosiliby demokrację na możliwie wszystkie kraje świata ...
Uważam w każdym razie , że UE a w tym Polska , powinna zabiegać o większe prawa obywateli , o zwiększenie swobód obywatelskich .
Powinno się tego jednak dokonywać wyłącznie na drodze dyplomatycznej , bez sankcji gospodarczych , które na dobre mogłyby zwrócić to państwo w stronę Rosji .
WN Czyli nie zgadzasz się z krokami takimi , jak zakaz wjazdu niektórych białoruskich oficjeli na teren Unii ?
Czy to właśnie jest droga dyplomatyczna ?
M.Ch .
To prawda , że takie kroki zostały podjęte .
Łukaszenka uważany jest na Zachodzie za dusiciela swobód obywatelskich .
Człowiek ten przywrócił na Białorusi symbole sowieckie , rozwiązał parlament , zamknął niezależne media , a dławionej opozycji zarzuca działanie na smyczy Zachodu .
Mimo tego , ja nie zgadzam się na tę izolację na arenie międzynarodowej .
Uważam , ze świat powinien wypracować sposób komunikacji z Białorusią - właśnie poprzez organizacje takie jak OBWE i stopniowo zmiękczać reżim .
Dobrą drogą do tego celu jest organizowanie wymian studentów , wymian naukowych , współpraca handlowa małych i średnich przedsiębiorstw ...
Szczególnie w przypadku Polski , ważne są zwykłe stosunki sąsiedzkie , nawet wzajemne wizyty turystyczne .
WN Czy Białoruś i Unia w ogóle wykazują dobrą wolę w kontaktach ?
M.Ch .
Wydaje się , że Polska angażuje się nieco zbyt mocno , a sama Unia trochę za słabo ...
Ale dobrą wolę Unia wykazuje na pewno .
Unia zainteresowana jest istnieniem stabilnej , bogatej Białorusi respektującej prawa człowieka , z niepokojem patrzy na odwracanie się trendu demokratyzacji w tym kraju .
WN Z pozycji osoby , która w obu przypadkach była wewnątrz , pokusiłbyś się o porównanie wyborów ukraińskich i białoruskich ?
M.Ch .
Przede wszystkim rzuca się w oczy ( samo ) świadomość obywatelska .
Na Ukrainie był ponadto wyraźny podział na dwa obozy .
Tutaj , pomimo z pewnością zawy żonych wyników , Łukaszenka ma mocną pozycję i na pewno by wygrał bez " machlojek " .
Ale to mu nie wystarczyło , chciał udowodnić sobie i światu ...
Demonstracja zwolenników Aleksandra Milinkiewicza
WN Prasa zachodnia jakby o tym zapominała , i pytała , czy Białoruś stać na pomarańczową rewolucję .
M.Ch .
Odniosłem wrażenie , by ć może subiektywne , ze większoś ć Białorusinów wcale tego nie potrzebuje !
Jest im dobrze jak jest , nie mają skali porównawczej , a państwo gwarantuje im pracę i jako - taką , lecz stabilną płacę .
WN Ale były przecież demonstracje poparcia dla opozycji ...
M.Ch .
No tak , ale już po wynikach ... było kilka tysięcy demonstrujących ...
To były demonstracje zwolenników opozycjonistów , Milinkiewicza , którego zresztą mam autograf !
WN Skąd autograf ?
M.Ch .
- Można prosić autograf dla polskiego obserwatora ?
- Dla polskiego zawsze !

Mińsk robi europejskie wrażenie
WN Na zako ńczenie cofnijmy się trochę , do momentu wjazdu do kraju .
Jakie wrażenie robi Białoruś ?
Czy pod względem czystości , zaopatrzenia sklepów przypomina Polskę dzisiejszą , czy raczej tę sprzed 20 lat ?
M.Ch .
Bez dwóch zdań , Mińsk robi europejskie wrażenie - jest czysto , porządnie , widać zdyscyplinowanie obywateli i nie sądze , by to była tylko siła reżimu .
Inne miasta , wiadomo , w porównaniu do stolicy wypadają nieco bladziej .
Biednie , ale czysto ?
WN " Zdyscyplinowanie obywateli " , " siła reżimu " - kojarzy się trochę totalitarnie ...
M.Ch .
No , nie uważam przecież , że to policja zmusza ludzi do czystości i porządku ...
Ulice miast naprawdę robią dobre wrażenie , w porównaniu np . z Polską dzisiaj .
WN To znaczy : korzystniej , niż Polska ?
M.Ch .
W sensie kultury osobistej Polska wypada zdecydowanie gorzej .
WN Masz na myśli zachowania takie , jak rzucanie papierków na ulicę ?
M.Ch .
Owszem , a także graffitti , zataczający się pijacy , brud środków komunikacji oraz domów - takich zjawisk na Białorusi nie odnotowałem .
WN A język ?
Mówi się po białorusku , czy po rosyjsku ?
Można porozumieć się po polsku ?
M.Ch .
Panuje wszędzie rosyjski jako język urzędowy .
Milinkiewicz miał w planach zrównać w prawach białoruski z rosyjskim ...
A po polsku mogą rozumieć raczej na zachodzie kraju - tam , skąd jeżdżą do Polski na zakupy lub mają bliskich .
WN Powiedz na zakończenie o śladach polskości na Białorusi .
M.Ch .
Serce się kroi - tyle powiem .
Zwiedziłem doprowadzony do fatalnego stanu , choć z wolna odbudowywany zamek Radziwiłłów w Nieświeżu , a także kilka innych polskich zabytków .
Na każdym miłującym historię człowieku zrobiłaby wrażenie krypta pod kościołem Bożego Ciała w Nieświeżu z kilkusetletnimi , drewnianymi trumnami członków tego znamienitego rodu .
Z punktu widzenia Polaka wzruszające było poruszanie się po do niedawna polskiej ziemi , kraju , gdzie w wyniku nieszczęśliwych rozstrzygnięć historycznych żyje obecnie prawie czterysta tysięcy Polaków .

Everybody from the press to your aunt ( who just made some serious bank on her antique teacups ) seems to have a place in their hearts for eBay .
But for those in the following five industries , eBay has caused a bit of stress for those who have failed to adapt to its influence .
1 ) Computer / Server Hardware
It was 4:00 PM on a Thursday afternoon and it had been a long week .
One of my best clients called in regarding a Cisco Switch I had quoted him earlier that month …
“ I really want to pick this up from you , but my manager searched this on eBay and found it for 10 % cheaper .
Can you come down a little ? ”
Luckily , we sell used Cisco and typically have comparable pricing to eBay .
If we were a manufacturer or a new reseller , our price probably would have been off by 50 % or more !
Manufacturers , resellers and remarketers have all faced price pressure from our clients who compare us to eBay .
The fact is , you ’ll ( almost ) always receive enhanced assurance and added value by working with a reseller and forming a long - standing partnership .
Nonetheless , it has become imperative that IT Hardware resellers take extra measures to add services , resources and trust .
Back to the example above .
My client forwarded me the auction listing for the used Cisco switch .
It turned out that it did n’t include power cords and slot - covers and it was offered “ as - is ” without any warranty …
We got the order Friday morning .
2 ) Jewelry Industry
Sell an old diamond ring to a storefront jeweler , and you ’re bound to get much less than you could reap in an online auction .
On the flipside , the jeweler is losing a sale to the person who purchased the used gem .
While there are concerns about authenticity and the fact that many like to see a diamond or other jewel in person before purchasing , eBay often still wins out .
Take the following snippet by an online jeweler directly from an eBay review page :
" There was a time when consumers went to what they thought was the ‘ source ’ ( the New York Diamond District ) for their diamond purchases , however , over the years , those who want to keep up with the competition ( in New York ) have actually opened eBay stores and conduct auction events in order to move their merchandise quickly ( especially during non holiday seasons ) . ”
Many jewelers have adapted by creating their own eBay stores and others instead decided to focus on the high - end of the market and market their expertise and prestige .
3 ) Flea Markets
The Flea Market circuit has had to feel the pain of the online marketplace .
How would you feel about sitting in the rain , trying to sell vintage road signs and painted hubcaps when you know you could just list them online instead ?
I think the flea market is enough of an event to retain most faithful shoppers , but many of those visitors check eBay pricing from home before they head out .
Thus , not even the flea market tables can escape the price pressures of eBay .
4 ) Coin Dealers
Before 1995 , there were millions of coin collectors , but only a handful of true coin dealers throughout the world .
When eBay came around , the industry was turned on its head .
Individuals are buying coins at online auctions with little education in the process .
Some coins might be listed at ridiculous prices online , making them terrible investments .
Collectors have reported that lower - priced coins tend to sell for more than they ’re worth , while higher price coins lose their value as the miseducated masses become coin “ dealers . ”
Those coin dealers who have become relentless online marketers have built quite a strong tool to market their products outside of their local shops and road shows .
eBay is a huge marketplace for them to draw in buyers to their inventories .
5 ) Professional eBay Sellers
Ironically , many of those who initially gained so much selling at eBay auctions were unable to adapt to increased competition , changing markets and increased listing fees – and ended up having to go back to their traditional jobs .
In a Salon.com essay , Doomed by eBay , Claudia O’Keefe recounts her success , then eventual failure as an eBay seller .
“ It was a beautiful dream , but a stupendously arrogant one on my part .
I fell under the giddy , deep drink of individual Internet commerce , and it has to stop . ”
In the end , even the everyday auction sellers have felt the eBay effect .
— — —-
Truth be told , the open marketplace is terrific for the consumer .
But most of these markets have felt great pains because they end up essentially being the middleman .
However , the leaders in these industries have either learned to adapt to the new marketplace , or have built up added value and assurance to their products .
Later this week , we ’ll discuss what Vibrant is doing to add value for our clients and become a leading reseller of servers , storage and networking in the eBay era .
( Article 1 of 5 in our eBay article series )
Peter Hunt puts the focus on successful web applications in How Python wins on the Web .
He cites the success of Plone , MoinMoin , Trac , Mailman PyBloxsom and the non-web - based BitTorrent .
He cedes the web application framework “ market ” to Rails and suggests that Python will “ win ” by having the best apps out there .
I think he ’s half correct .
Ultimately , it ’s the apps that people use and having the best apps will increase Python ’s user base .
But , the frameworks do matter , too .
The types of apps that Peter is talking about are “ canned ” apps .
Install them , tweak some settings and go .
But , there are many apps out there that need to be custom written for the task .
By saying that “ We wo n’t win in the Rails generation ” , Peter says that we might as well give up on frameworks because the custom apps are going to be written in Rails .
I think he ’s wrong .
Java , PHP and ASP dwarf Python and Ruby in usage .
People using those languages are starting to seriously look at doing things in a more agile way ( in the case of Java and C# ) or in a more structured way ( in the case of PHP ) .
Python , overall , has far greater usage than Ruby .
Despite Python ’s deeper penetration , people have been choosing to code their apps in Ruby because of Rails .
For custom apps , clearly , the framework matters .
Rails helps people get their work done faster .
Give people a similarly productive experience in Python , and you ’ll attract Python people and Java / PHP people who need to code the many custom apps that need to be written .
I have seen this to be the case on the TurboGears mailing list .
If I suddenly said , “ oh , Peter ’s right .
I ’ll just start coding custom apps in Rails and drop this whole TurboGears thing ” , then of course all custom development would go to Rails .
( Except for the fact that TurboGears has achieved enough mass that it would go on without me … )
But , I like programming in Python .
Lots of other people do , too .
And I want to have a productive time programming in Python .
So , there ’s value in a framework like TurboGears .
Back to the canned apps of the sort that Peter was talking about .
He ’s right that today Python has more successful canned apps out there than Ruby does .
But , Rails makes programming an application easier than doing everything ad - hoc .
If all of the Python apps continue to be ad - hoc , how will they keep up with folks that are getting things done more quickly with Rails ?
There are wikis , blogs and even a Trac - like system written in Rails .
If those developments move at a higher velocity than the Python ones , eventually they ’ll take over .
Once upon a time , I used Movable Type for my blog .
WordPress came along with a nicer interface ( and an easy migration ) and now I ’m running WordPress .
There ’s no reason to assume that the existing successful Python projects will remain so indefinitely .
( They certainly can , if they continue to be great at what they do ! )
Many people have written about how much they enjoy using TurboGears and how they get things done quickly .
Many of those people are writing custom apps , so clearly Rails is n’t getting everyone .
Additionally , canned apps written with TurboGears are starting to appear .
There are developments going on with CherryPy that will make it easy to wire up TurboGears apps easily and naturally and to use PasteDeploy if you want to run a non-TurboGears app next to it .
In summary , applications are ultimately what matter .
The whole point of a framework is to help people make their apps more quickly .
In that regard , frameworks do matter , too .

Pennsylvania Group Labeled “ Pacifists ” Targeted for Handing Out Flyers in Town Square
PITTSBURGH – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Pennsylvania today released new evidence that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting investigations into a political organization based solely on its anti-war views .
Two documents released today reveal that the FBI investigated gatherings of the Thomas Merton Center for Peace & Justice just because the organization opposed the war in Iraq .
Although previously disclosed documents show that the FBI is retaining files on anti-war groups , these documents are the first to show conclusively that the rationale for FBI targeting is the group 's opposition to the war .
“ It makes no sense that the FBI would be spying on peace activists handing out flyers , ” said Jim Kleissler , Executive Director of the Thomas Merton Center for Peace & Justice .
“ Our members were simply offering leaflets to passersby , legally and peacefully , and now they ’re being investigated by a counter–terrorism unit .
Something is seriously wrong in how our government determines who and what constitutes terrorism when peace activists find themselves targeted . ”
According to the documents released today , the FBI initiated a classified investigation into the activities of the Thomas Merton Center , noting in a November 2002 memo that the center “ holds daily leaflet distribution activities in downtown Pittsburgh and is currently focused on its opposition to the potential war on Iraq . ”
The synopsis of the document is provided to “ report results of investigation on Pittsburgh anti-war activities . ”
The FBI memo points out that the Merton Center “ is a left - wing organization advocating , among many political causes , pacifism . ”
“ All over the country we see the FBI monitoring and keeping files on Americans exercising their First Amendment rights to free expression , ” said Mary Catherine Roper , a staff attorney with the ACLU of Pennsylvania .
“ These documents show that Americans are not safe from secret government surveillance , even when they are handing out flyers in the town square – an activity clearly protected by the Constitution . ”
The documents come to the ACLU as a result of a national campaign to expose domestic spying by the FBI and other government agencies .
The ACLU has filed Freedom of Information Act requests in 20 states on behalf of more than 150 organizations and individuals .
In response to these requests , the government has released documents that reveal monitoring and infiltration by the FBI and local law enforcement , targeting political , environmental , anti-war and faith - based groups .
“ From the FBI to the Pentagon to the National Security Agency this administration has embarked on an unprecedented campaign to spy on innocent Americans , ” said Ann Beeson , Associate Legal Director of the national ACLU .
“ Investigating law - abiding groups and their members simply because of their political views is not only irresponsible , it has a chilling effect on the vibrant tradition of dissent in this country . ”

Tim Bray writes :
I just wanted to say how much I ’ve come to dislike this “ Web 2.0 ” faux - meme .
It ’s not only vacuous marketing hype , it ca n’t possibly be right .
In terms of qualitative changes of everyone ’s experience of the Web , the first happened when Google hit its stride and suddenly search was useful for , and used by , everyone every day .
The second — syndication and blogging turning the Web from a library into an event stream — is in the middle of happening .
So a lot of us are already on 3.0 .
Anyhow , I think Usenet might have been the real 1.0 .
But most times , the whole thing still feels like a shaky early beta to me .
While being completely right in the details ( we are quite arguably on 3.0 or even 8.0 if we ’re thinking about the internet compared to other software versioning ) , Tim is completely wrong about the big picture .
Memes are almost always “ marketing hype ” — bumper stickers is a better way to say it — but they tend to catch on only if they capture some bit of the zeitgeist .
The reason that the term “ Web 2.0 ” has been bandied about so much since Dale Dougherty came up with it a year and a half ago in a conference planning session ( leading to our Web 2.0 Conference ) is because it does capture the widespread sense that there ’s something qualitatively different about today ’s web .
Kevin Kelly wrote about this change at length in an article in the current issue of Wired : the key to success in this next stage of the web ’s evolution is leveraging collective intelligence .
And yes , Google ’s introduction of page rank was absolutely a milestone in this evolution of the web , but what was once an isolated stroke of genius is now being understood as one of the keys to the new paradigm .
There ’s a set of “ Web 2.0 design patterns ” — architecting systems so that they get smarter the more people use them , monetizing the long tail via a combination of customer - self service and algorithmic management , lightweight business models made possible by cooperating internet services and data syndication , data as the “ intel inside ” , and so on .
More immediately , Web 2.0 is the era when people have come to realize that it ’s not the software that enables the web that matters so much as the services that are delivered over the web .
Web 1.0 was the era when people could think that Netscape ( a software company ) was the contender for the computer industry crown ;
Web 2.0 is the era when people are recognizing that leadership in the computer industry has passed from traditional software companies to a new kind of internet service company .
The net has replaced the PC as the platform that matters , just as the PC replaced the mainframe and minicomputer .
You have to remember that every revolution occurs in stages , and often is n’t recognized till long after the new world is in place .
The PC revolution began in the early 80s , and most of the key PC companies and technology innovations were founded in that decade , but it was n’t till the mid-90s that the new shape of the computer industry was clear to everyone .
The Microsoft - Netscape equivalent of the 80’s was the debate about whether ATT ’s entry into the computer industry would dethrone IBM .
The crucial choices had already been made , though , that set the course for the Wintel - dominated industry of the 90s .
Similarly , the writing was on the wall when Yahoo ! , EBay , Amazon , Google and other web giants were started in the mid-90s .
We ’re now at a stage equivalent to the period in the PC market when people were debating whether OS2 or Windows was the operating system of the future .
Perhaps I ’m biased , because O’Reilly was the source and has been one of the biggest promoters of the Web 2.0 meme , but I think it captures exactly where we are at this moment : a widespread awakening to the fact that the game has changed .
There might be a better name ( I tried “ internet operating system ” on for size starting back in 2000 ) , but the fact that Web 2.0 has caught on says that it ’s as good a term as any .
While the patterns that constitute Web 2.0 are far from completely understood , there ’s a kind of intuitive recognition of sites that are expressing the new model .
( For example , at Esther Dyson ’s PC Forum last March , after presentations by two startups showing shared calendaring services , I overheard one attendee say to another , “ xxx is so Web 1.0 , and yyy is so Web 2.0 ” and the other attendee knew exactly what he meant .
A meme is a pointer , and as long as it points in the right direction , so that the listener recognizes what is being pointed at , it works . )
I guess it ’s the old debate between language purists , and language pragmatists .
The right words are the ones people actually use , and this word is catching on .
Step 1 Fold an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper down the middle of the 11 " dimension .
Do n't panic .
Just look at the pictures .
On the left I 'll show you what you 're starting with , and I 'll mark ( in blue ) where you 're going to fold .
On the right you 'll see what you should end up with after each step .
Step 2
Next fold the two upper corners in at a 45 - degree angle .
Be careful here to line these up , and do not let the flaps cross the middle of the paper .
Use the middle fold as a guide .
Step 3
Fold each side , again using the middle as a guide .
The two sides must be very even .
These folds are the most critical for proper flight .
Do n't crease these too hard , that creates a sharp edge and reduces the lift .
( The plane will nose dive )
If you leave these folds too rounded , the plane will tend to rise into a stall .
When you get into flight testing , you can adjust the plane my messing with the sharpness of these folds .
Step 4
Fold the tip over , lining the pointy tip up with where the other folds meet in the middle .
This provides both the proper center of gravity , and it makes the nose blunt so you wo n't poke your eye out .
Step 5
Fold the plane down the middle and press it flat .
Step 6
Next we 're going to fold a winglet .
The fold should be parallel to the edge of the paper , and about 3 / 4 of an inch ( 19 MM ) from the ends of the wings .
The little squiggles under the drawing show you how it would look if you held it up and looked at it from the back of the plane .
Step 7
Flip the plane over and fold the other winglet , using the first as a guide .
Get them both very even with each other .
Step 8
Next we 're going to make the fuselage or " body " of the plane .
I usually fold the wing over to split the blunt end evenly , so that half ends up on the body , and half on the wing .
Again the fold should be parallel to the paper .
Step 9
Flip it over and fold the other wing to create the completed fuselage .
I usually run my thumbnail along all of the fuselage folds here to really crease the edges .
Remember , DO NOT crease the leading edges of the wings too much , see step 3 for instructions .
Step 10 Almost done .
Unfold the wings and winglets and work them until you get the shape you see on the right .
There should be a very pronounced " V " shape in the wings , and the winglets should be at about a 90 - degree angle to the wings .
Now give it a gentle toss .
Have fun .
This Paper Airplane is the result of years of childhood research , design and testing .
Its unique design is resistant to stalling , and it flies very nicely with just a gentle toss .
It can also take a strong arm toss , and with all the layers of paper that make up the nose , I 've had good luck cutting a small notch in the belly near the nose to take a rubber band .
( I like tying 3 or 4 bands together and locking them in the notch of a dowel to make a launching " slingshot " rod .
As a kid I used to launch them that way over the trees in our yard .
( But that was long before video games as we know them today )
Ever wondered why is he always using the same theory every time he steps up to the podium ?
You are not alone .

Gravity bends light , but can it also magnify itself ?
Einstein made his fame with the idea that gravity bends light , a notion proven by observations of the planet Mercury in 1919 .
Once a crazy idea , it has shaped how scientists think about gravity ever since .
Even now , astrophysicists aim telescopes at the violent regions around distant black holes , hoping the intense pull of those collapsed stars will fully reveal gravity 's secrets .
But up close in our solar system , a certifiably " crazy idea , " according to National Science Foundation cosmologist Michael Turner , may offer a test of Einstein 's theory of gravity .
Albert Einstein 's theory of General Relativity may get tested by one cosmologist 's " crazy idea . "
AP
The idea comes courtesy of astronomer Robert Nemiroff of Michigan Technological University , who proposed it at last week 's American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington , D.C.
We know gravity bends light , but he proposes that " gravity might magnify itself , " as well .
If true , he suggests that regions of magnified gravity may exist in our solar system near the orbit of the planet Neptune .
These " gravitational hollows " — or spikes of magnified gravitational pull — would exist at the point where the sun 's gravity focuses the gravity from a distant star or black hole , much like a magnifying glass focuses light at a certain point .
He compares how gravity looks around a star to the looks of a sea urchin , with hollows radiating away from the sun like sea urchin spines .

For a look at an abstract on the topic of gravity lensing , follow this link from the American Astronomical Society meeting .
How do you test this idea ?
Fly a spacecraft though a region of magnified gravity and see if it slows down .
The largest hollow would come from the giant star Sirius , whose gravity , if magnified , would create a hollow almost 40 miles wide .
An atomic clock like the ones made now by the National Institute of Standards & Technology would be sensitive enough to pick up the difference in travel time , Nemiroff says .
Much smaller hollows would be created by the pull of Polaris , the North Star , and the massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy .
Nemiroff says he has polled experts on Einstein 's theory of gravity , better known as General Relativity , and they are n't certain whether gravity could bend gravity like it bends light .
Turner is dubious , but adds " We know Einstein did n't have the last word on gravity .
We 're all looking for an idea crazy enough to be correct and this definitely is a crazy idea . "
Also cautious is astrophysicist Michael Martin Nieto of Los Alamos National Laboratory who says , " It is fun to think about , but for now Nemiroff 's comments are intuitive , " and not formally defined enough for other physicists to critique .
Still , Nemiroff says either way his idea merits investigation .
If true , it would shake up our understanding of General Relativity and if false , it might tell us something about how gravity will perform around those distant black holes that cosmologists plan to investigate in coming decades .
FOR many Americans , it 's a mad , mad , mad , mad world out there , and getting worse .
During the Salman Rushdie affair 17 years ago , angry Muslims were content merely to call for the death of the allegedly blasphemous author and his publishers .
This week , they were calling for the death not only of some allegedly blasphemous cartoonists but also their compatriots .
And people from neighbouring countries .
And Jews .
And , inevitably , Americans .
What 's the point , some Americans grumble , of engaging with such people ?
We gave the Iraqis freedom , runs the argument , and they repaid us with roadside bombs .
Palestinians got the vote and used it to elect terrorists .
And dealing with the rest of the world is scarcely more rewarding : old Europe sneers at us , the Chinese steal our jobs and Mexicans are quietly re-conquering the south - western United States .
Would n't it be simpler to build a fence around our vast , rich , sane nation and let the rest of the world go hang ?
It is a sign of the appeal of such sentiments that George Bush devoted much of his state - of - the - union speech to them .
“ The road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting — yet it ends in danger and decline ... America rejects the false comfort of isolationism ... Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies , it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need ... American leaders — from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan — rejected isolation and retreat , because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march . ”
Mr Bush oversimplified , using one word — isolationist — for several disparate opponents .
But he is right to worry .
Partly in reaction to the president 's hyperactive foreign entanglements , various forms of isolationist sentiment are indeed on the rise .
A Pew poll in October found 42 % of Americans agreeing that the United States “ should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own . ”
That figure had jumped by 12 points in three years to its highest level since the mid-1970s ( after the humiliation of Vietnam ) .
Although Mr Bush was hardly fair when he described all advocates of a less muscular foreign policy as “ isolationist ” , he has correctly identified one of the strongest currents against which he must swim .
Many Americans wish to disengage from the world in one or more of four ways : by fighting fewer wars , by trading less freely , by allowing fewer foreigners into their country or by giving less foreign aid .
The purest isolationists , ironically , are to be found in the president 's own party .
Since Mr Bush came to office promising a “ humble ” foreign policy , they feel betrayed that he has practised the opposite .
“ Why would a president use his state of the union to lash out at a school of foreign policy thought that has had zero influence in his administration ? ” fumes Pat Buchanan , a former presidential aspirant and voice of the GOP 's nativist wing .
The answer : “ His foreign policy is visibly failing , and his critics have been proven right . ”
Iraq never attacked America , argues Mr Buchanan , so America did not have to attack it .
As for the idea that America 's security depends on ending foreign tyranny , that is “ noble - sounding nonsense ” , writes Mr Buchanan .
“ Our security rests on US power and will , and not on whether Zimbabwe , Sudan , Syria , Cuba or even China is ruled by tyrants .
Our forefathers lived secure in a world of tyrannies by staying out of wars that were none of America 's business . ”
Mr Buchanan thinks foreign aid is “ the looting of America for the construction of the New World Order ” .
He is proudly protectionist and he fears that Hispanic immigration threatens not only America 's survival as one nation but also Republican dominance of American politics , since Latinos usually vote Democrat .
Mr Buchanan has been singing this song for some time : it was part of his pitchfork rebellion against Mr Bush 's father in the Republican primaries in 1992 .
But in damning the Iraq war and the use of force to spread democracy , Mr Buchanan is part of a much broader ( and potentially more potent ) movement .
On the right , there are two main groups : small - government conservatives and foreign - policy realists .
The former point to the huge cost to the taxpayer of the Iraq war and the Pentagon ( see article ) .
The latter , typified by Brent Scowcroft , the first President Bush 's national - security adviser , think that the old policy of propping up Arab strongmen brought “ 50 years of peace ” to the Middle East .
For different reasons , almost everyone on the left opposes the war .
The people who have enough spare time to go on marches and listen to Cindy Sheehan tend to think “ BusHitler ” invaded Iraq to enrich Halliburton .
A larger , quieter group thinks the administration launched an avoidable war and botched it .
Overall , the proportion of Americans who think the Iraq war worth fighting has fallen from 70 % in April 2003 to about 45 % now .
They take our jobs
Opposition to Mr Bush 's trade policies comes mostly from the Democrats .
The Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) squeaked through the House last year by 217 votes to 215 .
Only 15 Democrats backed it — and unions promptly vowed to punish the “ CAFTA 15 ” .
Democratic presidents are usually more supportive of free trade than their party , perhaps because a president represents the whole nation , not just a district with a steel mill that might close because of imports .
Hillary Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner for 2008 , is a free trader .
But it is not impossible that the party 's increasingly angry base could nominate a protectionist in 2008 .
The party 's vice - presidential candidate in 2004 , Senator John Edwards , voted against cheap textile imports and then made stump speeches about a 10 - year - old American girl who , he said , could n't afford a winter coat .
According to Gallup , the proportion of Americans who see foreign trade more as an opportunity for growth than as a threat to the domestic economy fell from 56 % in 2000 to 45 % last year .
While many Democrats want to curb the inflow of foreign goods , many Republicans want to curb that of foreigners .
Mr Bush says the American economy “ could not function without ” immigrants .
Tom Tancredo , a Republican congressman from Colorado , disagrees .
He argues that the costs of immigration outweigh the benefits : immigrants ' children must be schooled at taxpayers ' expense , and their willingness to work for a pittance drags down the wages of unskilled Americans .
He thinks that America 's borders could be secured “ relatively easily ” and at “ minimal cost ” by building hundreds of miles of fences and deploying troops to patrol them ( which would be good training , he says ) , and by punishing firms that employ illegals .
He thinks the House would back 50 - 60 % of his agenda — a tough anti-immigration bill passed late last year and is now in the Senate — and he hopes to make immigration an issue in the November mid-term elections .
It will be .
Many non-Hispanic Americans see illegal immigration as not merely an economic threat , but also a cultural one .
In a recent poll , only 8 % of respondents thought the problem “ not very serious ” , while 63 % thought it “ very ” or “ extremely ” serious .
The final “ isolationist ” issue , foreign aid , is not yet electorally significant , though polls show Americans tend to think their country is too generous .
One reason to ignore the growth in isolationism in the short term is Mr Bush .
He has made it clear he has no plans to change course .
Iraq will be his legacy , so he has to see it through as best he can .
He has compromised on free trade before , and may do so again , but few doubt where his preferences lie .
On immigration , he seems sincerely liberal and convinced that Republicans can woo the swelling Hispanic vote .
And on foreign aid , who'll notice a few odd billions in a budget of $ 2.77 trillion ?
Optimists point out that America has always had a vocal isolationist minority .
And surely globalisation — more travel , ever deeper economic integration , common threats ( such as global warming and terrorism ) — mean that America can not go it alone .
Francis Fukuyama , a famously optimistic professor at Johns Hopkins University , even thinks the Muhammad cartoon row could pull America and Europe closer together , as Europeans realise they have more in common even with Texans than with Islamists .
So the most likely outcome is surely that the current isolationist surge will fade away .
But consider two things .
First , greater integration and the war on terror have hardly brought the two sides of the Atlantic together .
Meanwhile , despite his proud words in the state of the union , isolationism , broadly defined , has already tempered Mr Bush 's policy .
The public 's exhaustion with Iraq makes it harder for the president to tackle Iran .
He will also have to retreat on immigration if he is going to get something through .
A lot depends on leadership .
For the moment none of the leading candidates for the presidency in 2008 is an isolationist and the favourite in some polls , John McCain , is even more of an interventionist than Mr Bush .
But with so many voters angry about the mad world beyond their borders , America might yet end up with both a more protectionist Congress and a president who is more reluctant to throw America 's weight around .

Producer , Munich Operation Bayonet
On the eve of the release of Steven Spielberg 's film Munich , the BBC gains exclusive access to the undercover Mossad agents assigned to track down the Palestinian group responsible for the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics .
On 5 September 1972 , in the middle of the Olympic Games in Munich , Germany , a group of Palestinians associated with the Black September organisation entered the Olympic village and took 11 Israeli athletes hostage .
They demanded the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons .
One Israeli was killed early in the morning , a second one was murdered during the negotiations , and in the evening it was agreed that the Palestinians and their hostages would travel to a nearby military airport where they would board helicopters and leave Germany .
The German police initiated a rescue operation which ended bitterly : nine Israeli athletes died .
Three of the hostage - takers escaped but were captured later hiding in another part of the airport .
Within days of the massacre , Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir secretly ordered Mossad to hunt down and assassinate all those responsible for planning and carrying out the Munich killings .
Meir headed the " X Committee " , responsible for approving dozens of operations targeting suspects across Europe and the Middle East .
Paris blast
The campaign was conducted by a specially trained hit - team , comprising of fewer than 20 men and code - named Bayonet .
T had to monitor Hamshari 's daily routine and gather information
Within six weeks of the Munich attacks , the Israeli agents were dispatched to Rome for their first assignment in which a suspected operative was killed .
The mission in Rome completed , the agents moved on to France where one Mossad operative - known as " T " to hide his identity - was to play a major role .
Members from other Mossad units , assisted by T , broke into the apartment of Mohammed al - Hamshari , a high - profile Palestine Liberation Organisation activist living in the middle of Paris .
Once inside Hamshari's home , they planted a small explosive underneath the telephone table .
All they had to do then was to make sure that Hamshari himself answered the phone so they could detonate the bomb .
" We verified that he was entering his flat alone , " says T , " and once he entered the flat , we disappeared . "
Hamshari died in the blast .
' Idealists '
An elderly Israeli man , known only as " N " , was the commander of Bayonet .
" The men were all idealists , " he says .
" In 99 % of the cases the work was done perfectly .
We did some great operations . "
We decided that some of us would dress like women
Ehud Barak
Former Israeli Prime Minister
In most cases , the operations were conducted solely by Mossad agents .
For others , military commando units took part .
The most famous of these was the Spring of Youth operation in Beirut in April 1973 where the team , led by Mossad , targeted three leaders of Black September at once .
T met the commandos on the beach .
He said : " I arrived at the seashore and got a visual sign confirming the arrival of the troops .
I drove my car and they followed me in other cars . "
The military commander of the operation was Ehud Barak , who later became the prime minister of Israel .
" We knew that they would suspect a group of youngsters , " he says , " so we decided that some of us would dress like women . "
Heavily armed under their women 's clothes , the commandos carried out their mission and killed their targets .
The wrong man
Three months later , in the Lillehammer ski resort in southern Norway , Mossad was ready to make another hit .
The target was Ali Hassan Salameh , one of the most popular Palestinian leaders of Black September and considered to be the mastermind of the Munich massacre .
On 21 July 1973 , 15 Mossad agents arrived in the small town and lay in wait for Salameh .
But they got the wrong man .
They assassinated Ahmed Bouchiki , an innocent Moroccan waiter who had returned to the apartment with his pregnant wife .
He died of bullet wounds from several close range shots .
As the Mossad agents tried to leave the country , six of them were arrested and sentenced to prison terms in Norway .
Final operation
But the Lillehammer fiasco did not stop the Bayonet operations , and in 1979 operatives finally got a chance to kill the man who had escaped them in Lillehammer .
In a long and complicated operation , Mossad recruited Erika Chambers , a British citizen .
She joined welfare organisations supporting Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and was invited to Beirut .
It was there that she engineered a meeting with Salameh .
She soon learned his daily routine , including the route he drove from his house to work .
Mossad rented an apartment overlooking this route and the plan to assassinate him was laid .
Mossad operative T remembers : " We were given explosives and someone had to mount them in her car .
I did it . "
Erika 's car was parked on the side of the road beneath the apartment .
She had been trained to press a remote control and activate the explosion when she saw Salameh 's convoy driving past her car .
The blast killed Salameh and eight other people .
This was the last Bayonet operation .
Between 1972 and 1979 more than a dozen Palestinians were assassinated , ensuring the total eradication of Black September .
Munich : Operation Bayonet was broadcast on Tuesday , 24 January , 2006 , at 2320 GMT on BBC Two .
Predilections
By Mark Singer
The New Yorker - February 6 , 1989
Among the nonfiction movies that Errol Morris has at one time or another been eager to make but has temporarily abandoned for lack of investor enthusiasm are " Ablaze ! " ( or " Fire from Heaven " ) , an examination of the phenomenon of spontaneous human combustion ; " Whatever Happened to Einstein 's Brain ? " ( portions of the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex are thought to be in the possession of a doctor in North Carolina , other parts are floating around here and there ) ; " Road , " the story of one man 's attempt to build across northern Minnesota an interstate highway that no one else wanted ; " Insanity Inside Out , " based on the book of the same tide , by Kenneth Donaldson , a man who , in his forties , was wrongly committed by his parents to a mental hospital and got stuck there for fifteen years ; " Weirdo , " about the breeding of a giant chicken ; " The Wizard of Wendover , " about Robert K. Golka and his laser - induced fireball experiments in Utah ; and a perusal of Yap , a South Pacific island where stone money is the traditional currency .
Some months ago , Morris attended a meeting with executives of Home Box Office , his primary motive being , as they say in the movie business , to pitch an idea - in that case , the one involving Einstein 's brain .
The meeting did not go particularly well .
An HBO person at one point said admonishingly , " You know , your movies are ironic .
Our viewers just do n't like irony . "
Groping for a more tactful evasion , another HBO person said , " We 're already doing a transplant movie . "
" But wait a second , Morris replied .
" This brain has n't been transplanted - yet . "
Unapologetically , Morris draws his films fresh from the substance of the real world , where irony has a way of running riot .
Describing his work , he goes to some lengths to avoid using the term " documentary " ( " the ' D ' word , " he will say , in a pinch ) , but he has not yet coined an alternative label that a Hollywood publicist might use to characterize a generic Errol Morris movie .
During the past twelve years , he has directed and released three films : " Gates of Heaven , " about two pet cemeteries in Northern California ; " Vernon , Florida , " a series of interviews with several residents of a swamp town in Florida ; and " The Thin Blue Line , " which arrived in theatres around the country last summer and fall , and which Morris has described , not immodestly , as " the first murder mystery that actually solves a murder . "
An Errol Morris movie features real people talking uninterrupted , mainly about literal objects or events , only occasionally about feelings or ideas : trafficking in entertaining truths as well as in equally entertaining transparent prevarications ; free - associating , it often seems , as if the camera were a psychotherapist whose expensive time it would be a pity to squander on silence .
Near the midpoint of " Gates of Heaven , " which was completed in 1978 , a woman with a pinched mouth whose age might be anywhere from seventy to eighty - five sits in a chair before an open doorway .
She is never identified , but , it happens , her name is Florence Rasmussen .
In a manner that alternates between passive and bold , accented by facial expressions that range from beatific to sinister , Florence Rasmussen soliloquizes elegiacally :
" I 'm raised on a farm , we had chickens and pigs and cows and sheep and everything .
But down here I 've been lost .
Now they 've taken them all away from here up to that - What 's the name of that place ?
Up above here a little ways ?
That town ?
Commences with a ' B. '
Blue .
It 's - Blue Hill Cemetery , I think the name of it is .
Not too far , I guess , about maybe twenty miles from here .
A little town there , a little place .
You know where it 's at .
But I was really surprised when I heard they were getting rid of the cemetery over here .
Gonna put in buildings or something over there .
Ah well , I know people been very good to me , you know .
Well , they see my condition , I guess , must of felt sorry for me .
But it 's real , my condition is .
It 's not put on .
That 's for sure !
Boy , if I could only walk .
If I could only get out .
Drive my car .
I 'd get another car .
Ya ... and my son , if he was only better to me .
After I bought him that car .
He 's got a nice car .
I bought it myself just a short time ago .
I do n't know .
These kids - the more you do for them ...
He ' s my grandson , but I raised him from two years old ...
I do n't see him very often .
And he just got the car .
I did n't pay for all of it .
I gave him four hundred dollars .
Pretty good !
His boss knows it .
Well , he 's not working for that outfit now .
He 's changed .
He 's gone back on his old job - hauling sand .
No , not hauling sand ; he 's working in the office .
That 's right .
He took over the office job .
His boss told me that on the phone .
But , you know , he should help me more .
He 's all I got .
He 's the one who brought me up here .
And then put me here by myself among strangers .
It 's terrible , you stop and think of it .
I 've been without so much , when I first come up here .
Ya .
It 's what half of my trouble is from - him not being home with me .
Did n't cost him nothing to stay here .
Every time he need money , he 'd always come , ' Mom , can I have this ?
Can I have that ?'
But he never pays back .
Too good , too easy - that 's what everybody tells me .
I quit now .
I quit .
Now he 's got the office job , I 'm going after him .
I 'm going after him good , too - if I have to go in ... in a different way .
He 's going to pay that money .
He 's got the office job now .
And he makes good money anyway .
And he has no kids .
He has not married .
Never get married , he says .
He was married once - they 're divorced .
Well , she tried to take him for the kid , but she did n't .
They went to court .
It was somebody else 's kid .
She was nothing but a tramp in the first place .
I told him that .
He would n't listen to me .
I says , ' I know what she is . '
I said , ' Richard , please , listen to me . '
He would n't listen .
He knew all , he knew everything .
Big shot !
But he soon found out .
Now that 's all over with .
I 've been through so much I do n't know how I 'm staying alive .
Really , for my age ... if you 're young , it 's different .
But I 've always said I 'm never going to grow old .
I 've always had that , and the people that I tell how old I am , they do n't believe me , because people my age as a rule do n't get around like I do . "
With an arresting instinct for symmetry , Florence Rasmussen manages to contradict most of what she has to say .
It seems that she knows certain things , but then , in the next moment , she trots out contrary information : I have roots with the earth ; I 'm lost in this world .
People have been very good to me ; I 'm all alone , surrounded by strangers , my own flesh and blood treats me badly .
I have a health problem that 's real ; I protest too much .
I 'd like to drive my car ; but I might not even have a car any longer , might have to buy a new one .
I bought my son - O.K. , he 's not my son , he 's my grandson - a new car ; well , I did n't pay for the whole thing , I gave him four hundred dollars , but anyway I want my money back .
His boss - Hold on , he has a different boss .
He hauls sand for a living ; nope , he 's got that office job now .
He 's not the marrying kind ; he was married once .
He has no children ; he 's been involved in a paternity suit .
I 'll never grow old ; I 'm so old people can't believe it .
Even though I can't walk , people my age as a rule do n't get around like I do .
" Gates of Heaven " gives an account of a pet cemetery that fails and one that succeeds ; Mrs. Rasmussen refers to each in only a glancing manner .
The first day that Morris set out as a bona - fide film director with an actual film crew was the day the residents of the failed pet cemetery were being exhumed , so that they could be transferred to the other cemetery .
The cinematographer Morris had engaged to shoot " Gates of Heaven " he fired that same day - a consequence of serious philosophical differences that culminated in a physical struggle for the camera .
( " It 's mine ! " " No , it 's mine ! " )
Day Two , Morris met Florence Rasmussen , and she became the first person with whom he ever filmed an interview .
The footage from that interview did n't make it into the final cut , however , because the replacement camera operator , a woman , felt compelled to engage the interviewee in a dialogue .
When Mrs. Rasmussen mused " Well , here today , gone tomorrow .
Right ? " the camerawoman said " No. Wrong . "
Morris could n't decide which made him angrier - that the camerawoman had interfered with the interview or that her notions about death and the hereafter were so misguided .
In any event , he fired her on the spot and hired a replacement , who lasted three or four days .
One of Morris 's techniques is to situate his interview subject in a chair ( when possible , a specific chair : a lightweight canvas - and - metal - frame low - back Regista ) that is a precise distance ( forty - nine inches ) from the camera , which is equipped with a 25 - mm .
Zeiss high - speed prime lens - a lens of fixed focal length , which is one that cannot zoom - and is secured to a tripod , so that the camera cannot pan .
When Morris went back to reshoot Mrs. Rasmussen - accompanied by Ned Burgess , his fourth , and final , cinematographer - she rewarded him with what has become the emblem of the Morris style : a seamless monologue from someone who has been allowed to talk until the truth naturally sorts itself out .
Quotidian lies , the little fabrications that make the commerce of daily life possible , if not always palatable , are laid on the surface by the speaker .
A muted strain of implicit skepticism - the silent voice of the filmmaker - bubbles along just beneath that .
Peripheral stuff turns out to matter .
" I like the idea of making films about ostensibly absolutely nothing , " Morris says .
" I like the irrelevant , the tangential , the sidebar excursion to nowhere that suddenly becomes revelatory .
That 's what all my movies are about .
That and the idea that we 're in possession of certainty , truth , infallible knowledge , when actually we 're just a bunch of apes running around .
My films are about people who think they 're connected to something , although they 're really not . "
" Gates of Heaven " is the only one of Morris 's films that can be said to have emerged with its original subject matter intact .
" The Thin Blue Line , " which at its inception was to have been a study of Dr. James Grigson , a Texas psychiatrist who regularly testifies for the prosecution in death - penalty cases , instead became a horrifyingly satiric examination of the wrongful murder conviction and near - execution of an innocent man .
" Vernon , Florida , " which is essentially plotless - a pastiche of interviews with a turkey hunter , a policeman , a retired couple who are convinced that a glass jar in their possession contains radioactive sand that grows , a wild - animal collector , a Holy Roller preacher , a worm farmer , and others - evolved haphazardly , almost desperately , from an unwieldy idea Morris had of making a fiction film based upon a bizarre insurance scam .
A loquacious man named Albert Bitterling , who appears intermittently throughout " Vernon , Florida , " has held a pair of opera glasses against the lens of a camera and photographed the night sky .
In one scene , displaying the opaque result , he says , " Of course , as you can see is that picture ain't too good , it 's a cheap camera , you get a cheap picture . "
Then , speaking literally and in metaphor , he encapsulates the filmmaker 's dilemma : " Well , of course , you see , when you have a camera ...
You have a camera and you point it at a certain - Just like if you had a gun .
You do n't shoot , do you ?
Well , if you had a gun and you pointed it at something , you 're liable to hit what you 're pointing at , and then again you might not . "
" Vernon , Florida " has been , as a practical matter , the least accessible of Morris 's films ; it was completed in 1981 , but a commercial videocassette version of it has just been released .
Videocassettes of " Gates of Heaven " became available only a few months ago .
" The Thin Blue Line " is the first of Morris 's films to be widely distributed in theatres .
A word that regularly comes up when Morris discusses the until quite recent low - orbit trajectory of his career is " disturbing . "
The frustration of making movies that only modest numbers of people have seen , or even heard of , has encouraged Morris to cultivate a melodramatic haplessness .
In a less ironically disposed person , this tendency might be taken for neurotic self - indulgence .
When Morris consents to be the interviewee - when it becomes his turn to sort the truth out - he ends up quoting Shakespeare ( " But since the affairs of men rest still uncertain , let 's reason with the worst that may befall " ) or himself ( " The fact that the world is , like , utterly insane makes it tolerable " ) .
Once , when I made the mistake of asking , in an offhand manner , how he'd been feeling lately , he said , " I 've been horribly depressed , which , as you know , can be terribly time - consuming .
I mean , if you 're going to do it right , that is . "
Another time , en route to a preview screening of " The Thin Blue Line , " he said , " I hope this wo n't be terribly embarrassing . "
A pause , then : " No , actually , I remember , when I was a teen - ager , thinking there was no point in going on , but then I realized that life is just an endless series of embarrassments and I 'd hate to miss out on all that . "
The first time I met Morris was in an airport , on a day in early 1987 , when he was still working on " The Thin Blue Line " and was flying to Dallas to attend a federal - court hearing .
He wore a navy pin-striped suit , carried a briefcase , and could easily have masqueraded as a typical travelling litigator except that he was not flying first class .
Days when he does n't wear a suit , he dresses like a permanent graduate student - khakis , Black Watch blazer or tweed jacket , button - down shirt , dark - framed dark Kent - ish eyeglasses .
He has short dark - brown hair , which often looks as if it had been slept on the wrong way , and a rueful , asymmetrical smile .
Although he is six - one , imperfect posture renders his presence less than imposing .
Photographs make him appear either darkly handsome or dolefully goofy .
Morris is now forty - one years old .
He grew up in Hewlett , on the South Shore of Long Island .
His father , a doctor , died when he was two , and his mother , a Juilliard graduate , who did not remarry for more than twenty years , supported him and an older brother by teaching music in a public school .
Errol studied cello , read with a passion the forty - odd " Oz " books , watched a lot of television , and on a regular basis went with a doting but not quite right maiden aunt ( " I guess you 'd have to say that Aunt Roz was somewhat demented " ) to Saturday matinees , where he saw stuff like " This Island Earth " and " Creature from the Black Lagoon " - horror movies that , viewed again thirty years later , still seem scary to him .
" I do n't really understand how Errol got drawn to these gothic themes that interest him - maybe that he lost his father , " his mother , Cinnabelle Esterman , told me not long ago .
" I remember the first time we went on a trip out West .
We had to take a flight to Chicago , and a friend drove us to the airport .
And I noticed that along the way , in the car , Errol was reading the World Almanac , studying about air crashes . "
In the tenth grade , he was enrolled in the Putney School , in Vermont .
Part of what had drawn him to Putney was its highly regarded music program .
Morris 's most vivid memories , however , include having a forbidden radio confiscated because one evening he made the mistake of loudly singing along while listening to Birgit Nilsson perform the immolation scene from " Götterdammerung . "
On another occasion , for an offense that he cannot recall , a dormitory proctor deprived him of his cello .
Next came the University of Wisconsin , where he excelled academically ( " the first time I did really well at anything , except elementary school " ) and , in 1969 , received a degree in history .
For a couple of years , he drifted about , earning money as a cable - television salesman in Wisconsin and as a term - paper writer in Massachusetts and " trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep . "
This strategy , which did not succeed at Oxford and Harvard , finally worked at Princeton , but graduate school soon proved to have been not such a hot idea .
Morris 's mistake was in pursuing academic disciplines - at Princeton , the history of science - in which he had " absolutely no background . "
" I did enter Princeton actually thinking I was going to get a doctorate , " he says .
" I was wrong .
I had big fights with my adviser .
I was supposed to be concentrating on the history of physics .
And , naturally , my adviser expected me to take all these courses in physics .
But the classes were always full of fourteen - year - old Chinese prodigies , with their hands in the air - ' Call on me !
Call on me ! '
I could n't do it .
I reneged on some of my commitments .
At the end , my adviser actually assaulted me .
He was on sabbatical and had an office at the Institute for Advanced Study .
I remember thinking , This is the Institute for Advanced Study , and he 's assaulting me .
I 'd written a thirty - page double - spaced paper , and he produced thirty single - spaced pages of his own criticizing it .
The bile just flowed out of him .
I accused him of not even finishing reading what I 'd written .
It turns out I was a problem , but at least I was n't a drudge , and that school was filled with drudges .
I remember saying to my adviser , ' You wo n't even look through my telescope . '
And his response was ' Errol , it 's not a telescope , it 's a kaleidoscope . ' "
In 1972 , Morris moved to Berkeley , where he had been accepted as a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at the University of California .
His recollections of that experience also lack a warm glow , but something fundamentally positive did take place , which was that he discovered the Pacific Film Archive , a cinemathèque / library / revival house / symposium center , and the only place in the Bay Area with the ability to devote several days to a retrospective of , say , the cinema of Senegal .
Tom Luddy , a film producer , who was then the director of the Archive , recently said , " There were a bunch of regulars and a bunch of eccentric regulars , and Errol was one of the eccentrics .
I often had to defend him to my staff .
What made him eccentric ?
Well , for one thing , he dressed strangely .
Remember , this is Berkeley in the early seventies .
And Errol was wearing dark suits with pants that were too short , white dress shirts , and heavy shoes .
He looked like a New York person gone to seed .
Then , I let him use our library for research , and he was always getting into little frictions with the staff .
He felt he could both use the Archive and put it down .
He would leave messes .
He never bothered to reshelve books .
I found myself defending him , which was often difficult , because he would attack me for the programming .
He was a film - noir nut .
He claimed we were n't showing the real film noir .
So I challenged him to write the program notes .
Then , there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in .
I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it . "
The Archive opened each afternoon at five - thirty .
Among the other eccentric were a superannuated Berkeley professor who had a habit of showing up at 5:30 A.M. ; the narcoleptic who used to come for the first show , immediately fall asleep , and remain that way through the final feature ; a disconcertingly loud laugher , known as the Cackler ; and a misanthropic woman who , with her dog , lived in a van outside the Archive .
Meanwhile , Morris 's academic career failed to thrive .
" Berkeley was just a world of pedants , " he says .
" It was truly shocking .
I spent two or three years in the philosophy program .
I have very bad feelings about it . "
His own flaw , he believes , was that he was " an odd combination of the academic and the prurient . "
While he was supposed to be concentrating on the philosophy of science , his attention became diverted by an extracurricular interest in the insanity plea .
A quotation from " The Black Cat " - a story in which Edgar Allan Poe writes of " the spirit of perverseness & this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself ... to do wrong for the wrong 's sake only " - had become resonant for him , and he began to ponder the metaphysics of mass murder .
In 1975 , he returned to Wisconsin long enough to have several interviews with Ed Gein , the real - life prototype for the Norman Bates character in " Psycho " and a Midwestern legend .
" You could n't spend long in Wisconsin , especially with my predilection , without hearing a lot about Ed Gein , " Morris says .
Gein was then confined to Central State Hospital , in Waupun , a maximum - security institution for the criminally insane .
Evidently , Morris was the first person in quite a while to make a special effort to talk with him .
What perhaps discouraged other potential visitors was that Gein not only murdered people but also was a cannibal , a grave robber , and an amateur taxidermist .
Morris found his way to Dr. George Arndt , a Geinologist and the author of a study - a catalogue of Ed Gein jokes , basically - titled " Community Reaction to a Horrifying Event . "
" I go and meet Dr. Arndt , " Morris says .
" Almost from the beginning , I entertain serious doubts about the wholesomeness of Dr. Arndt 's interest in the Gein case .
Dr. Arndt seems real excited that there 's this kindred spirit interested in the Ed Gein story .
I tell him I 've been spending a lot of time in Plainfield , Wisconsin , where Ed Gein lived and committed his crimes .
I tell him I 've been to the Plainfield cemetery to look at graves .
I had the names of the graves whose occupants Ed had exhumed .
I noticed that those graves made a circle around his mother 's grave .
Dr. Arndt looks at me and says , ' You know what that means , do n't you ? '
I say , ' No , sir . '
He says , ' It 's a kind of sublimation .
Transference .
He could n't go down directly after his mother .
He had to go down through the other graves . '
He says , ' There may be underground tunnels leading to his mother 's grave . '
So we go in his Cadillac to the Plainfield cemetery .
When we 're almost there , he pulls over and starts looking around in the brush for something , and he comes up with a big thick stick .
We get to the cemetery , we find the graves where the exhumations took place , and he has me put my ear to the ground near Mrs. Gein 's grave .
While I do that , Dr. Arndt walks around beating the ground , searching for hollow sounds .
I hear nothing .
Finally , I ask , ' Dr. Arndt , why did n't he just dig straight into Mrs. Gein 's grave ? '
And Dr. Arndt gives me this look and says , ' Too devious . ' "
During his research , Morris stumbled across the provocative fact that Plainfield , with a population of seven hundred , had within a ten - year period been home to several multiple killers , and that Gein 's depredations had antedated the others ' , almost as if he had driven the town mad .
" One of the things that have always fascinated me about abnormal behavior is that we can't really explain it to our satisfaction , " Morris says .
" Almost everything I do now in my work is about epistemic concerns : how do we come by certain kinds of knowledge ?
Take the insanity plea - we talk about insane acts and insane people .
When we talk about insane acts , we 're saying we do n't understand something about the act itself .
When we say someone is insane , we 're either saying , one , ' That person could be mentally ill , ' or , two , ' I do n't know why that person does what he does . '
Rather than expressing a knowledge , we 're expressing a lack of knowledge .
I wrote an essay on the insanity plea and movie monsters and certain mechanistic fantasies we have about criminal behavior .
I very much wanted to write a doctoral thesis on this stuff , and it hurt my feelings when Berkeley just sort of kicked my ass out of there . "
The demise of Morris 's academic career was a protracted matter , and he stayed at the university long enough to get a master 's degree in philosophy .
All the while , he was a devotee of the Pacific Film Archive .
Tom Luddy introduced him to Werner Herzog , the German director , whose fascination with fanatics , losers , Nazi supermen , and dwarfs dovetailed with Morris 's outside - the - mainstream preoccupations .
Once , making the film " Even Dwarfs Started Small , " Herzog inadvertenly set a dwarf afire ; the dwarf survived , and Herzog did penance by throwing himself onto a cactus .
At the time he and Morris met , Morris 's reading diet included , in addition to his academic texts , the National Enquirer and Weekly World News .
For listeners whom he deemed worthy , he had assembled an endlessly aggressive repertoire that included eyewitness tales of Geinology and other vignettes of American dementia .
" Werner was very taken with Errol , " Luddy recalls , adding that , despite Morris 's never having shot a single foot of film , " Werner treated him as an equal . "
Morris and Herzog discussed the question that Morris and Dr. Arndt had left unanswered - whether or not Gein had disinterred his mother - and they set a date for a rendezvous in Plainfield in the summer of 1975 .
The idea was that , with shovels , in the moonlight , they would satisfy their curiosity .
When Herzog arrived in Plainfield , however - he had been working on a film in Alaska and was now driving toward New York - no familiar face was there to greet him .
He made a phone call to California and learned that Morris had had second thoughts .
A few months later , Morris did return to Plainfield , alone , and rented a room from Ed Gein 's next - door neighbors .
This time , he stayed almost a year , during which he conducted hundreds of hours of interviews with some of the other homicidally inclined local talent .
He had no focussed idea of what to do with the material .
Maybe he would make a film about Ed Gein called " Digging Up the Past , " or maybe he would write a book .
Although he still had a fellowship at the University of California , he did n't have enough money to transcribe all his interview tapes .
Some supplementary financial support came from his family , but it was not unqualified support .
" My mother was worried about what I was doing , " he says .
" She has this wonderfully euphemistic way of talking to me .
At one point , she said , ' Errol , ca n't you spend more time with people your own age ? '
And I said , ' But , Mom , some of these mass murderers are my own age . ' "
It did n't do Morris any good when , in order to talk to one of the Plainfield murderers , he made his way illegally into a state mental hospital , got caught , and was reported to his academic supervisors at Berkeley .
In the fall of 1976 , while Morris was still in Plainfield , Herzog unexpectedly returned .
During Herzog 's visit the previous year , his car had broken down , and he had discovered an automobile - repair shop - a grim place set against a grim , flat natural backdrop - that struck him as an excellent movie location .
So now he had come to finish a film , " Stroszek , " most of which had been shot in Berlin .
He asked Morris to work with him , but Morris felt that he had been abused .
" Stealing a landscape , " he complained .
" The worst kind of plagiarism . "
On the other hand , he had never made a film himself , and here was a chance to observe a master .
So he stuck around , and , when the shooting was completed Herzog , afflicted with some measure of guilt , handed him an envelope stuffed with cash .
They were in a motel room .
Morris went to a window and tossed the envelope into a parking lot .
After retrieving the money , Herzog offered it once more , saying , " Please do n't do that again . "
The envelope contained about two thousand dollars - more than enough to finance a two - week trip Morris had been planning .
Recently , he had read a newspaper article about an insurance investigator which mentioned , in passing , how several people in an unidentified Southern town had tried to collect benefits after " accidentally " losing limbs .
Morris had tracked down the insurance investigator and learned that the town was Vernon ( pop. 883 ) , in the Florida panhandle .
Vernon 's unofficial nickname was now Nub City .
In the hierarchy of nubbiedom , the supremely rewarding self - sacrifice was the loss of a right leg and a left arm , because , so the theory went , " afterward , you could still write your name and still have a foot to press the gas pedal of your Cadillac . "
Morris stayed in Vernon long enough to read some files at the courthouse , talk to an insurance broker and several nubbies , and receive at least one unambiguous death threat .
At the Cat's Eye Tavern one night , a citizen twice Morris 's size smiled as he extinguished a cigarette on the lapel of Morris 's blazer .
Morris remembers thinking that perhaps he had packed the wrong clothes .
Also , " I remember it hurt my feelings , because it seemed that , you know , maybe the people in Vernon did n't like me . "
Rarely did murders take place in Vernon , because , someone explained , " down here , people do n't get murdered - they just disappear . "
Back in Berkeley , Morris tried to write a script for a fiction feature to be called " Nub City . "
Mainly , he had a pitch line - " Nub City " would be " about people who in order to achieve the American dream literally become a fraction of themselves " - but the plot elements were still gestating .
Months went by and he made only slight progress .
One afternoon while waiting for inspiration to descend , he was eating lunch in the Swallow , a restaurant in the same building as the Pacific Film Archive , and he saw a headline in the San Francisco Chronicle that said , " 450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY . "
Suddenly , he had an altogether different idea for a film ; " Nub City " would have to wait .
It was enough that in deciding to make " Gates of Heaven " Morris selected a subject that , on its surface , seemed highly likely to repel .
He also insisted on making a documentary film " the opposite of how you were supposed to . "
That meant being static and obtrusive - using artificial light and heavy , earthbound equipment rather than the standard hand - held , mobile tools of cinema verité .
After Morris hooked up with Ned Burgess , a compliant cinematographer , the making of " Gates of Heaven " progressed in a straightforward fashion .
The film was shot in the spring and summer of 1977 and cost a hundred and twenty thousand dollars to make ; the money came from a wealthy graduate - school classmate and from Morris 's family .
Getting to know mass murderers and their relatives in Wisconsin , Morris had developed an interview technique that , reduced to basics , amounted to : Shut up and let people talk .
" Listening to what people were saying was n't even important , " he says .
" But it was important to look as if you were listening to what people were saying .
Actually , listening to what people are saying , to me , interferes with looking as if you were listening to what people are saying . "
The first half of " Gates of Heaven " explores the broken dream of a man named Floyd McClure , who lives in Los Altos , a peninsula town thirty miles south of San Francisco .
In the opening frames , McClure describes , in a sincere but unmaudlin manner , how the accidental death of a beloved collie in his childhood inspired his vision of a pet cemetery .
Choosing a site , he settled on what he calls " the most beautiful piece of land , as far as I was concerned , in the whole valley . "
( Never mind that the land was situated right next to a freeway ; it also happened to be across the street from his house . )
" A pet -cemetery business is not a fast - buck scheme , it 's not a suede - shoe game , " McClure says .
" It 's a good , solid business enterprise .
And in order to have this concept it has to be in your heart , not in your billfold .
And these are the type of people I wanted in business with me , in the pet- cemetery concept . "
His co-investors in the by now failed enterprise allow themselves to be interviewed , the owner of a rendering plant talks , families of departed pets have their say , Florence Rasmussen appears .
Monologues tend not to parse .
At one point , McClure says , " And this is the part of the inspiration of getting our little pets ... into a cemetery .
Something that we could be proud of , of saying , ' My little pet did his chore here - that God has sent him to us to do a chore - love and be loved and serve his master . '
And , boy , these little pets that did that ...
Like I said before - death is for the living and not for the dead . "
The second half of " Gates of Heaven " focusses on the Harberts family - Cal and his wife , Scottie , and their sons , Dan and Phil - who are the proprietors of Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park , the final final resting place of the displaced tenants of Floyd McClure 's doomed pet-cemetery concept .
Dan , the younger son , has been employed in the family business for a few years .
Phil has recently given up selling insurance in Utah ( his idol is W. Clement Stone , the Chicago insurance tycoon and an avatar of the Positive Mental Attitude ) and has repatriated to the Napa Valley .
Cal Harberts says , " We created the Garden of Honor .
And in this garden we will bury a Seeing Eye dog or a police dog killed in the line of duty at no cost - if it 's killed in the line of duty .
And for anybody else who wants to share this garden then we created a price which amounts to more than any other garden that we have . "
Phil , who manifests what might or might not be symptoms of an incipient existential crisis - possibly a consequence of having listened to and delivered too many motivational lectures - says , " I have to say to myself :
What does it mean to me ?
What does this mean to me ?
What is it going to mean to me ?
I recognize this and - A couple of things when I was instructing motivation back in Salt Lake City is that if we do n't stop and ask ourselves a question once in a while to probe our subconscious or to probe our conscious ... I used to teach it .
It 's a plain , simple formula .
We reduced everything to a formula , memorized it , and therefore we were able to repeat it constantly .
I used to call it the R2 - A2 formula : Recognize , Relate , Assimilate , and put into Action !
Like , I could be driving down the freeway and see a 450 SL .
I could say , ' Hey , I like that .
What does that mean to me ?
What would I have to do to get it ?
How can I do it ? '
And then go to work for it .
And strive for it .
It kind of makes life easy .
I think that 's why a lot of people do n't -
They get frustrated .
They have emotional problems , it 's that they do n't know how to cope with their - mind .
There are three things that I 've got to do and that if anybody wants to do to be successful , to have the desire , the want - to .
Why do you go to work in the morning ?
Gee , why am I here ?
Because you want to .
But that 's obvious .
And then the next very important ingredient is something that a lot of people and a lot of businesses fail to delge into .
It 's the activity knowledge .
It would be the equation to a mathematical problem .
It would be equal to the chemist 's ability to emulsify chemicals - you know , properly , the valences .
But the knowledge of it , the whole scope .
Everything in detail .
And then the third element would be , of course , the know - how or the experience .
I have the inspiration to action .
I do n't have the activity knowledge , but I 'm getting the know - how before I 'm getting the activity knowledge .
As a matter of fact , I 'm getting more know - how than I 'm getting activity knowledge .
But they can be correlated together .
They can be overlapped . "
Dan Harberts says , " As far as preparation - a hole has to be dug , prepared .
We have to make sure that the hole is going to fit the size of the casket .
Because you do n't want to make it too large , because you 're going to waste space .
And you do n't want to make it too small , because you can't get the thing in there . "
" Gates of Heaven " was first shown during the 1978 New York Film Festival , which happened to coincide with a newspaper strike .
In other words , " Gates of Heaven " sprang into a void .
When the film opened in Berkeley , that same year , a glowing review by Michael Covino appeared in the East Bay Express .
( Covino later retooled the essay , and it was published in Film Quarterly . )
More than two years elapsed before " Gates of Heaven " was seen again , in New York or anywhere else - before anyone paid significant attention .
In the spring of 1981 , New Yorker Films arranged a limited national distribution .
The notices were favorable - in several instances , extravagantly so .
Perhaps the most ardent champion of " Gates of Heaven " across the years has been Roger Ebert , who includes it in his list of the ten best films of all time and calls it " compulsively watchable , a film that has engaged me as no other movie has in my twenty - one years as a movie critic . "
When Ebert is invited to give a speech and is told that he can screen a film of his choosing , he selects " Gates of Heaven , " which he regards as " a film about hope - hope held by the loneliest people who have ever been on film . "
Ebert estimates that he has seen it at least fifty times - often enough to have memorized long passages .
" Every time I show this , it plays differently , " he says .
" Some people think it 's about animals .
Some people think it 's about life and death .
I 've shown it to a group of bankers , who believe it raises all kinds of questions about success , about starting a small business .
People think it 's funny or sad or deadpan or satirical .
They think that Errol Morris loved the people in the film , or that he was being very cruel to them .
I 've never yet had a person tell me that it 's a bad film or a film that does n't interest them . "
Werner Herzog commemorated the Berkeley premiere of " Gates of Heaven " by eating one of his shoes - a poached desert boot - in a public ceremony .
Though less spectacular than flinging oneself upon a cactus , this event was sufficiently momentous for the documentary filmmaker Les Blank to record it in a twenty - minute short titled " Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe . "
A haze of myth enshrouds the genesis of the shoe - eating .
Tom Luddy 's version has Herzog , while one day arguing with Morris in a hallway of the Pacific Film Archive , saying , " You 'll never make a film , but if you do I 'll come and eat my shoe at the premiere . "
Herzog maintains that it happened in a more encouraging manner , as in " You are going to make a film .
And the day I am going to see the film in a theatre I will eat the shoes I am wearing . "
Morris , who claims not to recall any of the above , says the entire stunt was concocted by Luddy .
" I did n't make " Gates of Heaven " so that Werner Herzog would have to eat his shoe , " he says .
" It 's not as if I decided to realize my potential as a human being in order to get somebody to ingest something distasteful .
I specifically asked Werner not to eat his shoe . "
Morris was supposed to fly from New York to Berkeley to attend the screening and to appear in Les Blank 's film .
At Kennedy Airport , he boarded a plane , but when a mechanical problem forced all the passengers to get off he decided not to go .
" As a result , I do n't appear in ' Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe , ' " he says .
" I suppose I regret that reticence .
Why be so prissy ?
Why try so hard to control things ?
I 'm not even sure what that 's all about .
Probably , as a result of my petulant behavior , fewer people have seen ' Gates of Heaven ' than otherwise would have .
In fact , I 'm still surprised when anyone tells me he 's seen it . "
In the winter of 1979 , Morris went back to Vernon , Florida , and for very little money he was able to rent one of the biggest houses in the county .
Vernon was no less xenophobic than any other small Southern town .
When the locals asked Morris why he had come there and he gave vague , misleading answers , the typical response was " No , you 're here because of the Nub City stuff . "
He spent much of his time attending revival meetings and driving around to places that had interesting names - Blackhead , Lizard Lake , the Ebro Dog Track .
Although he was still enamored of the Nub City idea , he had not yet written a workable screenplay .
If he were to try to make a nonfiction film about the Nub City episode , " it would turn into one of those bad investigative documentaries where people are slamming doors in your face . "
Finally , after several months of insisting " I 'm not here about Nub City , I 'm not making a film about Nub City , " guilt overwhelmed him , he indeed became incapable of making a film about Nub City , and he left town .
A year later , he returned , rented the same big house , and spun his wheels some more .
Now , however , vacillation carried a steeper price tag , because he had financial help from German television and from WNET , the public - television affiliate in New York .
A crew of recent graduates from the New York University film school drove to Vernon in a rented van , bringing with them equipment so heavy that the van blew out two sets of tires on the drive south .
When they arrived , Morris had still not decided what the film would be about .
A controversy had arisen involving the firing and rehiring of one of the local police officers .
Morris felt that the officer 's travails were connected with " the Napoleonic ambitions of the king of the nubbies . "
The king of the nubbies had advised Morris to leave town within twenty - four hours or leave in a casket .
When Morris failed to oblige , the king made what seemed a sincere effort to run down Ned Burgess , the cinematographer , with a truck .
More or less in desperation - to get the king of the nubbies off his back , to give the public - television people something , anything , for their money - Morris began to film interviews with various interesting citizens of Vernon , among them Roscoe Collins , the cop ; Joe Payne , the collector of wild animals ( opossum , gopher , tortoise , rattlesnake ) ; Albert Bitterling , the cosmologist with the opera glasses ( " Reality - you mean , this is the real world ?
Ha , ha , ha .
I never thought of that " ) ; George Harris and Claude Register , two geezers who discuss how an acquaintance put a shotgun to his forehead and pulled the trigger with his big toe ( " And he said , that day , he says , ' That 'll be the last thing I ever do is to shoot myself . '
Which it was " ) , " Vernon , Florida " contains not a single reference to Nub City .
Rather , as with " Gates of Heaven , " the film 's subjects are the American vernacular and the malleability of truth .
Morris presents Vernon , Florida , as is - no special effects , what you see is what you get - as if he had stumbled across , and without editorial intrusion had agreed to share , an unexplored settlement full of Florence Rasmussens .
Howard Pettis , the worm farmer , says , " I 've never studied no book on these wigglers .
What I know about 'em is just self - experience .
They got books on 'em , but them books is wrong .
They do n't teach you right .
They do n't teach you right on 'em .
Teach you what kind of feed to feed 'em .
How to do 'em and all , there .
And it 's all wrong , in my book . "
Henry Shipes , the turkey hunter ( " I can't tell you how it feel .
It 's just a hell of a sport , that 's all " ) , sits in a chair in his living room and , with enormous relish , recounts the gut - stirring thrills of each of a series of trophy kills .
While the viewer is not prohibited from imputing deep meanings to the images or the monologues of Henry Shipes , one ultimately gets the feeling that if turkey hunting stands as a metaphor for anything it is probably turkey hunting .
In the film 's final scene , Henry Shipes , on a hunt , surveys a crowd of buzzards roosting on a cypress tree and counts them aloud - thirty - five .
" Listen to that sound , " he says .
" That fwoop fwoop .
Hear that sound ?
Getting in and out of the trees ?
That flop - flop sound ?
Mmm-hmm .
That sound 'll sure mistake y ou for turkeys .
Listen !
Hear that flop - flop ?
Limbs breaking .
Hear that good flop then ?
Listening to that gives me the turkey fever .
Mmm-hmm .
I wish there 's as many turkeys as there are buzzards . "
Like " Gates of Heaven , " " Vernon " had its premiere at the New York Film Festival - the 1981 edition .
Werner Herzog called it " an invention of cinema , a discovery of one side of cinema that all of us have not known yet . "
A review in Newsweek said it was " a film as odd and mysterious as its subjects , and quite unforgettable - unforgettable , that is , for those who laid eyes on it .
Because it had a running time of only sixty minutes , no national distributor materialized , and not until the summer of 1982 , when it was shown on public television , did significant numbers of viewers or critics take notice .
Meanwhile , Morris was , as usual , low on funds .
He was living in Manhattan , occupying rooms in a series of not quite elegant hotels - the Carter , the Bryant , the Edison , the Wellington - before finally settling in a building in the West Fifties , where he still keeps an apartment .
The more dire his fiscal circumstances grew , the better he got to know a Mr. Montori , an employee of a collection agency .
Mr. Montori seemed to derive pleasure from gracing Morris 's telephone - answering machine with one - a- day rhetorical questions like " Mr. Morris , have you no sense of shame ? " and " Mr. Morris , were you really brought up to act this way ? "
Then the calls abruptly ceased .
After several months had passed , Morris phoned the collection agency , asked " Is Mr. Montori O.K. ? , " and learned that his tormentor had moved on to a more rewarding position elsewhere .
In earnest , Morris sought backing for what turned out to be some of his most resistible film projects : " Road , " the story of the northern Minnesota interstate - highway folly ; Robert K. Golka , the laser - induced - fireball wizard in Utah ; Centralia , Pennsylvania , the coal town where an inextinguishable subterranean fire began burning in 1962 .
Morris concluded that " people who tend to be interested in documentary filmmaking were n't interested in my films , because they did n't look like documentary films . "
The theme of " Road , " in particular - a man wants to create a complicated and expensive thing for which absolutely no need exists - was , he says , " disturbingly self - reflective . "
As his debts accumulated , his stepfather advised him that the time had come to " turn yourself in to the phone company . "
Instead , Morris permitted himself a brief Hollywood interlude .
In 1983 , Edward Pressman , a producer whose credits include films by Brian De Palma , Terrence Malick , and Oliver Stone , agreed to finance the development of a screenplay about the exploits of John and Jim Pardue , brothers from Missouri who , fifteen years earlier , had killed their father , their grandmother , and two accomplices and robbed five banks , in two instances using dynamite .
Pitching the film , Morris would say , " The great bank - robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is going wrong in the country .
Bonnie and Clyde were apolitical , but it 's impossible to imagine them without the Depression as a back - drop .
The Pardue brothers were apolitical , but it 's impossible to imagine them without Vietnam . "
Pressman underwrote a sojourn at the Chateau Marmont , a Hollywood hotel that is famous in part because John Belushi died there ( not because Errol Morris wrote anything memorable while in residence ) .
Morris enlisted Tom Waits and Mickey Rourke to portray the Pardue brothers , and got as far as writing a treatment before the project derailed .
Next , Morris was set to direct a Pressman film called " The King Lives , " about an Elvis Presley impersonator ; this venture proceeded not very far before Morris was fired .
For Dino De Laurentiis , Morris agreed to work on an adaptation of a Stephen King short story .
Then De Laurentiis changed his mind and asked him to adapt a different King short story .
Then he changed his mind again and gave Morris two and a half weeks to write a screenplay based on King 's " Cycle of the Werewolf . "
Around the time that De Laurentiis rejected the script - because it " was n't frightening enough " - Morris 's brother and only sibling , Noel , died suddenly of a heart attack , at age forty .
" I was very depressed , " Morris says .
His apartment in Manhattan was a couple of blocks from the Ed Sullivan Theatre , from whose studios fund - raising telethons were often broadcast .
He found himself dropping in .
" My favorite was the Stop Arthritis Telethon , " he says .
" When I would go to these things , I would always see the same people in the audience , and I 'd look upon them with some pity , and then I realized that I was one of them . "
In 1984 , Morris married Julia Sheehan , an art historian , whom he had met in Wisconsin in the mid-seventies , during his Ed Gein phase .
Julia had tried to get a friend to introduce them , but the friend " made such a mess of it I actually approached Errol to apologize , " she says .
" I wanted to meet him because I 'd heard he had been interviewing murderers .
I did n't know anyone else who knew any murderers .
It was quiet in Wisconsin - the sixties were over , not much was going on - so somebody who had met murderers sounded good . "
Morris recalls saying to her , early in their relationship , " I was talking to a mass murderer but I was thinking of you , " and immediately fearing that this might not have sounded affectionate .
Julia , however , was flattered : " I thought , really , that was one of the nicest things anyone ever said to me .
It was hard to go out with other guys after that . "
They share a vivid and fond memory of their wedding , which took place in the Criminal Court Building in Brooklyn .
" They frisked us on the way in , which was very romantic , " Julia says .
" We got married between two prostitution cases , " Morris says .
" And we celebrated with a whale - shaped cake from Carvel . "
They have since become the parents of Nathaniel Hamilton Morris , and Julia has come to understand her husband well .
Some time ago , she stopped in at the Strand Bookstore to pick up an order for him .
The clerk who was helping her could n't find the books and asked whether she knew the subject matter .
" I do n't know any of the titles , " she said .
" But they 're probably about either insanity or murder or Nazis . "
Indeed , there was one of each .
" The Nazis , of course , are interesting to me , " Morris once told me .
" I just finished reading Joseph Goebbels ' diary .
You know a movie director Goebbels really liked ?

What Morris likes to call his " predilections " led him , in early 1985 , to Dr. James Grigson , a Dallas psychiatrist .
Under Texas law , a jury cannot impose the death penalty unless it is confident that a convicted person will commit future violent crimes .
To encourage juries to arrive at that conclusion , Dr. Grigson for more than fifteen years regularly appeared as a prosecution witness in capital cases .
In almost every instance , Dr. Grigson would , after examining a defendant , testify that he had found the individual in question to be an incurable sociopath , who it was " one hundred per cent certain " would kill again .
When Morris first went to see Dr. Grigson , it was with the idea of making a film titled " Dr. Death . "
Grigson proved to be as obliging to Morris as he had been to the prosecutors he served , and encouraged him to interview several men who , helped along by Dr. Grigson 's testimony , had received the death penalty .
Do n't be surprised if these fellows profess their innocence , Dr. Grigson warned ; that , after all , is how sociopaths behave .
A number of the twenty - five or so inmates with whom Morris spoke made such a claim .
One was a thirty - six - year - old man named Randall Dale Adams , who was an inmate of the Eastham Unit , a maximum - security prison in southeast Texas .
In the spring of 1977 , Adams had been convicted of and sentenced to die for the murder , the previous fall , of Robert Wood , a Dallas police officer .
Wood had been shot five times by the driver of a car that he and his partner , Teresa Turko , had stopped in west Dallas for a minor traffic violation .
Nearly a month elapsed between the murder of Wood and Adams ' arrest .
Adams told Morris that he had been framed , and that the actual killer was David Harris - " the kid , " he kept calling him during that first conversation - who had been the principal prosecution witness at Adams ' trial .
Morris had not gone to Texas with the purpose of finding and becoming an advocate for innocent incarcerated men ; he had gone there because of his fascination with Dr. Grigson .
He did n't really believe the story Adams told him , because he had no particular reason to believe it .
Nevertheless , he went to Austin three weeks later and read the transcripts of several trials .
A number of passages in the Adams transcript aroused the possibility that Adams was telling the truth .
After Morris met David Harris , two weeks later , in a bar outside Beaumont , his doubts about Adams ' guilt and his curiosity about the case deepened .
This came at a time when Morris 's film career was in another lull .
Suzanne Weil , then the head of programming for the Public Broadcasting System and a generous believer in Morris and his work , had arranged a grant sufficient for him to begin his research on " Dr. Death . "
( She once told me , " Errol is the one person in the world who , if he now came to me and said , ' I want to make a documentary tided " My Grandmother Remembers " or " So- and - So : Potter of the South - west , " ' I would tell , ' Go ahead . ' " )
Morris 's main source of income at that point was free - lance employment with a private detective agency that specialized in Wall Street securities and commodities cases .
Most of the agency 's referrals came from law firms .
" When I worked as a detective , I felt like this well - paid conceptual cleaning lady for lawyers , " he has said .
" It 's like - There seems to be hair clogging the drain .
My job was to clean it out and find out if it was really hair .
I had one particular problem : people would start talking to me and when I 'd leave I often could n't remember what they had said .
I wanted to use a tape recorder , but my employer was totally opposed .
So I worried about whether I was getting valuable information .
I also worried about getting stains on my clothes - I had to wear suits all the time .
Because I could n't use a tape recorder , my most important piece of equipment was my can of K2r spot remover . "
The owner of the detective agency , who prefers annonymity , told me that what he valued most about Morris was his talent as a listener - the talent that has served him so effectively as a filmmaker .
What happened next was that Morris began to employ in his film work certain skills he was honing as a detective .
As a " director - detective " - a phrase Morris used to describe himself when he was promoting " The Thin Blue Line " - not the least of his accomplishments was cultivating Henry Wade , for thirty - six years the District Attorney of Dallas County .
Instead of handling the Adams prosecution himself , Wade assigned it to Douglas Mulder , one of his most experienced assistants .
After gaining access to the files in Wade 's office , Morris became convinced that Mulder had seriously tampered with the truth and that Adams had received anything but a fair trial .
Randall Adams and David Harris met by chance the morning before Officer Wood was killed .
Adams had run out of gas and was walking along a road in west Dallas when Harris , a sixteen - year - old with an extensive criminal record , driving a car that he had stolen in his home town of Vidor , Texas , pulled over and offered to help him refill the tank .
They spent the rest of the day , a Saturday , together - bumming around a shopping mall , drinking beer , visiting pawnshops , shooting pool , smoking marijuana .
That evening , they ended up at a drive - in theatre that featured two soft - core - porn movies .
Officer Wood was shot at twelve - thirty Sunday morning - almost three hours after Harris , according to Adams ' testimony , had dropped him off at the motel where he was living .
That became Adams ' alibi : he was home asleep when the crime was committed .
Teresa Turko proved to be a poor eyewitness to the slaying of her patrol partner , and gave an inaccurate description of the car that the killer had been driving .
The first break in the case came because David Harris , back in Vidor , told several friends that he had killed a policeman in Dallas .
After being arrested and leading the Vidor police to the murder weapon , a . 22 - calibre handgun that belonged to his father , Harris was turned over to the Dallas police .
At this point , he changed his story and said that he had only been bragging - that the real killer was a hitchhiker he had picked up and spent the day with .
Which is how Adams , who had no prior criminal record , came to be charged with murder .
Initially , Adams was represented by Edith James , a lawyer whose criminal - trial experience included no homicide - defense work .
She brought in as co-counsel a general practitioner named Dennis White .
In one of White 's previous head - to - heads with Doug Mulder , things had ended badly for his clients - two brothers named Ransonette who had made the mistake of kidnapping the daughter - in - law of a Dallas newspaper publisher .
At the sentencing hearing in that case , White argued that the victim had not been harmed by her captors , and suggested a lenient prison term of five years .
The prosecution mentioned a term of five thousand years .
The jury , aspiring to Solomonic wisdom , said , in effect , " O.K. Let 's compromise , " and sentenced each defendant to five thousand and five years .
Dennis
White was simply no match for Doug Mulder , who is said to have once boasted , " Anybody can convict a guilty man .
It takes talent to convict an innocent man . "
Testifying during Adams ' trial , David Harris offered a chronology of the events surrounding the murder that varied from Adams ' version by approximately two and a half hours .
Adams and Harris agreed that they had left the drive - in theatre during a movie called " Swinging Cheerleaders . "
Mulder elicited from Harris testimony that their departure had occurred shortly after midnight ; Adams said they left around nine - thirty .
In the D.A. 's files , Morris discovered a memorandum from Mulder 's own chief investigator stating that there had been no late showing of " Swinging Cheerleaders " that night and that the final feature had ended shortly after ten o'clock .
This was the sort of serious defect in Harris 's version of the facts that Mulder apparently had no intention of allowing to interfere with his prosecution of Adams - who , at twenty - eight , was eligible for capital punishment , whereas Harris , at sixteen , was not .
It was also , unfortunately , the sort of discrepancy that Adams ' attorneys failed to make clear to the jury .
Nor were Edith James and Dennis White prepared when Mulder produced three mysterious witnesses , all of whom testified that they had driven past the scene of the crime moments before Officer Wood was murdered and that Randall Adams was in the driver 's seat - the position from which the shots were fired .
The three witnesses , Emily Miller , Robert Miller , and Michael Randell , all of whom were aware of a five - figure reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer , appeared in court on a Friday and impressed the jury .
White , outmaneuvered by Mulder 's strategy of presenting his " eyewitnesses " during the rebuttal phase rather than as part of his case - in - chief , conducted an ineffectual cross-examination .
That weekend ,
White received a call from a woman named Elba Carr , who knew Emily and Robert Miller and expressed the opinion that " Emily Miller had never told the truth , in her life . "
When , back in court the following Monday , White asked to question the Millers and Michael Randell further , Mulder told the judge that all three had left town or were otherwise unreachable .
Actually , all three witnesses were still in Dallas .
The Millers , in fact , were ensconced in the Alamo Plaza Motel as guests of Dallas County .
Not until nine years later , when Morris came along and found in the District Attorney 's files bills for phone calls that the Millers had made from the Alamo Plaza , did Mulder 's role in this apparent deception become evident .
Toward the end of " The Thin Blue Line , " Errol Morris asks David Harris , " Would you say that Adams is a pretty unlucky fellow ? " and Harris responds , " Definitely - if it was n't for bad luck , he would n't have had none . "
Ironically , of course , Harris 's reply is accurate only up to the moment when Morris met Adams .
Not only did Morris discover important evidence in the prosecution 's files ; he discovered the absence of some important documents - specifically , the official record of a police lineup at which , according to Emily Miller 's trial testimony , she had positively identified Randall Adams .
Most significantly , Morris tracked down the three rebuttal witnesses themselves and persuaded them to appear on film .
Emily Miller , a bleached blonde , whose childhood ambition was to be a detective or the wife of a detective , told Morris that she had failed to identify Adams in the lineup but that a policeman had told her the correct suspect , " so that I would n't make that mistake again . "
Robert Miller told him , " I really did n't see anything . "
Michael Randell , who had testified in 1977 that he was on his way home from playing basketball when he drove past the murder scene , told Morris that in fact he had spent that evening in an adulterous endeavor and that he was drunk " out of my mind . "
Each of the state 's rebuttal witnesses , it therefore appeared , had committed damaging perjury .
Putting David Harris on film posed a significant challenge .
The first interview appointment , Morris says , Harris missed " because he was off killing somebody " - Mark Walter Mays , a Beaumont citizen , whose apartment Harris had broken into , and whose girlfriend he had abducted .
Another interview had to be postponed when Harris tried to use Morris in an escape attempt from the jail where he was awaiting trial for these crimes .
The climactic interview finally took place in the Lou Sterret Jail , in Dallas , by which time Harris had been convicted and sentenced to death for the Mays murder , and it included this exchange :
MORRIS : Is he [ Adams ] innocent ?
HARRIS : Did you ask him ?
MORRIS : Well , he 's always said he 's been innocent .
HARRIS : There you go .
Did n't believe him , huh ?
Criminals always lie .
MORRIS : Well , what do you think about whether or not he 's innocent ?
HARRIS : I 'm sure he is .
MORRIS : How can you be sure ?
HARRIS : Because I 'm the one that knows .
On a straightforward , realistic level , " The Thin Blue Line " is the story of how Adams got railroaded , the story of an innocent man wrongly accused .
Its aura , however , is that of a dreadful fantasy , a mixture of the ghastly and the absurd .
By any standard , it breaches the conventional definition of " documentary . "
Tom Luddy has said that " The Thin Blue Line " illustrates Morris 's belief that cinema verité is " too mundane - that there is a way to heighten the structure of the facts . "
To accomplish this , Morris combines straight interviews - his unblinking talking - heads technique , from " Gates of Heaven " and " Vernon , Florida " - with artful restagings of certain incidents .
The restaged episodes correspond to conflicting versions of " the facts " proposed by the people who appear in the interviews .
Also , inserted throughout the film are closeups - of a gun , a mouth and a straw , a milkshake spilling , popcorn popping - that have a fetishistic quality , an exaggerated objectivity ( evidence of Morris 's passion for film noir ) .
The " Rashomon " - like result is something considerably creepier than the cold - blooded murder that " The Thin Blue Line " explores .
The day before the interview with Harris , which took place December 5 , 1986 , Morris appeared in the courtroom of John Tolle , a federal magistrate in Dallas , who was presiding over a habeas - corpus hearing - an effort by Adams to win a new trial .
In addition to Morris 's oral testimony , unedited footage from his interviews with the prosecution witnesses became part of the court record .
Watching these interviews - either unedited or as they appear in the final cut of " The Thin Blue Line " - one marvels at Morris 's ability to win the confidence of so many people so prone to self - incrimination .
On film , the witnesses against Adams seem to suffer collectively from the actor 's nightmare - an instinctive fear of silence , terror at the thought of forgetting one 's lines .
Talking to Morris , they manage to discredit themselves thoroughly .
Under oath in Magistrate Tolle 's courtroom , however , Emily Miller and Michael Randell tried to recant their statements to the filmmaker .
Among the questions raised by Adams ' habeas - corpus motion were : Had Adams been denied due process because he had not been effectively represented by his attorneys during his original trial , because of certain evidence that was illegally withheld from the jury during that trial , and because in 1980 , when the United States Supreme Court overturned his death sentence ( on a technical point involving jury selection ) , he received from the governor of Texas a commutation of the death sentence to life imprisonment rather than a new trial ?
Morris returned to Magistrate Tolle 's courtroom a month later , for the second , and last , day of the habeas - corpus hearing .
Doug Mulder , by now a highly successful defense attorney , testified , responding to unwelcome questions from Adams ' appellate lawyer , Randy Schaffer , with mumbled replies and lapses of memory .
As the hearing ended , reason dictated that the magistrate would rule on Adams ' petition within a few weeks .
Tolle , however , turned out to be an even more , gifted procrastinator than Morris .
The New York Film Festival committee had expressed interest in showing " The Thin Blue Line " in September of 1987 , but Morris failed to meet the deadline .
Finally , on March 18 , 1988 , " The Thin Blue Line " had its premiere , at the San Francisco Film Festival .
Morris appeared to be in buoyant spirits that day , and I asked him what he expected to do after the screening .
" Oh , I imagine the usual lithium treatments , " he said .
" Followed by a period of hospitalization . "
A month later , " The Thin Blue Line " led off the USA Film Festival , in Dallas .
Magistrate Tolle had yet to be heard from .
Two more weeks passed - sixteen months had elapsed since the conclusion of the habeas - corpus hearing - and Tolle at last rendered his judgment : " All relief requested& denied . "
As far as Morris 's role in the case was concerned , Tolle wrote , " much could be said about those videotape interviews , but nothing that would have any bearing on the matter before this court . "
A week later , Randy Schaffer filed a motion asking that Tolle 's opinion be set aside , because an astonishing fact had come to light :
In the spring of 1977 , on the heels of Adams ' conviction for the murder of Officer Wood , Dennis White had filed a five - million - dollar lawsuit against Doug Mulder and Henry Wade , alleging that the District Attorney 's conduct during the trial had violated the defendant 's civil rights .
John
Tolle then worked in the civil division of the Dallas County District Attorney 's office .
White 's suit had been briskly dismissed by a federal judge .
After the screening at the USA Film Festival , Dennis White mentioned to Morris that he recalled Tolle 's having been involved in the 1977 civil suit .
The records of that litigation were dredged from a file , and , sure enough , John Tolle 's name was all over them : John Tolle had triumphantly represented Mulder and Wade .
Somehow , not quite ten years later , Magistrate Tolle had decided that this coincidence did not disqualify him from rendering an opinion on Adams ' habeas - corpus petition .
Rather , he had chosen to hear the case , and had then sat on it for seventeen months before eventually ruling , in effect , in favor of his former client .
The embarrassing revelation of Tolle 's conflict of interest forced him to withdraw his recommendation ; thus , an additional year and a half of Adams ' life had been consumed by a proceeding that ultimately yielded irrelevance .
Rather than start all over again in federal court , before a different magistrate , Schaffer decided to formally withdraw the writ and refile it in state court , citing new evidence that Adams had never received a fair trial .
Officer Robert Wood was murdered Thanksgiving weekend in 1976 .
Twelve years later almost to the day , Adams and his attorneys returned to the room where he had been convicted of the murder and handed a death sentence - Criminal District Court No. 2 , on the fourth floor of the Dallas County Courthouse .
By Texas statute , the judge who presides at a trial - in this instance , District Judge Don Metcalfe , whose evidentiary rulings against Adams formed part of the basis for the writ - also presides at any subsequent appellate - writ hearing .
Adams ' bad luck , while consistent , was not absolute , however , and Metcalfe had since left the bench .
In 1984 , he was succeeded by Larry W. Baraka , a respected former prosecutor and defense attorney , whose special distinction is that he is the only member of the Texas judiciary who is black , a Muslim , and a Republican .
On the eve of the hearing , I had a phone conversation with Morris .
In New York the previous day , he told me , his secretary had taken a call from a stranger who said , " An important message for Errol Morris : Stay away from the hearing in Dallas on Wednesday .
You might disappear " - a forewarning that brought to mind his experience in Vernon , Florida , a decade earlier , where , he had been informed , unfortunate people had a tendency to " just disappear . "
" My stepfather told my wife I should wear two bulletproof vests , so that one covers the seams of the other , " he continued .
" I do n't mind a death threat , as such , but I do mind the idea of disappearing .
That 's like the ' delete ' button on your personal computer - ' We deleted that character . '
Disappearing suggests a whole set of unsavory possibilities . "
As it turned out , I could n't be in Dallas the opening day of the writ hearing , and thereby missed a memorable striptease by David Harris .
Testifying for three hours , Harris said that he had been alone in a stolen car and in possession of a stolen gun when Wood pulled him over .
In a videotaped interiew that was introduced as evidence , he said that he had had his finger on the trigger as Wood approached him .
Judge Baraka , no quibbler , announced , " As far as the court is concerned , he 's in fact telling me he did it . "
Randy Schaffer read aloud a letter from Harris to his mother , written in September , 1988 - just two months earlier - that said , " It seems like my whole life is surrounded by ' wrongs ' of some kind and it seems like I 've never done the right thing when I could and should have .
Absolving Randall Dale Adams of any guilt is a difficult thing for me to do , but I must try to do so because he is innocent .
That is the I truth . "
Next , Schaffer called Teresa Turko , Robert Wood 's patrol partner , as a witness .
He wanted to make plain to the judge that Turko 's initial description of the killer , recorded immediately after the shooting , differed measurably from the one she had offered at Adams ' trial .
Dennis
White had not cross-examined Turko about the first statement , because , in violation of a cardinal principle of criminal - trial procedure , Mulder had not given him a copy .
Nor would the document have come to light , of course , if Morris had not insinuated himself into the Dallas District Attorney 's good graces and scrutinized Mulder 's old files .
When I caught up with Morris , at the end of the first day of the hearing , his mood was upbeat but not entirely sanguine .
The drama of Harris 's confession notwithstanding , it did not , in a technical sense , really help Adams .
In Texas , evidence of innocence is insufficient to win a new trial .
What Schaffer had to prove was that Adams ' original trial had been " unfair " on constitutional grounds .
Even if Baraka were to grant Adams ' writ , his ruling would have the effect only of a recommendation to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , a nine - judge panel , which in 1977 had unanimously upheld Adams ' conviction .
Harris 's testimony was useful , however , in bolstering some of the other claims in the writ - most significantly , that Harris and Mulder had an understanding in 1977 whereby in exchange for testimony against Adams unresolved criminal charges against Harris in another county would be dropped .
( Under cross-examination at the original trial , Harris had insisted that no quid pro quo existed - an avowal that Mulder has always maintained .
Further harm to Adams was done when Judge Metcalfe refused even to allow into evidence the fact that Harris had such charges pending . )
Randall Adams wore the same outfit to court all three days of the hearing - a bright - orange jumpsuit with " DALLAS COUNTY JAIL " in black block letters stencilled on the back ; leg irons ; and handcuffs , which were attached to a chain around his waist .
When Adams was escorted into the courtroom on Day Two , Morris had already arrived and taken a seat in the front row of the spectator section , between Adams ' mother , Mildred , and his two sisters , Nancy Bapst and Mary Baugess .
Two of Mildred Adams ' sisters and their husbands had also come to Dallas for the hearing .
George Preston , a lawyer who was assisting Randy Schaffer , leaned across a low partition that separated the spectators from the business end of the courtroom and showed Morris a printed sheet of paper , portions of which had been highlighted in yellow .
" This is from the Bar Association code , " he said .
" It regards tampering with witnesses and suppression of evidence . "
" I 'd like a copy of that , " Morris said .
" Our Xerox machine broke , so I had to tear this page out of the book , " Preston said .
" That page must have been missing from Doug Mulder 's copy , too , " Morris said .
The first witness on Day Two was Emily Miller .
Randy Schaffer expected to score several points while she was on the stand : her failure to identify Adams in a lineup ; the intervention of the Dallas policeman , who then pointed out to her the " right " suspect ; her subsequent perjury regarding her performance at the lineup ; and evidence that , like David Harris , she had struck an implicit deal with Mulder - specifically , her testimony against Adams in exchange for the dismissal of an outstanding robbery charge against her daughter .
A week after the murder of Robert Wood , at which time a twenty - thousand - dollar reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer , Emily Miller had given a formal statement to the Dallas police .
According to what she saw while driving the crime scene moments before the shooting , the suspect was " either a Mexican or a very light - skinned black man . "
That this description would divert suspicion from Adams , an auburn - haired Caucasian , perhaps explains why Mulder never showed the statement to Adams ' attorneys .
By the time of Adams ' trial , Emily Miller 's description of the killer had metamorphosed so that it matched the defendant .
In Judge Baraka 's courtroom , when Schaffer presented Emily Miller with a copy of her original statement she said that she had left her eyeglasses at home and could n't read it .
When Schaffer then read it to her and proceeded through a barbed interrogation , she said , " I do n't remember nothing that happened back then .
Specifics , I do n't remember who asked me what or who said what or who did what .
That was twelve years ago . "
As far as the officer who had coached her at the police lineup was concerned , she said , " I did n't base nothing I said on anything anybody told me .
It was what I seen .
And I 'm sorry I ever seen it . "
" You 're not the only one , I 'm sure , " Schaffer replied .
The subject of Errol Morris and his filmed interview with Emily Miller arose .
The witness turned to the judge and said , " May I get this clear on this videotape ?
This man [ Morris ] came to my house and told me that he was going to make a movie &
They were kicking it around in their heads about making a movie about the police shooting in Dallas .
So I said O.K .
He said , well , it would be interesting because , he said , ' In the first place , you 're married to a black man . '
This was his exact words .
And I said , ' Well . '
And he said , ' Do you mind ?
We 're not sure we 're going to film or anything .
We 're just going to kick it around . '
And I said , ' Well , I do n't exactly remember how everything went down back then . '
And he said , ' Well , what the heck , it 's just a movie , you know ? '
He said , ' Anything you do n't remember & I 'll remember for you . '
Well , this went on &
The movie was n't accurate .
It was n't , you know & I went along because he said what the heck , it 's a movie&
He tried to make me look like trash . "
During a recess , several reporters approached Morris - the cour troom was filled to capacity most of the three days of the hearing - and asked about Emily Miller 's accusations .
He pointed out that she had described the precise antithesis of his well - established interviewing style - his let - ' em - talk - until - the - truth - flows technique - and he offered to roll the tape of the full interview for anyone who was interested .
" She spoke extemporaneously , at length , without coaching , prodding , or interruption by me , " he said .
" It 's quite clear that Emily Miller has no credibility . "
Nevertheless , Emily Miller had accomplished something oddly significant : she had introduced the idea that " The Thin Blue Line " was a corrupt document .
Months earlier , a reporter for the Dallas Morning News had said to Morris , " You know , Errol , there are two sides to every story , " and he had replied , " Yeah , the truth and falsehood . "
Much as he still believed that about the Adams case , he also understood the mythology that attaches to movies , and he understood that in the iconography of this courtroom proceeding " The Thin Blue Line " had acquired a taint , as if it were some soiled version of the truth .
Errol Morris , seated in the front row of the spectator section , wearing a blue plaid jacket , chinos , a white shirt , and a red paisley necktie , repeatedly heard himself referred to as " a filmmaker from New York " - a phrase chock - full of unflattering connotations .
The word " movie " was chock - full of connotations .
Robert Wood was dead , and Randall Adams had spent twelve years behind bars - those were virtually the only remaining unassailable truths .
Almost every intervening fact had been tampered with by the police or lawyers or mysteriously motivated witnesses .
In the immediate context , Randall Adams , in his jumpsuit , handcuffs , and leg irons , seated mutely with his back to the spectators , seemed more relevant to the proceeding than Robert Wood but less relevant than Errol Morris .
Other witnesses went out of their way to impugn Morris - most notably Gus Rose , a former homicide detective , whom Adams described in " The Thin Blue Line " as having pulled a gun on him during one interrogation session .
Rose had come to court as the District Attorney 's witness .
During the direct examination by Leslie McFarlane , the appellate lawyer assigned to represent the Dallas County District Attorney , he made several statements that had Morris squirming in his seat and , whispering to me things like " Do n't these people get embarrassed lying ?
After all , this is only a man who was sentenced to death . "
Rose complained that Morris had misrepresented his intentions in soliciting an interview and then had been argumentative during the interview .
" You should hear this interview , " Morris said to me .
" I 'm barely present . "
When Rose testified that Adams had never denied murdering Robert Wood , Morris seethed , " That 's a lie .
He told me on film that Adams had denied it .
This is all lies , lies , lies . "
During cross-examination , Schaffer gave Rose reason to regret this particular portion of his testimony .
Holding a transcript of " The Thin Blue Line " - proof of Rose 's failure to keep his own story straight - Schaffer stood at the detective 's side and read a passage in which Rose recalled that Adams , shortly after his arrest , " almost over - acted his innocence . "
A hubbub arose in the spectator section , not unlike the inevitable moment when Perry Mason 's assistant , Paul Drake , shows up with a previously elusive piece of physical evidence .
A bearded man seated two rows behind Morris suddenly produced a videocassette of " The Thin Blue Line , " and Morris relayed it to George Preston , who passed it to Schaffer , who was able to taunt Rose with it , asking whether he wanted to see a moving picture of himself uttering words directly at odds with the testimony he had just given .
Trapped , Rose turned to Judge Baraka and said , " Your Honor , if the question is do I want to see the film the answer is no , I do not want to see the film or anything Errol Morris has anything to do with . "
Baraka called a recess for lunch .
In the hallway , I passed Mildred Adams , Randall 's mother .
A tall , broad - shouldered woman with light - blue eyes , blue - gray hair , and a beauty - shop permanent , Mrs. Adams was standing in a bath of bright light , being interviewed by a television reporter , saying not for the first or the last time , " If Dallas County will just admit that they made a mistake and let that boy come home ... "
One evening , I went to the Dallas County jail to have a conversation with Randall Adams .
I rode an elevator to the eighth floor of the courthouse building , signed in , presented a guard with a letter from Randy Schaffer authorizing my visit , and was directed to a pinkish - beige room about twice the size of a prison cell , along one wall of which was a row of telephone receivers and thick six - by - twelve - inch windows .
Adams , standing on the opposite side of the wall and holding two adjacent receivers - one to each ear - was concluding a conversation with Nancy Bapst and Mary Baugess , his sisters .
A black woman who had three children with her was talking on one of the other phones .
When Nancy Bapst handed me her receiver , a wall clock said eight - forty - five - which meant that we did n't have long before the visiting hour would expire .
Adams and I discussed Randy Schaffer 's aggressive style ( " I need somebody who can intimidate .
That 's what you need " ) and Doug Mulder , who was scheduled to testify the next morning ( " I know what those people did to me , but I have no personal animosity toward them " ) , and then I turned the subject to Errol Morris .
" If it was n't for him ...
I sat down there in Huntsville and this man listened to me - I was pleading for somebody and this man listened , " Adams began , in a flat voice , which , although it originated only a couple of feet away , sounded distant and disembodied , as if it had travelled through water .
" Errol Morris , when I talked to him , I talked to him for one purpose and one purpose only : for the investigation of my case , whether good or bad .
I told him , ' Whatever you want to do - you can dig into my closet if you will allow me to look at whatever you turn up . '
I knew what these people had done to me , but I could n't prove it .
Randy Schaffer and Mel Bruder [ another appellate lawyer ] , they did n't know .
The only one who knew was Dennis White , but he was shook up entirely and he was devastated .
I agreed to talk to Errol Morris on the condition that he would share with me what he found out .
I like to call Errol the Easter Bunny .
I needed somebody to gather up all these facts and put them in one basket .
He went and did his investigative work , and everything we 're doing now is because of what he did with his investigation of the facts .
That is what " The Thin Blue Line " did for me . "
The next morning , Doug Mulder gave a poised and self - assured courtroom performance .
As Leslie McFarlane lobbed him across - the - letters questions , Mulder , a handsome man in his late forties with a squarish face , not much of a neck , and a stocky , athletic build , effortlessly swatted them out of the ballpark .
McFarlane : " Everything that you discovered and everything that you reviewed in preparation for this case indicates Adams ' guilt , is that correct ?...
Did you find anything inconsistent with that ? "
Mulder : " Nothing that comes to mind , no . "
Schaffer , when his turn arrived , proved somewhat less ingratiating .
His gambit , for instance , went " Well , I guess today you 've returned to the scene of one of your greatest triumphs . "
Leslie McFarlane objected to the argumentative tone , and the judge agreed with her , telling Schaffer , " That 's not the way to start . "
From there on , Schaffer and Mulder duelled for more than an hour - until it was apparent that the judge had had enough and that Mulder was not going to throw up his hands and declare , " O.K. , ya got me , my legal career 's a shambles , I 'm finished in this town . "
The judge 's impatience with Schaffer belied the fact that he had already made up his mind on the basic question .
After a masterly summation by Schaffer - sufficient in its eloquence for McFarlane , when her turn came , to apologize , accurately , that her closing argument would be notably devoid of eloquence - Baraka said he was ready with his decision .
Of the thirteen grounds for relief cited in Adams ' writ , Baraka agreed on six : that Metcalfe , the original trial judge , had erroneously denied the admissibility of David Harris 's prior criminal record ; that Teresa Turko 's initial statement describing the killer had been illegally suppressed ; that , similarly , Emily Miller 's initial statement describing the killer had been illegally suppressed ; that evidence of Emily Miller 's failure to identify Adams in the police lineup and subsequent coaching by a police officer had been suppressed ; that Emily Miller had later committed perjury regarding her performance at the lineup ; and that Adams had been denied effective assistance of counsel .
It seemed that , because Baraka had rejected seven of the contentions cited in the writ , a final observation he made was designed to eliminate any remaining ambiguity : " I think over all , when we look at this trial , all the nuances that are involved , I think there 's no question that the defendant did not get a fair opportunity to a trial .
I would not go so far as to say that the defendant is innocent of this .
I would go so far as to say that if the defendant were to be retried , considering all the testimony elicited and what would be presented to the jury or a court , that more likely than not the defendant would be found not guilty . "
The ruling did not mean that Adams was now at liberty to walk out of the courtroom ; it meant that one judge officially believed that Adams had yet to receive a fair trial .
As a I practical matter , Baraka 's recommendation could languish with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for months before a final ruling came down .
And the court could , of course , reject Baraka 's recommendation .
Imminent freedom for Adams , in other words , was by no means a foregone conclusion .
Knowing that Baraka lacked the authority to grant Adams bail in the meantime , Schaffer asked for it anyway , and the motion was denied .
On that note , the hearing ended .
There was applause , and a call for order from the court officers , and then the television and newspaper people were ready with their questions .
Adams , seated in a wooden armchair and still wearing handcuffs and leg irons , said he felt " numb " - the same word he had used in " The Thin Blue Line " to describe his frame of mind when , twelve years earlier , he heard himself sentenced to death .
A woman with a microphone asked Adams if he had anything to say to David Harris .
No , he did not .
A reporter from Newsday asked , " Do you think you 'd be here today if it had n't been for Errol Morris ? "
" Without the facts that came from the movie , no , I would n't be here in this courtroom today .
We needed the facts , and the film helped .
It helped immensely . "
Roughly the same question was directed to Schaffer , who was standing nearby : " Do you consider that if the file that Errol Morris got out of Mr. Wade 's office had not been found , we'd be here ? "
In his summation , Schaffer had belittled the Dallas District Attorney , saying , " They 'll give their file to a moviemaker , because he 'll go out and make a movie and they 'll be famous , but they wo n't give it to a defense attorney . "
Elaborating , he now said , " No , if Errol had not decided on his own that this was a story worth telling , Randall Adams would have been buried forever .
Yes , that was the linchpin . "
Mildred Adams , between bouts of crying for joy and kissing Morris and Schaffer and any willing members of the press , said she hoped people would remember Robert Wood and his family in their prayers .
When the excitement had lasted close to half an hour , Morris suggested to Mrs.
Adams that she and her daughters and sisters and brothers - in - law should join him for champagne at the Adolphus Hotel .
" Did I tell you what Randall Adams said to me about my movie ? "
Morris asked me as we headed for the hotel , a few blocks east of the courthouse .
" He told me another inmate asked him , ' How come your case is being argued in the entertainment section of the newspaper ? '
And you know what Randall 's response was ?
He said , ' I 'll argue my case anywhere I can , any way I can . ' "
" The Thin Blue Line " made dozens of critics ' lists of the ten best films of 1988 ; according to a survey by the Washington Post , in fact , it turned up on more fen - best lists than any other film .
Both the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics chose it as best documentary of 1988 .
An Academy Award nomination is highly likely .
Although its box - office receipts have not extended into the " Roger Rabbit " or " Crocodile Dundee II " vicinity - at the end of the year , it was playing in fifteen theatres around the country - Morris no longer faces the prospect that he will soon again be working as a private detective or dodging collection agencies .
Immediately before the writ hearing in Dallas , he was in Italy , where " The Thin Blue Line " was shown at a festival in Florence .
On the same trip , he made stops in London - where he screened it for some people from the London Film Festival - and in Munich , where he met with Reinhold Messner , the legendary Alpine climber and the first man to have scaled all fourteen eight - thousand - metre peaks on earth ( including Mt. Everest without oxygen ) .
Messner was planning an ascent of Cerro del Toro , in Chile , and he wanted Morris - who happens to be an experienced rock climber - to accompany him and make a film .
" I 'm thinking of doing it , " Morris said , in Dallas .
" Messner 's a terrifically interesting person .
He told me he 's been doing a lot of walking recently .
You or I might assume he meant he was taking long strolls in his neighborhood .
What he actually meant was that he had just walked across Tibet .
And he 's planning to walk across Antarctica .
He told me some interesting stuff about meeting the yeti - know , the abominable snowman .
He 's seen two - the red yeti and the black yeti .
Messner was very reassuring .
He said , ' The only thing you really have to be scared of is when you hear the black yeti whistling - whistling through his nose . ' "
Heading off to South America with Messner would mean delaying a couple of other projects that Morris was eager to carry forward .
He still had plans to complete " Dr. Death " - the movie he had intended to make before the Randall Adams case sidetracked him .
He also hoped to direct " The Trial of King Boots , " a feature - length examination of how an Old English sheepdog named King Boots - the most highly decorated performer in the annals of show - dog competition - became the only canine in Michigan history to be prosecuted , in effect , for homicide .
Morris already had a vision of what the film 's publicity posters would say : " Only Two People Know What Happened .
One Is Dead .
The Other Is a Dog . "
If Morris could find the time to finish " Dr. Death , " he might at last tie together an odd melange of material : interviews with Dr. Grigson himself ; action shots of a lion tamer ; scenes from lab research on a mammal called the African naked mole rat ; archival footage from an Edison silent film called " Electrocuting an Elephant " ; and a meditation on Zoar , an extinct Utopian community in Ohio .
After a previous trip to Europe , Morris had told me with satisfaction about finding the right music to accompany the Zoar material .
" It 's called ' Yodeler Messen , ' " he said .
" I 'd been hearing this stuff on the radio in Zurich , and then I went into a record store and asked whether they had any liturgical yodelling .
They came up with ' Yodeler Messen . '
It 's , like , based on the idea that God might be hard of hearing . "
One afternoon , in his office near Times Square , Morris patiently tried to walk me through the connections between the elements that would compose " Dr. Death , " an exercise that struck me as analogous to a journey along the scenic route from the right side of his brain to the left .
He told me that his fascination with Dr. Grigson 's disturbing theories of sociopathy and recidivism had aroused an interest in lion taming , and that in 1985 this led him to the eponymous ringleader of a circus act called Dave Hoover 's Wild Animals .
Of the three basic schools of lion taming - what Morris delineated as " the persuasive , mutual - respect school , the behaviorist school , and the chairs - whips - guns school " - Hoover subscribed to the third .
Having filmed Hoover at work for several hours - the soundtrack consists mainly of scary roaring noises and the determined voice of Hoover saying , again and again , " Bongo ! Come !
Come to Daddy !
Bad girl !
Caesar !
Get home , Caesar !
Good boy ! " - Morris was uncertain what to do with the footage .
" After I 'd looked at this stuff awhile , I decided , Oh , no , I can't use this .
It 's too goofy , " Morris said .
" Then I got interested in the mole rats .
What 's the connection between the lion tamer and the mole rats ?
I do n't know if there even is one .
Mole rats spend their entire lives digging tunnels .
They have a rigid social system .
They 're like wasps or bees - there 's a queen and workers .
Mole rats dig at random , looking for tubers .
Maybe they find a tuber , or maybe they do n't .
They just dig away .
At one point I had thought the mole rats addressed the Utopian ideal of what it would be like if there were no crime or criminals , if you could say hello to your neighbor and your neighbor would say hello in return and we'd all be assured that no one would attack us with an axe .
Is aggression innate in mammals ?
Well , supposedly not in mole rats .
The mole rat was thought to be the only mammal that lives in harmony with its fellow - mammals , its fellow mole rats .
The only .
But it turns out that mole rats are nonviolent only under certain circumstances - that , in fact , they can be really nasty critters after all , who at times really do seem to hate one another .
When one colony of mole rats meets another , they can be extremely vicious .
Anyway , that was my original idea - Dr. Grigson , lion tamers , mole rats .
I then decided to add to this compote ' Electrocuting an Elephant ' - which was , if anything , a miscarriage - of - justice story . "
When it became clear that I was unfamiliar with the once popular habit - practiced during the first half of this century - of systematically executing " bad " elephants , Morris eagerly took a book from a shelf next to his desk and handed it to me .
It was a prolifically illustrated memoir titled " I Loved Rogues , " by George ( Slim ) Lewis and Byron Fish .
Lewis was a passionate lover of elephants who spent most of his working life in the employ of zoos and circuses , and Fish was a newspaperman whose interest in elephants was that of an involved amateur .
The book had chapter titles like " They Are Not House Pets " and " Ziggy Tries to Kill Me " and " How to Feed and Water Your Elephant . "
The foreword included a reproduction of a painting labelled " George Lewis and Tusko " - Tusko being a vast bull elephant who came close to being executed for doing something deemed bad .
A photograph on the facing page , captioned " Byron Fish painting Wide Awake , " showed Fish perched on an elephant 's shoulder , giving the animal a cosmetic treatment with a bucket of oil made from horse fat .
The phone rang .
While Morris took the call , I wrote down some more interesting captions and passages :
" Occasionally the victim of an elephant 's attack is a man who was hated for reasons of the elephant 's own " ( p.29 ) .
" Black Diamond seemed to know that he was taking his last walk " ( p.47 ) .
" After 170 shots by the firing squad , Diamond finally goes down " ( p. 48 ) .
" Joe Metcalf was another man Slim often met in his travels .
The man with his head in the elephant 's mouth was Alonzo Dever " ( p. 62 ) .
" Is n't that a wonderful book ? "
Morris said after he hung up .
" I 'd very much like to show you ' Electrocuting an Elephant . '
This elephant , Topsy , was , if anything , a good elephant rather than a bad elephant .
Topsy was being electrocuted because , as I understand it , some guy was smoking a cigarette and gave the cigarette to Topsy , burning the tip of her trunk .
Now , the tip of an elephant 's trunk is the most sensitive part of an elephant .
Topsy picked this guy up , tossed him in the air a couple of times , and hurled him onto concrete .
I ask you : Does Topsy deserve the juice for this ?
The film of Topsy 's electrocution is a 1903 Edison short - one of the first times electricity was used in capital punishment .
And , coincidentally , the equipment malfunctioned and the person who pulled the switch almost electrocuted himself while he was electrocuting Topsy . "
Morris paused .
We could hear the traffic on Broadway , two floors below , and from the editing room , ten feet away , we could hear a litany of " Come , Bongo ! " s and " Home , Caesar ! "s .
" My favorite line in ' Dr. Death , ' I think , will be when the last living Zoarite is quoted as saying , ' Think of it - all those religions .
They can't all be right .
But they could all be wrong , ' " Morris said .
He looked down at his hands , massaged the tips of his little fingers - a characteristic tic - and then looked up , smiling his asymmetrical smile .
" My two remaining ambitions are to have my picture hung up in my local Chinese restaurant and to have a sandwich named after me at the Stage Deli .
And I guess I 'll still keep making films .
I always felt film was a good medium for me to work in , because if you do n't finish , the level of embarrassment is so high . "
Over the years , computers have changed the way we live !
Marketing and Technology have recently started to " merge " together to create new amazing experiences .
Howeverm
In order to get us to where we are today , many software development and hardware companies have pushed the envelope to create what we use today .
Software development companies have evolved , Hardware has improved .
Although we currently live in an age of amazing hardware and software achievements , these products did not come without a price .
Below is a list of some of the worst flops in computer history .
The Xerox Alto
Developed in 1972 at Xerox 's Palo Alto Research center , the Alto had a bitmap display , windows , drop - down menu bars , a mouse , built - in Ethernet and hard disk , keyboard , word processor and more in their software productivity suite , a paint application , and even e-mail .
Xerox was far too busy fighting the copier patent war , and was not interested .
Steve Jobs was , and in 1984 , Apple introduced Apple Lisa , and the Apple Macintosh .
Although this was the most ingenious creation of the time , quite possibly responsible for the way we use computers today , it should be viewed also as a huge flop when Xerox did not capitalize on its innovation .
NeXT computer
This seemed like a great idea at the time .
Steve Jobs resigned from Apple back in 1985 to start a new company called NeXT .
The NeXT computer would be the most affordable UNIX super computer of its time .
Running a Motorola 33 - MHz 68030 processor , enclosed in a black case , there was no doubt this was the hottest and most powerful computer of its time .
However at $ 6,000 apiece , and with no software that would run on the machine , it was really a $ 6,000 brick .
Roughly 50,000 were ever produced .
The company had spent over $ 250 million producing them .
Although a huge disaster , this was also the computer that Tim Berners - Lee would later use to create the World Wide Web , and Steve Jobs would use as the core principles behind the new OS X. IBM PCjr
IBM was trying to build an affordable machine for the classroom and the masses .
Unfortunately , they ended up building an inferior non IBM - PC compatible machine with a ridiculously small keyboard that would n't run any software .
The costs was a few dollars less than some IBM - PC compatible clones , so it was pointless to buy one .
Another nice feature , the keyboard communicated with the computer via infrared beams .
This provided hours of enjoyment in the classroom screwing up other peoples computing .
Apple Newton
Although produced for six years , it was never as successful as Apple had hoped .
The main reasons : High price , Large size .
It 's handwriting recognition was notoriously bad , a problem that was featured in the Doonesbury comic strip .
However , although the Newton product itself never made mass appeal , the technologies that were developed for the Newton are still used today and responsible for many huge success ' for Apple ( iPod , OS X ) and started the PDA line of computer products .
Apple 3
Released in 1980 , the Apple 3 became one of the worst computers ever built and most expensive .
It was designed for the high end business market , but at a cost of $ 7,800 , even businesses had trouble justifying the cost .
To make matters worse , the computer was made far too cramped with parts to make it smaller .
When it became too hot inside the computer ( Engineers opted to not use a fan ) , chips would start popping out of the boards !
In order to correct the issue , Apple tech support could be heard saying " please lift up your Apple 3 about 10 centimeters off the desk , and drop it . " this would put the chips back in the slots sometimes .
Apple Lisa
How much to get into an amazing Apple Lisa ?
$ 10,000 dollars .
Announced in 1983 , this was a complete disaster for Apple .
Hardly any were ever sold .
How many were produced ?
100,000 .
The machine itself was far from powerful , and Apple users simply preferred the Macintosh .
The development costs are n't to be found .
Microsoft Windows ME
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition was touted as the first operating system to support Universal Plug and Play .
Unfortunately , this operating systems was quite possibly less compatible with hardware , than its predecessor , Windows 98 .
It was also notoriously difficult to re-install , which was terrible since this operating system needed to be re-installed almost weekly .
This was one of the worst software development projects of all time for Microsoft .
Hardcore users claimed that Windows ME was more stable than 98 , or 98SE , and the instabilities came from users installing bad drivers that were not approved and certified .
Nevertheless , most users of Windows were beginners , and thus the perception that Windows ME actually stood for " Microsoft Experiment " , " Moron Edition " , " Mistake Edition " , and " Memory Eater " .
Microsoft Bob
Another Software development disaster .
This one is great .
In 1995 Microsoft released a software package and interface that was aimed at replacing the Windows desktop with one aimed at novice computer users .
The interface featured a big yellow smiley face with glasses and virtual rooms .
Complete disaster !
Far too simple , not powerful enough , overpriced , and all and all , ridiculous .
This software development project was run by Bill 's wife by the way !
It was replaced that same year by Windows 95 .
IBM OS /2
In the 1990's after feeling " Had " by Microsoft , IBM decided they could trounce Microsoft and come up with their own operating system .
A great idea gone bad by marketing , the idea became to market OS / 2 and the PowerPC Chip together .
Had IBM pushed OS / 2 , and later OS / 2 Warp as an operating system alternative to Windows , the computing landscape might have been different today .
Instead , by the latter half of the 1990's , Windows 95 and 98 had obliterated OS / 2 . Gary Kildall's CP /M
Grab a cup of coffee for the biggest mistake , and largest computing stroke of luck that created Microsoft , and one of the wealthiest fortunes the planet has ever seen .
This one created the software industry as we know it !
In 1980 , IBM finally realized they needed to put a home computer out on the market extremely fast .
However they could not find the time to wait around to build their own operating system .
They wanted to buy one , and the best one at the time , Gary Kildall 's CP / M operating system .
Where was Gary Kildall on this fateful day that the IBM suits came knocking ?
Out of office flying a private plane .
IBM went back to the office 's and looked up Microsoft , which they thought had a broad license to sell CP / M .
Microsoft came in and negotiated a per licenses model to sell the operating system at 50 dollars per machine .
Bill Gates had created the Software Licensing Industry !
Microsoft did not have such an operating system themselves , nor did they have a license to sell CP / M .
In fact , Gary Kildall 's Digital Research did n't have CP / M ready to run on the 16 - bit computers IBM would manufacture .
Tim Patterson did at the Seattle Computer Company , which Microsoft bought for $ 50,000 .
Had Gary Kildall been at the office , Microsoft and Bill Gates might have been eating macaroni and cheese , and the Digital Research operating system would be running on all of our computers .
Gary Kildall died in July 1994 at the age of 52 .
The computer media mainly ignored his passing .
What do all of these stories have in common ?
Yes they were all mistakes ( at the time ) , but almost all of them paved the way for some of the largest success 's in computing history .
Sometimes for the same company , sometimes for other companies .
The lesson here is persistence , determination , and perseverance .

Charles Darwin would undoubtedly be both pleased and chagrined .
The famous scientist would be pleased because a study published online this week provides the first clear evidence that natural selection , his favored mechanism of evolution , drives the process of species formation in a wide variety of plants and animals .
But he would be chagrined because it has taken nearly 150 years to do so .
What Darwin did in his revolutionary treatise , “ On the Origin of Species , ” was to explain how much of the extraordinary variety of biological traits possessed by plants and animals arises from a single process , natural selection .
Since then a large number of studies and observations have supported and extended his original work .
However , linking natural selection to the origin of the 30 to 100 million different species estimated to inhabit the earth , has proven considerably more elusive .
In the last 20 years , studies of a number of specific species have demonstrated that natural selection can cause sub-populations to adapt to new environments in ways that reduce their ability to interbreed , an essential first step in the formation of a new species .
However , biologists have not known whether these cases represent special exceptions or illustrate a general rule .
The new study – published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – provides empirical support for the proposition that natural selection is a general force behind the formation of new species by analyzing the relationship between natural selection and the ability to interbreed in hundreds of different organisms – ranging from plants through insects , fish , frogs and birds – and finding that the overall link between them is positive .
“ This helps fill a big gap that has existed in evolutionary studies , ” says Daniel Funk , assistant professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University .
He authored the study with Patrik Nosil from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and William J. Etges from the University of Arkansas .
“ We have known for some time that when species invade a new environment or ecological niche , a common result is the formation of a great diversity of new species .
However , we have n’t really understood how or whether the process of adaptation generally drives this pattern of species diversification . ”
The specific question that Funk and his colleagues set out to answer is whether there is a positive link between the degree of adaptation to different environments by closely related groups and the extent to which they can interbreed , what biologists call reproductive isolation .
Funk and his colleagues saw a way to address this question by extending a method pioneered by two scientists in a now classic study of species formation in fruit flies published in 1989 .
The original method measured the way in which reproductive isolation varies with time .
It proved to be very powerful and a number of other researchers applied it to additional species .
Funk and his colleagues realized that if they used the results of these studies and added an ecological dimension then they would have an approach capable of measuring the link between natural selection and reproductive isolation .
“ We thought that the idea itself was important , that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question , ” says Funk , “ but we thought that there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results . ”
The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data .
“ There are all these species out there and so few of them are known in intimate detail , so any kind of ecological characterization , through no fault of ecologists , will be limited in accuracy and precision , ” Funk says .
Nevertheless , the researchers decided to do the best they could with the information available .
So they collected information from the published literature on three basic ecological variables : habitat , diet and size .
Then they used this information to calculate the differences in ecological adaptation between the hundreds of pairs of related species in the original studies .
When they compared these differences in adaptation with the degree of reproductive isolation for each pair and then added them up , the researchers found that the overall association was positive with a surprisingly high level of confidence :
The odds that the association is simply due to chance are only one in 250 , substantially higher than the standard confidence level of one chance in 20 that scientists demand .
“ The fact that the association is statistically significant despite the crudeness of our estimates suggests that the true biological association is very strong , ” Funk says .
“ Darwin ’s famous book was called ‘ On the Origin of Species , ’ but it was really about natural selection on traits rather than species formation .
Since our study suggests that natural selection is a general cause of species formation , it seems that Darwin chose an appropriate title after all . ”

How to be the perfect CEO
MANY business books assume that potential leaders are a blank canvas onto which must be hurled a particular set of habits and characteristics in order to form the perfect chief executive of the future .
Others assume that to become a better boss executives need do no more than ape other corporate high - flyers or draw inspiration from leaders in other walks of life .
In this vein , for example , there is the Jack Welch model and the Richard Branson model .
Military commanders are a favourite — military metaphors still abound in the corporate world — and Napoleon and Alexander feature frequently .
Alexander 's record on globalisation , however , is the more appealing in the current business climate .
Failure to make it in Moscow and being offshored on St Helena are not to be found on the CVs of potential business leaders of today .
Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones , two British academics , eschew the notion that effective bosses can be constructed piecemeal .
Their implicit message is that bosses are born , or at least made before they delve into books on management .
Rather than suggesting that high - quality leaders can be constructed from what they dismiss as an “ amalgam of traits ” , they stress that there are “ no universal leadership characteristics ” .
The talent that the pair thinks most vital is “ authenticity ” .
After 25 years spent observing well - regarded chief executives and good managers further down the ladder , the authors conclude that those who are true to characteristics they already possess make the best bosses .
Their message to the aspiring high - flyer is “ be yourself ” , have a lot of self - knowledge and be comfortable with who you are .
Identikit executives hiding behind the latest management fad , ambitious role players , time - servers and office politicians may manage to creep to the top .
But Messrs Jones and Goffee insist that those they seek to lead will soon find them out .
Authenticity cannot be faked , they say , and a little eccentricity wo n't hurt either .
The authors approvingly cite Mr Branson 's casual style and endearing difference from the norm that his followers appreciate .
Displaying other differences , foibles or even shortcomings , they say , adds to the authenticity , and they give examples of the kinds of differences that bosses should exude .
When CEO of Unilever , Niall FitzGerald gave free vent to his Irishness ; Franz Humer 's passion was on display for all to see at Roche ; and the BBC revelled in Greg Dyke 's “ blokeishness ” .
The authors do concede that there are techniques which can improve leadership .
Some characteristics work better than others , so play these up .
But they warn against phoney sincerity , and ( perhaps surprisingly ) they advocate displays of weakness .
Mr Dyke had a notoriously bad temper ; Alain Levy of PolyGram could be blunt and emotional .
Appear human and your leadership will seem more attractive .
The authors go on to make some fairly obvious points that the truly authentic and self - aware could probably work out for themselves : be conscious of how well you read situations ( and try to get better ) ; conform ( but not too much ) ; get close to your underlings ( but not too close ) ; and communicate authentically too .
Are you better on e-mail or face - to - face ?
They cite Mr Welch 's use of experiences from his boyhood in his communiqués as a way of conveying authenticity .
They suggest trying a little humour — which is surely not a good idea if you are not authentically funny .
It is a shame that the British authors offer many more examples from Europe than they do from America .
The reader is left wondering whether revealing eccentricities in a land where conformity is more highly prized ( and weaknesses where capitalism is reddest in tooth and claw ) would meet with less success .
Wal - Mart , Microsoft and other hugely successful American companies have been led by rather unexceptional people with little sense of humour .
Readers looking for detailed and specific advice on being a good manager may feel that the authors ' message is a little too vague .
Managers who are unpleasant by nature may also want to try another approach .
That said , “ be yourself ” is doubtless good advice for anyone yearning to lead hundreds and thousands of employees .
Or indeed anyone merely wishing to lead a happy life .
This guy must really hate Paris , otherwise he would n’t make all of this effort for nothing .

Often when unexpected errors first occur , I ’ve found problems in the way the error is handled .
This is n’t surprising : error handling code is often the least - exercised part of your system , so it ’s natural that there are bugs in it .
It is important to fix the error handling problems first , then the original error .
Sometimes there is a whole chaing of problems started by the original error condition , then compounded as layers of error handling code mis-handle the condition .
Fix all the problems , backwards .
Error handling code
In any program , there will be code specifically designed to handle unusual situations , whether they be errors , exceptions , failed assertions , edge conditions , odd input , whatever .
The important thing about this “ anomaly code ” is that it is not often executed , making it a good hiding place for bugs .
Often it can be difficult to test : how can you make sure there ’s a bad block in a disk file to test your error handling logic ?
Estimates vary about what fraction of a large program is devoted to error handling , especially when different error handling techniques ( status codes vs. exceptions , for instance ) are taken into account .
I think five to ten percent is a reasonable estimate in a large well - developed application .
That ’s a good slice of code that does n’t get regularly tested .
Fix error handling first
When a problem occurs in your application , always check first that the error was handled appropriately .
If it was n’t , always fix the handling code first .
Always fix error handling before fixing errors .
This rule is like the airline rule of putting an oxygen mask on yourself before putting one on your child .
There are a few reasons for insisting on this order of work :
With the original error in place , you have a perfect test case for the bug in your error handling code .
Once you fix the original problem , how will you test the error handling ?
Remember , one of the reasons there was a bug there in the first place is that it is hard to test it .
Once the original problem is fixed , the urgency for fixing the error handling code is gone .
You can say you ’ll get to it , but what ’s the rush ?
You ’ll be like the guy with the leaky roof .
When it ’s raining , he ca n’t fix it because it ’s raining out , and when it is n’t raining , there ’s no leak !
Cascading errors
In complex systems , we might be talking here about a whole chain of hidden bugs , all hidden until one problem triggers them , displaying them to you all at once .
When that happens , analyze the chain , understand what went wrong at each step , and then fix the problems backwards .
Fix a chain of bugs backwards , from last observed problem back to the original cause .
This is the general statement of my original rule .
In each cause - and - effect pair , do n’t fix the cause until the effect is correct .
With a chain , the only effect you can fix first is the last one , because every other one is another effect ’s cause .

No handler for failed assertion
4 [ trace ]
Prefs lookup : cache for is empty
5 [ trace ]
Querying full user info ...
6 [ trace ]
User using skin
The first thing wrong here is at line 2 , where a critical error occurs : a failed assertion .
The programmer thought it was impossible to have an empty string for a user id .
He was wrong .
If it happens , it must be possible .
In the real bug this is based on , the cause was another server that was unavailable , but it does n’t matter : clearly somehow the user id was an empty string , so an assertion is the wrong way to deal with it .
Bug 1 .
At line 3 , we see that the assertion infrastructure is not properly initialized , and there is no handler for failed assertions , so it is ignored .
Bug 2 .
At line 4 , the preferences cache is being asked for information about the user , using the empty string as an id , and the cache is trying to find the user ( see the double space in the phrase “ cache for is empty ” ?
That ’s the empty user id in that message ) .
The cache should know enough not to accept an empty string as a user id .
Bug 3 .
At line 5 , the user ’s full information is queried , and at line 6 , the results of the user query are back , and they are n’t good .
Not only has the user database gladly accepted an empty string as a user id , but it has returned empty strings back as the results .
The log message here has two cases of double - space , showing the two places where empty strings are being used as words .
Bug 4 .
The wrong way to fix it
In this example , the simple thing to do is to find the server that was down , bring it back up and try again .
The server will be available , the user id will be properly retrieved , it will find real results in the cache and the database , and all will be well .
Right ?
Wrong .
You wo n’t have fixed any bugs — our first bug was n’t that the server was down , it was that we mis-handled the server being down .
The next time the server is unavailable , everything will go wrong again .
The right way to fix it
Work backwards , starting with the last problem .
Fix the database so that it detects bogus ids , and returns some sort of error .
Run the application again , and see that bugs 1 through 3 still happen , but number 4 has been fixed .
Work on bug 3 : fix the cache so that it detects bogus ids , and returns some sort of error ( perhaps throwing an exception ) .
Run the app again , and see that bugs 1 and 2 still happen , but number 3 has been fixed .
Notice that at this point , you ca n’t tell if bug 4 is fixed or not : the bogus user id never gets to the database , so it never gets a chance to show that it can detect it .
This is why we had to fix ( and test ! ) bug 4 first .
Bug 4 only happens when bugs 1 through 3 are still in the system .
Fix bug 2 : make sure the assertion handler is properly initialized , or make sure that if it is not , something dramatic ( like a dialog box or a thrown exception ) happens .
Fix bug 1 : do n’t assert that the user id ca n’t be the empty string .
Clearly it can .
Throw an exception instead .
Now that all four of the bugs are fixed , you can do something about the real problem : the application did n’t handle an unavailable server well .
There ’s tons of ways to deal with this ( retries , fail over , caches , redundant sources ) , but that ’s off the topic .
Putting it into practice
Working strictly backward like this can be difficult .
For one thing , the four bugs could have ended up with different developers , and coordinating their efforts to be sure the bugs were fixed ( and tested ) in reverse order would have been too constraining .
( In the real bugs my example was based on , the four bugs were handled by three different developers ) .
You may be under time pressure , and do n’t have the luxury of fixing all four bugs in turn .
The boss is screaming for the system to start working again , and wo n’t want to hear about some “ theoretical ” improvement .
As far as he ’s concerned , everything ’s broken until the system is running again .
Some people would even argue that fixing all four bugs was unnecessary .
Consider bug 4 .
Once the database client is fixed so that it never requests data about the empty user id , why does it matter what the database server does with an empty user id ?
So it ’s not a bug any more , right ?
In the real world , there are all sorts of constraints and pressures ( time , ownership , expertise , etc ) that may convince you not to fix bugs .
I understand that — we all have to ship product , and we ’re all only human .
But the fact remains that bug 4 was a real bug .
It may be latent , it may be hard to fix , it may be expedient not to fix it , but let ’s not kid ourselves : it is a bug .
A bug you ca n’t see is still a bug .
Fixing code is easiest when you can run it , and error handling code is only run when there are errors happening for it to handle .
Broken error handling code is just a future mysterious accident waiting to happen .
Fix error handling code before fixing errors .

US military and Iraqi deaths soar amidst preparations for major offensive
By Joe Kay
19 October 2006
Ten US troops died on Tuesday in Iraq and at least one more on Wednesday , bringing the monthly death toll for October up to 70 .
At the current rate , US casualties for the month will be the highest since November 2004 , and the third highest since the invasion in March 2003 .
The latest surge in casualties brings the total US death toll to at least 2,786 .
The increased death rate comes as the American military has stepped up efforts to repress the Iraqi insurgency , particularly the Shiite population in the capital .
Five of the fatalities from Tuesday and Wednesday were in or around Baghdad , including five soldiers killed in two separate roadside bombs , and another killed by gunfire .
Other deaths took place in Diyala , north of the capital , and in the predominantly Sunni Anbar province in western Iraq .
Iraqi deaths are also up sharply , including those killed by occupation forces and those killed in escalating sectarian violence .
According to an Associated Press count , which certainly underestimates the number of Iraqi deaths , 767 Iraqis have been killed in war - related violence so far this month , or 45 per day .
At the current rate , October will be the deadliest month since the AP began keeping count in April 2005 .
Most Iraqi deaths , however , go unreported and therefore would not be included in the AP figures .
A report released earlier this month — published in the British medical journal Lancet and produced by a team at Johns Hopkins University — estimated that 600,000 Iraqis have been killed in war - related violence since March 2003 , which would amount to about 500 every day .
The Lancet report also found that the number of deaths has been steadily increasing , meaning that the current mortality rate is likely to be much higher than this number .
This carnage is a product of an escalating US warfare with Iraqi resistance fighters , combined with increasingly sharp divisions within rival factions of the Iraqi elite , which is taking the form of sectarian killings .
In Balad , a city north of Baghdad , 100 Iraqis were killed or disappeared over the weekend , amidst execution - style killings .
The violence began on Friday , when 19 Shiites were abducted and beheaded .
This was followed by apparently arbitrary reprisals by Shiite militias against Sunni Muslims .
At the same time , the US military is preparing to move sharply against Shiite militias , which could produce a bloodbath far greater than the current level of violence .
The Bush administration is pressuring the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki to support a major assault on the Shiite militia of Moqtada al - Sadr .
These preparations , and Maliki ’s reservations , were revealed in an interview Maliki gave to USA Today on Friday .
The newspaper reported that Maliki “ has rejected US plans to launch large - scale operations in Sadr City , a Baghdad slum and stronghold ” of Sadr ’s Mahdi Army .
“ We have told the Americans that we do n’t mind targeting a Mahdi Army cell inside Sadr City , ” Maliki said .
“ But the way the multinational forces are thinking of confronting this issue will destroy an entire neighborhood . ”
Maliki ’s comments are significant for what they reveal about American plans to “ destroy an entire neighborhood . ”
Such an operation would parallel previous attempts to gain control of predominantly Sunni areas such as Fallujah by leveling an entire city and decimating its population .
While they have not been revealed publicly , these plans are clearly known to Maliki and preparations to implement them have already begun .
There is a truly criminal character to this entire enterprise , which has produced an unimaginable catastrophe for the Iraqi people and a tragic squandering of lives of American soldiers .
Over three - and - a - half years after the invasion , the American military is still attempting to secure its control over the population and natural resources of Iraq through a fresh round of brutal killing .
Maliki ’s statements are also revealing of the extraordinary tensions building up between the current Iraqi government and the American occupation forces .
Maliki ’s decision to give the interview was clearly calculated to warn the American government against what he considers to be a disastrous policy , one that will undermine his own base of power and likely lead to his replacement by someone not so closely tied to the Shiite militias .
The Bush administration and sections of the US military now see the Shiite militias , particularly the organization headed by cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , as the principal obstacle to establishing a government in Iraq that will carry out the demands of the occupying forces .
While he has collaborated with the occupation and supported the Maliki government , Sadr ’s base of support is among impoverished and working class layers of the Shiite population who are intensely opposed to the American military presence .
The demands from Washington are creating enormous problems for Maliki , since Sadr controls one of the largest blocs in the Iraqi parliament supporting Maliki ’s government .
With the tacit approval of Washington , Shiite militias have been largely integrated into the state , particularly in the Interior Ministry , which includes the police apparatus .
Much of the sectarian killings have been carried out by members of the Iraqi police , or with their approval .
Now the Bush administration is shifting strategy , and demanding that Maliki follow through .
An article in the New York Times on Tuesday spelled out the current thinking within the American establishment .
Maliki , the newspaper reported , “ has come under intense American pressure to purge Iraq ’s security forces of the militias and death squads that operate within their ranks . ”
“ Another serious problem for American officials , ” the newspaper reported , “ is Mr. Maliki ’s refusal to allow a major crackdown on Mr. Sadr ’s militia , the Mahdi Army .
This has been a long - smoldering issue for the Americans , who faced two uprisings by the Shiite militia in April and August 2004 , only to have Mr. Sadr escape outright defeat when Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the most powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq , intervened , allowing Mr. Sadr to keep large parts of his militia intact . ”
These background comments by American officials to the Times were no doubt intended in part as a response to Maliki ’s earlier interview with USA Today .
Pressure on Maliki has resulted in his decision to remove two top officials in the Special Police , both Shiites .
Also on Tuesday , in another sign of increasing tensions , American forces arrested a top aide to Sadr , Sheik Mazin al - Saedi , who is described by the Times as “ the head of Mr. Sadr ’s office in the poor Shiite neighborhood of Shuala ” in Baghdad .
Saedi was released on Wednesday after protests from Maliki and discussions between the prime minister , Sistani and Sadr .
The escalating crisis in Iraq , and the American government ’s reaction , makes a mockery of Iraqi “ democracy , ” which has never been anything more than a means through which the occupying forces have sought to solidify their control .
Sadr ’s organization currently holds 30 seats in the parliament , as well as several cabinet posts .
It gained these posts in the much - touted “ democratic ” elections in 2005 .
However , this has not stopped American forces from talking openly about destroying the organization .
There are also growing signs that the US is preparing an open breach with Maliki and his replacement by some sort of military junta or “ strongman ” to carry out US demands .
There is some indication that the US might turn again to former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi , who returned to Iraq this week for the first time in months .
While head of the “ Iraqi Interim Government ” from May 2004 to April 2005 , Allawi supported the American assault on Fallujah and Najaf .
While in exile after breaking with Saddam Hussein , he spent many years on the CIA ’s payroll .
Debates within the American ruling elite over what to do about the Iraq occupation are being carried out largely behind the backs of the American population .
While it is broadly acknowledged within the government and policy think tanks that a major shift is necessary — including a crackdown on Shiite insurgents — a final move is being deliberately put off until after the November elections , now three weeks away .
There is , once again , a deliberate attempt to exclude opposition to the Iraq occupation from the framework of political debate , under conditions in which the war is extremely unpopular .
A recent CNN poll , conducted over the weekend , found that 64 percent of the US population opposes the war in Iraq .
This conspiracy against the American and Iraqi people has been carried out with the complicity of both the Democrats and Republicans .
The entire political establishment in the United States supports the basic premises of the Iraq occupation .
Disputes — within the Republican Party and between the Democrats and Republicans — are entirely concerned with tactical decisions on how best to defend the interests of American imperialism .
The Democratic Party is seeking to align itself with sections of the military that have long complained that the Iraq occupation has been a disaster because there are not enough troops on the ground .
A series of books written by Democratic Party figures have advocated a form of “ universal citizen service ” — a military draft in different language .
To cite one example , Rahm Emanuel , a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and Bruce Reed , president of the Democratic Leadership Council , advocate in their book The Plan a program in which all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 will engage in “ three months of basic training , civil defense preparation and community service . ”
Such a program would serve as a precursor to mandatory military service for all American youth .
These plans are being developed in response to the growing strains of the Iraq occupation , as well as plans for military intervention in Iran or North Korea .
They will mean more American youth being supplied as cannon fodder to carry out the demands of American imperialism .
TURIN , Italy , Feb .
18 - The inevitable question about 2002 was posed to Ahn Hyun Soo during a postrace news conference Saturday night :
How upset were the people of South Korea , his home country , four years ago when the American Apolo Anton Ohno was given the gold medal after South Korea 's top short - track skater , Kim Dong Sun , was disqualified ?
Just as the question was posed , Ohno walked into the room .
Ahn and his interpreter chuckled .
The interpreter turned her head and said to Ohno , " We were just talking about you . "
Ohno grinned , walked to his seat behind the table and gave
Ahn two congratulatory pats on the back .
What Ahn went on to say about 2002 was pretty much irrelevant .
The exchange had been proof enough that what happened at the Winter Games in Salt Lake City was a thing of the past .
A half - hour earlier , Ahn had put to rest any lingering controversy by proving he was the best short - track skater in the world .
He took the gold medal in the 1,000 meters at the Palavela , and his teammate Lee Ho Suk won the silver .
It was a repeat of their 1 - 2 finish in the Olympic 1,500 meters a week earlier .
Ohno took the bronze , and -- though it was not the ideal outcome -- the medal made up for his disappointing eighth - place finish in the 1,500 .
tinyapps.org / docs / Not Yours To Give
by Col. David Crockett , US Representative from Tennessee
( Published in The Life of Colonel David Crockett by Edward Sylvester Ellis , though the entire account has been called in to question .
What the critics seem to miss is that the principle is far more important than any appeal to authority or historical accuracy . )
One day in the House of Representatives , a bill was taken up appropriating money for the benefit of a widow of a distinguished naval officer .
Several beautiful speeches had been made in its support .
The Speaker was just about to put the question when Crockett arose :
" Mr. Speaker - - I have as much respect for the memory of the deceased , and as much sympathy for the sufferings of the living , if suffering there be , as any man in this House , but we must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for a part of the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living .
I will not go into an argument to prove that Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity .
Every member upon this floor knows it .
We have the right , as individuals , to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity ; but as members of Congress we have no right so to appropriate a dollar of the public money .
Some eloquent appeals have been made to us upon the ground that it is a debt due the deceased .
Mr. Speaker , the deceased lived long after the close of the war ; he was in office to the day of his death , and I have never heard that the government was in arrears to him .
Every man in this House knows it is not a debt .
We cannot , without the grossest corruption , appropriate this money as the payment of a debt .
We have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as a charity .
Mr. Speaker , I have said we have the right to give as much money of our own as we please .
I am the poorest man on this floor .
I cannot vote for this bill , but I will give one week 's pay to the object , and if every member of Congress will do the same , it will amount to more than the bill asks . "
He took his seat .
Nobody replied .
The bill was put upon its passage , and , instead of passing unanimously , as was generally supposed , and as , no doubt , it would , but for that speech , it received but few votes , and , of course , was lost .
Later , when asked by a friend why he had opposed the appropriation , Crockett gave this explanation :
" Several years ago I was one evening standing on the steps of the Capitol with some other members of Congress , when our attention was attracted by a great light over in Georgetown .
It was evidently a large fire .
We jumped into a hack and drove over as fast as we could .
In spite of all that could be done , many houses were burned and many families made homeless , and , besides , some of them had lost all but the clothes they had on .
The weather was very cold , and when I saw so many women and children suffering , I felt that something ought to be done for them .
The next morning a bill was introduced appropriating $ 20,000 for their relief .
We put aside all other business and rushed it through as soon as it could be done .
" The next summer , when it began to be time to think about the election , I concluded I would take a scout around among the boys of my district .
I had no opposition there , but , as the election was some time off , I did not know what might turn up .
When riding one day in a part of my district in which I was more of a stranger than any other , I saw a man in a field plowing and coming toward the road .
I gauged my gait so that we should meet as he came to the fence .
As he came up , I spoke to the man .
He replied politely , but , as I thought , rather coldly .
" I began : ' Well , friend , I am one of those unfortunate beings called candidates , and --'
" ' Yes , I know you ; you are Colonel Crockett , I have seen you once before , and voted for you the last time you were elected .
I suppose you are out electioneering now , but you had better not waste your time or mine .
I shall not vote for you again . '
" This was a sockdolager . . .
I begged him to tell me what was the matter .
" ' Well , Colonel , it is hardly worth - while to waste time or words upon it .
I do not see how it can be mended , but you gave a vote last winter which shows that either you have not capacity to understand the Constitution , or that you are wanting in the honesty and firmness to be guided by it .
In either case you are not the man to represent me .
But I beg your pardon for expressing it in that way .
I did not intend to avail myself of the privilege of the constituent to speak plainly to a candidate for the purpose of insulting or wounding you .
I intend by it only to say that your understanding of the Constitution is very different from mine ; and I will say to you what , but for my rudeness , I should not have said , that I believe you to be honest .
. . .
But an understanding of the Constitution different from mine I cannot overlook , because the Constitution , to be worth anything , must be held sacred , and rigidly observed in all its provisions .
The man who wields power and misinterprets it is the more dangerous the more honest he is . '
" 'I admit the truth of all you say , but there must be some mistake about it , for I do not remember that I gave any vote last winter upon any constitutional question . '
" ' No , Colonel , there 's no mistake .
Though I live here in the backwoods and seldom go from home , I take the papers from Washington and read very carefully all the proceedings of Congress .
My papers say that last winter you voted for a bill to appropriate $ 20,000 to some sufferers by a fire in Georgetown .
Is that true ?'
" ' Well , my friend ; I may as well own up .
You have got me there .
But certainly nobody will complain that a great and rich country like ours should give the insignificant sum of $ 20,000 to relieve its suffering women and children , particularly with a full and overflowing Treasury , and I am sure , if you had been there , you would have done just as I did . '
" ' It is not the amount , Colonel , that I complain of ; it is the principle .
In the first place , the government ought to have in the Treasury no more than enough for its legitimate purposes .
But that has nothing to do with the question .
The power of collecting and disbursing money at pleasure is the most dangerous power that can be intrusted to man , particularly under our system of collecting revenue by a tariff , which reaches every man in the country , no matter how poor he may be , and the poorer he is the more he pays in proportion to his means .
" ' What is worse , it presses upon him without his knowledge where the weight centers , for there is not a man in the United States who can ever guess how much he pays to the government .
So you see , that while you are contributing to relieve one , you are drawing it from thousands who are even worse off than he .
" ' If you had the right to give anything , the amount was simply a matter of discretion with you , and you had as much right to give $ 20,000,000 as $ 20,000 .
If you have the right to give to one , you have the right to give to all ; and , as the Constitution neither defines charity nor stipulates the amount , you are at liberty to give to any and everything which you may believe , or profess to believe , is a charity , and to any amount you may think proper .
You will very easily perceive what a wide door this would open for fraud and corruption and favoritism , on the one hand , and for robbing the people on the other .
No , Colonel , Congress has no right to give charity .
" ' Individual members may give as much of their own money as they please , but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose .
If twice as many houses had been burned in this county as in Georgetown , neither you nor any other member of Congress would have thought of appropriating a dollar for our relief .
There are about two hundred and forty members of Congress .
If they had shown their sympathy for the sufferers by contributing each one week 's pay , it would have made over $ 13,000 .
There are plenty of wealthy men in and around Washington who could have given $ 20,000 without depriving themselves of even a luxury of life .
" ' The congressmen chose to keep their own money , which , if reports be true , some of them spend not very creditably ; and the people about Washington , no doubt , applauded you for relieving them from the necessity of giving by giving what was not yours to give .
The people have delegated to Congress , by the Constitution , the power to do certain things .
To do these , it is authorized to collect and pay moneys , and for nothing else .
Everything beyond this is usurpation , and a violation of the Constitution .
" ' So you see , Colonel , you have violated the Constitution in what I consider a vital point .
It is a precedent fraught with danger to the country , for when Congress once begins to stretch its power beyond the limits of the Constitution , there is no limit to it , and no security for the people .
I have no doubt you acted honestly , but that does not make it any better , except as far as you are personally concerned , and you see that I can not vote for you . '
" I tell you I felt streaked .
I saw if I should have opposition , and this man should go to talking , he would set others to talking , and in that district I was a gone fawn - skin .
I could not answer him , and the fact is , I was so fully convinced that he was right , I did not want to .
But I must satisfy him , and I said to him :
" ' Well , my friend , you hit the nail upon the head when you said I had not sense enough to understand the Constitution .
I intended to be guided by it , and thought I had studied it fully .
I have heard many speeches in Congress about the powers of Congress , but what you have said here at your plow has got more hard , sound sense in it than all the fine speeches I ever heard .
If I had ever taken the view of it that you have , I would have put my head into the fire before I would have given that vote ; and if you will forgive me and vote for me again , if I ever vote for another unconstitutional law I wish I may be shot . '
" He laughingly replied : ' Yes , Colonel , you have sworn to that once before , but I will trust you again upon one condition .
You say that you are convinced that your vote was wrong .
Your acknowledgment of it will do more good than beating you for it .
If , as you go around the district , you will tell people about this vote , and that you are satisfied it was wrong , I will not only vote for you , but will do what I can to keep down opposition , and , perhaps , I may exert some little influence in that way . '
" ' If I do n't , ' said I , ' I wish I may be shot ; and to convince you that I am in earnest in what I say I will come back this way in a week or ten days , and if you will get up a gathering of the people , I will make a speech to them .
Get up a barbecue , and I will pay for it .'
" ' No , Colonel , we are not rich people in this section , but we have plenty of provisions to contribute for a barbecue , and some to spare for those who have none .
The push of crops will be over in a few days , and we can then afford a day for a barbecue .
This is Thursday ; I will see to getting it up on Saturday week .
Come to my house on Friday , and we will go together , and I promise you a very respectable crowd to see and hear you . '
" ' Well , I will be here .
But one thing more before I say good - by .
I must know your name . '
" ' My name is Bunce . '
" ' Not Horatio Bunce ? '
" ' Yes . '
" ' Well , Mr. Bunce , I never saw you before , though you say you have seen me , but I know you very well .
I am glad I have met you , and very proud that I may hope to have you for my friend . '
" It was one of the luckiest hits of my life that I met him .
He mingled but little with the public , but was widely known for his remarkable intelligence and incorruptible integrity , and for a heart brimful and running over with kindness and benevolence , which showed themselves not only in words but in acts .
He was the oracle of the whole country around him , and his fame had extended far beyond the circle of his immediate acquaintance .
Though I had never met him before , I had heard much of him , and but for this meeting it is very likely I should have had opposition , and had been beaten .
One thing is very certain , no man could now stand up in that district under such a vote .
" At the appointed time I was at his house , having told our conversation to every crowd I had met , and to every man I stayed all night with , and I found that it gave the people an interest and a confidence in me stronger than I had every seen manifested before .
" Though I was considerably fatigued when I reached his house , and , under ordinary circumstances , should have gone early to bed , I kept him up until midnight , talking about the principles and affairs of government , and got more real , true knowledge of them than I had got all my life before .
" I have known and seen much of him since , for I respect him -- no , that is not the word - - I reverence and love him more than any living man , and I go to see him two or three times every year ; and I will tell you , sir , if every one who professes to be a Christian lived and acted and enjoyed it as he does , the religion of Christ would take the world by storm .
" But to return to my story .
The next morning we went to the barbecue , and , to my surprise , found about a thousand men there .
I met a good many whom I had not known before , and they and my friend introduced me around until I had got pretty well acquainted -- at least , they all knew me .
" In due time notice was given that I would speak to them .
They gathered up around a stand that had been erected .
I opened my speech by saying :
" ' Fellow - citizens - - I present myself before you today feeling like a new man .
My eyes have lately been opened to truths which ignorance or prejudice , or both , had heretofore hidden from my view .
I feel that I can today offer you the ability to render you more valuable service than I have ever been able to render before .
I am here today more for the purpose of acknowledging my error than to seek your votes .
That I should make this acknowledgment is due to myself as well as to you .
Whether you will vote for me is a matter for your consideration only . '
" I went on to tell them about the fire and my vote for the appropriation and then told them why I was satisfied it was wrong .
I closed by saying :
" ' And now , fellow - citizens , it remains only for me to tell you that the most of the speech you have listened to with so much interest was simply a repetition of the arguments by which your neighbor , Mr. Bunce , convinced me of my error .
" ' It is the best speech I ever made in my life , but he is entitled to the credit for it .
And now I hope he is satisfied with his convert and that he will get up here and tell you so . '
" He came upon the stand and said :
" ' Fellow - citizens - - It affords me great pleasure to comply with the request of Colonel Crockett .
I have always considered him a thoroughly honest man , and I am satisfied that he will faithfully perform all that he has promised you today . '
" He went down , and there went up from that crowd such a shout for Davy Crockett as his name never called forth before .
" I am not much given to tears , but I was taken with a choking then and felt some big drops rolling down my cheeks .
And I tell you now that the remembrance of those few words spoken by such a man , and the honest , hearty shout they produced , is worth more to me than all the honors I have received and all the reputation I have ever made , or ever shall make , as a member of Congress .
" Now , sir , " concluded Crockett , " you know why I made that speech yesterday .
" There is one thing now to which I will call your attention .
You remember that I proposed to give a week 's pay .
There are in that House many very wealthy men-- men who think nothing of spending a week 's pay , or a dozen of them , for a dinner or a wine party when they have something to accomplish by it .
Some of those same men made beautiful speeches upon the great debt of gratitude which the country owed the deceased - - a debt which could not be paid by money -- and the insignificance and worthlessness of money , particularly so insignificant a sum as $ 10,000 , when weighted against the honor of the nation .
Yet not one of them responded to my proposition .
Money with them is nothing but trash when it is to come out of the people .
But it is the one great thing for which most of them are striving , and many of them sacrifice honor , integrity , and justice to obtain it . "

Do your graphics say the wrong thing ?
If a picture really is worth a thousand words , which words ?
Graphics are usually the best tool we 've got for sending a message -- instructions , sign , marketing , entertainment , interface , etc. -- but what are we doing to make sure the person viewing the image sees the message we intended ?
The picture above is a sign posted at a local trailhead .
What does it mean ?
( Getting it wrong , by the way , means a $ 50 fine . )
It 's supposed to mean , " Each human can have no more than two dogs under their control . " ( this is a leash - optional trail )
And while most people could -- after cocking their head to the side -- figure it out , I have to laugh about what else this sign says like :
" You can have a German Shepard , and an Old English Sheepdog , but SPRINGER SPANIELS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED ! "
On a trail it 's no big deal if you get it wrong or need to take a few extra moments to study it ( or read the accompanying text , if there is some ) .
But ... imagine situations where it's a lot more important -- where the consequences of misinterpretation are serious , and / or time - to - getting - it is scarce .
Or imagine a situation where the person viewing the graphic is simultaneously bombarded with so much info that even the smallest bit of cognitive overhead means trouble ...
So , what went wrong ?
How can we make it better ?
[ UPDATE : for this sign , text really WOULD work fine .
But the idea here is to practice on something simple . ]
The exercise is this : assume that for some reason you CANNOT use words , and have to convey the message that " a person can have no more than two dogs under voice / sight control ( i.e. off - leash ) .
Here 's one idea I had for and a few simple suggestions .
I 'm hoping the information and / or graphic designers will jump in to improve on or extend what I 've done ...
RECOMMENDATION :
Use only one breed of dog in the graphic .
Or better yet , use an abstract representation of a dog rather than a specific dog type .
Having three different dogs is misleading -- it makes it appear that the breed of dog matters , when the sign is about the quantity of dogs per person .
Having different dogs suggests that there 's something relevant about dog breeds ( which in some contexts is true -- some of the most aggressive breeds are banned from parts of Colorado ) .
GENERAL PRINCIPLE :
Differences in an image are interpreted as meaningful information .
If two things represent the same idea , make them the visually similar .
Conversely , if two things represent different ideas , make them different !
Examples :
User interface : if two buttons on a website are blue with round corners , they 'll be interpreted as having some common function .
If one of them is a navigation button and the other is a transaction button , there 's a problem .
API design : if two methods in two related classes have a similar naming scheme , they 'll be interpreted as performing a similar action .
One of the worst examples I can think of in J2 EE is ejbCreate ( ) method -- which means " create a new object " in Session beans , but for Entity beans , " insert a new record in the database and , oh yeah , pull an existing object from the pool ... "
It would have been easier to remember what ejbCreate ( ) does for entity beans if they 'd given it a completely different name ... even an arbitrary name ( although ejbInsert ( ) might have been nice ) .
Having two different behaviors with the same name means cognitive load because your brain wants to find the pattern between the two matching names ...
In the dog sign , using three different dog pictures / breeds introduces cognitive noise that the viewer 's brain will try to process as a meaningful distinction .
RECOMMENDATION :
Include a person in the graphic ( especially an abstract representation of a person ) .
The trailhead rule is about the relationship between dogs and people .
It 's not about the quantity of dogs -- it 's that each person cannot have more than two dogs .
GENERAL PRINCIPLE :
Include the context !
Show all relevant relationships , and if necessary , draw attention to the key concept .
Example :
In code samples in our book , rather than using code snippets , we reproduce the code in which that snippet matters , but draw attention to the key pieces by screening back the for - context - only pieces and bolding / highlighting the new or relevant piece .
RECOMMENDATION :
The sign should have an " X " through three dogs , not just one , and show that one dog is OK and two dogs are OK ( per person ) .
GENERAL PRINCIPLE :
Think about what a sign / graphic is really supposed to say - - if spoken -- and try to " say " that same thing visually , in the least confusing way .
In this case , the sign is supposed to say :
* A single individual can have one dog , or two dogs , but not three dogs .
So , the sign should show a picture of a person with one dog as OK , a person with two dogs as OK , and a person with three dogs as NOT OK .
RECOMMENDATION :
The numbers on the side , " 1 , 2 , 3 " should go away ( or be placed to the right of the dog images as reinforcement ) .
And if the numbers are used , the " 3 " should ALSO have an " X " ( or NO symbol ) through it !
In the current sign , the number " 3 " is bigger and bolder than the other numbers ( what 's up with THAT ?
And why is the " 2 " bigger than the " 1 " ?
There 's no difference between one and two dogs ... ) , but there 's nothing to indicate that " 3 " is NOT OK .
GENERAL PRINCIPLE :
Do not " say " something that is n't true .
Whatever the brain sees first is likely to stick , so any attempt to qualify or make exceptions or explain what 's on the sign in a way that conflicts with the image is a problem .
Examples :
A shop window that lists hours of operation , then lists the exception underneath :
OPEN 7 AM to 7 PM
( Sundays Noon to 5 )
In our books , we try not to show code or a process that 's wrong without putting a big ol ' warning over the top of it or right next to it .
We want the learner 's brain to see the code and the big flashing lights at the same time , processing them as one image -- the image we want to stick .
We do n't want the wrong or untrue thing to take hold in their brain , and trying to undo it with a later exception or caveat or warning does n't always work .
TWO MORE PRINCIPLES ( not related to the dog sign ) :
COLOR
Think about the implicit information conveyed by color , and exploit that ( or at least do n't violate it ) .
For example , look at the following two images -- one with the blue rectangle on top , and the other with the brown rectangle on top .
Does one of them feel a little ... off ?
Even if you do n't consciously notice it , your brain feels the difference .
We 're more used to seeing the blue sky above the brown earth , and the brain perceives cool , less saturated colors as " higher " while perceiving warmer , more saturated colors as " lower " .
Trying to convey numeric or spatial relationships using color might cause cognitive dissonance if you represent a " higher " thing using brown , and a " lower " thing using light blue .
On the other hand , you can use this hard - wired color perception to add a second layer of info to give the viewer one more chance to " get it " the way you meant it .
Because of color blindness , or problems with different displays , etc. , we try to avoid using color as the sole info channel , but color makes a nice way to add another channel that viewers will often feel rather than consciously think .
CLARITY TRUMPS STYLE :
Although the best designers can be both clear and stylish , instructors do n't always have that luxury .
My favorite worst - case example comes from ( where else ) Sun , where the graphics / editorial department " prettied up " some of the graphics from one of the technical course books .
The problem was ... the graphics they " improved " were actually UML diagrams , where just about everything in the image means something .
For example , in UML the difference between a closed and open triangle is HUGE !
But the non-technical designers thought the open triangles looked unattractive and decided to fill them in .
They also took the squares and rounded the corners and , well , if you 're a programmer , you get the idea of just how bad this was .
The " new and improved " graphics now conveyed something completely different ( or nothing at all ) than the originals .
But I 'll be damned if they did n't look nicer on the page ... ; )
[ Disclaimer - - I 'm guilty of some really bad graphics myself , both in the blog and my books , so I do n't get to be all graphicker - than - thou ]
What about you ?
Any bad signs or graphics you can point to ?
Any before - and - afters ?
Cheers !
[ I'm back but only for two more days , then I leave again for two weeks .

Do your graphics say the wrong thing ? :
Comments
Haha !
I too thought it meant something about the type of dog .
It might be more obvious in context ...
... or maybe not .
Posted by : Tiara | Jun 18 , 2006 5:41:49 PM
Heh , my first reaction was exactly what you wrote , except I do n't know my dog breeds .
Your improvement still feels a bit off .
It 's clear that three dogs are a problem , but it 's still not clear why .
Are they just spread too wide across the trail ?
Or maybe the stickwoman is allowed to have her own dog , and allowed to let her dog interact with one other dog , but not allowed to let her dog near a crowd of dogs ?
I 'm no graphic designer , but I 'd start with the stick woman , and a dog on a leash to the right , then another dog on a leash to the left , then a third dog on a leash to the right .
Posted by : Scott Reynen | Jun 18 , 2006 6:34:44 PM
Hmm .
Scott , nice idea but the leashes would complicate the design ( and the trail is leash optional ) .
Also adding to different sides does n't read effienctly .
When drawn , it looks more like a pattern puzzle , and perhaps is asking what is the correct third line - perhaps it was meant to be dog , person , dog , person .
Which is where the problem is ... it _is_ a pattern puzzle .
Hmm .
I guessed it was something about the dog , was n't sure it was the breed , maybe the last dog had fleas .
Posted by : Matt | Jun 18 , 2006 7:35:29 PM
But why is the person with the dogs a women ?
Is it because men are allowed as many dogs as they like ? :-P
Posted by : Lloyd | Jun 18 , 2006 7:35:38 PM
Man I like this blog .
Get 's you really thinking .
How do you clear away from the gender issue .
Does your new sign mean men with 3 dogs are ok .
Only kidding .
Posted by : Stephen | Jun 18 , 2006 8:35:02 PM
If you put : 1 ( checkmark ) , 2 ( checkmark ) and 3 ( big x ) next to each line , I think it becomes very clear that 1 or 2 dogs is okay , but 3 dogs is not .
Anyway , " No more than 2 dogs per person " is way faster to parse than even the improved sign .
I 'd rather have 7 words than a thousand .
Posted by : James | Jun 18 , 2006 8:46:42 PM
Just as another suggestion : maybe crunch it all down into one graphic - one figure with 3 dogs , the thrid w/ an X through it .
Ca n't it be assumed that if two dogs are OK , so is 1 ?

When I read some of these comments , I think that lots of us have lots of time in our hands !!!
Posted by : OCtavio | Jun 18 , 2006 10:03:52 PM
Maybe it 's just me , but when it comes to information to be conveyed to a general public , I see no problem whatsoever in using good old plain text to carry a complex message that can't be explained in less than four words .
Graphical symbols are good to convey simple ideas but hopeless at more complex concepts .
That 's why we have " OK " and " Cancel " symbol buttons in a GUI but we do not have one for " re-format disk and re-install Windows " .
Other than the BSOD - but that 's STILL text !
Posted by : Noons | Jun 18 , 2006 10:06:11 PM
I agree with the above commenter about the text .
Why not just have :
" More than 2 dogs per person NOT permitted "
Posted by : Eric | Jun 18 , 2006 10:16:26 PM
El problema con solamente usar el texto es que no todo al mundo hable inglés .
Which is this gringo's attempt at saying that signs are good when you can't count on everyone knowing how to read -- or read a single language .
Posted by : Jeremy Dunck | Jun 18 , 2006 11:43:19 PM
Lloyd , Stephen : I had to laugh out loud at that one !
It actually means , " People wearing DRESSES can have a maximum of two dogs . "
Scott :
The rule is actually slightly more complicated than I stated it , which makes the leash thing tricky -- the restriction applies ONLY to off - leash dogs .
You have a good point about the " why " question still sitting out there , and I did nothing to answer that .
So the sign * really * needs to say , " No more than two dogs under sight / voice control per person ( but on - leash dogs are OK .
Or at least I think ... the signs and text on that were n't clear either ! )
Jake : I thought about that , and was on the fence .
I was n't 100 % sure it said it all , but if it does , then your way would be much better .
Everyone who said , " just use text " :
1 ) That was not the exercise ; )
I should have been more explicit in saying , " assume that for some reason you CANNOT use words ... "
The point is to practice with something simple ...
2 ) Most of us do n't have the problem of using graphics when words will do just fine .
In the tech world , we use FAR too many words when graphics would be 1,000 times better for quicker and more accurate grokking , retention , and recall .
3 ) In this particular sign , using text is n't the best because the sign is meant to be read from a distance , and people would have to physically leave the trail and walk to where it 's posted to read the text ( unless the sign was made much larger ) .
And as Jeremy pointed out , using a single language is n't always appropriate ( and adding even a second translation -- in my case it would be Spanish - - would make the sign even larger ...
OK , so back to the exercise : suspend disbelief and imagine that you could not use words to say it .
If you do n't need practice in thinking and communicating visually , then you can help the vast majority of us who do !
Cheers ; )

Actually it implies that people wearing dresses are not permitted three black dogs ( and there 's no indication about four as professional dog walkers would no doubt seek to exploit ) .
Thus , in this case , it would be better to use actual photos of various combinations of gender specific walkers and varieities of dogs .
Those combinations which are unlawful would be photographed receiving a ticket from a warden .
What a wonderful country !
Yes , there would be grey areas for debate , but on the grounds that ignorance is no defence , all people too stupid to understand this simple premise would deservedly be fined .
Posted by : john dodds | Jun 19 , 2006 4:54:48 AM
I guess you do n't even need the first line of your graphic ( the one with just one dog ) .
It 's safe to assume that if two dogs are allowed , than there 's no reason why one dog would NOT be allowed .
Although , this requires some thought on the part of the reader , and sometimes thinking is too much to ask .
Posted by : Sean C. | Jun 19 , 2006 6:48:49 AM
What you can leave out from a graphic is determined by what you can assume the viewers implicitly understand .
Without a common implicit understanding , any communication is ambiguous , even if you do use text .
As a non dog - owner , I brought in an assumption that " under control " was a synonym for " on a leash " , so even the written language above initially confused me .
Can we assume that dog owners are used to rules about numbers of dogs on and off leash , and expect to see those kinds of instructions in signs ?
Otherwise who knows what it could mean , given a different implicit understanding : a future archaeologist might come up with the theory that the sign belonged to a temple in a dog worshipping society and that acolytes had to be accompanied by one or two dogs to proceed along the path .
Posted by : DL | Jun 19 , 2006 7:32:02 AM
" a future archaeologist might come up with the theory that the sign belonged to a temple in a dog worshipping society and that acolytes had to be accompanied by one or two dogs to proceed along the path . "
Oh that is too too good , DL .
I may never see the world the same way again now that you said that ... what a fun way to look at signs .
Of course you did make a key point that implicit understanding and previous context matter .
And in fact , I actually do NOT understand all the dog rules at the trail ( and once DID get a $ 50 fine for not having a leash ON me , even though my dog was under control ... you still have to carry a leash even if you 're not required to use it ) .
But for example , I 'm not sure what happens when you have a combination of on and off - leash dogs , although it appears that you could have 247 on - leash dogs as long as not more than two dogs " under your control " were off - leash .
Sheesh .
But I 'm getting one lesson here ... that even trying to communicate something seemingly so simple is n't always quite as clear as it appears .
John : I think your multiple - combination gender - and - dog - specific sign is the best path .
But since you 're having fun with me here , I 'm going to have to violate every internet privacy law in this galaxy and post what you sent me in an email :
" You mean it 's not some wild west version of the three
strikes law .
Three offences and the dog gets it ! "
; )
Sean :
You hit on the main idea for me -- that even the * tiniest * bit of thinking means cognitive overhead , and while again - - cognitive overhead while running along a trail is n't a problem , it matters deeply when a lot more information is pouring in and those little bits of overhead stack up .
It breaks flow when the conscious mind has to come to full attention to think , and we try to follow Steve Krug 's " Do n't Make Me Think " mantra ( or rather , do n't make me think about the wrong thing . )
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jun 19 , 2006 8:20:28 AM
I like the design exercise , but it seems clear that the problem is the law itself .
If only the designer had the freedom to re-cast the problem , it would all be avoidable :)
This is one of those situations where the law is getting in the way of itself , ironically due to what I assume is an attempt to be as lenient as possible .
The intent of the law is that you be able to control any canine (s ) you may bring to the trail .
So the law SHOULD just be " no out of control canines , " not " we assume you can control two dogs but not three dogs so you can have two or fewer but you have to carry leashes for them just in case you can't actually control them after all , and if you want other dogs on leashes that 's cool too . "
That way you just need a sign with three elements :
- an angry - faced owner yelling at a dog
- the dog flipping off the owner and grinning
- a big red circle and slash over the whole scene

" Each human can have no more than two dogs under their control . "
This implies that I can have two dogs under control and 50,000 bitches in heat running around scrapping . :)
Drop the human from the graphic and show the dogs with collars attached .
In the background place an image of a hiker carrying a leash to further imply control .
The X on the third image is over both the dogs and the hiker .
Posted by : Mark | Jun 19 , 2006 10:34:12 AM
DL , you can't assume anything about dog owners knowing and understanding the rules .
In all the examples given , only Chris even tried to address the second point of the sign .
That is , that the up to two dogs off - leash must be under control .
In my book that means can you keep your off - leash dog from running up to my on - leash dog ?
Can you get it to come by calling it once ?
Will your dog leave the hiker who really doens't like dogs alone ?

The " future archaeologist " perspective is a good exercise .
However this exact problem is very real and is the ultimate graphic design challenge faced by the U.S. government right now :

Reminded me of a Laurie Anderson riff , from United States Live :
" Hello .
Excuse me .
Can you tell me where I am ?
In our country , we send pictures of people speaking our sign language in Outer Space .
We are speaking our sign language in these pictures .
Do you think that They will think his arm is permanently attached in this position ?
Oh , do you think They will read our signs ?
In our country , Goodbye looks just like Hello .
Say Hello . "

Sorry if someone had already mentioned this ( did n't get a chance to read all the comments ) , but I 'd say that the most effective way to pictorially represent the ' no more than two dogs per person ' rule is to depict three people ( stick figures ) , at the same level , from left to right .
The leftmost person keeping one ( abstract ) dog in close proximity , the middle person keeping two dogs in close proximity , and finally the rightmost person keeping three dogs in close proximity .
The third person and the three dogs are then crossed with a red X , or with a stop sign .
I know this is a minor quibble , but I think it makes a hell of a difference , because it implies walking with dogs .
The original solution , with three people and their respective dogs lined up vertically , lose some of the trail context .
Cheers !

What about two people with four dogs - ok ?
Here in open country on farmland or commonland loose dogs are liable to be shot by farmers concerned about sheep / lambs .
And no dog is under control if off the lead / leash !
The best sign locally to deter bad behaviour with dogs , is the one showing the number of dogs shot year - to - date .
It has several crossings out with numbers replaced with greater totals as the year progresses .
Visitors who like to let their dogs off the lead tend to have second thoughts after seeing that !

The impact was observed by scores of telescopes at ground observatories , as well as NASA 's Hubble , Spitzer and Chandra observatories in Earth orbit , and other spacecraft .
Rick Grammier , the mission 's project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , said the encounter came off without a hitch .
The flyby craft , with high and medium - resolution telescopic cameras and an infrared spectrometer for identifying materials ejected from the comet , successfully monitored the impact from 5,300 miles away .
The craft also emerged undamaged after passing within 310 miles of the comet while ducking behind a set of shields designed to protect it from dust and other particles streaming from the comet .
" We have a healthy flyby spacecraft , " Mr. Grammier said at the news conference .
It is particularly gratifying , he added , to have such success on July 4th , the nation 's birthday .
" I actually hope it 's made America proud , " he said .
After its close approach , the flyby craft pivoted around and took more pictures of the receding comet .
It then continued its playback of data it and the impactor collected during the encounter .
The battery - powered impactor separated from the flyby craft 24 hours before colliding with Tempel 1 .
During the last two hours , to impactor used an autonomous navigation system to pick a target point on the sun side of the comet and made three course corrections to reach it .
The craft also took increasingly detailed pictures with its telescopic camera as impact closed in , shooting its last image just 3.7 seconds before the collision .
Late images from the impactor , the best ever taken of a comet , showed a moon - like surface with flat plains , circular craters and a long , irregular ridge .
Some of the last pictures appeared to show the impactor coming in between two mile - wide craters .
Scientists are interested in comets because they are believed to be remnants of the materials that formed the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago .
Astronomers believe the interiors of comets have undergone little change since then and contain the pristine ice , gases , dust and other materials from which the rest of the solar system formed .
An added reason to probe comets is that they , along with rocky asteroids , pose the threat of hitting the Earth and causing cataclysmic damage .
Potential planetary defense requires knowing more about these objects in hopes of deflecting or destroying dangerous ones , experts say .

Prologo
Quando ho pensato a questo articolo la mia idea fondamentale era quella di mostrare come passare dall ' utilizzo di Ajax nudo e crudo , ad una forma più astratta e potente .
Mi sono accorto velocemente che un lettore ha bisogno di conoscere alcuni concetti di programmazione funzionale che i designer di Javascript hanno ben pensato di aggiungere al linguaggio per capire appieno come funzionano alcuni pezzi del codice che mostrerò .
Come conseguenza l'articolo ha assunto una nuova forma , quella di una guida veloce ma completa ad Ajax , dalle basi alle astrazioni che erano all ' origine lo scopo dell ' articolo .
Molto del codice esposto viene utilizzato in un servizio di social bookmarking che sto sviluppando in questi mesi ( segnalo.com ) , dunque le tecniche di programmazione mostrate sono reali , nel senso che sono applicabili a progetti in produzione .
Cos'è Ajax
Se leggete in giro su internet forse vi farete l'idea che Ajax è una cosa complicatissima che solo i programmatori più bravi usano .
In realtà Ajax è una stupidagine dal punto di vista tecnico , fondamentalmente l'unione di due cose .
La capacità di Javascript di aggiornare parte di una pagina HTML senza che questa venga caricata nuovamente .
La capacità di Javascript di fare richieste tramite il protocollo HTTP .
Molto spesso si parla di Ajax anche quando soltanto una di queste due caratteristiche viene utilizzata , in ogni caso per capirci qualcosa iniziamo esplorando la prima capacità listata sopra : aggiornare le pagine in temo reale tramite Javascript .
Giocare con gli elementi di una pagina
Ciao come stai ?
Esempio 1 Ciao come stai ?
Provate a guardare il codice dell ' esempio 1 e ad utilizzarlo ( basta premere il bottone Esegui esempio ) .
Alla pressione del bottone il contenuto dell ' elemento DIV che ha come id pluto viene modificato da " Come stai " a " Benone ! " .
Guardando il codice si capisce subito che farlo è molto semplice , questa è la funzione script1 che viene richiamata alla pressione del pulsante :
function script1 ( ) { var e = document.getElementById(" pluto " ) ; e.innerHTML = " Benone ! " ; }
La funzione script1 chiama la funzione document.getElementById passando come argomento l'identificativo del DIV , e quello che viene ritornato è un riferimento all ' oggetto che rappresenta il nostro DIV nella pagina HTML .
L'oggetto in questione ha una proprietà chiamata innerHTML che può essere letta / scritta .
Se viene letta restituisce il codice HTML presente dentro il DIV , se viene scrittta settandola a qualcosa di diverso come abbiamo fatto noi nell ' ultima riga della funzione script1 il contenuto del DIV cambia e gli effetti si vedono immediatamente nella pagina .
Facile no ?
Javascript illusionista
Altra cosa molto utilizzata in applicazioni
Ajax è la possibilità di poter settare due proprietà dello stile CSS di un oggetto chiamate visibility e display in modo da fare scomparire e apparire l'oggetto a piacimento .
Bisogna far pratica anche con questo aspetto ( altrettanto semplice ) prima di scrivere applicazioni Ajax serie .
Ecco il secondo esempio che illustra come fare a diventare prestigiatori in Javascript .
Io scompaio e appaio !
Esempio 2
Io scompaio e appaio !
Anche in questo caso l'idea di base non è difficile da capire .
Prendiamo il riferimento dell ' oggetto con document.getElementById come al solito e modifichiamo lo stile dell ' oggetto a nostro piacimento tamite oggetto.style.nomeProprietà per fare quello che vogliamo .
Qualcuno di voi che non conosce molto bene i CSS si chiederà come mai modifichiamo sia la proprietà visibility che display .
La prima viene settata a visible se si vuole che l'oggetto sia visibile , mentre il valore di hidden la fa scomparire .
La seconda invece viene settata a none quando si vuole che l'oggetto non prenda più spazio nella pagina , altrimenti anche se invisibile occuperebbe lo spazio ugualmente .
A volte ciò è desiderabile , altre volte non lo è .
Si noti come la proprietà dispaly venga settata a block quando si vuole far ricomparire l'oggetto : questo valore è infatti il default per un DIV ma varia al variare dei diversi elementi HTML , ad esempio per altri elementi il valore di default è inline .

Congratulazioni !
Sapete la metè delle cose che bisogna sapere per utilizzare Ajax in maniera rudimentale .
Dunque andiamo a scoprire l'altra metè della storia .
Richieste HTTP da Javascript
Qual'è la caratteristica principale di una applicazione in Ajax ?
Il fatto che la pagina si aggiorna senza la necessità di essere ricaricata , o al contrario che un evento generato dall ' utente ( come ad esempio la pressione di un tasto ) causi una operazione sul server , senza la necessita di postare alcun FORM .
Abbiamo visto come tramite Javascript sia possibile modificare il contenuto di una porzione della pagina , e di come gli elementi possano scomparire e ricomparire .
Questo è sufficiente per creare pagine i cui contenuti si aggiornano in maniera dinamica in linea teorica .
In pratica per il sistema avere una utilità reale serve che ad una azione dell ' utente vengano visualizzati dati che noi non potevamo avere già in memoria .
Immaginate un programma di gestione del magazzino scritto in Ajax .
Quando l'utente digita il codice di una particolare merce immediatamente appare nella pagina la quantità ancora disponibile in magazzino .
Ovviamente non è pensabile che tutti i dati del magazino siano nella memoria di Javascript , dunque è necessario eseguire una richiesta al server " di nascosto " , e appena si ottiene la risposta necessaria aggiornare la pagina .
Altro esempio , una web mail scritta in Ajax ( chi non conosce Gmail ? ) .
Alla pressione del tasto Delete l'email viene cancellata .
Eliminare la riga di quella email dalla lista delle email è semplice , abbiamo già visto come fare .
Ma chi dice al server di cancellare l'email dal database se non è possibile spedire un FORM ?
Quello che ci vuole per risolvere questi problemi è la capacità di fare richieste al server in maniera asincrona , ovvero in background , senza che l'utente si accorga di niente .
In questo modo Javascript può contattare il server spedendo e ricevendo informazioni senza che la pagina venga ricaricata .
Ma come si fa nella pratica ?
L'oggetto XMLHttpRequest
Javascript è capace di fare richieste HTTP in background sia utilizzando il metodo GET che il POST .
Noi ci occuperemo solo del primo perchè nella pratica è quello che si utilizza di più e una volta che conoscete questo , se vi fosse necessario , utilizzare l'altro non sarà una cosa complicata .
Per poter fare tale richiesta è necessario utilizzare un oggetto che si chiama XMLHttpRequest in tutti i browser moderni escluso Internet Explorer che necessita di un diverso oggetto .
Prima facciamo finta che Internet Explorer non esista ( ho quasi l'impressione che il mondo riesca ad andare avanti lo stesso ) .
Ciò che serve per fare una richiesta HTTP in Ajax è ovviamente un pò di Javascript , e dall ' altra parte ( nel server ) qualcuno che risponda alla richiesta , ovvero un piccolo script in PHP .
Ovviamente l'applicazione server - side può essere scritta in qualunque linguaggio , tutti gli esempi di questo articolo sono scritti in PHP perchè lo conosce anche mia zia Caterina , esperta di programmazione web e di uncinetto , a cui dedico questo articolo .
La prima cosa che vi mostro è la funzione che crea un oggetto XMLHttpRequest .
function CreateXmlHttpReq ( handler ) { var xmlhttp = null ; xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = handler ; return xmlhttp ; }
Bisogna spiegare cosa fa questo codice .
La funzione CreateXmlHttpReq prende in ingresso un solo argomento , una funzione , che verrà chiamata quando la richiesta è stata eseguita .
Infatti Javascript è un linguaggio che per l'input / output utilizza un modello basato sugli eventi , ricordate onClick , onChange , eccetera ?
L'idea è che lui quando non sta fecendo niente per l'utente aspetta che si verifichi un evento associato ad una qualche funzione .
Appena l'evento si verifica Javscript entra in azione chiamando l'handler ( ovvero una funzione che gestisce l'evento ) apposito .
Bene , le richieste HTTP necessitano del tempo per essere eseguite , cosa dovrebbe fare Javascript nel mentre , aspettare ?
Non può perchè deve gestire il resto dell ' applicazione .
Dunque la richiesta viene lanciata in background .
Appena ci sono novità di rilievo l'handler che noi passiamo come argomento a CreateXmlHttpReq viene chiamato per servire la nostra richiesta .
Ora che sappiamo come creare l'oggetto necessario per fare una richiesta HTTP in background , e come associarvi un handler , ci serve sapere come utilizzarlo per richiamare una data pagina e qualche altro dettaglio .
var myRequest = CreateXmlHttpReq(myHandler ) ; myRequest.open ( " GET " , " primo.php " ) ; myRequest.send ( null ) ;
Come potete immaginare il codice sopra setta l'oggetto XMLHttpRequest in maniera da fargli eseguire una query tramite il metodo GET al file primo. php , e nella riga immediatamente successiva spedisce la richiesta .
A questo punto la richiesta parte ... ma non abbiamo ancora scritto la funzione myHandler che deve occuparsi di gestirla quando ci sono novità in vista .
function myHandler ( ) { if ( myRequest.readyState == 4 && myRequest.status == 200 ) { alert ( myRequest.responseText ) ; } }
Si noti come myRequest sia una variabile globale , infatti l'handler viene chiamato senza arogmenti , non c'è nessuno che gli comunica a quale oggetto si riferisce la richiesta per cui è stato invocato , dunque bisogna avere un riferimento globale all ' oggetto XMLHttpRequest .
Nel codice finale che viene presentato in questo articolo l'oggetto viene invece registrato nella chiusura ( se leggete di piu ' capirete cos'e ' ) , cio ' permette di gestire in maniera affidabile piu' richieste concorrenti .
Ma per ora non ci pensate , facciamo finta che il modo migliore sia avere una variabile globale per l'oggetto XMLHttpRequest .
Il nostro handler viene invocato più volte durante una richiesta HTTP .
La proprietà readyState ci dice per quale motivo l'handler è stato chiamato in base al valore che assume .
0 : uninitialized
1 : loading
2 : loaded
3 : interactive
4 : complete
Ciò che a noi interessa è fare qualcosa quando la richiesta viene completata , per questo testiamo che readyState abbia il valore 4 .
A quel punto sarà settata anche la proprietà status che contiene il valore dello stato della risposta HTTP , che è 200 per richieste avvenute con successo , il famoso 401 per pagine non trovate , e così via .
Come averete visto il nostro handler è una funzione che si milita a visualizzare un alert .
Ora mettiamo le parti assieme e proviamo questo esempio , manca però solo una parte : il file PHP .
Ecco dunque il sorgente di primo.php :
<? echo ( " Questi dati vengono dal PHP " ) ; ?>
Ecco l'esempio con il codice completo e la possibilità di vederne gli effetti dal vivo .
var myRequest = null ; function CreateXmlHttpReq ( handler ) { var xmlhttp = null ; xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = handler ; return xmlhttp ; } function myHandler ( ) { if ( myRequest.readyState == 4 && myRequest.status == 200 ) { alert ( myRequest.responseText ) ; } } function esempio3 ( ) { myRequest = CreateXmlHttpReq(myHandler ) ; myRequest.open ( " GET " , " primo.php " ) ; myRequest.send ( null ) ; }
Nota : questo script non funziona con Internet Explorer !
Ogni volta che cliccate sul bottone Clicca per lanciare la richiesta , tale richiesta parte , quando la risposta del server è disponibile l'handler viene richiamato con la giusta combinazione di readyState e status e l'alert col contenuto della risposta viene visualizzato .
Se avessimo voluto avremmo potuto mettere un DIV nella pagina e tramite la proprietà innerHTML sarebbe stato possibile mostrare il risultato della richiesta aggiornando il DIV direttamente , invece che utilizzare un alert .
Questo è un buon esercizio che vi consiglio di fare subito prima di continuare a leggere l'articolo .
Tra poco affronteremo argomenti un tantino più complicati dunque è consigliabile giocare un pò con i concetti esposti fino a questo punto per acquisire dimetichezza .
Internet Explorer comunque esiste
E non lo possiamo ignorare poichè più o meno l'ottanta percento delle persone lo utilizza .
Per fortuna non serve modificare che una singola funzione per rendere il nostro codice compatibile con IE , la CreateXmlHttpReq2 .
Ecco la versione compatibile :
// Create the XML HTTP request object .
We try to be // more cross - browser as possible .
function CreateXmlHttpReq2 ( handler ) { var xmlhttp = null ; try { xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; } catch (e ) { try { xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " Msxml2.XMLHTTP " ) ; } catch (e ) { xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " Microsoft.XMLHTTP " ) ; } } xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = handler ; return xmlhttp ; }
Questa funzione tenta di risolvere un certo numero di problemi con diverse versioni di Internet Explorer , e un problema con una vecchia versione del browser Mozilla .
Come potete vedere il modo in cui viene creato l'oggetto per la richiesta HTTP e il modo in cui viene settato l'handler variano nei diversi browser , ma gli oggetti sono molto simili e l'handler non deve essere modificato per gestire l'uno o l'altro .
Ciò è importantissimo : abbiamo isolato il codice non compatibile tra i diversi browser in un'unica funzione !
C'è un secondo problema con IE in realtà , fa il caching delle richieste HTTP fatte in questo modo , dunque se sono effettuate utilizzando la stessa URL più volte , anche se lo script PHP richiamato produce diversi risultati , il risultato ottenuto sarà sempre lo stesso .
Per evitare questo problema invece di richiedere qualcosa come script .
php basta richiedere script.php?rand=numeroCasualie .
In questo modo inganniamo IE facendogli credere che ogni volta si tratta di una richiesta diversa ed evitiamo il problema della cache .
Per generare un numero casuale in Javascript si utilizza la funzione Math.random , dunque per evitare il problema della cache di IE tutto quello che dovremmo modificare nello script di sopra è la riga in cui la richiesta viene settata utilizzando il metodo open .
Nello script originale usavamo :
myRequest.open ( " GET " , " primo.php " ) ;
Mentre sarebbe opportuno utilizzare :
myRequest.open ( " GET " , " primo.php&rand= " +escape(Math.random ( ) ) ) ;
Un esempio completo che funziona su tutti i browser
A questo punto siamo pronti per riscrivere l'esempio di sopra con alcune modifiche .
Per prima cosa utilizzeremo la funzione CreateXmlHttpReq2 compatibile con IE , secondo utilizzeremo il parametro casuale nella richiesta per evitare la cache e terzo modificheremo lo script PHP in modo da ritornare il tempo in secondi , così possiamo vedere che i dati cambiano ad ogni invio .
Infine questa volta useremo un DIV per visualizzare il risultato dinamicamente utilizzando innerHTML .
Il codice integrale è il seguente .
var myRequest = null ; function CreateXmlHttpReq2 ( handler ) { var xmlhttp = null ; try { xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; } catch (e ) { try { xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " Msxml2.XMLHTTP " ) ; } catch (e ) { xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " Microsoft.XMLHTTP " ) ; } } xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = handler ; return xmlhttp ; } function myHandler2 ( ) { if ( myRequest.readyState == 4 && myRequest.status == 200 ) { e = document.getElementById(" ex4result " ) ; e.innerHTML = myRequest.responseText ; } } function esempio4 ( ) { var nome = document .
f1.nome.value ; var r = Math.random ( ) ; myRequest = CreateXmlHttpReq(myHandler2 ) ; myRequest.open ( " GET " , " secondo.php?nome= " +escape( nome ) + " &rand= " +escape(r ) ) ; myRequest.send ( null ) ; }
Il PHP del file secondo. php è il seguente semplice script :
<? if ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' nome ' ] ) ) { $ n = strtolower ( $ _GET [ ' nome ' ] ) ; $ name [ ' giorgio ' ] = " Bianchi " ; $ name [ ' vittorio ' ] = " Rossi " ; $ name [ ' augusto ' ] = " Verdi " ; if ( isset ( $name [ $ n ] ) ) { echo ( " Il cognome di $n è $ name [ $ n ] " ) ; } else { echo ( " Non conosco il cognome di $ n " ) ; } echo ( "
tempo corrente in secondi : " .time ( ) . " " ) ; } ?>
Nome :
Risultato :
Per testare l'esempio sopra provate a immettere i nomi Giorgio , Vittorio , Augusto e premere Visualizza congome , poi provate a mettere un altro nome che non è contenuto nell ' array del programma secondo. php , ad esempio Alessio .
Avete capito bene come funziona il codice ?
Complimenti , ora potete dire di sapere come funziona
Ajax , e anche spargere la voce sul fatto che le basi sono molto semplici .
Ma non illudetevi , Ajax è facile , chiunque può imparare ad usarlo .
Quasi tutta la programmazione è così , alla portata di tutti .
La differenza che potete fare voi è che se avete talento e voglia potete diventare dei grandi programmatori , capaci di utilizzare astrazioni più potenti che vi rendono il lavoro più facile e veloce .
La seconda parte di questo articolo , che è la motivazione per cui la prima parte è stata scritta , si sofferma proprio su questo : l'astrazione , ma prima permettetemi una breve digressione su XML .
XML ? no , grazie
Il termine Ajax è un acronimo , e significa :
A synchronous
synchronous Ja vascript
vascript and XML
XML è una delle tre parti , eppure noi abbiamo utilizzato Ajax fino ad ora senza neppure toccare XML .
Come mai ?
semplicemente chi ha coniato il termine pensava che il modo migliore per comunicare tra il programma che risiede sul server , e il client che fa la richiesta in Ajax , era quello di utilizzare XML .
Lo pensano in molti , ma in realtà Ajax non ha niente a che fare con XML .
PHP ( o chi per lui ) e Javascript possono spedirsi i dati in qualunque formato desiderabile .
Si noti come di solito la grande quantità dei dati passi dal server al client .
Ad esempio in Gmail il server spedisce al client informazioni sui messaggi , e il client si occupa tramite Javascript di visualizzare tali messaggi nella pagina dell 'utente .
Di solito il passaggio di parametri dal client al server avviene semplicemente passando dei parametri tramite una richeista GET , come abbiamo fatto noi poco fa nel caso del nome .
Per questa ragione uno dei miei metodi preferiti per passare dati dal server all ' interprete Javascript del client è utilizzare un formato di semplice testo nel caso di operazioni molto semplici .
Ad esempio se devo controllare se uno username in fase di registrazione in un servizio web è già occupato prima di ricaricare la pagina , faccio ritornare dal server un semplice OK o ERR , e controllo dal Javascript se la stringa ritornata è l'una o l'altra .
Se invece è necessario passare molti dati , utilizzo una tecnica diversa .
Creo nello script che gira sul server un array Javascript e lo spedisco .
Dal lato Javascript uso la funzione eval per valutare l'Array , è già pronta , non mi serve scrivere un parser .
Ecco un esempio in PHP .
<? echo ( ' var data = Array ( " ' ) ; echo ( $a ) ; echo ( ' " , " ' ) ; echo ( $b ) ; echo ( " ) " ) ; ?>
Semplice no ?
ma cosa succede se $ a o $b contengono caratteri ( in questo contesto ) speciali come le virgolette ?
Per evitare qualunque problema basta utilizzare la seguente funzione .
<? function safejsstring ( $s ) { $ a = unpack ( " C* " , $s ) ; $res = " " ; foreach ( $ a as $ byte ) { $ res .= sprintf ( " \\x %02x " , $ byte ) ; } return $res ; } ?>
Tale funzione prende una stringa PHP e la converte interamente in sequenze di escape nella forma \xHH dove HH è sono due cifre esadecimali .
In questo modo Javascript riuscirà sempre ad interpretare la stringa in maniera corretta anche se fosse costituita da dati binari .
Dal PHP potete generare semplicemente anche Array annidati , in breve strutture dati complicate quanto lo desiderate .
Se volete usare XML ... non vi tiene nessuno ;) ma volevo soltanto che fosse chiaro che non è necessario e il termine è finito dentro questa tecnica di programmazione solo perchè l'autore dell ' acronimo ha deciso così .
Parte seconda : facciamo di meglio
Carino Ajax vero ?
Ma se pensate a quanto codice abbiamo scritto per fare una mezza richiesta HTTP in Javascript , che abbiamo utilizzato in maniera esplicita una variabile globale , e quanto poco astratto dal reale problema che risolve risulta il nostro codice , non c'è mica da essere orgogliosi ... dobbiamo proprio correre ai ripari .
Benvenuti nella seconda parte di questo articolo , dove ( se non lo sapete già ) , imparerete come innalzare il livello del vostro Javascript utilizzando i concetti della Programmazione Funzionale .
Se non sapete di cosa si tratta vi consiglio di leggere questa parte anche se non siete interessati a sapere di più su Ajax .
In ogni caso i concetti che seguono sono assolutamente necessari per seguire la parte più avanzata dell ' articolo , in cui saranno usati per creare una piccola libreria
Ajax che ci libera dal tedio di fare tutto a mano , e che sembra integrata nel linguaggio .
Funzioni anonime
Utilizzando linguaggi che sono fondamentalmente imperativi , come il C , Java , PHP , Javascript ( anche se l'ultimo come vedremo ha un buon supporto per la programmazione funzionale ) , una delle cose che capita spesso di fare è quella di scorrere un array indice dopo indice tramite un ciclo for .
Partiamo da un esempio reale ... una operazione spesso necessaria è , dato un array , prendere l'elemento col valore massimo .
Serve per un sacco di cose , una tra tutte : avete presente la nuova moda web 2.0 , di visualizzare dei tag con un font o con un colore proporzionale alla sua popolarità ?
( più spesso proporzionalmente al logaritmo della popolarità ) .
Bene , la prima cosa che serve per fare la proporzione è ovviamente sapere qual'è il valore del massimo elemento .
In javascript scrivereste abbastanza ovviamente :
var a = Array ( 10,5,7,81,28 ) ; var max = a [ 0 ] ; for ( i = 1 ; i < a.length ; i++) { if ( a [ i ] > max ) { max = a [ i ] ; } }
La fuzione reduce
E se vi serve sapere qual'è la stringa più lunga di un array ?
Vi serve un altro ciclo for .
Una volta un programmatore ha detto
Se per ogni ciclo for che ho scritto nella mia vita potessi ricevere un centesimo sarei ricco .
Come possiamo liberarci da questa schiavitù del ciclo for ?
La soluzione è data dal fatto che in Javascript le funzioni sono oggetti di prima classe , che in breve significa che le funzioni così come un oggetto stringa o un numero possono essere passate come argometi ad altre funzioni e ritornate come valore di ritorno da funzioni .
In pratica non c'è differenza sostanziale tra quello che si può fare con un numero , con una stringa e con una funzione .
Ora abbiamo la soluzione al nostro primo problema , possiamo scrivere una potente funzione che si chiama reduce .
function reduce ( a , f ) { if ( a.length == 0 ) { throw empty ArrayError ; } var res = a [ 0 ] ; for ( var j = 1 ; j < a.length ; j++ ) { res = f( res , a[j ] ) ; } return res ; }
Questa piccola funzione prende in ingresso due oggetti : il primo è un array , il secondo è una funzione f. Applica f ai primi due elementi dell ' array , e prende il risultato .
Poi applica f al risultato e al terzo elemento dell ' array , e così via .
in pratica se L'array contiene i valori 1,2,3, 4 il risultato di reduce è f( f( f ( 1,2 ) , 3) ,4 ) .
Come vedete la funzione f che viene passata a reduce prende in input due argomenti , li compara , e ritorna uno dei due .
Se f fosse una funzione che dati due argomenti ritorna il più grande dei due , il risultato di reduce ( a , f ) sarebbe il massimo elemento dell ' array !
Bene , ora siamo in grado di scrivere del codice che prende l'elemento più grande di un array senza ricorrere ad un clico for usando reduce .
Ecco come .
function max ( a , b ) { if ( a > b ) return a ; else return b ; } var a = Array ( 10,5,7,81,28 ) ; var max = reduce ( a , max ) ;
In pratica abbiamo estrapolato quello che c'è di uguale in molti cicli for e lo abbiamo separato dal resto del codice , incarnandolo nella funzione reduce .
Rimane un problema , abbiamo dovuto scrivere la funzione max , e ciò può essere noioso .
Ora che abbiamo reduce vorremmo utilizzarla in tanti piccoli contesti quotidiani , e scrivere continuamente funzioni aiutanti è una noia .
Ma Javascript non è un linguaggio smidollato !
Infatti ha un concetto molto utile , le funzioni anonime .
Se in Javascript le funzioni sono oggetti come tutti gli altri , perchè devono avere per forza un nome ?
Una stringa non ha un nome , neppure un numero .
Anche le funzioni possono non averlo , possono essere scritte in maniera " letterale " , o messe dentro una variabile , come tutti gli altri tipi di dato .
Basta usare la seguente notazione .
var a = Array ( 10,5,7,81,28 ) ; var maxfunction = function ( a , b ) { return ( a> b ) ? a : b } ; var max = reduce ( a , maxfunction ) ;
Così come Array ( 1,2,3 ) ritorna un array , function ( parametri ) {codice} ritorna una funzione .
Dunque nell 'esempio sopra abbiamo creato una funzione e abbiamo messo il suo riferimento in una variabile , e poi l'abbiamo usata come argomento di reduce .
Ma perchè usare una variabile intermedia ?
Ecco dunque la versione finale , in tutto il suo splendore ;)
var a = Array ( 10,5,7,81,28 ) ; var max = reduce ( a , function ( a , b) {return ( a> b ) ? a : b;} ) ;
Confrontate questo codice per trovare il massimo elemento di un array con quello che avevamo scritto utilizzando il ciclo for all ' inizio .
Non solo questo , reduce fa tutto quello che volete ... avete voglia di sommare l'array ?
Bene :
var a = Array ( 10,5,7,81,28 ) ; var sum = reduce ( a , function ( a , b) {return a + b ; } ) ;
Il limite è la vostra fantasia .
Le amiche di reduce : map e filter
Anche se per i nostri scopi la cosa importante è la comprensione delle funzioni anonime ( che permetteranno di capire cosa sono le chiusure nel prossimo paragrafo ) , la programmazione funzionale è uno strumento potentissimo , dunque illustro brevemente altre due classiche primitive della programmazione funzionale , map e filter .
Come reduce anche map prende come input un array e una funzione f , ma invece che ridurre l'array ad un solo elemento applicando una funzione come fa reduce , map ritorna un nuovo array in cui ogni elemento è stato ottenuto trasformando il vecchio elemento nel nuovo tramite una funzione f .
In termini pratici , dato l'array 1,2,4,7 ciò che ritorna map ( a , f ) è f( 1 ) , f( 2 ) , f( 4 ) , f( 7 ) .
Ecco la funzione map .
function map ( a , f) { var res = Array ( ) ; for ( var j = 0 ; j < a.length ; j++ ) { res[j ] = f ( a[j ] ) ; } return res ; }
Questa volta la funzione f che passiamo come argomento a map è una funzione che prende un solo argomento ( una funzione unaria ) , e ritorna un valore .
Ecco un esempio di applicazione di map , che non fa altro che trasformare un array di numeri in un array dei quadrati di tali numeri .
var a = Array ( 1,5,4,3 ) ; var b = map ( a , function ( x ) {return x* x} ) ;
Alla fine del programma l'array b conterrà gli elementi 1,25,16,9 .
Come potete immaginare è possibile sommare gli effetti di map e reduce , ad esempio provate a scrivere il codice che utilizzando queste due primitive sommi i quadrati degli elementi di un array .
Si noti come anche se teoricamente siamo interessati soltanto al valore di ritorno della funzione f , sia possible forzare map a lavorare come una sorta di foreach .
var a = Array ( 1,5,4,3 ) ; map ( a , alert ) ;
Queste due righe di codice avranno l'effetto di fare l'alert di tutti gli elementi dell ' array .
Il risultato della funzione map non viene utilizzato in nessun modo perch&egrabe ; non è nostro scopo , in questo caso siamo solo interessati nell ' effetto collaterale ( o side effect ) che ha la chiamata della funzione f ( ovvero alert ) , che è quello di visualizzare i numeri .
L'ultima delle funzioni che giocano un ruolo importante tra le primitive della programmazione funzionale su cui ci soffermeremo è filter .
Questa funzione sarà solo descritta in quanto concettualmente molto simile alle altre due .
L'implementazione di filter è lasciata come esercizio al lettore .
Ma cosa fa filter ?
Dato un Array e una funzione unaria f in ingresso , ritorna un Array composto solo dagli elementi per cui la chiamata alla funzione f restituisce true .
In pratica filter filtra l'array e ne crea uno che ha come elementi solo quelli che piacciono alla funzione passata come argomento , che utilizza il valore di ritorno true o false per indicare se tenere o scartare ogni dato elemento
Utilizzando assieme map , filter e reduce è per esempio possibile in una singola linea di codice processare un array per tenere solo gli elementi che sono maggiori di 10 , elevarli al quadrato e ottenerne la somma .
Ma ora è tempo di chiudere questa ( spero interessante ) parentesi e continuare il nostro breve incontro delle caratteristiche evolute di Javascript .
Le chiusure
La più semplice definizione di chiusura , e anche una delle meno immediatamente comprensibili per chi non le conosce , è la seguente : una chiusura è una funzione con uno stato ad essa associato .
Cosa significa di preciso ?
Per spiegarlo bisogna fare un passo indietro , e ritornare alle funzioni anonime di cui abbiamo parlato prima ( se non ricordate bene cosa sono , tornate indietro a fare un ripasso e poi ritornate qui ! ) .
Abbiamo detto che in Javascript le funzioni sono un oggetto di prima classe , e abbiamo infatti visto come sia possibile passare una funzione come argomento ad un'altra funzione .
Abbiamo anche affermato che è possibile scrivere funzioni che ritornano funzioni come argomento .
Ad esempio il codice
function creaFunzione ( ) { var f = function ( ) { return 1} ; return f ; } var b = creaFunzione ( ) ; alert ( b ( ) ) ;
quando viene eseguito mostra un alert in cui c'è scritto 1 . La funzione creaFunzione ritorna una funzione che non fa altro che ritornare 1 ( scusate il gioco di parole , ma è proprio cosi , creaFunzione ritorna una funzione che quando viene chiamata ha come valore di ritorno l'intero 1 ) .
Tale funzione ritornata da creaFunzione viene salvata dentro la variabile b.
Da questo momento in poi b può essere usata come una funzione , infatti la chiamiamo nell ' ultima riga del programma di esempio , per ottenere l'argomento di alert .
Fin qui nulla di nuovo .
Esistono le funzioni anonime , e come tutte le altre funzioni sono oggetti di prima classe : possono essere utilizzato come argomento , ritornate da altre funzioni , tenute dentro le variabili , e qualunque altra cosa fareste con un numero , una stringa o un array ( anch'essi tutti oggetti di prima classe ) .
Ma cosa accade se nel corpo di una funzione anonima c'è un riferimento ad una variabile che è definita al momento della sua creazione nello scopo esterno ad essa ?
Un esempio chiarirà cosa voglio dire .
function creaFunzione ( valore ) { var f = function ( ) {return valore} ; return f ; }
La variabile valore esiste mentre la funzione creaFunzione viene eseguita , e come potete vedere compare nel corpo della funzione anonima che alla fine restituiamo come valore di ritorno .
Ma quando utilizzeremo la funzione anonima creata , creaFunzione non sarà più attiva , dunque cosa contiene la variabile valore quando la funzione anonima viene invocata ?.
Concentratevi che questo è un passaggio delicato .
Ciò che accade è che la funzione anomina create ricorderà il riferimento all ' oggetto che aveva la variabile valore al momento in cui la funzione anonima è stata creata .
Dunque se scrivo
a = creaFunzione ( 10 ) ; b = creaFunzione ( 20 ) ; a( ) ; // ritorna 10 b( ) ; // ritorna 20
Le funzioni a e b ritorneranno ad ogni chiamata rispettivamente 10 e 20 !
Ecco cosa significa che una chiusura è una funzione con uno stato ad essa associato .
La chiusura ricorda tutti i riferimenti a variabili esterne al momento della sua creazione .
La cosa interessante è che questo stato che la chiusura si porta appresso può anche essere modificato .
Per esempio è possibile scrivere una funzione che ritorna delle funzioni che contano .
function creaContatore ( ) { var c=0 ; return function ( ) { return c++ ; } } var a = creaContatore ( ) ; var b = creaContatore ( ) ; a( ) ; /* ritorna 0 */ a ( ) ; /* ritorna 1 */ a( ) ; /* ritorna 2 */ b( ) ; /* ritorna 0 */ b( ) ; /* ritorna 1 */ a( ) ; /* ritorna 3 */
Ad ogni chiamata a ( ) e b( ) ritornano l'intero successivo ( partendo da zero ) , e ricordano dove erano arrivate .
Siccome questo non è un corso completo di programmazione funzionale non mi posso spingere oltre , ma provate a immaginare le possibilità ... ( argh , sembra lo spot della Apple ) .
Chiusure e handler ?
C'è un campo in cui è necessario soffermarsi sull ' applicazione delle chiusure : le funzioni che gestiscono eventi in Javascript , ovvero i così detti handler .
Partiamo da un problema reale , e vediamo come viene affrontato tramite le chiusure .
In una pagina HTML ci sono due elementi : uno spazio in cui l'utente può scrivere qualcosa ( un banale elemento INPUT di tipo text ) e un bottone .
Alla pressione del bottone Javascript fa partire un timer , che dopo dieci secondi mostrerà un alert che visualizza cosa c'era scritto nell 'INPUT al momento in cui l'utente aveva premuto il tasto .
Eccovi l'esempio funzionante .
L'utete potrebbe ad esempio scrivere hello e premere il tasto , poi scrivere world e premere il tasto .
Dopo alcuni secondi vedrebbe in successione due alert , uno in cui è scritto hello e l'altro in cui è scritto world .
Per implementare un tale programma qualcuno potrebbe essere tentato di scrivere qualcosa come :
function whenButtonIsPressed ( ) { setTimeout ( showAlert , 10000 ) ; } function showAlert ( ) { var e = object.getElementById(" inputobj " ) ; alert ( e.value ) ; }
Nell 'esempio immaginiamo che il bottone abbia un evento onClick che richiama la funzione whenButtonIsPressed e che il testo digitato dall ' utente sia contenuto in un elemento INPUT con ID inputobj .
Ovviamente il codice mostrato sopra non funziona , perchè l'handler del timer , ovvero la funzione showAlert , va a leggere il contenuto dell 'INPUT solo quando deve visualizzare l'alert .
Se nel mentre il contenuto è cambiato perchè l'utente nel corso dei 10 secondi ha scritto qualcosa di nuovo il nostro gioco non funziona .
Noi vogliamo che alla pressione del tasto , l'alert risultante 10 secondi dopo visualizzi quello che c'era scritto quando il tasto era stato premuto .
Ci servirebbe un handler che ha memoria del passato ... ovvero , una chiusura !
Ecco il codice corretto :
function whenButtonIsPressed ( ) { var string = document.getElementById(" inputobj " ) .value ; var myHandler = function ( ) { alert ( string ) ; } ; setTimeout ( myHandler , 10000 ) ; }
Abbiamo risolto il problema con un'unica funzione .
La chiusura che usiamo come handler ha un riferimento a string , dunque si crea un collegamento tra l'oggetto che conteneva tale variabile al momento della creazione della funzione e la funzione stessa .
Nota : questo particolare problema potrebbe essere risolto anche tramite eval ( ) , ma ci sono molti casi in cui le chiusure risolvono problemi non risolvibili con eval ( ) e tantissimi altri casi in cui risolvono i problemi in maniera molto più elegante .
Ajax comodo
Siamo prossimi alla conclusione .
Con le conoscenze acquisite ci proponiamo di scrivere delle funzioni che rendono
Ajax così semplice che per fare una query in Ajax e mostrare la risposta in un alert basterà scrivere :
ajaxGet ( " primo.php " , myHanlder ) ; function myHandler ( content ) { alert ( content ) ; }
In pratica la funzione ajaxGet dovrà predisporre la query , e poi chiamare l'handler passando come primo argomento il risultato della richiesta HTTP solo se la richiesta è andata a buon fine .
Non c'è nessuna variabile globale , nessun controllo dello stato , tanto meno la ripetizione del codice necessario per creare l'oggetto necessario alla richiesta e alla sua inizializzazione .
Ma non ci accontentiamo di questo , l'altra importantissima caratteristica che deve avere la nostra nuova interfaccia verso Ajax è la seguente : qualunque argomento addizionale passato alla funzione ajaxGet dovrà essere passato all ' handler quando la richiesta viene completata , dunque il codice :
ajaxGet ( " primo.php " , myHandler , " a" ,10 ) ; function myHandler ( content , first , second ) { alert ( content ) ; alert ( first ) ; alert ( second ) ; }
Avrà l'effetto di eseguire la richiesta e chiamare l'Handler con la risposta ottenuta dal server come primo argomento , la stringa " a " come secondo argomento e l'intero 10 come terzo .
Riflettete un pò su questa caratteristica e vi accorgerete come ora la richiesta sia in grado di portarsi appresso lo stato , e permetta dunque di usare lo stesso handler per gestire diverse situazioni .
Infatti dietro l'implementazione di ajaxGet ci sono proprio le chiusure , abbiamo preso i vantaggi della closure e li abbiamo trasportati nella nostra API , anche se nella pratica per usare tale API non serve conoscere le chiusure .
E ' importante notare come la possibilità di passare argomenti addizionali all ' handler aumenti la potenza della nostra interfaccia .
Immaginate di avere due divesi elementi DIV nella pagina .
Volete fare delle richieste a diversi file PHP e visualizzare il contenuto in un DIV o nell ' altro tramite innerHTML .
Potete semplicemente scrivere :
ajaxGet ( " primo.php " , myHandler , " primodiv " ) ; function myHandler ( content , elementid ) { var e = document.getElementById( elementid ) ; e.innerHTML
= content ; }
Se più tardi volete fare una nuova richiesta ma visualizzare il risultato in un DIV diverso , potrete riutilizzare il vecchio handler e scrivere semplicemente :
ajaxGet ( " primo.php " , myHandler , " secondodiv " ) ;
Vedrete come nella vita reale qualunque applicazione Ajax non banale presenta questo tipo di necessità .
Ora che abbiamo visto come vorremmo che fosse la nostra interfaccia verso Ajax , andiamo ad implementarla utilizzando le tecniche di programmazione imparate fino ad ora e qualcuna nuova che sarà esposta quando occorre .
Implementazione
Iniziamo dalla fine , mostrando il codice completo della funzione ajaxGet e della sua funzione aiutante ajaxOk .
var ajax_req = null ; function ajaxOk ( ) { if ( ajax_req.readyState == 4 && ajax_req.status == 200 ) { return ajax_req.responseText ; } else { return false ; } } function ajax Get ( url , handler ) { var a = new Array ( " placeholder " ) ; for ( var j=2 ; j<arguments.length ; j++ ) { a [ a.length ] = arguments[j ] ; } var myhandler = function ( ) { var content = ajaxOk ( ) ; if ( content != false ) { a [ 0 ] = content ; return handler.apply ( this , a ) ; } } ajax_req = CreateXmlHttpReq ( myhandler ) ; ajax_req.open ( " GET " ,url ) ; ajax_req.send ( null ) ; }
La funzione ajaxOk svolge un compito banale , se avete ancora fresca nella memoria la prima parte dell ' articolo ricorderete che le proprietà readyState e status dell ' oggetto xmlHttpReq vengono utilizzate per controllare lo stato della richiesta , ovvero se è andata a buon fine .
In caso positivo , tramite la proprietà responseText si può ottenere il contenuto della riposta HTTP .
Alla luce di questi fatti si vede subito che ajaxOk non fa altro che controllare se la richiesta registrata nella variabile globale ajax_req sia terminata con esito positivo , e in tal caso ritornare la risposta ottenuta .
In caso contrario invece viene ritornato false .
Analizziamo ora il pezzo forte , ovvero ajaxGet .
Questa è una funzione che utilizza un numero variabile di argomenti .
In Javascript ogni funzione ha accesso esplicito alla lista di argomenti con cui è stata chiamata tramite l'array arguments .
Quello che fanno le prime righe di codice di ajaxGet è predisporre un array con il primo elemento settato a una stringa arbitraria ( che sarà poi rimpiazzata dal testo della riposta HTTP ) , e tutti gli altri argomenti settati al valore passato dall ' utente ad ajaxGet come argomenti addizionali .
In pratica questo array sarà utilizzato per chiamare l'handler quando la richiesta Ajax è completa .
Infatti sotto si procede alla creazione dell ' handler vero della richiesta , quello che poi chiamerà l'handler più astratto , in pratica il vero handler fa da wrapper o da interfaccia per usare un termine italiano a quello di più alto livello .
Utilizzando la funzione ajaxOk il vero handler controlla che la richiesta abbia avuto buon fine ( altrimenti non fa nulla ) , in caso positivo setta il primo elemento dell ' array a alla risposta ottenuta .
Ora l'array a contiene una la lista degli argomenti con cui richiamare l'handler di alto livello , e il gioco è fatto .
Si noti come sia l'array a che l'argomento handler della funzione ajaxGet siano memorizzati nella chiusura assegnata alla variabile myHandler .
Ecco dunque a cosa servivano le chiusure in questa nostra libreria .
La funzione apply
Siamo all 'ultima riga di codice che rimane oscura :
return handler.apply ( this , a ) ;
Cosa fa apply ?.
Il problema è il seguente : l'handler reale deve chiamare il nostro handler di alto livello con la lista di argomenti settati nell ' array a .
Come si richiama una funzione utilizzando come argomenti gli elementi di un array ?
In breve se ho un array che contiene gli elementi " a " , " b " e " c " , e una funzione f( ) , vorrei avere qualcosa che produca l'effetto di una chiamta a f ( " a " , " b " , " c " ) .
Il metodo apply di ogni oggetto funzione Javascript fa proprio questo .
A questo punto dovrebbe essere tutto chiaro , le seguenti righe di codice non fanno altro che creare la richiesta e assegnarla alla variabile globale ajax_req , e finalmente spedire la richiesta .
La variabile globale
Come avete visto anche se nell ' utlizzo della nuova interfaccia non c'è traccia di variabili globali , nella implementazione l'abbiamo utilizzata .
Ciò era in questo caso desiderabile perchè la funzione CreateXmlHttpReq si occupa sia di creare l'oggetto necessario alla richiesta XmlHttpReq che di settare l'handler .
Separando tale funzione in due parti , una che crea la richiesta ed una che setta l'handler , la necessità di una variabile globale non sussiste più , ma poichè viene fatta al massimo una richiesta
Ajax per volta e non volevo rimettere le mani nel codice esposto nella prima parte per non creare confusione ho preferito questa soluzione .
In realtà non c'è alcun motivo per non registare anche l'oggetto della richiesta nella chiusura , dunque una buona esercitazione è quella di riscrivere il codice in modo da evitare le variabili globali ( anche se nella vita reale l'implementazione esposta potrebbe essere più conveniente perchè la parte incompatibile tra i diversi browser viene isolata in una sola funzione ) .
Internet Explorer 5
Purtroppo il codice sopra esposto non funzionerà con Internet Explorer 5 , perchè tale browser non implementa apply .
Siccome ancora c'è circa l'un percento della popolazione di internet che utilizza tale browser è bene sopportarlo in qualche modo .
A tal fine ho scritto una implementazione di apply utilizzando la funzione eval :
function myDummyApply ( funcname , args ) { var e = " funcname ( " ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < args.
length ; i++) { e += " args [ " +i+ " ] " ; if ( i+1 != args.length ) { e += " , " ; } } e += " ) ; " return eval(e ) ; }
Anche ajaxGet va modificata per utilizzare tale funzione se la apply reale fallisse .
Ecco dunque il codice integrale completo di ogni pezzo che implementa l'interfaccia Ajax comoda da usare .

When a rainbow formed in the sky people stopped and stared at the natural wonder .
But then lightning sparked across the evening panorama as two of nature 's most spectacular phenomenon created an unusual alliance .
See more incredible storms and lightning pictures here
The clash of weather was seen above the affluent city of Fort Smith , in the Southern state Arkansas .
One onlooker said : " It was awe inspiring .
The lightning made a huge rumbling sound and when you looked up there was also this incredible rainbow forming on the horizon . "
The intracloud lightning , known as an anvil crawler , is the most common form of lightning , with the electrical charge contained within a single cumulonimbus cloud .
Lightning often occurs during heavy storms while rainbows are generally formed after the rain has stopped , making an appearance of both simultaneously relatively rare .
The actual electric charge in a flash of lightning comes from particles from the sun sent out in the solar wind which gather in the outer atmospheric layers before creating a strike .
Scientists are still divided by what actually causes lightning , with one theory suggesting falling droplets of ice and rain become electrically polarised as they fall through the natural electric field in the Earth 's atmosphere .
This would explain why lightning often accompanies storms and heavy rain .
The same droplets also cause the rainbow , when light from the sun is refracted by the water to cause a spectrum .

The research prompted the FBI to make its site more secure
The finding was uncovered by researchers who analysed how the net 's addressing system works .
They also found that if the simple attacks were combined with so - called denial - of - service attacks , 85 % of the net becomes vulnerable to take - over .
The researchers recommended big changes to the net 's addressing system to tackle the vulnerability at its heart .
Site seizing
When you visit a website , such as news .
bbc.co.uk , your computer often asks one of the net 's address books , or domain name servers , for information about where that site resides .
But the number of computers that have to be consulted to find the computers where that site is located often makes sites vulnerable to attack by vandals and criminals , found Assistant Professor Emin Gun Sirer and Venugopalan Ramasubramanian from the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University .
Professor Sirer told the BBC News website that , on average , 46 computers holding different information about the components of net addresses are consulted to find out where each dotcom site is actually hosted .
But , he said , this chain of dependencies between the computers that look after the different parts of net addresses creates all kinds of vulnerabilities that clever hackers could easily exploit .
" The growth of the internet has caused these dependencies to emerge , " said Professor Sirer .
" Instead of having to compromise one you can compromise any one of the three dozen . "
All the information gathered and analysed by the researchers has to be publicly available to keep the net 's addressing system working .
The research analysed information about almost 600,000 computers .
The research also revealed that 17 % of the servers that host the net 's address books are vulnerable to attack via widely known exploits .
We need to re-think the entire naming infrastructure of the internet
Professor Emin Gun Sirer
One site vulnerable in this way was run by the FBI , said Professor .
Sirer .
Although the five computers that act as the first reference point for the fbi.gov domain were secure , one of the five that connect to these has yet to install a patch for a well - known bug .
That computer was fixed after the Cornell team reported its findings to the FBI , but hundreds of thousands of sites suffer from similar problems .
The most vulnerable net domain found by the survey was that of the Roman Catholic Church in the Ukraine .
Criminals such as phishing gangs would be interested in re-directing traffic from well - known sites so they can grab key login and personal details that would help them de-fraud web users .
If attacks via known exploits were combined with other attacks , said Professor Sirer , malicious hackers could open up enormous amounts of the net to attack .
For instance , he said , hackers could use denial - of - service attacks to overwhelm the net address books that are secure .
This could leave users ' computers with no choice but to look up website names via compromised servers .
By combining well - known attacks and denial - of - service attacks , 85 % of the net 's domains become vulnerable to take over , revealed the analysis .
He said : " They could already be doing it and we would hardly ever know . "
The research had exposed a big problem that net administrators need to tackle , said Professor Sirer .
Thought should be given to using a secure version of the system used to pass around information about net addresses .
" The domain name system has been incredibly successful so far but it is showing its age , " he said .
" We need to re-think the entire naming infrastructure of the internet . "
The hierarchical structure of the net 's address books could be replaced with a more resilient system , he said , that uses a peer - to - peer type structure that would be harder to compromise .
Even as the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development pay contractors millions of dollars to help train journalists and promote a professional and independent Iraqi media , the Pentagon is paying millions more to the Lincoln Group for work that appears to violate fundamental principles of Western journalism .
In addition to paying newspapers to print government propaganda , Lincoln has paid about a dozen Iraqi journalists each several hundred dollars a month , a person who had been told of the transactions said .
Those journalists were chosen because their past coverage had not been antagonistic to the United States , said the person , who is being granted anonymity because of fears for the safety of those involved .
In addition , the military storyboards have in some cases copied verbatim text from copyrighted publications and passed it on to be printed in the Iraqi press without attribution , documents and interviews indicated .
In many cases , the material prepared by the military was given to advertising agencies for placement , and at least some of the material ran with an advertising label .
But the American authorship and financing were not revealed .
Military spokesmen in Washington and Baghdad said Wednesday that they had no information on the contract .
In an interview from Baghdad on Nov. 18 , Lt. Col. Steven A. Boylan , a military spokesman , said the Pentagon 's contract with the Lincoln Group was an attempt to " try to get stories out to publications that normally do n't have access to those kind of stories . "
The military 's top commanders , including Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , did not know about the Lincoln Group contract until Wednesday , when it was first described by The Los Angeles Times , said a senior military official who was not authorized to speak publicly .
Pentagon officials said General Pace and other top officials were disturbed by the reported details of the propaganda campaign and demanded explanations from senior officers in Iraq , the official said .

COVER STORY
Marxist Literary Critics Are Following Me !
How Philip K. Dick betrayed his academic admirers to the FBI .
by Jeet Heer
WHEN THE NOVELIST PHILIP K .
DICK DIED IN 1982 , THE INFLUENTIAL literary theorist Fredric Jameson eulogized him as " the Shakespeare of science fiction . "
At the time of this encomium , Dick was hardly famous .
The author of more than fifty books , he had an enthusiastic following among science fiction fans .
But he was rarely read by anyone else .
These days ,
Dick is far better known .
Vintage publishes his fiction in a uniform paperback edition .
Hollywood filmmakers transform his stories of imaginary worlds and conspiratorial cartels into movies like Screamers and Total Recall .
Meanwhile , academic critics laud him as a postmodernist visionary , a canny prophet of virtual reality , corporate espionage , and the schizoid nature of identity in a digitized world .
Indeed , beginning in the last years of his life and continuing to the present , these critics have played a key role in the canonization of Philip K. Dick .
But did Dick return the favor ?
Not exactly .
To their considerable anguish , Dick 's academic champions have had to contend with the revelation that their hero wrote letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation denouncing them .
In these letters , Dick claimed that Jameson and other literary theorists were agents of a KGB conspiracy to take over American science fiction .
When he sent these messages , Dick was not in the best state of mind :
He frequently heard voices and saw visions , often bathed in a mysterious pink light .
Even so , the news of his surreptitious campaign against his academic admirers has left some of them deeply disturbed .
In his fiction , Dick had a genius for turning reality upside down and inside out , writing novels in which time runs backward or the Nazis win World War II .
Yet the celebrated " reality breakdowns " of Dick 's novels seem normality itself compared with the bizarre , unsettling missives he sent to the authorities in Washington , D.C.
The laureate of radical postmodernism was , it turns out , a stool pigeon .
DICK STARTED SELLING SF stories as early as 1951 , when he was twenty - two , but he never wanted to be a genre writer .
Gifted with a quicksilver imagination and lightning - fast typing fingers , he planned to earn a living churning out pulp stories until he could find a publisher for his realistic " mainstream " novels .
To his dismay , Dick discovered that though he could easily sell SF stories and novels , he could not secure a buyer for his earnest and grim tales of working - class life .
Dick received a paltry fifteen hundred dollars a shot for his SF novels , which he produced at a rate of four or five a year ; typically they were published as cheap paperbacks , with titles such as Dr. Bloodmoney ( 1965 ) and Clans of the Alphane Moon ( 1964 ) .
Considering the conditions under which the novels were written and published , it is amazing that Dick managed to find any sort of intelligent audience .
Yet the best of these books notably , The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ( 1965 ) and Ubik ( 1969 ) presented intellectually ingenious and emotionally lacerating dislocations of reality .
In Ubik , the hapless protagonist , Joe Chip , travels to Des Moines across a landscape of rapidly decaying objects that are moving backward in time : Coins and elevators , cars and airplanes become old - fashioned versions of themselves .
Drawing on SF conventions to dramatize life in the postmodern age , Dick regularly explored the world of mind - altering drugs and shifting realities .
Not surprisingly , John Lennon was a fan .
Dick 's fiction of the 1960s resonated not only with the counterculture but also with the New Left .
Dick , who came of age in Bohemian Berkeley , infused his novels with a satiric radicalism .
As he noted in his diary , " I may not have been / am CP [ Communist Party ] , but the basic Marxist sociological view of capitalism negative is there .
Good . "
Dick 's political imagination is evident in his recurring focus on the world of work .
Unlike most science fiction heroes , his protagonists are ordinary working folks who struggle against corporate cartels .
( The novelist John Sladek once wrote a parody of Dick 's work titled " Solar Shoe Salesman . " )
Given Dick 's countercultural themes and politics , his work naturally attracted leftists such as Jameson , Peter Fitting of the University of Toronto , and Richard Pinhas , a French critic who went on to form a punk band .
Istvan Csicsery - Ronay , Jr. , a professor of English at DePauw University , notes that many readers in the late 1960s and 1970s thought Dick was " expressing ...sly critiques of capitalism and the American bourgeois world picture . "
The SF novelist Thomas M. Disch praised Dick for writing " self - consistent social allegories of a more - or - less Marxist bent . "
In 1975 , the journal Science Fiction Studies devoted a special issue to Dick 's work .
The critics were exceedingly generous in their praise .
Polish novelist Stanislaw Lem acclaimed Dick as the only American writer of SF with any merit , " a visionary among charlatans . "
Fitting lauded Ubik as a " deconstruction of bourgeois science fiction . "
But could these critics trust Dick ?
Even before their paeans were published , Dick had begun writing a stream of letters to the FBI .
In the earliest of these , written on October 28 , 1972 , he asserted , " Several months ago I was approached by an individual who I have reason to believe belonged to a covert organization involving politics , illegal weapons , etc. , who put great pressure on me to place coded information in future novels ' to be read by the right people here and there , ' as he phrased it .
I refused to do it . "
Dick went on to suggest that this mysterious organization ( which he claimed was possibly run by neo - Nazis ) had successfully recruited at least one SF writer , Thomas M. Disch .
" I stress the urgency of this , " he wrote , " because within the last three days I have come across a well - distributed science fiction novel which contains in essence the vital material which this individual confronted me with as the basis of encoding .
That novel is camp concentration by Thomas Disch . "
( Disch 's 1968 novel portrays a totalitarian future America where dissidents are rounded up by the government and subjected to mind - control experiments . )
Around the same time , Dick grew suspicious of Stanislaw Lem , who was starting to gain an English - speaking audience for his satiric science fiction .
In November 1972 , Lem had secured permission to have Ubik translated into Polish .
Because of Cold War currency restrictions , Dick was unable to collect royalties from this translation .
He blamed Lem for the situation , accusing the Polish novelist of embezzlement .
In February 1974 , Dick first experienced his pink - light visions , which continued without interruption until his death .
They revealed to him an entire cosmology .
Sometimes he experienced the world as a persecuted Christian living in imperial Rome ; at other times he felt he was receiving messages from some future superior intelligence , which he named VALIS ( Vast Active Living Intelligence System ) .
Dick was never sure whether the pink light was the voice of God , a message from a space alien , or a drug - induced hallucination ( among other possibilities he entertained ) .
Yet despite the pink light 's uncertain nature , he often acted under its direction .
VALIS issued cryptic theological messages but also offered Dick practical advice on how to deal with his son Christopher 's hernia .
The visions also expanded his conspiratorial fantasies , which became global in scope .
In March 1974 , he claimed to have received two mysterious pieces of mail : a fan letter from Estonia and an anonymous clipping from a communist newspaper .
Under the guidance of the pink light , Dick concluded that these letters were part of a effort to put his loyalty to the test .
Connecting the letters to his dispute with Lem , he wrote to the FBI asking for assistance against the communist conspiracy .
On May 1 , 1974 , Dick got a phone call from Peter Fitting , who had written an article slated to run in the special Philip K. Dick issue of Science Fiction Studies .
Fitting , who was spending a sabbatical year in San Francisco , wanted to visit Dick and bring along Jameson , Richard Pinhas , and Pinhas 's wife , Agneta .
Writing to the FBI after this phone call , Dick connected " the Fitting group " with Lem and " the flurry of weird mail of a Soviet type . "
He believed that this proposed visit was a prelude to a kidnapping plot : " The Fitting group , including ... most especially the foreign national [ Pinhas ] , of whom I am most greatly afraid , in case he is not French but from behind the Iron Curtain in fact maybe a Soviet police agent who wants to talk to me direct , or is from Poland anyhow , representing Lem .... "
Despite these fears , Dick received " the Fitting group " on May 15 .
Again writing to the FBI , he provided a surprisingly genial picture of the visit : " You will be glad to know that in fierce debate we routed the Peter Fitting group , which consisted of four people from four different countries .
Their purpose in coming to see me was to get an endorsement from me , recorded on tape , of a Marxist interpretation of my writings .
With them , besides a lot of good liquor and a pretty girl , they brought at least three complex Marxist philosophical theses on my novels , one of which they translated from the French aloud , onto tape , for me to agree with .
I told them this French doctoral thesis was entirely wrong .
We had then a one - hour furious polemical debate in three languages , plus assorted Greek and Latin technical terms , after which they accused my tastes of being ' in favor of God ' as well as ' right - wing fascist propaganda ' and then departed , leaving their liquor behind ( they did take the girl with them , though ) . "
Fitting himself provides a slightly different account of the visit in a statement prefacing volume 3 of The Selected Letters of Philip K. Dick : " It was a very pleasant day .
Certainly , there was discussion and even disagreement about the ' meaning ' of his work , but I think it fair to say that none of us were concerned about receiving his imprimatur on our readings , or worried that our various interpretations did not agree with the author 's conscious intentions .
We ate and drank a fair amount ; Dick flirted quite a bit with Agneta in a kind of pidgin German ....
All in all , a wonderful and amusing day . "
Fearful of arousing suspicion among his imagined enemies , Dick strove to please them even as he denounced them to the FBI and denigrated what he called their " weird Marxist talk . "
In letters written in late 1974 , Dick combined all his various fears into one elaborate scheme .
Lem , he imagined , was a KGB agent orchestrating a vast conspiracy that included such pawns as Jameson , Fitting , Darko Suvin ( a Canada - based critic who then edited Science Fiction Studies ) , and Franz Rottensteiner ( an Austrian who at that time was Lem 's Western literary agent ) .
" What is involved here , " he wrote , " is not that these persons are Marxists per se or even that Fitting , Rottensteiner and Suvin are foreign - based but that all of them without exception represent dedicated outlets in a chain of command from Stanislaw Lem in Krakow , Poland , himself a total Party functionary ....
For an Iron Curtain Party group ... to gain monopoly positions of power from which they can control opinion through criticism and pedagogic essays is a threat to our whole field of science fiction and its free exchange of views and ideas . "
In countering this communist conspiracy , Dick again feared for his life :
He believed he was in danger of being kidnapped and brainwashed by Lem and company .
WHILE DICK WAS ALIVE the targets of his letters to the FBI were not aware of his duplicity .
( For its part , the FBI responded with a single noncommittal thank - you note , and does not seem to have acted further on his reports . )
But even without the knowledge of Dick 's letters to the FBI , his critical supporters became increasingly uncomfortable with the eccentricities of his private life .
As Csicsery - Ronay notes , " For the New Left critics , the whole Pink Beam episode was an embarrassment and they never talked about it .
It was just another wacky , tawdry Dick thing . "
Dick 's admirers first confronted the issue of his letters to the FBI in 1991 , when the relevant volume of his selected letters was released .
The earliest response , by Robert M. Philmus of Concordia University , was also the harshest .
Writing in Science Fiction Studies , Philmus described Dick 's actions against Lem as " slander to an extent that is not only actionable but ( legally as well as morally ) indefensible . "
Today , Philmus explains that he was angry because Dick 's letters hit close to home .
" This was not something that was remote to me , " he says .
" These letters involved the denunciation of friends and acquaintances . "
Yet even Philmus acknowledges that certain mitigating historical and biographical factors relax one 's initial outrage .
In particular , Philmus believes that Dick 's own previous experience with security services sheds light on Dick 's actions .
As it turns out , long before Dick approached the FBI , the bureau had approached him .
In 1953 or 1954 , Dick and his second wife , Kleo , were repeatedly approached by two FBI agents , who hoped ( but failed ) to recruit the young Bohemian couple to spy on students at the University of Mexico .
According to Dick 's biographer Lawrence Sutin , these encounters had a " lasting " impact and planted the seed for Dick 's future anxieties about the national security state .
( Not all these anxieties were unjustified , either .
In 1958 , a letter Dick wrote to a Soviet scientist was intercepted by the Central Intelligence Agency .
Ten years later , Dick lent his name to an antiwar ad that ended up in his FBI file . )
Of all those named in Dick 's letters , Disch has perhaps been the most forgiving .
In an e-mail interview , he stresses Dick 's personal agony .
" At this point , early and mid-1970s , " Disch notes , Dick " really was freaking out on drugs , almost the whole pharmacopoeia except heroin .
The drugs did n't destroy his gift entirely , even at his nadir , but they did make it impossible for him to distinguish between self - interest and Poe 's Imp of the Perverse .
He loved to make trouble : Witness those letters to the FBI ....
He 'd follow the moment 's inspiration , which would lead sometimes to only momentary mischief ( the FBI , after all , did n't take him seriously , so far as I know ) , sometimes to an okay novel . "
Disch also believes that Dick was motivated partially by " pure envy , disguised as paranoid fantasy . "
In a letter to Disch , written the day after his October 28 , 1972 , letter to the FBI , Dick extravagantly praised Camp Concentration as " not only the finest science fiction novel I 've ever read but now that I 've realized that , I find myself reflecting that it is the finest novel as such . "
Disch is " flattered " that Dick felt so threatened by Camp Concentration that he had to denounce the novel to the government .
Yet even if Dick 's critics forgive his treachery as delusional , can they justifiably canonize him as a great subversive novelist ?
As Csicsery - Ronay noted in a 1992 survey of the history of Dick 's literary reputation , " Dick 's paranoid fantasy seems to retroactively undermine the whole point of the effort to apotheosize him as an icon of critical , anti-establishment SF .
The historical situation is profoundly , unnervingly Dickian .
Even as the earnest critics are trying to establish models of resistance and redemption , their hero is secretly undermining them .
The idealism of the beatification essays is now riven with our knowledge that their object was a traitor . "
Certainly Peter Fitting 's views of Dick 's work have changed .
In 1975 , Fitting had celebrated Dick 's fiction for its transgressive power .
In his view , most science fiction novels like most traditional " realist " novels are ideological constructs that mask the fundamental relations between social classes .
They proffer a " conception of reality which mystifies the actual reality of the capitalist mode of production and the resultant repression and alienation . "
By contrast , he lauded Dick for " carrying subjectivity to an extreme " and thus " reminding us ... that ' reality ' is a mental construct which may be undermined at any time . "
But speaking about Dick now , Fitting says with wary sadness that " there has n't been anything really interesting written about him in the last decade ....
People are n't so interested in him ....
It is harder to find a radical vision in his work . "
Fitting believes that far from intentionally subverting SF , Dick was often " confused , " which made his work seem more complicated than it actually was .
DICK WAS AN ERUDITE widely read man .
But nothing in his career prepared him to appreciate the methods and styles of contemporary literary criticism .
In one interview , he complained that he " read a lot of ... criticism in which [ critics ] see a lot of ideas which are n't there at all . "
Dick may have misread his critics , but in his view , the critics misread him .
His story about being asked to plant covert neo -Nazi messages in his books can be read as a paranoid fantasy about literary criticism , which involves not just finding meanings deeply hidden in the text but sometimes also inventing meanings .
Csicsery - Ronay believes that Dick " felt intimidated by and vulnerable to the eggheads , " so his letters to the FBI were an attempt " to protect his work from the interference of strange academics . "
This type of " anti-academic feeling " is " strong in the SF community , " claims Csicsery - Ronay , who is the current editor of Science Fiction Studies .
And indeed , Disch speaks for many authors in the field when he writes that he disdains " SF academics " as " Lukács - style Continental ideologues , who worshipped [ Dick ] but in turgid prose and missing half the jokes . "
In considering Dick 's ill - fated relationship with his academic admirers , Disch writes , " I worry more about academe than Dick .
The work has stayed in print , it 's widely read , and whether it will continue to seem relevant depends more on history than the work itself .
That is , he will be worth reading so long as he seems uncannily prescient . "
Dick 's portrayal of a media - saturated world where reality is lost among simulacra is just as timely as ever , so perhaps we should heed Disch 's advice to return to Dick 's splendid fiction and leave the sad life behind .
Yet separating life and art is difficult with a character like Dick , whose own life and art pushed so hard at the boundaries of the normal .
Philmus recently observed that in 1974 Dick " entered the world of his fiction . "
And as Dick himself wrote to Fitting in that same year , " It seems to me that by subtle but real degrees the world has come to resemble a PKD novel ; or , put another way , subjectively I sense my actual world as resembling the kind of typical universe which I used to merely create as fiction , and which I left , often happily , when I was done with writing .

Our monthly dissertation feature for Contentville brings to light the paper trail left by the good and the great , the famous and the infamous .
Learn what you most need to know about most every topic from our regular Barnes & Noble column .
This post concerns an experimental internal - BBC - only project designed to allow users to collectively describe , segment and annotate audio in a Wikipedia - style fashion .
It was developed by the BBC Radio & Music Interactive R&D team – for this project consisting of myself , Tristan Ferne , Chris Bowley , Helen Crowe , Paul Clifford and Bronwyn Van Der Merwe .
Although the project is a BBC project , all the speculation and theorising around the edges is my own and does not necessarily represent the opinion of my department or the BBC in general .
It ’s officially my last day at the BBC today , but with the permission of my outgoing boss Mr Daniel Hill I ’m going to make the very best use of it by talking about a project that we ’ve been working on for the last few weeks .
I consider it one of the most exciting projects I ’ve ever worked on , and BBC Radio & Music Interactive one of the only places in the world where I would have been able to have done so .
If you ’re impatient , you should probably skip straight to the clumsy screencasts I ’ve done to illustrate the project – playing an annotated programme ( 4 Mb ) and editing / annotating a programme ( 4 Mb ) .
But for everyone else , maybe a little context .
The media landscape is changing incredibly quickly – ten or twenty years ago in the UK you might have had a choice of a dozen or so radio and television stations broadcasting at any given time .
Over the last decade that ’s grown to hundreds of stations , plus a variety of on - demand services like Sky Box Office .
Over the next few decades , it ’s pretty clear that the massive archives of content ( that every broadcaster in the world has accrued over the last seventy or eighty years ) will start to appear on - demand and on the internet .
You can already see the evidence of consumer interest in the sheer number of conventional stations that broadcast repeats , and on the international sales of DVDs across the world .
An on - demand archive is going to make the number of choices available to a given individual at any point almost completely unmanageable .
And then there ’s the user - generated content – the amateur and semi- professional creations , podcasts and the like that are proliferating across the internet .
In the longer term there are potentially billions of these media creators in the world .
All of this choice , however , creates some significant problems – how on earth are people expected to navigate all of this content ?
How are they supposed to find the specific bit of audio or video that they ’re looking for ?
And how are they supposed to discover new programmes or podcasts ?
And it gets more complicated than that – what if what you ’re not looking for is a complete coherent half - hour programme , but a selection of pertinent clips – features on breaking news stories , elements in magazine programmes , particular performances from music shows ?
In the end , the first stage in making any of these processes possible is based on the availability of information about the audio or video asset in question – metadata – at as granular a level as possible .
And not only about that asset , but also about its relationship to other assets and services and other information streams that give individuals the ability to explore and investigate and assess the media they ’ve uncovered .
The project we undertook was focused on Annotatable Audio ( specifically , but not exclusively , of BBC radio programming ) – and we decided to look in an unorthodox direction – towards the possibilities of user - created annotation and metadata .
We decided that we wanted to develop an interface that might allow the collective articulation of what a programme or speech or piece of music was about and how it could be divided up and described .
Our first ideas looked for approaches similar to del.icio.us , Flickr or our own Phonetags – which create collective value by accreting the numerous annotations that individuals make for their own purposes .
But after a fascinating discussion with Jimmy Wales , we decided to think about this in a different way – in which ( just like Wikipedia ) individuals would overtly cooperate to create something greater and more authoritative .
So here ’s what we ’ve come up with .
First off , imagine yourself as a normal user coming to a page about a particular programme or speech .
What you see is a simple interface for playing and scrubbing through the audio at the top of the page with marked ‘ segments ’ highlighted .
If you hover over those segments they brighten up and display the title of that section .
If you click on them , it starts the audio playing from that point .
This correlates to the sections below which could be filled with any amount of wiki - style content – whether that be links or transcripts or background information or corrections or whatever .
Beneath that are tags that users have added to describe the programme concerned .
If you click on any of the segment permalinks to the left it starts the audio at that point and changes the URL to an internal anchor so you can throw around links to chunks of a programme or a speech .
So basically you get a much richer and fuller experience of the audio that you ’d get by just listening to it in a media player .
Here ’s a screen cap :
But it gets much more exciting when you actually delve a bit deeper .
If you want to edit the information around a piece of audio , then just like on a wiki you just click on the ‘ edit / annotate ’ tab .
This brings you up a screen like this :
Here you can zoom into the wave form , scrub around it , and decide either to edit a segment or create a new segment .
Once you ’ve decided ( in this walkthrough I decided to edit a pre-existing segment ) you simply click on it , at which point the editing interface appears :
And on this screen you can change the beginning and end points of the audio by simply clicking and dragging , you can change the title to something more accurate , add any wiki - style content you wish to in the main text area and add or delete the existing fauxonomic metadata .
If you want to delete a segment you can .
If you need to keep digging around to explore the audio , you can do so .
It ’s all amazingly cool , and I ’m incredibly proud of the team that made it .
This final screen represents that last core aspect of wiki - like functionality – a history page that allows you to revert back to previous versions of the annotations if someone has defaced the current version :
So that ’s the core parts of the project – a demonstration of a functional working interface for the annotation of audio that ’s designed to allow the collective creation of useful metadata and wikipedia - like content around radio programmes or speeches or podcasts or pieces of music .
If you ’ve worked through the rest of this piece and managed to not watch the screencasts now , here are the links again – although be warned , they are a few Mb in size each .
The first one shows the functionality of the playback page ( 8 Mb ) and how people might use the information to navigate through audio .
The second shows someone editing the page , editing a segment and adding a new segment ( 4 Mb ) , and it really shows off Chris Bowley ‘s astonishing work on the Flash components and how it connects to Helen Crowe ’s Ajaxy HTML .
As always with projects from the R&D team , the Annotatable Audio project is unlikely to be released to the public in its current form .
We ’re using it as a way of testing out some of these concepts and approaches – some of which will probably manifest in upcoming products in one way or another .
In the meantime if you want to know more about the project or you ’re inside the BBC and would like a play , then either leave a comment below or contact the awesome Tristan .
Ferne {at the domain} bbc.co.uk who ’s going to be running the project now I ’ve left .
Anyway , I ’d just like to take this final opportunity again to say thank you to the BBC and to all the people I ’ve worked with to make cool stuff .
It ’s been a blast and I genuinely could n’t be happier with the final project we worked on together .
You guys rock .
But now …
Something new !
And just to give you the disclaimer one more time .

Individual variation in social behavior is one of the most striking features of cooperative animal societies .
In a new study from the June issue of American Naturalist , Michael A. Cant ( University of Cambridge ) , Justine B. Llop ( University of Cambridge ) , and Jeremy Field ( University College London ) investigate the extent to which differences in aggressive behavior within a cooperative society can be explained by " inheritance rank " -- the likelihood that an individual will get to mate successfully in that society based on their rank -- or place in the social hierarchy .
They can only pass on their genes when they reach the top of the hierarchy , usually after those ahead of them in the rank have died and they have inherited the right to reproduce .
" Certain group members inflict or receive many more acts of aggression than others .
In some cases , these acts ( which include bites , shoves , mounts , and charges ) appear to regulate cooperative activity in the group by activating lazy workers , for example , or punishing defectors , " write the researchers .
The researchers developed two simple mathematical models that predicted that , if inheritance rank mattered in a cooperative society , then the rates of aggression would be highest toward the front of the queue and that the aggression would increase as the time available to inherit the ability to breed ran out in seasonal animals .
These predictions were tested on field colonies of the paper wasp Polistes dominulus by recording aggression between all group members and then repeatedly removing the dominant wasps .
When individuals were experimentally promoted in rank , their aggression toward subordinates increased radically , suggesting that aggression depends on rank rather than vice versa and that particularly high levels of aggression are used by newly promoted dominants to establish their status .
" We found that rates of both aggressive ' displays ' ( aimed at individuals of lower rank ) and aggressive ' tests ' ( aimed at individuals of higher rank ) decreased down the hierarchy , as predicted by our models , " write the authors .
Cant et al. conclude that variation in future fitness due to inheritance rank is the hidden factor accounting for much of the variation in aggression among apparently equivalent individuals .

The iPhone landscape has changed somewhat over the last few days .
Finally now we have a choice other than SoftBank if we want to own an iPhone .
For some of us the fact that we needed at least 24 months remaning on our visa to sign up for their 2 year contract was the killer .
For others it was the rumors of poor network coverage or just the desire to wait until the spec was a little closer to the Android phones .
If you have n’t got an iPhone yet , it is easier now .
But which provider is the best deal ?
Softbank or au by KDDI ?
The short answer boils down to two key factors .
If your decision is purely driven by money , the answer is Softbank .
But , if you are a heavy user or you just hate waiting for web pages to pop up then I hate to say it but you should probably be going with au .
Below I ’ll walk you through some of the other differences and throw in another option to include , and help you come to your own verdict .
The price issue is simple .
With au , it costs you an extra 500 yen each month on your “ all you can chew data ” set .
Depending on a the model you choose it might also cost you more to purchase the iPhone itself through au .
If you are transferring to au from another carrier and satisfied with the most basic iPhone ( 16GB ) you will end up with Continue reading Getting an iPhone 4S in Japan : SoftBank or au - KDDI … or ? →
I have been an investor in a company called Return Path for almost six years .
Return Path is in a number of email related businesses , but one that they basically invented is the email delivery assurance business .
They work for commercial emailers and help them get permissioned email delivered to inboxes .
They work with the commercial senders on changing their practices so that their email will get a reputation as a " good mail " and will get through to the inboxes of the people who have requested the mail .
Well today AOL announced that it is taking a very different approach .
Last year AOL partnered with a competitor of Return Path 's called Goodmail that thinks money is the answer to spam .
They believe that if you force commercial mailers to pay to get into inboxes , the spammers will be put out of business .
Nice theory , but in practice it smells like bribing your way into inboxes .
Both approaches are EZ Pass for email .
But Return Path 's approach has always been to get the senders to send email the way consumers want it .
Permissioned , relevant , not too often , and stopped when the consumer says " no more " .
AOL 's approach is to turn email delivery into a pay for access business .
Those who can afford to pay get through .
So if you use AOL for mail , look forward to lots of high value email like mortgage offers , life insurance offers , etc .
But what if you are an AOL user and you get your weekly horoscope from a great service that also has marketing messages in it ?
If that service does n't pay , your horoscope is going to go into the junk mail folder .
And you 'll wonder where it went .
What if you get your bank statements via email and your bank refuses to pay to get delivery ?
Who will pay the late fees when you do n't get your statements ?
Until today , Goodmail was only an option not a requirement because AOL also had something called " enhanced whitelist " which allowed commercial mailers with excellent reputations to get through the filters .
But I guess that was n't making them any money .
So today , AOL announced that they are " phasing out " their enhanced whitelist program and forcing commercial mailers to use Goodmail if they want their mail to get through to inboxes .
They spun that news as a good thing as this piece from ClickZ shows .
But what is really going on here is that AOL is saying that it does n't matter if you have a great reputation and have been whitelisted at AOL for years .
Now if you want to get commercial mail into their customers inboxes you must pay for delivery .
And so it 's a sad day for email .
The spammers have won .
They have turned email delivery into a business that can be bought and sold for the highest price .
And AOL is leading the way .
Of course .
Editor ’s note :
In this column , Molly Ivins notes that when the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund went belly up in 1998 , it nearly wrecked world markets .
So why , she wonders , are we allowing well - connected Republicans to prevent the SEC from staving off the next catastrophe ?
AUSTIN , Texas —
In case you have n’t got anything else to worry about — like war in the Middle East , nuclear showdowns , global warming or Apocalypse Now — how about the suicide of capitalism ?
Late last month , the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down a new rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mandatory registration with the SEC for most hedge funds .
This may not strike you as the end of the world , but that ’s because you ’ve either forgotten what a hedge fund is or how much trouble the funds can get us into .
These investment pools for rich folks are now a $ 1.2 - trillion industry ( known to insiders , I am pleased to report , as “ the hedge fund community ” ) .
Hedge funds are now beginning to be used by average investors and pension investors .
Back in 1998 , there was this little - bitty old hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management .
Because hedge funds make high - risk bets , Long Term Capital got itself in so much trouble its collapse actually threatened to wreck world markets , and regulators had to step in to negotiate a $ 3.6 - billion bailout .
A similar fiasco at this point probably would break world markets .
The Securities and Exchange Commission under William Donaldson ( appointed after the Enron mess ) had tried to regulate hedge funds .
But Christopher Cox , current SEC chairman and no friend of regulation , said he would consult other members of the administration about whether to appeal the ruling , which “ came on the same day as disclosures , ” reports The Washington Post , that the feds “ are investigating Pequot Capital Management , Inc. , a $ 7 billion hedge fund , for possible insider trading . ”
Nice timing , judges .
This is the third time in less than a year the appeals court has blocked the SEC from acting beyond its authority .
According to The Washington Post , “ Former SEC member Harvey J. Goldschmid , who voted to approve the plan , yesterday urged regulators to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , members of Congress or both .
In the Pequot case , a former SEC lawyer who worked on the Pequot investigation before being fired by the agency has written a letter to key members of the Senate banking and finance committees alleging that the SEC dropped the probe because of political pressure . ”
The lawyer said he was prevented by political pressure from interviewing a top Wall Street executive .
Sources said the executive was John J. Mack , once chairman of Pequot and now chief executive of Morgan Stanley — and a major fundraiser for President Bush ’s campaigns .
I ’d say the guy ’s wired .
So what we have here is yet another case of ideological decision - making ( “ all government regulation is bad ” ) being applied despite the most obvious promptings of common sense .
Come to think of it , that ’s exactly the pattern this administration has followed with war in the Middle East , nuclear showdowns , global warming and Apocalypse Now .
Well , if the administration wo n’t do something , how about Congress ?
Reps. Barney Frank , Michael Capuano and Paul Kanjorski are co-sponsoring a bill to reverse the court decision — and to gather more information about how hedge funds affect the economy .
This would seem a peppy response , except Congress seems quite determined to do nothing at all these days , having already beaten the record of the “ do - nothing Congress ” of the Truman era .
As near as can be figured out , the Republican “ game plan ” is to do absolutely nothing between now and November .
This does n’t improve anyone ’s opinion of the Republican Congress , but has the happy effect of dragging the Democrats down with them .
Correction Appended
WASHINGTON - REPRESENTATIVE
JAMES P. MORAN , Democrat of Virginia , does not have the kind of record most lawmakers would herald on national television .
He has offended Jews with impolitic remarks and made news for scuffling with his wife a day before she filed for divorce .
A former boxer , he threatened to slug one House colleague , and has thrown a punch at another .
So what in the world possessed him to appear on " The Colbert Report , " the late - night Comedy Central show , and allow himself to be goaded into taking a swing at the host , Stephen Colbert ?
" Because , " Mr. Moran explained , " a little self - deprecation on the part of a politician is priceless . "
Self - deprecation is often in short supply in Washington .
But Mr. Colbert , playing the deadpan reporter in his " Better Know a District " segments , is injecting a new levity into politics .
Tongue firmly in cheek , he is on a quest to interview -- or lampoon -- all 434 members of the House .
( The man who held the 435th seat , the disgraced California Republican Randy Cunningham , " is dead to me , " Mr. Colbert declared . )
So Mr. Colbert is creating a litany of fools on the Hill .
He drew Jack Kingston , a Georgia Republican and seemingly boring white guy who once lived in Ethiopia , into a discussion of his " African - American experience . "
He tweaked Jerrold Nadler , Democrat of New York , for proposing $ 300 million to stop school bullying : " Was that bill your idea , or did somebody bigger put you up to it ? "
He asked the Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , who is gay , about his wife .
Mr. Frank was not amused .
" Two Stooges short of a good routine , " he complained .
The Moon -Bush Cash Conduit By Robert Parry
June 14 , 2006 O ver the past quarter century , South Korean theocrat Sun Myung Moon has been one of the Bush familys major benefactors  both politically and financially  while enjoying what appears to be protection against federal investigations into evidence that his cult - like organization has functioned as a criminal enterprise .
Indeed , the newest disclosure about Moon funneling money to a Bush family entity bears many of the earmarks of Moons business strategy of laundering money through a complex maze of front companies and cut -outs so it cant be easily followed .
In this case , according to an article in the Houston Chronicle , Moons Washington Times Foundation gave $ 1 million to the Greater Houston Community Foundation , which in turn acted as a conduit for donations to the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library .
The Chronicle obtained indirect confirmation that Moons money was passing through the Houston foundation to the Bush library from Bush family spokesman Jim McGrath .
Asked whether Moons $ 1 million had ended up there , McGrath responded ,  Were in an uncomfortable position .
If a donor doesnt want to be identified we need to honor their privacy . 
But when asked whether the $ 1 million was intended to curry favor with the Bush family to get President George W. Bush to grant a pardon for Moons 1982 felony tax fraud conviction , McGrath answered ,  If that s why he gave the grant , hes throwing his money away .
That s not the way the Bushes operate .
McGrath then added ,  President Bush has been very grateful for the friendship shown to him by the Washington Times Foundation , and the Washington Times serves a vital role in Washington .
But there cant be any connection to any kind of a pardon . 
[ Houston Chronicle , June 8 , 2006 , citing the work of private researcher Larry Zilliox . ]
But Moon has many other interests beyond clearing his criminal record with a presidential pardon .
While its true Moon has sought a pardon since the latter years of Ronald Reagans administration , Moon also has counted on powerful political connections to shield his business activities from renewed federal investigation that otherwise might have pried into criminal offenses ranging from money laundering to evading the U.S. embargo on the rogue state of North Korea .
Moon has achieved this remarkable insulation for his operations largely by spreading around hundreds of millions of dollars for political activities , charitable functions and the publication of one of Washingtons daily newspapers , the Washington Times .
The founder of the South Korean - based Unification Church has made himself particularly useful to the Bush family and other prominent Republicans who have returned the favor by speaking at his events , lavishing praise on his business operations and granting him Capitol Hill space for some of his ceremonies .
Bags of Cash Faced with Moons political clout , federal authorities have looked the other way for more than two decades even when principals within Moons organization have made public declarations about its continuing criminal practices .
For instance , Moons former daughter - in - law , Nansook Hong , admitted to participating in money - laundering schemes by personally smuggling cash from South Korea into the United States .
She also said she witnessed other cases in which bags of cash were carried into the United States and delivered to Moons businesses .
Moon demonstrated contempt for U.S. law every time he accepted a paper bag full of untraceable , undeclared cash collected from true believers  who smuggled the money in from overseas , Nansook Hong wrote in her 1998 book , In the Shadows of the Moons .
Nansook Hongs allegations were corroborated by other disaffected Moon disciples in press interviews and in civil court proceedings .
Maria Madelene Pretorious , a former Unification Church member who worked at Moons Manhattan Center , a New York City music venue and recording studio , testified at a court hearing in Massachusetts that in December of 1993 or January of 1994 , one of Moons sons , Hyo Jin Moon , returned from a trip to Korea with $ 600,000 in cash which he had received from his father .
...
Myself along with three or four other members that worked at Manhattan Center saw the cash in bags , shopping bags . 
In an interview with me in the mid-1990s , Pretorious said Asian church members would bring cash into the United States where it would be circulated through Moons business empire as a way to launder it .
At the center of this financial operation , Pretorious said , was One - Up Corp. , a Delaware - registered holding company that owned many Moon enterprises including the Manhattan Center and New World Communications , the parent company of the Washington Times .
 Once that cash is at the Manhattan Center , it has to be accounted for ,  Pretorious said .
 The way that s done is to launder the cash .
Manhattan Center gives cash to a business called Happy World which owns restaurants .
... Happy World needs to pay illegal aliens .
... Happy World pays some back to the Manhattan Center for services rendered .
The rest goes to One - Up and then comes back to Manhattan Center as an investment .
The lack of federal investigative interest in these admissions of guilt was especially curious because evidence of Moons money - laundering dated back to the late 1970s when Moons operations came under the scrutiny of a congressional probe into a South Korean influence - buying plot called  Koreagate . 
Investigators discovered Moons pattern of money transfers emanating from mysterious sources in Asia and ending up funding media , political , educational and religious activities in the United States .
By the early 1980s , that federal money - laundering probe had led to the criminal charges against Moon for tax evasion , a prosecution that the new Reagan - Bush Justice Department tried to derail but couldnt because it was being handled by career prosecutors in New York City .
Moon was convicted in 1982 and imprisoned for 13 months .
Buying Influence But Moons influence - buying operation was only just beginning .
He launched the Washington Times in 1982 and its staunch support for Reagan - Bush political interests quickly made it a favorite of Reagan , Bush and other influential Republicans .
Moon also made sure that his steady flow of cash found its way into the pockets of key conservative operatives , especially when they were most in need , when they were facing financial crises .
For instance , when the New Rights direct - mail whiz Richard Viguerie fell on hard times in the late 1980s , Moon had a corporation run by a chief lieutenant , Bo Hi Pak , buy one of Vigueries properties for $ 10 million .
[ See Orange County Register , Dec. 21 , 1987 ; Washington Post , Oct. 15 , 1989 ]
Moon also used the Washington Times and its affiliated publications to create seemingly legitimate conduits to funnel money to individuals and companies .
In another example of Moons largesse , the Washington Times hired Viguerie to conduct a pricy direct - mail subscription drive , boosting his profit margin .
Another case of saving a right - wing icon occurred when the Rev. Jerry Falwell was facing financial ruin over the debts piling up at Liberty University .
But the fundamentalist Christian school in Lynchburg , Va. , got a last - minute bail - out in the mid-1990s ostensibly from two Virginia businessmen , Dan Reber and Jimmy Thomas , who used their non-profit Christian Heritage Foundation to snap up a large chunk of Libertys debt for $ 2.5 million , a fraction of its face value .
Falwell rejoiced and called the moment  the greatest single day of financial advantage in the schools history , even though it was accomplished at the disadvantage of many small true - believing investors who had bought the church construction bonds through a Texas company .
But Falwells secret benefactor behind the debt purchase was Sun Myung Moon , who was kept in the background partly because of his controversial Biblical interpretations that hold Jesus to have been a failure and because of Moons alleged brainwashing of thousands of young Americans , often shattering their bonds with their biological families .
Moon had used his tax - exempt Womens Federation for World Peace to funnel $ 3.5 million to the Reber - Thomas Christian Heritage Foundation , the non-profit that purchased the schools debt .
I stumbled onto this Moon - Falwell connection by examining the Internal Revenue Service filings of Moons front groups .
The Women Federations vice president Susan Fefferman confirmed that the $ 3.5 million grant had gone to  Mr. Falwells people for the benefit of Liberty University .
The indirect funneling of money to Falwells school paralleled the technique used a decade later to donate funds to George H.W. Bushs presidential library .
[ For more on Moons funding of the Right , see Robert Parrys Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Bush Speeches Moon also used the Womens Federation to pay substantial speaking fees to George H.W. Bush , who gave talks at Moon - sponsored events .
In September 1995 , Bush and his wife , Barbara , gave six speeches in Asia for the Womens Federation .
In one speech on Sept. 14 to 50,000 Moon supporters in Tokyo , Bush said what really counts is faith , family and friends . 
Moons wife , Hak Ja Han Moon , followed the ex-President and announced that it has to be Reverend Moon to save the United States , which is in decline because of the destruction of the family and moral decay . 
[ Washington Post , Sept. 15 , 1995 ]
In summer 1996 , Bush was lending his prestige to Moon again .
Bush addressed the Moon - connected Family Federation for World Peace in Washington , an event that gained notoriety when comedian Bill Cosby tried to back out of his contract after learning of Moons connection .
Bush had no such qualms .
[ Washington Post , July 30 , 1996 ]
In fall 1996 , Moon needed the ex-Presidents help again .
Moon was trying to replicate his Washington Times influence in South America by opening a regional newspaper , Tiempos del Mundo .
But South American journalists were recounting unsavory chapters of Moons history , including his links to South Koreas feared intelligence service and various neo-fascist organizations .
In the early 1980s , Moon had used friendships with the military dictatorships in Argentina and Uruguay  which had been responsible for tens of thousands of political murders  to invest in those two countries .
There also were allegations of Moons links to the regions major drug traffickers .
[ For details on the drug ties , see Robert Parrys Lost History . ]
Heaven Sent Moons disciples fumed about the critical stories and accused the Argentine news media of trying to sabotage Moons plans for an inaugural gala in Buenos Aires on Nov. 23 , 1996 .
 The local press was trying to undermine the event ,  complained the churchs internal newsletter , Unification News .
Given the controversy , Argentinas elected president , Carlos Menem , decided to reject Moons invitation .
But Moon had a trump card : the endorsement of an ex-President of the United States , George H.W. Bush .
Agreeing to speak at the newspapers launch , Bush flew aboard a private plane , arriving in Buenos Aires on Nov. 22 .
Bush stayed at Menems official residence , the Olivos .
As the headliner at the newspapers inaugural gala , Bush saved the day , Moons followers gushed .
 Mr. Bushs presence as keynote speaker gave the event invaluable prestige ,  wrote the Unification News .
 Father [ Moon ] and Mother [ Mrs. Moon ] sat with several of the True Children [ Moons offspring ] just a few feet from the podium  where Bush spoke .
 I want to salute Reverend Moon ,  Bush declared .
 A lot of my friends in South America dont know about the Washington Times , but it is an independent voice .
The editors of the Washington Times tell me that never once has the man with the vision [ Moon ] interfered with the running of the paper , a paper that in my view brings sanity to Washington , D.C. 
Bushs speech was so effusive that it surprised even Moons followers .
 Once again , heaven turned a disappointment into a victory ,  the Unification News exulted .
 Everyone was delighted to hear his compliments .
We knew he would give an appropriate and nice speech , but praise in Fathers presence was more than we expected .
...
It was vindication .
We could just hear a sigh of relief from Heaven . 
While Bushs assertion about Moons Washington Times as a voice of sanity  may be a matter of opinion , Bushs vouching for its editorial independence simply wasnt true .
Almost since it opened in 1982 , a string of senior editors and correspondents have resigned , citing the manipulation of the news by Moon and his subordinates .
The first editor , James Whelan , resigned in 1984 , confessing that  I have blood on my hands  for helping Moons church achieve greater legitimacy .
Ties That Bind But Bushs boosterism was just what Moon needed in South America .
 The day after ,  the Unification News observed ,  the press did a 180 - degree about - turn once they realized that the event had the support of a U.S. President .
With Bushs help , Moon had gained another beachhead for his worldwide business - religious - political - media empire .
After the event , Menem told reporters from La Nacion that Bush had claimed privately to be only a mercenary who did not really know Moon .
 Bush told me he came and charged money to do it ,  Menem said .
[ La Nacion , Nov. 26 , 1996 ]
But Bush was not telling Menem the whole story .
By fall 1996 , Bush and Moon had been working in political tandem for at least a decade and a half .
The ex-President also had been earning huge speaking fees as a front man for Moon for more than a year .
Throughout these public appearances for Moon , Bushs office refused to divulge how much Moon - affiliated organizations have paid the ex-President .
But estimates of Bushs fee for the Buenos Aires appearance alone ran between $ 100,000 and $ 500,000 .
Sources close to the Unification Church told me that the total spending on Bush ran into the millions , with one source telling me that Bush stood to make as much as $ 10 million from Moons organization .
The senior George Bush may have had a political motive , too .
By 1996 , sources close to Bush were saying the ex-President was working hard to enlist well - to - do conservatives and their money behind the presidential candidacy of his son , George W. Bush .
Moon was one of the deepest pockets in right - wing circles .
North Korean Cash Moon , who has the status of a U.S. permanent resident alien , has skirted other federal laws , including prohibitions on financial relations with the hard - line communist government of North Korea .
Despite Moons history of extreme anti-communism , Moon began spreading money around inside North Korea  much as he has in other countries  while seeking business advantages during the first Bush administration , according to U.S. intelligence documents .
U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency documents , which I obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request , showed Moons organization paying millions of dollars to North Korean leaders .
The payments included a $ 3 million birthday present to current communist leader Kim Jong
Il and offshore payments amounting to several tens of million dollars to the previous communist dictator , Kim Il Sung , the partially declassified documents said .
Yet , in the 1990s , while Moon was passing out money , North Korea was scrambling for the resources to develop missiles and other advanced weaponry , including a nuclear weapons capability .
Moons activities attracted the attention of the Defense Intelligence Agency because it is responsible for monitoring potential military threats to the United States .
Moon negotiated one North Korean business deal in 1991 , after face - to - face meetings with Kim Il Sung , the longtime communist leader , the DIA documents said .
 These talks took place secretly , without the knowledge of the South Korean government ,  the DIA wrote on Feb. 2 , 1994 .
 In the original deal with Kim [ Il Sung ] , Moon paid several tens of million dollars as a down - payment into an overseas account ,  the DIA said in a cable dated Aug. 14 , 1994 .
The DIA said Moon 's organization also delivered money to Kim Il Sung 's son and successor , Kim Jong Il .
 In 1993 , the Unification Church sold a piece of property located in Pennsylvania ,  the DIA reported on Sept. 9 , 1994 .
 The profit on the sale , approximately $ 3 million was sent through a bank in China to the Hong Kong branch of the KS [ South Korean ] company  Samsung Group . 
The money was later presented to Kim Jung Il [ Kim Jong Il ] as a birthday present .
After Kim Il Sung 's death in 1994 and his succession by his son , Kim Jong Il , Moon dispatched his longtime aide , Bo Hi Pak , to ensure that the business deals were still on track with Kim Jong
Il and his coterie ,  the DIA reported .
 If necessary , Moon authorized Pak to deposit a second payment for Kim Jong Il ,  the DIA wrote .
The DIA declined to elaborate on the documents .
 As for the documents you have , you have to draw your own conclusions ,  said DIA spokesman , U.S. Navy Capt .
Michael Stainbrook .

Contacted in Seoul , South Korea , Bo Hi Pak , a former publisher of the Washington Times , denied that payments were made to individual North Korean leaders and called absolutely untrue the DIAs description of the $ 3 million land sale benefiting Kim Jong Il .
But Bo Hi Pak acknowledged that Moon met with North Korean officials and negotiated business deals with them in the early 1990s .
Pak said the North Korean business investments were structured through South Korean entities .
 Reverend Moon is not doing this in his own name ,  Pak said .
Pak said he went to North Korea in 1994 , after Kim Il Sungs death , only to express condolences  to Kim Jong Il on behalf of Moon and his wife .
Pak denied that another purpose of the trip was to pass money to Kim Jong
Il or to his associates .
Asked about the seeming contradiction between Moons avowed anti-communism and his friendship with leaders of a communist state , Pak said ,  This is time for reconciliation .
We 're not looking at ideological differences .
We are trying to help them out with food and other humanitarian needs .
Samsung officials said they could find no information in their files about the alleged $ 3 million payment .
Embargo Busting North Korean officials clearly valued their relationship with Moon .
In February 2000 , on Moons 80th birthday , Kim Jong Il sent Moon a gift of rare wild ginseng , an aromatic root used medicinally , Reuters reported .
Because of the long - term U.S. embargo against North Korea  eased only in 2000  Moons alleged payments to the communist leaders raised potential legal issues for Moon especially if some of the money stemmed from a land sale in Pennsylvania .
 Nobody in the United States was supposed to be providing funding to anybody in North Korea , period , under the Treasury ( Department 's ) sanction regime ,  said Jonathan Winer , former deputy assistant secretary of state handling international crime .
The U.S. embargo of North Korea dated back to the Korean War .
With a few exceptions for humanitarian goods , the embargo barred trade and financial dealings between North Korea and all U.S. citizens and permanent residents wherever they are located , and all branches , subsidiaries and controlled affiliates of U.S. organizations throughout the world .
Moon became a permanent resident of the United States in 1973 , according to Justice Department records .
When interviewed in 2000 , Bo Hi Pak said Moon had kept his green card status .
Though often in South Korea and South America , Moon maintained a residence near Tarrytown , north of New York City , and controlled dozens of affiliated U.S. companies .
Direct payments to foreign leaders in connection with business deals also could prompt questions about possible violations of the U.S. Corrupt Practices Act , a prohibition against overseas bribery .
Ironically , although Moon reportedly gave North Korea desperately needed foreign capital , Moons Washington Times attacked the Clinton administration for failing to take a more aggressive stand against North Koreas missile program .
The newspaper called the administrations policy an abdication of responsibility for national security .
Moon also was consolidating his influence with American conservatives as he was growing increasingly anti-American .
While former President Bush was hailing Moon in public in the mid-1990s , Moon was calling the United States  Satans harvest  and claiming that American women descended from a line of prostitutes .
But Moon understood one basic rule of politics that applied the world over : money talks .
He knew he could get politicians to do his bidding if the bribes were big enough .
In one sermon on Jan. 2 , 1996 , Moon was unusually blunt about how he expected his wealth to buy influence among the powerful in South America , just as it had in Washington .
 Father has been practicing the philosophy of fishing here ,  Moon said , through an interpreter who spoke of Moon in the third person .
 He [ Moon ] gave the bait to Uruguay and then the bigger fish of Argentina , Brazil and Paraguay kept their mouths open , waiting for a bigger bait silently .
The bigger the fish , the bigger the mouth .
Therefore , Father is able to hook them more easily .
For Moon , there has been no bigger fish than the powerful Bush family and its many friends in the U.S. government .

The laptop for the world 's children should be durable and self - reliant
The laptop will be tough and foldable in different ways , with a hand crank for when there is no power supply .
Professor Negroponte came up with the idea for a cheap computer for all after visiting a Cambodian village .
His non-profit One Laptop Per Child group plans to have up to 15 million machines in production within a year .
A prototype of the machine should be ready in November at the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) in Tunisia .
Children in Brazil , China , Egypt , Thailand , and South Africa will be among the first to get the under - $ 100 ( £ 57 ) computer , said Professor Negroponte at the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT .
The following year , Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney plans to start buying them for all 500,000 middle and high school pupils in the state .
Professor Negroponte predicts there could be 100 million to 150 million shipped every year by 2007 .
Virtually indestructible
The laptops will be encased in rubber to make them more durable , and their AC adaptors will also act as carrying straps .
The Linux - based machines are expected to have a 500MHz processor , with flash memory instead of a hard drive which has more delicate moving parts .
The laptop will be more rugged and flexible than ordinary ones
It will also have a dual - mode display so that it can still be used in varying light conditions outside .
It will be a colour display , but users will be able to switch easily to monochrome mode so that it can be viewed in bright sunlight , at four times normal resolution .
When Professor Negroponte saw the benefits of donated notebook PCs that Cambodian children could carry around with them , he immediately set about planning the sub -$ 100 machines .
The project has some big - name supporters on board , including Google , which is working on thin - client applications .
Thin client computing means several machines can share programs when linked up to a central " brain " , or server .
Making them so cheap would mean that developing nations would be able to afford to bulk - buy them , although Professor Negroponte thinks that even $ 100 remains too expensive for some .
He said he is committed to the idea that children all over the world should be equipped with technology so that they can tap into the educational and communications benefits of the net .
Power is a big issue for developing nations in particular when it comes to technology , which is why the hand crank will be fitted to supply extra juice when it is needed .
By using innovative technologies , such as electronic ink displays , the MIT team thinks it can reduce power consumption even further on the computers .
Such displays require very little power to work .
The Simputer is a handheld solution for developing nations
A sub -£ 100 box , called Nivo , has been developed by UK not - for - profit group , Ndiyo .
It runs on open source software and works as a thin client .
The Simputer has also been developed for developing nations .
It is a cheap handheld computer designed by Indian scientists .
NASA administrator says space shuttle was a mistake By Traci Watson , USA TODAY
The space shuttle and International Space Station — nearly the whole of the U.S. manned space program for the past three decades — were mistakes , NASA chief Michael Griffin said Tuesday .
NASA chief Michael Griffin on the space shuttle : " It is now commonly accepted that was not the right path . "
By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY
In a meeting with USA TODAY 's editorial board , Griffin said NASA lost its way in the 1970s , when the agency ended the Apollo moon missions in favor of developing the shuttle and space station , which can only orbit Earth .
" It is now commonly accepted that was not the right path , " Griffin said .
" We are now trying to change the path while doing as little damage as we can . "
The shuttle has cost the lives of 14 astronauts since the first flight in 1981 .
Roger Pielke Jr. , a space policy expert at the University of Colorado , estimates that NASA has spent about $ 150 billion on the program since its inception in 1971 .
The total cost of the space station by the time it 's finished — in 2010 or later — may exceed $ 100 billion , though other nations will bear some of that .
Image gallery Check out how NASA plans to use elements of the Apollo and shuttle programs for the next moon mission .
Only now is the nation 's space program getting back on track , Griffin said .
He announced last week that NASA aims to send astronauts back to the moon in 2018 in a spacecraft that would look like the Apollo capsule .
The goal of returning Americans to the moon was laid out by President Bush in 2004 , before Griffin took the top job at NASA .
Bush also said the shuttle would be retired in 2010 .
Griffin has made clear in previous statements that he regards the shuttle and space station as misguided .
He told the Senate earlier this year that the shuttle was " inherently flawed " and that the space station was not worth " the expense , the risk and the difficulty " of flying humans to space .
But since he became NASA administrator , Griffin has n't been so blunt about the two programs .
Asked Tuesday whether the shuttle had been a mistake , Griffin said , " My opinion is that it was .
...
It was a design which was extremely aggressive and just barely possible . "
Asked whether the space station had been a mistake , he said , " Had the decision been mine , we would not have built the space station we 're building in the orbit we 're building it in . "
Joe Rothenberg , head of NASA 's manned space programs from 1995 to 2001 , defended the programs for providing lessons about how to operate in space .
But he conceded that " in hindsight , there may have been other ways . "
More than a billion downloads have been bought from iTunes
Currently , songs bought from Apple 's iTunes music store can only be played on Apple - manufactured iPods .
The bill would mean any digital song could be played on any player , regardless of its format or source .
But the legislation leaves room for artists to sign deals with Apple and others , enabling them to restrict which systems their music will play on .
' State - sponsored piracy '
Under the bill , companies such as Apple , Sony and Microsoft could be made to share their proprietary copy - protection systems .
It was intended to deter piracy and ensure no single company dominated the fast - growing music download market .
In March , Apple said the law would encourage " a state - sponsored culture of piracy " , and hinted that it could withdraw from the French market .
The law has been watered down and the loophole to allow artists to sign exclusive deals with individual companies was added last month .
Final stage
The bill will also create a new independent authority to decide when " interoperability " should apply .
Both the Senate and the National Assembly , France 's upper and lower houses , voted in favour of the bill , the final stage before it becomes law .
More than one billion downloads have been purchased from the iTunes store since it was set up three years ago .
The legislation also includes anti-piracy measures threatening fines of thousands of euros and prison sentences for professional copiers .
とかく、日本はITに関しては、国際的な視点で見るとボロボロだ。
そういわれても、日本のみなさんは、あまり実感が湧かないかもしれない。
以前は、安くインドの労働力を使ってなんて言っていたが、おそらく、それが逆転するのももうすぐだろう。とにかく、インド（およびアメリカ）のIT業界のビジネスマンのスタンスは、日本のそれとは全く違う。
日本では、B2Cや他業種向けのIT商品（業界特化型パッケージやコンシューマーソフト）がいわゆる商社や販社などが扱いやすい製品ということになる。
だから、開発系など、IT業界におけるB2Bの製品を出しても販路の開拓がむずかしく、なかなかそのようなベンチャーが育たない。
では、アメリカや海外ではどうだろうか。
アメリカやインドでは、B2Bの製品がIT業界では主流だ。ベンチャーキャピタルからの出資も、B2B製品を扱うベンチャーに対する出資がほとんどだ。
では、なぜそのようなことになってしまうのか。
答えは、日本と海外の企業の経営者や決裁者のスタンス、つまりは企業の文化にある。
日本の企業は、 「プロの経営者」というものは、財務処理や戦略などのプロとみなされ、現場はある程度知っていれば良いとされる。現場を知らなくても野生の感で凄腕経営者は意思決定できるというつわものがそろっているようだ。
海外の 「プロの経営者」というものは、マーケッターもしくはセールスのプロで、豊富な経験によるマーケットの高度な分析を行う人だ。B2Cの場合はあまりそうではないが、B2Bのビジネスでは、現場を知ることなしに戦略を決定するなどということは、リスクが高すぎて当然ながらありえない。
戦略の決定には、リアリティーのあるロジカルな思考が必要なのだ。
例えばであるが、日本に来ているインド人で会社を経営している人は、もともとは自分もエンジニアを経験しているケースが多い。
実際に先週会ったインド人経営者も、今は現場を若干離れ気味だが、もともとはエンジニアだ。会社の規模的には大体５０人くらいだ。
もう、エンジニアをやっていないから、HibernateやStruts , Springなどというのはあんまり知らないかと思いきや、全然そんなことはない。
このインド人エンジニア経営者は、自分で実際に触ったり、現場のエンジニアに評価させて、どのくらいのレベルのエンジニアならこれを使って作業できるとか、どういうパーツを作るのにはどのフレームワークがよいとか、現場レベルの知識をバッチリ持っている。
セールスがメインの仕事になっても、自分で時間を作ってコツコツと勉強しているのだ。
だから、プロ向けのツールなどでも、説明が非常に簡単である。
日本の経営者と比べると 「おお！すごい！」とおもいきや、実は、彼らにとってこれは当たり前のことなのである。
なぜならば、彼らは、請負の開発を日本で取る際に、見積もりをきちんとできねば自殺行為だからだ。
しかも、インドのエンジニアは、サービス残業はしないし、雇われている人はいわれたことを言われた時間しかしない。日本だと意外かもしれないが、海外では当たり前のことである。
また、単なる経営者（＝単純なセールスや経理）とエンジニアでは、海外ではエンジニアの方が給料が高い。日本のように「経営者＝高給」「雇われエンジニア＝薄給でコキ使われる」という暗黙のルールなど存在しない。
むしろ、逆である 。
これだけのリスクを乗り越えられる能力を持ってして初めて、B2Bの事業の場合「経営者」としての立場が成り立つわけである。それゆえ、海外のB2BのIT企業の経営者は理系のエリート大学を出た人がほとんどだ。
だから、インド人の会社経営者は常に必死で勉強したり、新しいものを探したり毎日行っている。
彼らが探しているものは、そのような経営のリスクを少しでもやわらげられるものだ。
だから、開発を支援するようなツールを提案すると、本当に目の色を変えて飛びついてくる。
そういう製品を売ってくれといっても、「売るよりも自分が使った方が儲かるから買う」という。
でも、販売も興味あるからいろいろマーケティングで協力してくれると言う。
本当にありがたい 。
彼らにとっては、時間はリアルに金なのだ。従業員はおとなしくサービス残業はしない。
一方、日本の場合 「 経営者でも分かる説明にしなくてはだめだ」と、いわゆる日本の「販売のプロ」は言うが、これは、「大学の専門課程の数学を小学生１年生に、大学のテストで60点以上取れるように教えろ」というのと同じだ。
だから、日本で開発支援系のITツールなど、B2B（ITの同業者向け）ビジネスを支援するソフトを開発してプロトタイプが出来たら、日本にあるインド人が経営する会社に持っていくといい。

Need money fast ?
Perhaps you need to pay for a sudden health expense , or you ’ve got a broken appliance in your home that needs immediate repair .
When emergencies happen , it ’s hard to find the support you need as quickly as you need it .
How much would you like to borrow ?
$ 100 $ 200 $ 300 $ 400 $ 500 $ 600 $ 700 $ 800 $ 900 $ 1000 $ 1100 $ 1200 $ 1300 $ 1400 $ 1500 $ 1600 $ 1700 $ 1800 $ 1900 $ 2000 $ 2100 $ 2200 $ 2300 $ 2400 $ 2500 $ 2600 $ 2700 $ 2800 $ 2900 $ 3000 $ 3100 $ 3200 $ 3300 $ 3400 $ 3500 $ 3600 $ 3700 $ 3800 $ 3900 $ 4000 $ 4100 $ 4200 $ 4300 $ 4400 $ 4500 $ 4600 $ 4700 $ 4800 $ 4900 $ 5000 Get Started

While anyone can struggle to find cash in an emergency situation , the people who suffer the most are usually those with bad credit .
Unfortunately , while it takes years to develop a good credit score that attracts the best deals from lenders , a single mistake can destroy your rating .
As people across the US continue to struggle to find fast funding thanks to high costs and low incomes , poor credit ratings are becoming increasingly common .
Since traditional lenders will avoid you at all costs if you want to borrow money with poor credit , you need to seek out alternative solutions .
Fortunately , for people who own their vehicle outright , or those who have very little loan left on it , there could be a solution .
Otherwise known as a fast auto loan , car title loans are quick and easy ways to get money for emergencies , without having to worry about a bank .
Here ’s what you need to know about this kind of lending .
What is a Car Title Loan ?
A car title loan is very similar to a payday loan , in that it offers you quick access to money when you need it most .
This kind of lending is designed for people who need to access money quickly for emergency expenses like essential bills or debts .
The good thing about title lending , is that it does n’t matter if you have a bad credit rating .
The company that offers you your loan will be getting a kind of security in exchange for the money that they lend you .
Basically , this means that when you borrow cash from a title loan , you promise the title to your car to the lender if you ca n’t make the repayment .
While payday loans are unsecured repayment options , title car loans are secured loans that rely on using your car as collateral .
To get one of these online loans , you need to own your car 100 % , and you need a clear title , without any liens on your vehicle .
However , similarly to payday loans , car title loans also require you to make your repayments quite quickly , often by your next payday .
This means that you can get in and out of debt as quickly as possible , without having to worry about ongoing repayments for very long .
How Does a Title Loan Work
When you agree to a car title loan , you ’ll usually hand over the title or deed to your car until you ’ve repaid the loan in full .
While there are a lot of states that do n’t allow weekly installment loans , there are a handful that are beginning to explore this option as an easy and accessible way for people with bad credit to borrow the money that they need .
Depending on where you apply for your car title loan , you may need to visit a lender in person at a physical store , or you could complete the entire process online .
If you do complete the application online , it ’s a little more complicated than applying for a traditional payday loan .
While a standard payday loan allows you to get everything done online and receive the money you need within a matter of hours , car title loans demand that you visit a company in person .
That ’s because with title lending , you need to give the loan company physical ownership of your title for a short period of time .
This can make the process a little more complicated and lengthy for some customers .
You ’ll also need to provide some basic proof of ID , such as car documents that specify you own the vehicle , and proof of your car insurance .
The good news is that if you can visit the title lender in person , it ’s usually a process of simply walking in and signing a few papers .
You then walk away with a direct deposit or check for the amount of money that you need .
Not accounting for the time it takes to visit the location , the whole process usually takes less than 30 minutes .
If you get approved for your title loan , you will get the title back when the debt is repaid .
You ’ll be able to agree on the terms and conditions of the loan with your lender before you sign over your title in exchange for the borrowing opportunity .
How Much Can You Borrow This Way ?
The amount that you can borrow from a title pledge loan can differ depending on a number of factors , including the lender that you work with .
Usually , you ’ll be able to borrow anywhere up to 50 % of the value of your car .
This means that you can get a few thousand dollars quite easily this way .
When the time comes to repay what you owe , you often make that payment in person , or online through automatic direct debits from your checking account .
Like with payday loans , because you ’re paying the interest of your title loan all at once , rather than over an extended time , you ’ll usually have a slightly higher fee to consider on top of your repayment .
While many people worry that car title lenders will immediately claim their vehicle if they can’t pay back what they owe , this is rarely the case .
A lot of companies that provide this kind of lending will be willing to discuss options with you if you contact them and let them know that you need longer to make your repayments .
You can sometimes roll your existing loan into a new title loan , for instance .
However , the more you roll over your loan , the more fees you will need to pay .
That ’s often why people prefer to avoid the stress of a title loan and stick to a standard payday loan instead .
Why Do People Get Title Loans ?
A car title loan is just like any other lending opportunity , it has positives and negatives to consider .
On the downside , if you ca n’t repay your loan for any reason , then the lender will have the right to repossess your car and claim your title .
This means that you wo n’t have your vehicle anymore .
However , regardless of what kind of loan you take out , it ’s fair to say that all lenders have the right to seek compensation for the money that they give you if you ca n’t make repayments .
Because of this , a car title loan is no more dangerous than any other loan option .
Additionally , because you ’re getting a secured loan rather than a standard payday loan that is unsecured , you ’ll have a few more lending options available to you .
For instance , the biggest benefit of a title loan is that it ’s available to anyone – even people with bad credit , or no credit .
In some cases , a title loan provider will only run a soft check on your credit to see if you ’re eligible for the money .
This means that you do n’t walk away with any black marks on your credit report .
On the downside , the lenders also wo n’t report your payments to the credit agencies , so your credit score wo n’t improve either .
Because of this , if you want to improve your credit rating , it ’s probably better to choose a standard payday loan instead .
Another major bonus of a title loan is that you can usually borrow a lot more this way than you could with a payday loan .
You need to be earning a certain amount of cash every month to get a specific amount of money , but if you can prove that you can make the repayments , you ’re free to borrow up to 50 % of your car ’s value .
Alternatively , most payday loans do put limits on the amount you can borrow , which makes it harder to get all the cash that you need at once to deal with an emergency .

Finding the Right Car Title Loan
If you decide that a car title loan is the best way for you to lend , then you ’ll need to go out and find the company that ’s right for you .
There are many different loan providers available today that offer this kind of payday loan .
Comparing your options will help to ensure that you ’re getting the best interest rates and the lowest fees .
You can also do some research into the solutions available in your specific state or area when you ’re doing your research .
For instance , the Military Lending
Act offers special support for people in the military and their dependents when taking out any kind of loan – including a title loan .
It ’s worth looking into this extra protections if you can get them .
Once you ’ve found the title loan that ’s right for you , it ’s simply a matter of signing on the dotted line , making your repayments , and walking away with the cash that you need , without the stress of any long - term monthly installments .
Could this be the right lending option for you ?
I did n’t want to write about this .
Hell , I did n’t even want to know about it .
I remember the first time I heard of it while I was in Amman .
Eblis sent me an e-mail titled “ Behold the revolution in Egypt ” with a link to malek ’s post on it and I stupidly clicked on it and was presented with a reality that I did n’t want or desire to confront .
The story is as follows for the those of you who did n’t hear about it :
It was the first day of Eid , and a new film was opening downtown .
Mobs of males gatherd trying to get in , but when the show was sold out , they decided they will destroy the box office .
After accomplishing that , they went on what can only be described as a sexual frenxy :
They ran around grabbing any and every girl in sight , whether a niqabi , a Hijabi or uncoverd .
Whether egyptian or foreigner .
Even pregnant ones .
They grabbed them , molested them , tried to rip their cloths off and rape them , all in front of the police , who did n’t do shit .
The good people of downtown tried their best to protect the girls .
Shop owners would let the girls in and lock the doors , while the mobs tried to break in .
Taxi drivers put the girls in the cars while the mobs were trying to break the glass and grab the girls out .
It was a disgusting pandamonium of sexual assaults that lasted for 5 houres from 7:30 PM to 12:30 am , and it truns my stomach just to think about it .
I called my father when I heard of that happening , and he informed me that he did n’t hear of it at all .
They watched Al Jazeerah , CNN , flipped through opposition newspapers , and nothing .
Nada .
Nobody mentioned it .
As if it did n’t happen .
But it did .
The bloggers available downtown documented the whole thing , and provided pictures of it as well .
Reading their accounts I ca n’t help by feel my heart being torn on what the people of the country has turned to .
The one that broke my heart the most was Sharqawi ’s account ( remember , he is the guy who got sexually assaulted by the police during interrogation ) and how it suddenly danwed at him that what happend to him was n;t an isolated incident .
That The Police forces did n;t came from another planet , that they were born and raised egyptians , amongst the egyptian people , the same egyptian people who have produced those mobs who found it in their right to attack girls in middle of crowded downtown for 5 houres under the police ’s watchdul eyes .
The ones who approached the police asking them to do something were told : “ what do you want us to do ?
It ’s Eid. Happy Eid to you too ! ”
The same response was given to women who went to the police stations to report the incidents .
The police refused to do their jobs and take a report , because it would probably reflect badly on their downtown peers .
Some people were surprised at the Police ’s reaction , but the majoirty of us were n’t .
Those are the same police officers who facilitated the assaults on women last year during the referendum .
This is business as usual for them .
What was unusual was the silence of the press .
Nobody was mentioning it .
Nobody was bringing it up .
It seemed like there was some consensus of just not reporting it and maybe it will just go away .
What at first seemed like a conspiracy got later on confirmed by my sources in the news media .
Al Jazeera had taped the incidents but were forbidden to air it at the request of the egyptian authorities .
The editor at a leading newspaper refused to touch it with a 6 foot pole .
This was going to be one of those incidents that only the blogsphere would talk about , while the mainstream media ignored .
Until Nawarah
Negm blew the whole thing wide open on live television on the Dream Channel .
She was brought in as a writer to be part of a fluffy segment on Mona Al Shazly show talking about the Ramadan TV shows , and the girl ’s first response to the question was : “ What Television shows do you want to discuss , when egyptian girls are assaulted on the streets of Cairo while the police watched and did nothing ? ”
When Mona counterd that she never heard of it before , Nawarah told her all about it , in details and how it ’s all over the internet .
All of Egypt saw that .
The cat was out of the bag .
A cover -up was no longer feasiable .
When I spoke to the brilliant Nawarah yesterday , she told me that she was debating talking about it or not on television , that was until she was faced with the camera and found herself on the air , and just could n’t hold herself back .
She went for it , and god bless her for having the guts to do that .
The next day , Mona Al Shazly went and did a segment on the incident and interviewed the people on the street .
The video of the segment is here ( arabic , sorry ) .
She even contacted the Ministery of Interior for a statement .
You know what their response was ?
“ We did n’t hear of anything .
This did n’t happen .
Things were just crowded in downtown that day , but no girls were assaulted , because no police reports were filed in that regard ! ”
FUCKERS !
I am not one of those people who claims to be above hate .
I do hate , and I hate quite passionately , the same way when I love I love passionately .
But I have to say that I have never hated anyone or group as much as I hate the egyptian police at this moment .
It ’s a hate of unequaled proportions .
I really would n’t mind them all dying horrible deaths right now .
A police force that does n’t protect its citizens , especially its women , has no business being on the streets .
They become nothing more than an organized armed gang now in my opinion , even lower , because they are shaming everyone who wore theat uniform before and did his job .
THEY DESERVE TO DIE !
Anyway , the TV show brought it up , and now Egypt ’s leading newspaper , Al Masry Al youm , featured two columns on the incident .
More is bound to come and this national shame will be exposed and confronted .
Now , the egyptian blogsphere has been abuzz in debate over the incident .
Some are writing posts on why it happend , possible causes , what it means , the social and political factors that could possibly lead to this behavior , and quite honestly , I ca n’t be botherd .
I do n’t care why it happend .
Rape is not up for debate .
I just care that it happend .
What we should discuss right now is n’t what caused it , but what kind of horrible punishment that should be enacted on any egyptian male who thinks that it is well into his right to sexually harass a female on the street .
That ’s it .
Pure and simple .
I am often told that I am too westernized or too liberal by people I know , and they are not wrong or inaccurate .
My values are for the most part western values .
However , there are two middle - eastern traits in me that I can never give up :
The first is my stupid insistince on always paying for the bill when I am with a girl I am dating , and the second is my protectiveness of women .
I have no tolerance for those who assault women sexually in any way , and that almost got me kicked out of my school in Boston when I broke the leg of one of my roommates who raped a friend of mine .
The incident only resulted in him getting a broken leg because people stoped me before I killed him .
And I had the full intention of killing him .
Rapists do not deserve to live .
And that ’s how I feel towards every single one of those pieces of shit that attacked women on the streets of cairo the other day .
People can debate solutions based on dialogue , education , or whatever and that ’s their right .
My solution is far simpler :
Any egyptian man whose mother raised him right should beat the living crap of any man he sees on the street that assaults or harasses a female .
Think of them as your sisters , and act accordingly .
The Police is n’t interested in protecting the women , and that ’s fine , but that means that we should take this job as our own .
Those who insist on acting like animals will be treated as such , and deserve no sympathy or mercy from us .
I assure you , if we did this , if we undertook this as part of our national duty , there will no longer be a problem on our streets .
That is all !

It seems that most every culture has a legend of a great society , ripe with wealth and wisdom , which is lost to the sea .
To westerners these are the stories of Atlantis or Thule .
To many of the peoples of the South Pacific it is Lemuria or Menehune .
To Asians it is called Mu , and was home to people who could fly and who drank an elixir that would cease aging .
After years of searching , and combing the Pacific for a possible lost land that could have been the root of one of these legends , it is clear that there is no extra continent in the sea .
However , in 1986 , a SCUBA diver , Kihachiro Aratake , diving off the coast of the island of Yonaguni - jima discovered something that may lend credence to the existence of Mu or Lemuria .
On the sea floor he found vast geometric structures cut out of the rock .
There was evidence of stairs , and improbable angles in the stone .
He marked the location for future divers , and in the intervening years these undersea ruins have come to be known as the “ Yonaguni Monuments ” .
Efforts to date the monument are derived from the last time the area was above sea level , which would have been approximately 8,000 - 10,000 years ago⁠ — about 3 - 5 millennia before Egypt ’s pyramids were erected .
If the monuments were indeed built by humankind , it would require some dramatic revisions to the accepted chronological history of humanity .
Not far from a set of cliffs called “ Iseki Point ” , the main structure of the Yonaguni Monuments lies under about two hundred feet of water .
It is about 240 feet long , 90 feet wide , and 45 feet tall .
There appear to be clear cut stairs , and to many there are distinct similarities to ancient buildings found on Okinawa , or even heiau temples on Hawaii .
Various structures surround the main building , and they seem to stretch out into a road spanning approximately 311 miles leading to Okinawa and its neighboring islands .
But as clearly defined as the structures are to some , there are others who disparage the tale of the Yonaguni Monuments .
No chambers or entrances have ever been found into the monuments , and no tools have been found in the vicinity to clearly indicate human involvement .
Many assert that the formations can be attributed to erosion or coral settlements .
The sharp angles and lines in the stone may be the result of the way the stones erode⁠ — breaking off at right angles .
One can look to the cliffs above the sea to observe that the regional stone tends to erode in a way that leaves naturally sharp angles .
Perhaps the most reasonable theory , however , is one which suggests that the mounds of stone are natural features that were carved and shaped into terraces by early man .
This theory adequately explains the lack of entrance into the monuments , and the apparent post holes and etchings made in the rock .
Because of the submerged location and the strong currents in the area , the Yonaguni Monuments have proved difficult to properly study ; though the area has become a popular site for SCUBA tours .
Researchers have not yet found conclusive evidence implicating either erosion or humanity as the source of these shapes , so the investigation and debate regarding the nature of the Yonaguni Monuments continues .

Stephen Colbert is running at full stride .
As he enters the studio , the audience is already cheering .
He is dressed , as he seems always to be dressed , in a sharp suit and conservative tie , with rectangular rimless glasses and perfectly parted hair , so that when he does his short victory lap on the floor of the studio , he looks like a gleeful bank manager who ’s just won the lottery or possibly lost his mind .
He thrusts his arms out in mock triumph .
The audience roars .
He offers a couple of V - for-victory gestures that are part Richard Nixon and part chest - thumping , peace - out - homey sign .
Then he motions for everyone to quiet down and asks , “ Do you have any questions ?
Anything you want to know about me before I go into character and start saying these terrible things ? ”
A hand in the front row shoots up before he finishes .
The woman looks so excited to be here that you suspect she ’s wearing homemade Colbert pajamas under her clothes .
She stands and addresses Colbert .
“ So how did it feel to give the president the verbal finger at the White House press - corps dinner ? ”
The audience roars again .
“ Ah , yes , ” says Colbert , of the night that vaulted him from a cult - TV comedian to a lantern - wielding folk hero in the dark .
“ The press - corps dinner . ”
He smiles a slightly wary , slightly weary smile .
The audience roars again .
This has been a very good year for Stephen Colbert , both the 42 - year - old , God-fearing , Catholic Church–attending comedian and his even - more - God- fearing , lefty - baiting , fact - averse TV alter ego .
He ’s about to celebrate the first anniversary of his show , The Colbert Report , on the very first episode of which he coined truthiness , a term that ’s been embraced as the summarizing concept of our age .
He was invited to give the keynote speech at a dinner for the president and wound up delivering a controversial , possibly very funny , possibly horribly unfunny , possibly bravely patriotic , and possibly near - seditious monologue that earned him a crazed mob of lunatic followers who await his every command .
( Which is ironic , not least to Colbert , since his show is essentially a satire of the kinds of people who have crazed mobs of lunatic followers who await their every command . )
And he finds himself smack - dab in the middle of an election season in which farce — a language that , right now , no one is speaking more fluently than Colbert — is barely outpacing the front page .
On a recent Monday morning , he scanned a preliminary script for that evening ’s show , on which topic one was Republican Mark Foley and his lewd messages to teenage congressional pages .
Colbert was practically giggling .
“ This is my favorite part , ” he said , then slipped into his character ’s voice .
“ People , you do n’t understand : He was the co-chairman of the Caucus for Missing and Exploited Children ! ”
He cracks up , partly at the delectable irony and partly at the word caucus .
The underlying message in his grin , though , is clear : Seriously — you can’t make this shit up .
But the real reason he ’s having a very good year is that we ’re about to head to the polls in what the Times has characterized as “ the most toxic midterm campaign environment in memory , ” amid a barrage of attack ads that play out like Colbert - penned parodies .
One Republican spot criticizes a Wisconsin Democrat and doctor for suing patients who had n’t paid their medical bills and includes the line “ Why do n’t you just tell the truth , Dr. Millionaire ? , ” which is impossible to hear without imagining it in Colbert ’s scolding , mock - stentorian voice .
The president recently reached a compromise on torture legislation by redefining the meaning of torture .
When a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the war in Iraq had increased the terrorist threat to America , the White House ’s official response was that the war in Iraq had not , in fact , increased the terrorist threat to America .
Colbert ’s cleverly worded political doublespeak — like the press - corps - dinner joke “ Do n’t pay attention to the approval ratings that say 68 percent of Americans disapprove of the job [ Bush ] is doing .
I ask you this :
Does that not also logically mean that 68 percent of Americans approve of the job he ’s not doing ? ” — could plausibly have come from the mouth of Tony Snow .
Or Donald Rumsfeld .
Or Karl Rove .
“ Language has always been important in politics , but language is incredibly important to the present political struggle , ” Colbert says .
“ Because if you can establish an atmosphere in which information does n’t mean anything , then there is no objective reality .
The first show we did , a year ago , was our thesis statement :
What you wish to be true is all that matters , regardless of the facts .
Of course , at the time , we thought we were being farcical . ”

It ’s been a very good year for Stephen Colbert because it ’s witnessed the birth of the Colbertocracy .
We ’re just voting in it .
For six seasons , Colbert co-starred as one of several sidekicks to Jon Stewart on Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show .
He ’d actually started on the show in 1997 , two years before Stewart arrived , back when it was hosted by Craig Kilborn and was less a pointed political satire than a pell - mell send - up of corny local - news affiliates .
Under Stewart , though , Colbert developed his trademark persona .
With his cocked eyebrow and deadpan glare , he played the self - serious , implacable right - wing counterpoint to Stewart ’s skeptical anchor .
On the night in 2000 that Al Gore finally conceded the presidency , Colbert turned to Stewart after they ’d finished taping and said , “ This is the best job in television . ”
In those years , though , The Daily Show was , by design , organized as Jon Stewart and the Stewartettes .
Colbert was one of two emerging stars :
The other was Steve Carell , he of the dusty brown hair and goofy grin .
After Carell left in 2004 to star in NBC ’s sitcom The Office ( and The 40 - Year - Old Virgin ) , Colbert became Stewart ’s de facto second - in - command , subbing as the anchor when Stewart was on vacation .
But it was clear that Colbert was outgrowing his role .
“ If your name ’s not Jon Stewart , there ’s only so many places you can go on The Daily Show , ” says Ben Karlin , the 35 - year - old executive producer of both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report .
“ Steve Carell and Steve Colbert were the first two we identified as giant talents with breakout potential .
But we did n’t have the mechanism in place when Steve Carell started getting offers , so he left .
With Stephen , we said , ‘ Let ’s not just let him go off and become a huge star and not be working with the guy . ’ ”
Looking back now on The Daily Show , Colbert says , “ I could n’t imagine how much longer I could do it .
I still liked it , and I did n’t want to not like it . ”
So on the day after the 2004 Emmys in L.A. , at which The Daily Show won the Best Writing and Best Variety Series awards , Colbert met with Doug Herzog , the head of Comedy Central .
Herzog wanted to expand the Daily Show franchise , and Stewart and Karlin were looking for a TV show for their production company , Busboy .
So they decided to do their first project with Colbert .
The Colbert Report premiered on October 17 , 2005 , and it was well received , though there were a few grumpy dissenters among the critics , including me .
( I even went so far as to compare it unfavorably in print with David Spade ’s show on Comedy Central , something about which I will be continually reminded while seated in the waiting room of hell . )
Sure , it was funny , but here was the dilemma :
An entire program built around a caustic right - wing bully — with no impish Jon Stewart to leaven the irony — struck some ( well , me ) as a joke with a built - in stale date .
Still , the debut episode had its moments , such as the introduction of a segment titled “ The Word , ” which facilitates an opening rant by Colbert .
On the first show , the word was supposed to be truth , because a central element of Colbert ’s character is his distinction between “ truth ” and “ facts . ”
“ I ’m not a fan of facts , ” he declared on - air , by way of a manifesto .
“ You see , the facts can change , but my opinion will never change , no matter what the facts are . ”
At about 3:30 on the day of the first taping , during a rehearsal , Colbert stopped and beckoned to his writers .
He ’d decided they needed a better word .
“ It ’s not stupid enough , ” he said .
“ We ’re not talking about truth , we ’re talking about something that seems like truth — the truth we want to exist . ”
Then he had an idea : “ Truthiness . ”
He now displays , on a bookshelf in his office , a sampler embroidered with TRUTHINESS inside a gold frame .
Colbert usually arrives for work about ten , having been driven the 45 minutes from his home in Montclair , New Jersey .
On this morning , though , Colbert has arrived at his studio at 54th and Tenth at 8:30 a.m. , so we ’ll have time to talk .
Now , I do n’t really expect Colbert to be wearing a suit at 8:30 in the morning , but I ’m slightly surprised and disappointed that he ’s not .
I have to admit I pictured him sleeping in the suit , then waking in the suit , and then barking orders at his minions throughout the day in the suit , while standing still and thrusting his arms out straight so his robot manservants can steam the suit clean .
But then , like a lot of people , I am prone to confuse Stephen Colbert with “ Stephen Colbert . ”
He is fond of joking that he might start calling himself Stephen Col - Bert , with a hard T , rather than Col - Bear , just to accentuate the distinction .
So Stephen Col - Bert shows up at 8:30 in a charcoal polo shirt with the collar half - turned up , and ruffled hair , and those rimless rectangular glasses , and black rugby pants , and brown Merrell slipper - sneakers .
We sit down in his office , which is big , and has brick walls , and features a few distinctive decorative touches , such as a Lord of the Rings pinball game , and an elliptical machine with an American flag folded on the console , and a bobblehead doll from that strange , not - that - long - ago - but - seems - like - forever - ago period when Colbert served as GM ’s national “ Mr. Goodwrench ” spokesperson .
One difficulty in writing about Colbert is that when you point out things like the fact that he ’s a huge Lord of the Rings nerd and has , on his desk , a heavy picture book titled A Tolkien Bestiary , roughly half the readers will think , Hmmm , interesting , while the other half will think , Yes !
Yes !
Of course !
Colbert ’s a Tolkien nut !
because they worship Stephen Tyrone Colbert and know everything about him .
Here ’s a few more things they know :
He ’s the eleventh of eleven children , born into a Catholic family in Charleston , South Carolina .
He ’s deaf in his right ear .
His father was a doctor , and his mother stayed at home .
When he was 10 , his father and two of his older brothers were killed in a plane crash .
Every night , he would listen to “ The Ballad of Davy Crockett ” before going to bed and it would make him cry .
As a kid , he was fascinated by the geographically indistinct accents of TV news anchors , and he purposefully dropped his southern twang , because he sensed that Southerners got stereotyped as being dumb .
He studied philosophy in college .
His favorite comic was Bill Cosby .
He was also influenced by the comedian Don Novello , best known as Father Guido Sarducci — but what Colbert loved best was the ultrapatriotic correspondence Novello wrote to various corporations under the pseudonym Lazlo Toth , published as The Lazlo Letters , each one concluding with the sign - off “ Stand by our President . ”
He studied comedy at Second City in Chicago and got his start in news by doing a wacky segment on Good Morning America .
He ’s married to a woman from his hometown , and they have three kids , the oldest of whom is 11 .
He still teaches Sunday school .
Here ’s something Colbertophiles might not know or might not want to know :
He loves Richard Nixon .
He has a 1972 Nixon campaign poster on the wall of his office .
He points at it and says , “ He was so liberal !
Look at what he was running on .
He started the EPA .
He opened China .
He gave 18 - year - olds the vote .
His issues were education , drugs , women , minorities , youth involvement , ending the draft , and improving the environment .
John Kerry could n’t have run on this !
What would I give for a Nixon ? ”
Colbert in person is one of those rare comedians who like to dissect comedy , especially his own comedy , and especially what makes his own comedy funny .
This is owed in part to the nature of his show — he plays an abrasive character who is , on the surface , designed to be repellent but is actually meant to entertain — which means he ’s spent a lot of time thinking about how exactly to pull off this trick .
When he was developing the idea with Karlin and Stewart , he said to them , “ I ca n’t be an asshole . ”
And Stewart said , “ You ’re not an asshole .
You ’re an idiot .
There ’s a difference . ”
For starters , being an idiot gives him a certain license .
“ The audience would n’t forgive Jon for saying things most comedians would want to say .
But we can say almost anything , because it ’s coming out of the mouth of this character . ”
Still , there ’s obvious room for overlap and conflict between the two shows ; for example , a “ War on Valentine ’s Day ” story that Colbert ’s writers had prepared a long segment about , only to learn The Daily Show had already done a field piece on the topic .
Both shows maintain independent writing staffs , so Ben Karlin zips back and forth between the studios , overseeing the tapings and making the final call if there ’s a tug - of - war .
“ The game they ’re playing is a slightly different one from us , ” says Stewart , “ so we do n’t trip on each other that much .
And let ’s put it this way :
This ai n’t the Serengeti .
There ’s plenty of food to go around . ”
If a story ’s big enough , like the Mark Foley sex scandal , both shows will take a bite — Stewart with his What is this world coming to ?
lament and Colbert with his contrarian - at - all - costs irony .
“ It ’s the Jewish Day of Atonement , ” said Stewart on - air , about Foley .
“ I do n’t know how many days of fasting can get you out of trying to bang 16 - year - olds .
My guess is at least three days .
Even after that , probably a month of salads . ”
On his show , Colbert defended Foley as misunderstood , claiming “ stud ” is a text - message acronym for “ Strong Teenager Using Democracy , ” and “ horny ” stands for “ Happy On Reaching New Year ’s . ”
“ Every January 1 , ” announced Colbert in that unwavering pundit ’s tone , “ that is the message I send to my buddies at Stephen Colbert ’s Youth Camp for Young Studs : ‘ I am incredibly horny . ’ ”
Colbert ’s on - air personality , so distinct from Stewart ’s , leads to a peculiar comedic alchemy on the show .
During one taping I attended , Colbert did a bit about eating disorders that ended with his addressing the camera and saying flatly , “ Girls , if we ca n’t see your ribs , you ’re ugly . ”
The audience laughed .
I laughed .
The line was obviously , purposefully outrageous .
But it was weird to think that this no - doubt self - identified progressive - liberal crowd was howling at a line that , if it had been delivered verbatim by Ann Coulter on Today , would have them sputtering with rage .
In fact , here ’s a list of statements by either Stephen Colbert or Ann Coulter .
See if you can tell who said what ( answers are at the end of the story ) :
1 . “ Even Islamic terrorists do n’t hate America like liberals do .
They do n’t have the energy .
If they had that much energy , they ’d have indoor plumbing by now . ”
2 . “ There ’s nothing wrong with being gay .
I have plenty of friends who are going to hell . ”
3 . “ I just think Rosa Parks was overrated .
Last time I checked , she got famous for breaking the law . ”
4 . “ Being nice to people is , in fact , one of the incidental tenets of Christianity , as opposed to other religions whose tenets are more along the lines of ‘ Kill everyone who does n’t smell bad and answer to the name Muhammad . ’ ”
5 . “ I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion , be you Hindu , Muslim , or Jewish .
I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior . ”
6. “ [ North Korea ] is a major threat .
I just think it would be fun to nuke them and have it be a warning to the rest of the world . ”
7 . “ Is n’t an agnostic just an atheist without balls ? ”
Of course , I ’m not trying to equate Coulter with Colbert .
For starters , Coulter is a shrill , abusive demagogue and Colbert just plays one on TV .
But with Coulter , there ’s always been a sturdy suspicion that she is playing a character ( like Colbert ) and amping up the obnoxious rhetoric for maximum effect ( like Colbert ) .
When I mention the comparison to Colbert , though , he seems surprised , even unnerved .
“ I do n’t really think about her much , ” he says .
“ She ’s a self - generating bogeyman .
She ’s like someone who wants attention for having been bad . ”
Given that he ’s hosted right - wing true believers like Joe Scarborough before , and has often said he ’d love to have Bill O’Reilly on the show , would he ever invite Coulter as a guest ?
“ My sense is that she ’s playing a character , ” he says .
“ I do n’t need another character .
There ’s one character on my show , and that ’s me . ”
The thesis of the ﬁrst show , a year ago , was , “ What you wish to be true is all that matters , regardless of the facts , ” says Colbert .
“ At the time , we thought we were being farcical . ”
Colbert ’s character is a comedic high - wire act , and as the crowd beneath him gets larger , and louder , and more distracting , the act gets trickier still .
“ We share the same name .
But he says things I do n’t mean with a straight face .
On the street , I think people know the difference .
But I ’m not sure , when people ask me to go someplace , which one they ’ve asked . ”
He ran into this problem earlier this year , when Knox College in Illinois invited him to deliver a commencement speech .
Genuinely unsure of who the school was expecting , he delivered half the speech as himself and half as Col - Bear .
The most notorious example , however , of this invite - Jekyll - and - get - Hyde conundrum was the press - corps dinner , at which a prominent comedian traditionally performs a light roast of the president .
This year , Mark Smith , the president of the White House Correspondents ’ Association , invited Colbert to give the main toast .
Smith later told the Times he had n’t seen much of Colbert ’s work .
Colbert accepted the invitation , grabbed his tux , and shuttled down to D.C. , prepared to deliver twenty minutes ’ worth of vintage Colbert jokes , some new and some drawn from the show .
The night kicked off with opening remarks , then an act in which President Bush appeared alongside a President Bush impersonator , which went over very well .
Then Colbert stepped to the podium .
He opened with an obligatory Cheney ’s - going - to - shoot - me - in - the - face joke , then said , “ Madame First Lady , Mr. President , my name is Stephen Colbert , and tonight it ’s my privilege to celebrate the president … I stand by this man because he stands for things .
Not only for things , he stands on things .
Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares .
And that sends a powerful message : that no matter what happens to America , she will always rebound — with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world …
He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday , no matter what happened on Tuesday .
Events can change ; this man ’s beliefs never will … ” Then , addressing the press , Colbert said , “ Over the last five years , you people were so good .
Over tax cuts , WMD intelligence , the effect of global warming :
We Americans did n’t want to know , and you had the courtesy not to try and find out . ”
And so on .
In the audience , Colbert ’s co-head writers , Allison Silverman and Rich Dahm , sat at a table with Colbert ’s agent and his wife .
Henry Kissinger was nearby , as was Karl Rove , as were Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame .
Silverman remembers thinking , Oh , my God , he ’s really going for it .
When I asked her later about that night , she laughed and said , “ I was afraid for my life . ”
After the speech , Colbert was introduced to the First Couple .
“ The president was very nice , ” he recalls .
“ The First Lady said , ‘ Well done . ’ ” But later , at a party , somebody came up to him and asked , “ So , what would you take back if you could ? ”
To which Colbert replied , “ Nothing .
I had a really good time . ”
Then he asked , “ Is there something I should know ? ”
The speech , which was broadcast on C - span , was all over YouTube within an hour , and the clips were viewed 2.7 million times over the next two days .
Peter Daou on Salon called it “ a biting rebuke of George W. Bush and the lily - livered press corps . ”
Richard Cohen , in the Washington Post , called Colbert “ not just a failure as a comedian but rude . ”
Chris Lehmann in the Observer wrote , “ [ T ] he act was the opposite of ballsy confrontation … the material came off as shrill and airless . ”
A commenter on the blog Daily Kos wrote , “ He was stunning and they were stunned . ”
The strangest responses , though , were the ones that defended Colbert by claiming he was n’t trying to be funny — that his real goal , having infiltrated the inner sanctum of Washington under cover of tuxedo , was to enact some kind of kamikaze Soy Bomb attack on President Bush .
A commenter on the New Republic ’s Website wrote , “ Given an opportunity to inflict personal , withering criticism on perhaps the most insulated President in the history of our nation , what would you rather be : scathing or funny ? ”
Another suggested to the Times ’ “ Letters ” page , “ Although I am a fan of Mr. Colbert , I rarely laughed .
If his performance was n’t funny , perhaps it ’s because he was n’t joking . ”
Colbert has become something very close to what he ’s parodying , a kind of Bill O’Reilly for the angry left .
In the immediate aftermath of the press - corps appearance , Colbert seemed genuinely unsettled by all the attention , refusing to speak on it publicly .
At the taping I attended with the crazy - enthusiastic girl who asked about giving the president the finger , he demurred uncomfortably , saying , “ For the record , I was there to do jokes . ”
He then said of the president , “ He ’s a charming fellow … ” before trailing off and taking the next question .
Later , to me , he repeats what ’s now become his standard line : “ I was there to do some jokes .
I was there to do what I do .
I expected maybe a whiff of brimstone .
A soupçon of scandal .
Did I expect this to be a line in the sand for people ?
No , absolutely not . ”
As for the Internet - fueled hysteria , he claims not to know much about it .
“ I ’ve kept myself willfully ignorant of people ’s reactions .
I did not read the blogs .
People would send me links , and I ’d say , ‘ Please do n’t send me links . ’
I asked my wife just to collect everything , put it in a book , and tell me about it later . ”
He has yet to open that scrapbook , though he adds later about the furor , “ It depresses me that there is n’t a politician who can address that frustration that was clearly evident in the reaction to what I did .
Where ’s the politician who can take advantage of that anger and that passion ? ”
When I point out his current folk - hero status and suggest that , you know , maybe he ’s that guy , he deflects the question .
“ I ’m Paul Bunyan , is that what you ’re saying ?
We should open a gift shop and museum here . ”
Colbert ’s not oblivious , of course , to the anger , or the passion , or his following .
It ’s evident in his show .
Even before the press - corps - dinner speech , Colbert ’s character was evolving — and the show getting funnier — but since then , he ’s been unleashed .
His success now highlights an ironic problem for his progenitor , The Daily Show , which , as it ’s grown in stature , has struggled to keep its most talented correspondents .
Ed Helms , Colbert ’s ostensible replacement , left to join The Office ; Rob Corddry is developing his own show with Busboy ; his younger brother , Nate , bolted for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip .
Stewart has resorted to re-airing Colbert ’s appearances on the show in a segment called “ Klassic Kolbert . ”
“ We ’ve always been made up of moving parts , ” Stewart says .
“ But it ’s a lot easier to lose a pinkie toe than a leg . ”
During his own media moment , which peaked around the 2004 election , Stewart reliably sidestepped the question of his influence , and he ’s always remained studiously nonpartisan , even though his personal politics are n’t hard to discern .
The politics of Colbert , the person , are more difficult to unravel — “ I ’m not a political person , and I certainly do n’t have the answers , ” is his refrain — but Colbert , the character , now commands the power of his growing “ Colbert Nation ” in a manner The Daily Show has never attempted with its fans .
In recent months , Colbert has dispatched his followers on a rampage of merry mischief : bombing the Website of a junior - league hockey team holding a name - our - mascot campaign ( the team ’s mascot is now Steagle Colbeagle the Eagle ) ; hijacking an online poll posted by Hungary ’s Economic Ministry to name a new bridge over the Danube the Stephen Colbert Bridge ( he topped the poll , but Hungary disqualified him because he ’s not dead ) ; sabotaging Wikipedia , the collectively edited online encyclopedia , after Colbert coined “ Wikiality , ” a reality that exists simply because enough people agree on it .
These are all pranks , of course , but they would have fallen flat if there was n’t a real Colbert Nation waiting to be mobilized .
Ironically — and not really in the Col - Bear ironic way — he ’s become something very close to what he ’s parodying , a kind of Bill O’Reilly for the angry left .
“ The funny thing is , I knew when we were developing this show , we were doing a show that parodies the cult of personality , ” he says .
“ And yet , if the show was successful , it would generate a cult of personality .
It had to .
That means it ’s working . ”
So to anyone who worried that Colbert would wither as a one - note parody , stunted by The Daily Show ’s shadow , take heed :
He now stands astride the political landscape , his mob of followers at the ready .
Colbertisms ring throughout the land — and not just from the mouth of Colbert .
The best testament to the triumph of the Colbertocracy is that you can now hear a Colbert line like “ I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least , and by these standards , we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq ” and , devoid of context , you might genuinely wonder if it came from a parodist , a pundit , or from the president himself .

DALLAS -- Mavericks guard Darrell Armstrong was so happy his
beloved Washington Redskins beat the Dallas Cowboys that he grabbed
a microphone before Sunday night 's game against the Minnesota
Timberwolves and hollered , " How ' bout those Redskins ! "
It 's going to cost him $ 1,000 .
Dallas coach Avery Johnson announced the fine during his
postgame news conference and team owner Mark Cuban later verified
it was legit , much to the chagrin of a disbelieving Armstrong .
The
money will all go to charity , with Johnson saying the Cowboys would
decide the recipient .
The Redskins wrapped up a 35 - 7 victory over the Cowboys shortly
before the Mavericks left the locker room to play the Timberwolves .
As part of the pregame ceremonies , guard Devin Harris wished the
crowd a happy holiday .
Then Armstrong , who was n't scheduled to
speak , asked for the microphone .
He added his holiday wishes , then
made his fine - inducing proclamation , a twist on a famous line by
former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson .
A mixture of laughter and boos followed , even from German import
Dirk Nowitzki .
Cuban laughed , too , and joked with Armstrong about
it when he returned to the bench .

The torrents of blog posts and news feeds on today 's Internet hold way too much data to keep up with if you just browse the Web normally .
Fortunately , help is here in the form of sites that filter the news for you with ever - increasing efficiency , and improved news readers that let you subscribe to news feeds and sort through them like e-mail .
For example , sites such as Digg rely on Web 2.0 techniques to turn users into editors .
Other approaches include sites that mine the linking structures of top blogs to provide a front - page - news view of the Internet 's conversations , and personalized news - recommendation engines that monitor your reading habits to bring you more - focused news .
What is the best news - management approach for you ?
We 'll examine a number of sites , Web apps , and programs that can help you sort through the best news and commentary on the Net .
First , though , a little background : Almost all of these tools depend on RSS ( for Really Simple Syndication ) feeds -- specially formatted XML files that sites use to quickly publish and exchange bare - bones information about new articles , blog posts , or other updates .
They 're often identified on a Web site by a small , orange ' XML ' button .
( You can right - click the button or link , and then copy the link location . )
Once you add that feed into a news reader , the software will periodically check it for new stories .
Good news readers let you read through sites in half the time that you would take using a browser .
Plus , if you 're getting spam on one feed , you can just unsubscribe .
Of course , while feed readers can help you plow through stories quickly , they create a new temptation :
Once you realize you 've read your news in half the time , it 's easy to subscribe to more and more feeds until you 're spending as much time reading news as you did before .
Public Service Announcement
The Register regrets to report that the world is about to end .
It seems that Iran is going to attack Israel today , 22 August , with nuclear weapons , and initiate World War III , as famous Islamic scholar Bernard Lewis explains in his recent Wall Street Journal editorial .
" ... confrontation seems to be looming between a nuclear - armed Iran and its favorite enemies , named by the late Ayatollah Khomeini as the Great Satan and the Little Satan , i.e. , the United States and Israel , " the professor says .
" A direct attack on the US , though possible , is less likely in the immediate future .
Israel is a nearer and easier target , and [ Iranian President Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad has given indication of thinking along these lines . "
Naturally , this would result in a catastrophic attack on Iran .
As for why the Iranians might wish to commit genosuicide , Lewis explains that they 're just funny that way : " The threat of direct retaliation on Iran is ... weakened by the suicide or martyrdom complex that plagues parts of the Islamic world today , without parallel in other religions , or for that matter in the Islamic past . "
Besides , it 's been ordained by scripture .
" In Islam , as in Judaism and Christianity , there are certain beliefs concerning the cosmic struggle at the end of time - Gog and Magog , anti-Christ , Armageddon - and for Shiite Muslims , the long awaited return of the Hidden Imam , ending in the final victory of the forces of good over evil , however these may be defined .
Mr Ahmadinejad and his followers clearly believe that this time is now , and that the terminal struggle has already begun and is indeed well advanced . "
The professor has read between the lines , and discovered the optimum date for the end of human civilization .
" This year , August 22 corresponds , in the Islamic calendar , to the 27th day of the month of Rajab of the year 1427 .
This , by tradition , is the night when many Muslims commemorate the night flight of the prophet Muhammad on the winged horse Buraq , first to ' the farthest mosque , ' usually identified with Jerusalem , and then to heaven and back ( c.f. , Koran XVII.1 ) .
This might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel , and , if necessary , of the world . "
So , that 's it then .

Journalist Jill Carroll is back home now , and detailing her experiences as a captive of the jihadists in Iraq in the Christian Science Monitor . (
http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0814/p01s01-woiq.html )
I 'm sure the details will prove fascinating , but the upshot of what she has learned is that the Islamists are - gasp !
- different from us !
Furthermore , I believe that she 's beginning to suspect that they are really not very nice people .
Oh whatever will this poor old world be FORCED to endure next ?
Since the beginning of the Iraq phase of this conflict of civilizations , I 've experienced the teeth - grinding frustration of watching both pro- and anti- Iraq sides make the exact same mistake - that of supposing that these people are bascially Americans in funny costumes .
In this respect , George Bush and Michael Moore are equally clueless , as was Jill Carroll apparently .
I went to live and work in Saudi Arabia in 1998 , and I " made my year " as expats there put it .
That phrase means that I actually stuck out the whole year , instead of " running " from my contract , an occurrence so common that you only have to say " he did a runner " to explain why someone is n't showing up for work anymore .
And while my experience was n't nearly as unpleasant as Jill Carroll 's , I could have told her a thing or two before she went to Iraq armed with her overflowing good will .
In Eastern Europe and the South Balkans , whenever I have gone to live in a place which I had formed opinions about , the actual experience of living there has always radically changed those opinions , sometimes into a completely contradictory one .
Most often , my academic research led me to form a beautifully coherent model which experience turned into a semi-coherent collection of observations and tentative conclusions .
In the case of the Kingdom , I went there with a certain sympathy for Arab grievances , a belief that America had earned a lot of hostility from " blowback " from our ham - handed interventionist foreign policy and support for Israel etc .
I came back with the gloomy opinion that over the long run we are going to have to hammer these people hard to get them to quit messing with Western Civilization .
And by the way , among " rational , fair - minded " non-interventionist libertarians , not a damn one of them has asked me , " What in your experience caused you to change your mind ? "
Instead what I get are gratuitous insults followed by insufferably condescending lectures about how wrong I am .
So , with the caveat that one of the first things I learned was that the term “ Arab ” covers a lot of territory , here are some observations and some tentative conclusions about Arabs , more specifically about Arabs from the oil states about why we have misunderstood each other to the point that we are fighting a war with some of them and are pissing off the rest of them .
I suspect that many of these also apply to Iranian Islamists , but I have never been there and note that Iranians are not Arabs and have a different cultural history .
1 ) They do n’t think the same way we do .
No , I mean THEY REALLY DON'T THINK THE SAME WAY WE DO .
Yes , yes , I know we are all human and share the same human nature ( perhaps the most disastrous mistake of Marxism was the denial of this elementary fact ) .
But within the scope of that shared human nature , there are a lot of different ways to be human .
We Americans have a basically open attitude to our fellow human beings and sometimes forget this .
Combined with the fact that most Americans are linguistic idiots , we tend to assume that anyone who learns to speak English learns to think like us .
2 ) When you meet them in just the right circumstances , they are a very likable people .
Arabs are often easy to like , but difficult to respect - as opposed to Israelis , who are often difficult to like but impossible not to respect .
From their nomadic heritage they have a tradition of generosity and hospitality to guests that warms the heart .
Arab shopkeepers have a talent for making you feel guilty that you did n’t buy anything ( once you get past a dislike of having them lay hands on you ) .
Haggling is a social grace with them and when you ask the price , and agree to the first one quoted , they will often come down on the price just out of pity for your social ineptness .
This does not in the least affect the fact that no friendship with you is ever going to remotely equal the obligations they have for their family , tribe or the community of the Believers .
3 )
Their values are fundamentally different from ours , their self - esteem is derived from a different source .
And you know what ?
Theirs is PHONY .
Yes I know , I ’m making a cultural value judgment , the cardinal sin when I was a grad student in Anthropology .
With us , the most important sources of self - esteem are useful work and the love of a good woman .
Being good at something that requires skill ( even a hobby ) and being of primary importance to somebody just because you are who you are .
Work for them , is something to be avoided .
The basic forms of work : making stuff , growing stuff and moving stuff around , is taken care of by a class of indentured servants , usually non-Arab Muslims from the Third World , and even today , by outright slaves .
The Kingdom is a modern country , they abolished slavery in 1967 , but old expats have reported seeing slave auctions as late as 1981 .
On one occasion a student of mine asked me , “ Teacher , what do you call a man who can be sold ? ” ( Excellent use of the passive voice , I was proud of him . )
I explained , “ He is called a slave , the condition is called slavery , the verb is to enslave . ”
Later I had occasion to ask them about the headsman , the fellow who cuts heads and hands off in chop - chop square in front of the mosque on Fridays .
The reason I asked was that from my studies I knew that in tribal societies converting from a tribal or feudal system into a system of common laws , a man condemned to death by a court of law must often be executed by a member of his own tribe , or a complete outsider so that the execution does not spark a blood feud .
In the Kingdom the headsman is usually a Sudanese .
My students explained , “ Yes teacher , he ’s a slave . ” i.e. he ’s a person of no importance and therefore outside the web of obligations of vengeance .
The point being , in a slave society , work is not honorable ( as De Tocqueville pointed out ) and cannot be a source of self - worth .
In Tunisia I saw a population doing their own work and I have worked with a fair number of Jordanians engaged in skilled labor and the professions .
Note that neither is an oil state and I believe their contribution to the ranks of terrorists is far less than the oil - rich countries .
It is difficult to argue that poverty is the driving cause of terrorism .
“ Of conjugal love they know nothing . ” ( Thomas Jefferson on the French aristocracy . )
In a land of arranged marriages , where the whole society is geared towards a strict segregation of the sexes and women are at least semi-chattels , romantic love is rare – and greatly desired .
In the Kingdom I found a few students with a consuming interest in romantic poetry , whom I had to teach very discretely .
Most of them were just obsessed with sex however .
And interestingly , when visiting the West or the fleshpots of Bahrain , they are said to have a tendency to fall in love with the prostitutes they patronize .
Without honorable work , romantic love or any accomplishments not overshadowed by those the West , their sense of self - worth comes from being the possessors of the One True Religion .
And Allah does n’t seem to be delivering on his promises of being exalted above the unbelievers these days .
On the plus side , they are willing to spare you and absorb you into their community as a respected member if you convert to the One True Religion .
The Brotherhood of Believers is a reality in the lands of Islam , and while it sometimes falls short of the ideal ( as does our democratic ideal ) it is a reality , and in its way admirable .
4 ) Not only can they not build the infrastructure of a modern society , they ca n’t maintain it either .
The very concept of " maintenance " is foreign to them .
This is what drives the foreign instructors in the Gulf absolutely mad .
The per capita richest countries in the world resemble Eastern Europe or Latin America in the tackiness and run-down appearance of the buildings and streets .
An electronics technician new to the Kingdom once told me how his first job was to inspect a junction box in the desert .
He had to pry it open with a crowbar as it had evidently not been opened since it had been installed several years earlier .
This is expressed in the inshallah philosophy , “ If God wills it . ”
A Palestinian friend of mine explained to me that even the weather forecaster will qualify his prediction , “ It will rain tomorrow .
Inshallah . ”
Or , “ I will meet you tomorrow , inshallah . ” ( But God understands that I am a very unreliable person . ) I remember giving a pep talk to my students before a crucial exam , “ You are all going to pass the exam , right ? ” “ Inshallah teacher . ” “ No , no ! ” I shouted , “ No inshallah .
Study !
” This was once also characteristic of the former communist countries .
Work was indifferently performed and maintenance was a real problem .
A factory owner in Poland told me that machines he bought from Sweden lasted only half as long in Poland as they did in Sweden because of poor maintenance .
However as soon as people were assured that they could keep a reasonable amount of what they worked for , people reverted to their true cultural patterns , worked plenty hard and started to take care of their tools and the public spaces .
5 ) They do not think of obligations as running both ways .
With us , contractual and moral obligations tend to be equal and reciprocal .
They do n’t see it that way .
The obligations of the superior to the inferior do not equal those of the inferior to the superior .
Obligations within a family or clan outweigh all others .
That is why we had to take care not to sit members of the same clan near each other during exams .
If one asks another for help , he has to give it .
In spite of promises to the school and even when the clansman is a total stranger .
Obligations to other believers outweigh all obligations to unbelievers and especially when the believers are fellow - Arabs .
And in contracts with unbelievers , the obligations of the Believer to the kaffir are not equal to the obligations of the kaffir to the Believer .
Consider that Muslims in England have quite un - selfconsciously demanded that a pub near a Mosque be shut down as offensive to their religion – in spite of the fact that the pub had precedence by six hundred years !
Or that they demanded the right to broadcast the prayer call on loudspeakers in London while it is illegal to have a church at all in the Kingdom .
6 )
In warfare , we think they are sneaky cowards , they think we are hypocrites .
In our civilization , when two men get down , either seriously or just “ woofing ” , what do they say ?
Some variation of “ I ’m going to kick your ass . ”
Am I right ?
Here ’s what I heard in the Kingdom , “ Hey , do n’t f** k with me , or someday you get a knife in the back . ”
I ’m not saying that would n’t happen to you in the West , but most men would be ashamed to make a threat of that nature .
We do n’t understand that direct shock battle is not necessarily the law of nature .
When overwhelming force is brought to bear on them , they become cringing and obsequious .
To put it bluntly , they lie their heads off to get you to turn your back on them .
Try to see it from their point of view – how else do you expect them to act when you have the overwhelming force ?
You expect them to meet you on equal terms when the situation is so unequal ?
What other tactics are available but prevarication and delay followed by a sneak attack ?
Folks , what we call “ terrorism ” is quite close to the historically normal way of warfare among these people .
7 )
In rhetoric , they do n’t mean to be taken seriously and they do n’t understand when we do .
Thus an ultimatum is often not taken seriously and the reality comes as a surprise .
Remember the “ Mother of all Battles ” ?
Like many other Mediterranean peoples , Arabs do n’t seem to mind making a scene in public and have a high blown sense of drama .
Paul Harvey once described how he had spent the Suez Crisis hiding under the bed in his hotel room because of the blood - curdling radio broadcasts , before he learned that Arabs talk like that when they ’re arguing over a taxi .
“ This is my taxi and I will defend it to the death ! ” “ You lie , it ’s mine and rivers of blood will flow in the street before I give up my taxi !
” An Arab will scream at you , get into your personal space and sometimes kick dirt on your shoe – and they react with utter surprise when an American up and decks him .
“ What did I do ? ”
To say the least , this makes negotiations difficult .
8 )
They do n’t place the same value on an abstract conception of Truth as we do , they routinely believe things of breathtaking absurdity .
I can not begin to tell you of some of the things I ’ve heard from Gulf Arabs or read in the English language press in the Kingdom .
“ The Jews want Medina back . ” ( Medina was a Jewish city in the time of the Prophet . )
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion has been turned into an immensely popular miniseries on Egyptian TV .
The Blood Libel ( the medieval myth that Jews need the blood of non-Jewish babies to celebrate Passover ) is widely reported in the Arab press , and widely believed .
Allah will replenish the oil beneath Arabia when it runs out .
I ’ve been assured , by well - educated and otherwise sensible people that Winston Churchill was Jewish and that Anthony Quinn had been blacklisted and would never work again after making Lion of the Desert ( just before he made that turkey with Kevin Costner ) .
9 ) They do not have the same notion of cause and effect as we do .
This involves some seriously weird stuff about other people being responsible for their misery because they ill - wished them .
I ’ve read in the English - language press of the Kingdom serious admonitions against using Black Magic to win an advantage in a dispute with a neighbor .
The columnist did not deny the efficacy of Black Magic , he just said it ’s forbidden to use it .
On one occasion I was trying to explain the concept of " myth " to them and I used the example of the djinn .
I was n't getting through to them at all and was concerned that I had mangled the pronunciation of the word when it dawned on me that the reason they did n't understand what I was getting at , was that they had no doubt that the djinn were real .
10 ) We take for granted that we are a dominant civilization still on the way up .
They are acutely aware that they are a civilization on the skids .
Anyone who looks at the surviving architecture of Moorish Spain can tell that Islamic civilization has seen better days .
There was a time when cultural transmission between Islam and the West went overwhelmingly from them to us .
( Note the recent discoveries of Sufi symbols engraved on the structural members of European cathedrals . )
Now the situation is reversed , and it is humiliating for them .
11 ) We think that everybody has a right to their own point of view , they think that that idea is not only self - evidently absurd , but evil .
In the West , and America more than anyplace else , we have internalized the notion that everyone has a right to their own opinion , and that said opinion is perfectly valid for them .
When we meet a people who think that that idea is insane and evil , we are sometimes left in the absurd position of defending their idea as “ perfectly valid for them ” .
Does n’t work that way for them , God ’s Truth is laid out in some detail in the Koran , and not to believe it is a sin .
I know I know , in America you can find lots of Christian Fundamentalists who believe that God will cast you into hell for holding the wrong opinions about Him , but even those who would make their religion into an established church seldom desire the level of enforcement in such detail as the Kingdom does or the Taliban did .
12 ) Our civilization is destroying theirs .
We can not share a world in peace .
They understand this ; we have yet to learn it .
Another culturally - imposed blindness we have is the notion that everybody can get along with enough good will .
There is absolutely no evidence to support this and a great deal to oppose it .
Can the subjugation of women coexist with Western Civilization with Western media ubiquitous throughout the world ?
Can a pluralistic and tolerant society be governed by Islamic law ?
Can a modern economy exist where interest is forbidden and many forms of business risk - taking are considered gambling , and thus forbidden ?
Can a society that educates its young men by a process of rote recitation produce critically thinking , technically educated men to build and operate a modern economy ?
Can you even teach elementary concepts of maintenance to a people who believe that anything that happens is inshalla ( As God will it ) ?
To compete , or even just survive in the world they must become more like us and less like themselves – and they know this .
Business Logic : To Store or not to Store that is the Question ?
A lot of people in the database and programming professions are vehemently in favor or opposed to the use of stored procedures and the like in databases .
They will argue that all access to the database should go thru stored procedures because it is more secure and shields applications from changing logic .
The other side will vehemently argue that you should avoid this because not all databases support this and the way each supports it is different so your code is less portable .
I would start by saying those individuals who are vehemently on one side or the other should open their minds a little .
One approach is not strictly the best solution for all business requirements .
In the next couple of sections we 'll outline what are the important questions to consider when choosing one approach over another .
Often you will find that even in a single application a mixture of approaches works best .
Best Practices vs. Best approach to achieve the goal Before dismissing one approach over another , it is important to map out what you are trying to achieve and then determine how using one approach aligns with your objectives .
You will often hear the term Best Practices used in Application Architecture .
The danger of such a term is that it gives one a sense that there is no need to question a practice because it is always best .
Just follow Best Practices outlined by an authority in the subject matter and things will magically fall into place .
Rather than just focus on Best Practices , I would like to propose that one should think about what they are trying to achieve and why one approach is better than another to get there .
What to consider ?
In this section , we will talk about considerations on a very elemental functional level rather than a more macro application level .
We think it is important to consider each functional task of an application separately rather than thinking of an application as a whole .
Example you may have one part of an application that needs to talk to a mainframe database or run scheduled tasks , and given that it does n’t make sense to drive your whole application structure based on the need of this single functionality .
Does this function need to work in various kinds of databases ?
Is this function used in multiple parts of an application or applications ?
Does this function require many arguments and return one set of values in form of single table or scalar value ?
Does this function require few arguments passed to the database , but require lots of data from the database to arrive at results ?
Is the function data intensive or processor intensive ?
E.g. is it an encryption function or one to get results of a complex query - is it more SQL intensive or more procedural intensive
Are the parameters passed into the function consistently the same or can they vary ?
E.g. a complex search form will not always need to pass the same parameters , but a simple one will just have a single search field and always pass just that .
Does the function require page long batches of SQL statements or is it a one line SQL statement ?
Are the fields of the result set always the same or do they need to vary .
For example do you always find yourself joining the same set of tables varying slightly by the need for different fields or subsets of data ?
Database Objects
I always find it amusing that when people talk about database logic they are very focused on stored procedures and its almost like nothing else exists .
Makes me wonder if these people have ever worked with modern databases .
Stored procedures are one of the oldest methods of encapsulating database logic , but they are not the only method available .
Many relational databases nowadays have views , constraints , referential integrity with cascading update , delete , stored functions , triggers and the like .
These are extremely powerful tools when used appropriately .
In the next couple of sections we ’ll cover stored procedures and these other kinds of database objects and detail the strengths and weaknesses of each for encapsulating logic .
We will give a rating of 0 - 5 for each feature 0 meaning the feature is non-existent , 5 meaning this object is one of the best suited objects for implementing this kind of task .
Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are one of numerous mechanisms of encapsulating database logic in the database .
They are similar to regular programming language procedures in that they take arguments , do something , and sometimes return results and sometimes even change the values of the arguments they take when arguments are declared as output parameters .
You will find that they are very similar to stored functions in that they can return data ; however stored procedures can not be used in queries .
Since stored procedures have the mechanism of taking arguments declared as OUTPUT they can in theory return more than one output .
Feature Rating Works in various kinds of databases 3 ( many databases such as DB II , Oracle , SQL Server , MySQL 5 , PostGreSQL , FireBird support them ) .
There are also a lot that do n’t e.g.
MySQL < 5.0 , MS Access ( although parameterized queries serve a similar role )
Can be called by multiple applications and interfaces 4 ( generally they can be called , but the use of OUTPUT arguments is not always usable )
Can take an undefined number of arguments 2 ( note most databases allow to define optional arguments , but this can become very unwieldy to maintain if there are a lot because you end up duplicating logic even within the stored procedure so is generally avoided )

In general true for most DBMSs that support them .
Can return varying number of fields given different arguments .
3 –again in theory it can , but very hard to maintain since you would often be duplicating logic to say return one field in one situation and other set of fields in another situation or update a field when the field is passed in as an argument .
Note that in many databases such as for example SQL Server and Oracle , one can return multiple result sets with a stored procedure , but the receiving end needs to be able to do a next result set call and know the sequence in which the result sets are being sent .
Long stretches of SQL easy to read and maintain 5 ( one of the great strengths of stored procedures is that you can have long transactions of sql statements and conditional loops which can be all committed at once or rolled back as a unit .
This also saves on network traffic .
Stored Functions Stored Functions are very similar to stored procedures except in 3 major ways .
Unlike stored procedures , they can be used in views , stored procedures , and other stored functions .
In many databases they are prohibited from changing data or have ddl / dml limitations .
Note for databases such as PostGreSQL this is not true since the line between a stored function and a stored procedure is very greyed
They generally can not take output arguments ( placeholders ) that are then passed back out with changed values .

Can take an undefined number of arguments 2 ( note most databases allow to define optional arguments , but this can become very unwieldy to maintain if there are a lot because you end up duplicating logic even within the stored function so is generally avoided )
Reusability within the database 5 ( you can reuse them in views , in other stored functions and stored procedures ) .
This varies slightly from DBMS to DBMS .
Can be used to change data in a table without giving rights to a user to change table directly 3
Many databases do not allow changing of data in stored functions except temp table data , but those that do in general support this .
Can return varying number of fields given different arguments .
4 – For databases such as SQL Server , PostgreSQL , DB 2 , Oracle that allow return tables and sets , you can selectively pick fields you want from within a query .
So although the function always outputs the same number of fields , you can selectively use only some similar to what you can do with views .
This is not true for scalar functions ( MySQL 5.1 - only supports scalar functions ) .
Long stretches of SQL easy to read 5 - yes - you can do fairly intensive multi-line processing which in the end returns one value or table to the user .
Views Views are one of the greatest things invented since sliced bread .
The main beauty of a view is that it can be used like a table in most situations , but unlike a table , it can encapsulate very complex calculations and commonly used joins .
It can also use pretty much any object in the db except for stored procedures .
Views are most useful when you always need to join the same set of tables say an Order with an Order Detail to get summary calculation fields etc .

In many databases Views are read - only and complex views are rarely updateable .
Note that for example some databases such as Oracle , PostgreSQL , MS SQL Server , SQLite will allow you to update even a complex view by using an instead of trigger or rule against the view .
MySQL 5 , MS SQL Server and some others automatically make one table views updateable .
MS
Access has a fairly sophisticated update algorithm for queries in that it automatically makes one table and even multi-table queries updateable and allows deletes if you define primary keys appropriately .
Also depending on the field a column comes from it will update that and also automatically create child records in child tables if you try to update a child column when there is no record .
Can return varying number of fields given different arguments .

3 ( A view can often be defined with an administrative designer or using a color coded sql editor so is fairly easy to read ) - in general though it is limited to only one select statement or unioned select statements .
Triggers
And Rules Triggers are objects generally tied to a table or view that run code based on certain events such as inserting data , before inserting data , updating / deleting data and before these events happen .
Triggers can be very great things and very dangerous things .
Dangerous in the sense that they are tricky to debug , but powerful because no update to a table with a trigger can easily escape the trigger .
They are useful for making sure certain events always happen when data is inserted or updated - e.g. set complex default values of fields , inserting logging records into other tables .
Triggers are especially useful for one particular situation and that is for implementing instead of logic .
For example as we said earlier , many views involving more than one table are not updateable .
However in DBMS such as PostgreSQL , you can define a rule on a view that occurs when someone tries to update or insert into the view and will occur instead of the insert .
The rule can be fairly complex and can layout how the tables should be updated in such a situation .
MS SQL Server and SQLite let you do something similar with INSTEAD OF triggers .
Note the term Rule is a little confusing in DBMS because they mean quite different things .
In Microsoft SQL Server for example a Rule is an obsolete construct that was used to define constraints on tables .
In PostgreSQL a Rule is very similar to a trigger except that it does not get triggered per row event and is defined without need of a handling function .

Yes - cascade update / delete rules are a special kind of trigger so to speak that kick in when a potential referential integrity constraint can be violated .

2 - SQL often sits interspersed with other programming logic which makes it somewhat difficult to read depending on the application language and also difficult to write complex transactional sql .
What about Security ?
In the above criteria , we did n't put Security in as a feature / benefit even though many people will argue that dynamic SQL and the like are not secure .
This actually varies depending on how you implement Dynamic SQL , e.g. if you are using an O/R Mapper or built - in dataadapters ( supported in . NET ) , prepared statements , or are very careful to sanitize inputs you are using in your sql then your Dynamic SQL will probably be just as secure or sometimes more so than using stored procedures since some people are of the mindset that stored procedures are a magic bullet for protecting against SQL Injection and other attacks ( such as script injection ) regardless of how they are implemented and called and thus neglect other necessary precautions .

Plans for the porn -only domain had aroused controversy
Advocates of the exclusive domain had argued that it would make it easier for web users to locate - or avoid - pornography online .
Conservative opponents of the plan said it would legitimise pornography , while opponents in the porn industry warned it could lead to more state control .
Internet regulator Icann 's chief said the decision was not political .
" The heart of the decision today was not driven by a political consideration , " Paul Twomey told the Associated Press news agency .
The idea for an .xxx domain was first floated in 2001 .
A final decision on approving the exclusive porn domain has been delayed several times - most recently in December .
In August , the decision was postponed following a request from the US Department of Commerce which had " concerns " about the domain .
Plans for the .xxx have been criticised by many people and organisations , among them former Icann board member Karl Auerbach and US conservative religious groups , including the Family Research Council .
ICM Registry , the company that proposed and plans to run the .xxx , said the domain would have made it easier to find and filter pornographic material online .
Critics said that because signing up for .xxx was voluntary , there was no guarantee pornographers would move material to the new domain , not least because many have established themselves on other well - known sites .
Joel Spolsky ’s latest essay is The Perils of Java Schools .
He explains in detail why he thinks teaching computer science with Java is a bad thing .
It basically comes down to not learning about pointers or recursion .
He laments the state of computer science education , and fears for the entire industry as a result .
At least Joel has the good sense to start the piece by making fun of himself for griping about “ kids these days ” .
He has his knickers in a twist for no good reason .
One of the things that caught my eye about the piece was that Joel attended Penn , and discusses a course there called CSE 121 .
As it happens , I also went to Penn .
I suspect it was a couple of years earlier than Joel , but not many .
I did n’t take CSE 121 .
I wonder if it was offered , because it does n’t sound familiar , but looks like an interesting course .
So I never had the legendary Intro To The Theory Of Programming Languages Using Lisp course that so many people find so fascinating .
But I took another course that is germane to the discussion , Intro To Assembly Language .
I do n’t think CS students today are being taught assembly language .
Should they be ?
I do n’t know .
Is it useful ?
Yes , at the very least for debugging .
Working in C++ , there have been many times when dropping into disassembly in the debugger was the only way to see what was really going on .
I ’ve had debugging sessions with engineers with recent Master ’s degrees from MIT where I started poking around in disassembly and registers , and as far as they were concerned , I might as well have been speaking in tongues .
( Side note about the Assembly Language course at Penn : we were taught PDP - 11 assembly language , and did all our work in it .
The final project was to write a 6502 emulator for the PDP - 11 .
But Penn did n’t have a PDP - 11 ; all the projects were run on a PDP - 11 emulator on a Univac mainframe !
Needless to say , the 6502 programs we tested our emulators with ran very slowly ! )
Assembly language can be very helpful , but if you ’re working in Java ( or Python or Ruby or PHP or Perl ) , there is n’t much call for it .
So should it be taught ?
Hard to say .
Understanding it will definitely give you a deeper understanding of what ’s really going on , and many areas of software engineering still require its use .
But if students do n’t take a semester of assembly language , they can take a semester of something else instead , something that may be more helpful in the long run .
UI design ?
Finance ?
There are lots of things I never learned in college that would be handy now .
Why does Joel pick out pointers and recursion as the two gatekeeper concepts ?
Because he found them difficult ?
As Tim Bray points out , Java is perfectly adept at recursion , and concurrency may be a more important and difficult concept to master in any case .
The emphasis on recursion in Lisp languages is a bit over the top , and does n’t carry into other programming cultures .
Why do people think it ’s so important for software engineering ?
Do n’t get me wrong : I love recursion when it ’s the right tool for the job , but that is just not that often to warrant Joel ’s focus on it as a fundamental concept .
While we ’re hunting around for tough concepts that separate the men from the boys , what about the one that got Joel and I into a tussle two years ago : Exceptions .
He does n’t like them , basically , because they confuse him .
Is this any different than a Java guy not liking pointers ?
Yes , you can avoid exceptions and use status returns , but you can also try really hard to avoid pointers .
Does that mean you should ?
So Joel ’s got the concepts he likes ( pointers and recursion ) , and laments their decline , but does n’t seem to notice that there are newer concepts that he ’s never caught on to , which the Java kiddies feel at home with .
Joel draws an analogy to Latin and Greek being required by universities in 1900 .
Good point .
This is where the “ kids these days ” arguments always fall apart .
By digging back even further into the past for helpful analogies , the old timers do n’t even realize the trap they are falling into .
Joel did n’t learn Latin or Greek at Penn , and neither did I .
Neither did 99.99 % of the software engineers working today .
Which means Mr. 1900 would look at every single one of us and consider us unfit for professional work .
But we are not .
We are fit for the world we find ourselves in .
Education changes , and the world changes .
Which is the cause and which the effect ?
Perhaps it ’s a bit of both .
In any case , the colleges produce graduates , who go into industry , and produce software .
Some will be good at it , some will not .
This is how it has always been .
In my experience , most of what is truly helpful in writing software did n’t come out of a text book or off of a blackboard .
So much of the day - to - day work of writing software is completely missing from curricula anyway , why worry about it ?
You want a good software engineering education ?
The final project should be to take some other kids ’ project from last year and adapt it to do something he did n’t even consider .
Then the result gets passed on to another kid next year .
That would be an education !
The Java kiddies will learn to write software .
Some of that learning will happen in college , some will happen on the job .
Joel learned on Pascal , a language specifically simplified for teaching .
When I started at Penn in 1980 , the first course in the computer science curriculum was Introduction to Programming in , you guessed it , Pascal , because Pascal was trendy for teaching in 1980 .
Java is trendy now .
The industry survived Pascal and its students , and it will survive Java .
And you know what ?
Twenty years from now , the Java kiddies will be the old timers , and they ’ll probably be lamenting how computer science is being taught in 2026 .
So it has always been , and so it will always be .
Geez , old - timers these days !
THE NEW YORK TIMES ’S Dec. 16 article that disclosed the Bush administration ’s warrantless eavesdropping has led to an important public debate about the once - secret program .
And the decision to write about the program in the face of White House pressure deserved even more praise than I gave it in a January column , which focused on the paper ’s inadequate explanation of why it had “ delayed publication for a year . ”
The article , written by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , has been honored with a Pulitzer and other journalistic prizes .
But contradictory post- publication comments by Times editors and others about just how long the article was held have left me increasingly concerned about one key question : Did The Times mislead readers by stating that any delay in publication came after the Nov. 2 , 2004 , presidential election ?
In my January column , in which I refused to rely on anonymous sources , I noted that I was left “ puzzled ” by the election question .
But I have now learned from Bill Keller , the executive editor , that The Times delayed publication of drafts of the eavesdropping article before the 2004 election .
This revelation confirms what anonymous sources had told other publications such as The Los Angeles Times and The New York Observer in December .
A number of readers critical of the Bush administration have remained particularly suspicious of the article ’s assertion that the publication delay dated back only “ a year ” to Dec. 16 , 2004 .
They contend that pre-election disclosure of the National Security Agency ’s warrantless eavesdropping could have changed the outcome of the election .
Since the Times article appeared , I have grown increasingly intrigued by changes in the way the delay has been described in the paper and in comments by Mr. Keller .
A background paragraph in a follow - up article on Dec. 31 said , “ The administration first learned that The New York Times had obtained information about the secret eavesdropping program more than a year ago . ”
Mr. Keller also began using the “ more than a year ” language .
My decision to take another look at the extent of the delay came after reading Mr. Keller ’s response to an online question in April during “ Talk to the Newsroom , ” a feature on nytimes.com .
Eric Sullivan , from Waunakee , Wis. , commented : “ I ’d like to know why you sat on the N.S.A. story .
You probably changed the course of an election and likely history to come . ”
Mr. Keller ’s rather matter - of - fact acceptance of Mr. Sullivan ’s presumptions caught my eye : “ Whether publishing earlier would have influenced the 2004 election is , I think , hard to say .
Judging from the public reaction to the N.S.A. eavesdropping reflected in various polls , one could ask whether earlier disclosure might have helped President Bush more than hurt . ”
Mr. Keller , who would n’t answer any questions for my January column , recently agreed to an interview about the delay , although he saw it as “ old business . ”
But he had some new things to say about the delay and the election .
Internal discussions about drafts of the article had been “ dragging on for weeks ” before the Nov. 2 election , Mr. Keller acknowledged .
That process had included talks with the Bush administration .
He said a fresh draft was the subject of internal deliberations “ less than a week ” before the election .
“ The climactic discussion about whether to publish was right on the eve of the election , ” Mr. Keller said .
The pre-election discussions included Jill Abramson , a managing editor ; Philip Taubman , the chief of the Washington bureau ; Rebecca Corbett , the editor handling the story , and often Mr. Risen .
Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , the publisher , was briefed , but Mr. Keller said the final decision to hold the story was his .
Mr. Keller declined to explain in detail his pre-election decision to hold the article , citing obligations to preserve the confidentiality of sources .
He has repeatedly indicated that a major reason for the publication delays was the administration ’s claim that everyone involved was satisfied with the program ’s legality .
Later , he has said , it became clear that questions about the program ’s legality “ loomed larger within the government than we had previously understood . ”
Image
But last week Mr. Keller e-mailed me a description of how that picture had changed by December 2005 , and it cast some new light on the pre-election situation for me .
It implied that the paper ’s pre-election sources had n’t been sufficiently “ well - placed and credible ” to convince him that questions about the program ’s legality and oversight were serious enough to make it “ responsible to publish . ”
But by December , he wrote , “ We now had some new people who could in no way be characterized as disgruntled bureaucrats or war - on - terror doves saying we should publish .
That was a big deal . ”
Holding a fresh draft of the story just days before the election also was an issue of fairness , Mr. Keller said .
I agree that candidates affected by a negative article deserve to have time — several days to a week — to get their response disseminated before voters head to the polls .
So why did the Dec. 16 article say The Times had “ delayed publication for a year , ” specifically ruling out the possibility that the story had been held prior to the Nov. 2 election ?
“ It was probably inelegant wording , ” Mr. Keller said , who added later , “ I do n’t know what was in my head at the time . ”
Were the wording and the sensitivity of the election - day timing issue discussed internally ?
“ I do n’t remember , ” Mr. Keller said in an interview .
He does remember discussing that “ I wanted to own up to holding it . ”
And The Times does deserve credit for disclosing that it had held the story .
It was more than inelegant , however , to report flatly that the delay had lasted “ a year . ”
Characterizing it as “ more than a year , ” as Mr. Keller and others later did , would have been technically accurate .
But that phrase would have represented a fuzziness that Times readers should n’t have to put up with when a hotly contested presidential election is involved .
Given the importance of this otherwise outstanding article on warrantless eavesdropping — and now the confirmation of pre-election decisions to delay publication —
The Times owes it to readers to set the official record straight .
Identifying Contributors
Inviting outside experts to write essays , commentaries and columns about their field can provide valuable insights to Times readers .
But because they hold non-journalism jobs that are their primary means of income and professional fulfillment , readers can question how much those career endeavors influence what these experts write .
While the inherent conflict ca n’t be eliminated , full disclosure of the positions held by outside contributors can defuse reader suspicions that otherwise could take root in the absence of the facts .
But a check of The Times reveals that not all of these contributors are being identified by the job they hold , and it ’s not clear that any paper - wide standards are being applied consistently .
This concern over disclosure does n’t involve all outside contributors .
The bulk of the army of freelancers used by The Times is n’t at issue here because journalism or writing typically constitutes their principal job .
And contributors to the weekly Book Review and the Op - Ed pages are already being identified .
I ’m not suggesting any journalistic sins by contributors with careers outside journalism , but here are a few examples where disclosure could help allay reader suspicions about possible hidden agendas .
One reader asked recently why Samuel G. Freedman , a writer of the On Education column , is not identified as a professor at Columbia , where he teaches journalism .
His editor does n’t think it ’s necessary because Mr. Freedman does n’t devote entire columns to Columbia or journalism schools .
But I feel his Columbia position is relevant to his writing about education , and disclosing it would be beneficial especially because his “ sgfreedman@nytimes.com ” e-mail address listed with each column could lead readers to think he ’s on the staff .
Peter Steinfels , the respected writer of the Beliefs column , is n’t identified in any way .
He is co-director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture and a member of the faculty at Fordham University , a Catholic institution .
Catholics and Catholicism are frequently mentioned in Beliefs , although Mr. Steinfels sees only eight of his past 45 columns as “ really dwelling on matters specific to Catholicism . ”
Many of the medical doctors who write essays and commentaries for the Health & Fitness pages of the Science Times section are not identified beyond the “ M.D. ” in their bylines .
Based on the queries I have received , I think readers would like to know what kind of medicine these doctors practice and where .
Many NHS trusts take obesity into account over access to fertility therapy
The British Fertility Society is recommending women with a body mass index of 36 and over should not be allowed access to fertility treatment .
Underweight women and those classed just as obese ( BMI over 29 ) should be forced to address their weight before starting treatment , the society said .
NHS guidelines say overweight women should be warned of the health risks , but do not impose any ban on treatment .
Obese women are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to encounter health problems
Richard Kennedy , of the British Fertility Society
Q&A : Infertility treatment ' Too fat for IVF '
Being overweight can put both the health of the mother and child at risk through problems such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure .
In reality , many primary care trusts do not fund women who are obese .
The BFS has published its recommendations in a bid to end the IVF " postcode lottery " .
It wants to standardise treatment so that clinics use the same criteria in relation to age and family status as well as weight .
Dietary advice
Richard Kennedy , of the BFS , said : " The NHS is already stopping women who are obese from having fertility treatment .
WHAT WOULD CHANGE UNDER THE BFS PROPOSALS ?
All clinics would operate under the same rules
Very obese women would not be able to get IVF Women over 40 should not be treated Couples who have not had children together would be eligible Having had private IVF would not stop couples having IVF treatment Same sex couples and single women should be treated in the same way as heterosexual couples Smokers should not be barred from having IVF
' Too fat for IVF ' Calculate your BMI
" What we are saying is that they should be less stringent and more consistent with how they apply this .
" Obese women are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to encounter health problems .
It makes sense to address obesity before seeking fertility treatment . "
The BFS , which represents health fertility professionals , also recommended single women and same sex couples be given the same priority as heterosexual couples .
NHS guidelines say women aged 23 to 39 should be entitled to three cycles of IVF , although the government gave the health service a deadline of April last year to provide one cycle with a view to working towards three .
The society made its recommendations after surveying 64 fertility clinics in England and Wales .
It received responses from 37 , showing one in 10 was not providing IVF treatment free on the NHS because they were not being given funding by the local PCTs .
None of the clinics was providing three cycles , the poll , which will be published in the Human Fertility journal in September , said .
Clinical factors
The poll also showed many of the PCTs which did provide IVF treatment were restricting access by taking social factors into account .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The NHS should not fund IVF at all
Rob Berrisford , Pontefract
Send us your comments Calculate your BMI
These included barring people from treatment if one of the partners already had a child from a previous relationship or because the couple had paid for private treatment before going to the NHS .
And it also revealed a quarter of clinics were also restricting treatment according to age , with most only allowing women in their late 30s to have IVF .
Dr Gillian Lockwood , who chairs the BFS 's ethics committee , told the BBC that " unfairness " was the aspect of the NHS provision which people objected to most .
Trying to get rid of the postcode lottery is something that 's influenced treatments for Multiple Sclerosis and cancer
Dr Gillian Lockwood
But Dr Lockwood said there were clinical factors which affected the success of IVF and , as well as weight concerns being over the age of 40 meant that " even very high - tech treatments like IVF are really very unsuccessful " .
She added : " For £ 2,500 , you have at least a 50 % chance of producing a much wanted , beautiful healthy baby - the same cost as stripping varicose veins .
" I think the fourth richest country on earth should be able to afford effective fertility care for its citizens . "
Clare Brown , chief executive of Infertility Network UK said : " From our own surveys and from the many , many calls we receive from patients , we know only too well that there are still unacceptable inequalities in the funding of treatment around the country and couples face huge difficulties in accessing services . "
But Josephine Quintavalle , of the organisation Comment on Reproductive Ethics , told BBC Five Live limited NHS budgets needed to be focused on treatment for groups which would benefit the most .
" If it 's a proven fact that it 's very difficult to get pregnant when you 're overweight , then the logical cure for that kind of infertility is to encourage the patient to lose weight . "
' In line '
Jo Webber , deputy director of policy at the NHS Confederation which represents over 90 % of NHS organisations , said : " We recognise the distressing circumstances that couples with infertility problems find themselves in .
" However , primary care trusts receive a fixed allocation of money to deliver all the services for their local community and have to take difficult decisions on competing priorities . "
The Department of Health said that , while it did not support bans being imposed , the current NHS guidelines were broadly in line with the recommendations on obesity .
A spokeswoman added : " Primary responsibility for implementing NICE guidelines , including the rate of implementation , rests with the NHS at local level and we have made it clear that we expect these guidelines to be followed . "
She said the government was working with patient group Infertility Network UK to ensure PCTs listened to the views of patients .
STATEMENT OF FRANK ZAPPA
These are my personal observations and opinions .
They are addressed to the PMRC as well as this committee .
I speak on behalf of no group or professional organization .
The PMRC proposal is an ill - conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children , infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children , and promises to keep the courts busy for years , dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal 's design .
It is my understanding that , in law , First Amendment Issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative .
In this context , the PMRC 's demands are the equivalent of treating dandruff by decapitation .
No one has forced Mrs. Baker or Mrs. Gore to bring Prince or Sheena Easton into their homes .
Thanks to the Constitution , they are free to buy other forms of music for their children .
Apparently , they insist on purchasing the works of contemporary recording artists in order to support a personal illusion of aerobic sophistication .
Ladies , please be advised :
The $ 8.98 purchase price does not entitle you to a kiss on the foot from the composer or performer in exchange for a spin on the family Victrola .
Taken as a whole , the complete list of PMRC demands reads like an instruction manual for some sinister kind of " toilet training program " to house - break all composers and performers because of the lyrics of a few .
Ladies , how dare you ?
The ladies ' shame must be shared by the bosses at the major labels who , through the RIAA , chose to bargain away the rights of composers , performers , and retailers in order to pass H.R. 2911 , The Blank Tape Tax : A private tax levied by an industry on consumers for the benefit of a select group within that industry .
Is this a " consumer issue " ?
You bet it is .
PMRC spokesperson , Kandy Stroud , announced to millions of fascinated viewers on last Friday 's ABC Nightline debate that Senator Gore , a man she described as " A friend of the music industry , " is co-sponsor of something she referred to as " anti-piracy legislation " .
Is this the same tax bill with a nicer name ?
The major record labels need to have H.R. 2911 whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a rat .
One of them is chaired by Senator Thurmond .
Is it a coincidence that Mrs. Thurmond is affiliated with the PMRC ?
I cannot say she 's a member , because the PMRC has no members .
Their secretary told me on the phone last Friday that the PMRC has no members . . . only founders .
I asked how many other D.C. wives are nonmembers of an organization that raises money by mail , has a tax - exempt status , and seems intent on running the Constitution of the United States through the family paper - shredder .
I asked her if it was a cult .
Finally , she said she could n't give me an answer and that she had to call their lawyer .
While the wife of the Secretary of the Treasury recites " Gonna drive my love inside you . . . " , and Senator Gore 's wife talks about " Bondage ! " and " oral sex at gunpoint , " on the CBS Evening News , people in high places work on a tax bill that is so ridiculous , the only way to sneak it through is to keep the public 's mind on something else : ' Porn rock ' .
The PMRC practices a curious double standard with these fervent recitations .
Thanks to them , helpless young children all over America get to hear about oral sex at gunpoint on network TV several nights a week .
Is there a secret FCC dispensation here ?
What sort of end justifies THESE means ?
PTA parents should keep an eye on these ladies if that 's their idea of ' good taste ' .
Is the basic issue morality ?
Is it mental health ?
Is it an issue at all ?
The PMRC has created a lot of confusion with improper comparisons between song lyrics , videos , record packaging , radio broadcasting , and live performances .
These are all different mediums , and the people who work in them have the right to conduct their business without trade - restraining legislation , whipped up like an instant pudding by The Wives of Big Brother .
Is it proper that the husband of a PMRC nonmember / founder / person sits on any committee considering business pertaining to the Blank Tape Tax or his wife 's lobbying organization ?
Can any committee thus constituted ' find facts ' in a fair and unbiased manner ?
This committee has three .
A minor conflict of interest ?
The PMRC promotes their program as a harmless type of consumer information service providing ' guidelines ' which will assist baffled parents in the determination of the ' suitability ' of records listened to by ' very young children ' .
The methods they propose have several unfortunately [ sic ] side effects , not the least of which is the reduction of all American Music , recorded and live , to the intellectual level of a Saturday morning cartoon show .
Teen - agers with $ 8.98 in their pocket might go into a record store alone , but ' very young children ' do not .
Usually there is a parent in attendance .
The $ 8.98 is in the parents pocket .
The parent can always suggest that the $ 8.98 be spent on a book .
If the parent is afraid to let the child read a book , perhaps the $ 8.98 can be spent on recordings of instrumental music .
Why not bring jazz or classical music into your home instead of Blackie Lawless or Madonna ?
Great music with no words at all is available to anyone with sense enough to look beyond this week 's platinum - selling fashion plate .
Children in the ' vulnerable ' age bracket have a natural love for music .
If , as a parent , you believe they should be exposed to something more uplifting than sugar walls , support Music Appreciation programs in schools .
Why have n't you considered your child 's need for consumer information ?
Music Appreciation costs very little compared to sports expenditures .
Your children have a right to know that something besides pop music exists .
lt is unfortunate that the PMRC would rather dispense governmentally sanitized Heavy Metal Music , than something more ' uplifting ' .
Is this an indication of PMRC 's personal taste , or just another manifestation of the low priority this administration has placed on education for The Arts in America ?
The answer , of course , is neither .
You cannot distract people from thinking about an unfair tax by talking about Music Appreciation .
For that you need sex . . . and lots of it .
Because of the subjective nature of the PMRC ratings , it is impossible to guarantee that some sort of ' despised concept ' wo n't sneak through , tucked away in new slang or the overstressed pronounciation of an otherwise innocent word .
If the goal here is total verbal / moral safety , there is only one way to achieve it ; watch no TV , read no books , see no movies , listen to only instrumental music , or buy no music at all .
The establishment of a rating system , voluntary or otherwise , opens the door to an endless parade of Moral Quality Control Programs based on " Things Certain Christians Don't Like " .
What if the next bunch of Washington Wives demands a large yellow " J " on all material written or performed by Jews , in order to save helpless children from exposure to ' concealed Zionist doctrine ' ?
Record ratings are frequently compared to film ratings .
Apart from the quantitative difference , there is another that is more important : People who act in films are hired to ' pretend ' .
No matter how the film is rated , it wo n't hurt them personally .
Since many musicians write and perform their own material and stand by it as their art ( whether you like it or not ) , an imposed rating will stigmatize them as individuals .
How long before composers and performers are told to wear a festive little PMRC arm band with their Scarlet Letter on it ?
The PMRC rating system restrains trade in one specific musical field : Rock .
No ratings have been requested for Comedy records or Country Music .
Is there anyone in the PMRC who can differentiate infallibly between Rock and Country Music ?
Artists in both fields cross stylistic lines .
Some artists include comedy material .
If an album is part Rock , part Country , part Comedy , what sort of label would it get ?
Should n't the ladies be warning everyone that inside those Country albums with the American Flags , the big trucks , and the atomic pompadours there lurks a fascinating variety of songs about sex , violence , alcohol , and the devil , recorded in a way that lets you hear every word , sung for you by people who have been to prison and are proud of it .
If enacted , the PMRC program would have the effect of protectionist legislation for the Country Music Industry , providing more security for cowboys than it does for children .
One major retail outlet has already informed the Capitol Records sales staff that it would not purchase or display an album with any kind of sticker on it .
Another chain with outlets in shopping malls has been told by the landlord that if it racked " hard - rated albums " they would lose their lease .
That opens up an awful lot of shelf space for somebody .
Could it be that a certain Senatorial husband and wife team from Tennessee sees this as an ' affirmative action program ' to benefit the suffering multitudes in Nashville ?
Is the PMRC attempting to save future generations from SEX ITSELF ?
The type , the amount , and the timing of sexual information given to a child should be determined by the parents , not by people who are involved in a tax scheme cover -up .
The PMRC has concocted a Mythical Beast , and compounds the chicanery by demanding ' consumer guidelines ' to keep it from inviting your children inside its sugar walls .
Is the next step the adoption of a " PMRC National Legal Age For Comprehension of Vaginal Arousal " .
Many people in this room would gladly support such legislation , but , before they start drafting their bill , I urge them to consider these facts :
(1) There is no conclusive scientific evidence to support the claim that exposure to any form of music will cause the listener to commit a crime or damn his soul to hell .
(2) Masturbation is not illegal .
If it is not illegal to do it , why should it be illegal to sing about it ?
(3) No medical evidence of hairy palms , warts , or blindness has been linked to masturbation or vaginal arousal , nor has it been proven that hearing references to either topic automatically turns the listener into a social liability .
(4) Enforcement of anti-masturbatory legislation could prove costly and time consuming .
(5) There is not enough prison space to hold all the children who do it .
The PMRC 's proposal is most offensive in its " moral tone " .
It seems to enforce a set of implied religious values on its victims .
Iran has a religious government .
Good for them .
I like having the capitol of the United States in Washington , DC , in spite of recent efforts to move it to Lynchburg , VA .
Fundamentalism is not a state religion .
The PMRC 's request for labels regarding sexually explicit lyrics , violence , drugs , alcohol , and especially occult content reads like a catalog of phenomena abhorrent to practitioners of that faith .
How a person worships is a private matter , and should not be inflicted upon or exploited by others .
Understanding the Fundamentalist leanings of this organization , I think it is fair to wonder if their rating system will eventually be extended to inform parents as to whether a musical group has homosexuals in it .
Will the PMRC permit musical groups to exist , but only if gay members do n't sing , and are not depicted on the album cover ?
The PMRC has demanded that record companies " re-evaluate " the contracts of those groups who do things on stage that THEY find offensive .
I remind the PMRC that groups are comprised of individuals .
If one guy wiggles too much , does the whole band get an " X " ?
If the group gets dropped from the label as a result of this ' re - evaluation ' process , do the other guys in the group who were n't wiggling get to sue the guy who wiggled because he ruined their careers ?
Do the founders of the tax - exempt organization with no members plan to indemnify record companies for any losses incurred from unfavorably decided breach of contract suits , or is there a PMRC secret agent in the Justice Department ?
Should individual musicians be rated ?
If so , who is qualified to determine if the guitar player is an " X " , the vocalist is a " D / A " or the drummer is a " V " .
If the bass player ( or his Senator ) belongs to a religious group that dances around with poisonous snakes , does he get an " O " ?
What if he has an earring in one ear , wears an Italian Horn around his neck , sings about his astrological sign , practices yoga , reads the Quaballah , or owns a rosary ?
Will his " occult content " rating go into an old CoIntelPro computer , emerging later as a " fact " , to determine if he qualifies for a home - owner loan ?
Will they tell you this is necessary to protect the folks next door from the possibility of ' devil - worship ' lyrics creeping through the wall ?
What hazards await the unfortunate retailer who accidently [ sic ] sells an " O " rated record to somebody 's little Johnny ?
Nobody in Washington seemed to care when Christian Terrorists bombed abortion clinics in the name of Jesus .
Will you care when the " Friends of the wives of big brother " blow up the shopping mall ?
The PMRC wants ratings to start as of the date of their enactment .
That leaves the current crop of ' objectionable material ' untouched .
What will be the status of recordings from that Golden Era to censorship ?
Do they become collector 's items . . . or will another " fair and unbiased committee " order them destroyed in a public ceremony ?
Bad facts make bad law , and people who write bad laws are , in my opinion , more dangerous than songwriters who celebrate sexuality .
Freedom of Speech , Freedom of Religious Tthought [ sic ] , and the Right to Due Process for composers , performers and retailers are imperiled if the PMRC and the major labels consummate this nasty bargain .
Are we expected to give up Article
One so the big guys can collect an extra dollar on every blank tape and 10 to 25 % on tape recorders ?
What 's going on here ?
Do WE get to vote on this tax ?
There 's an awful lot of smoke pouring out of the legislative machinery used by the PMRC to inflate this issue .
Try not to inhale it .
Those responsible for the vandalism should pay for the damage by voluntarily rating themselves .
If they refuse , perhaps the voters could assist in awarding the Congressional " X " , the Congressional " D/A " , the Congressional " V " , and the Congressional " O " .
Just like the ladies say : these ratings are necessary to protect our children .
I hope it's not too late to put them where they really belong .
ANALYSIS
By Mark Ward
Technology correspondent , BBC News website
Filling the place left by Bill Gates is going to prove difficult
Speech highlights
The basic character of the firm was established as long ago as 1976 when Bill Gates clashed with the members of California 's legendary Homebrew Computer Club .
This was where many of those that have gone on to shape the hi-tech world first met and chatted about their new hobby and the first popular home computer - the Altair 8800 .
Bill Gates and co-founder Paul Allen wrote software for the Altair that actually allowed hobbyists to do something with it .
Homebrew members seized on the software , copied it and freely distributed it - much to Bill Gates ' annoyance .
In an open letter to the group Mr Gates decried this willingness to steal .
All that copying without paying does , he said , " is prevent good software from being written . "
" Who can afford to do professional work for nothing ? " he asked in the letter , signing himself as a general partner at Micro - Soft .
Protect and survive
The letter is widely seen as establishing Microsoft 's basic outlook as a fierce protector of its own programs .
It stands in stark opposition to a more open approach that lets anyone tinker with the innards of software .
And , because Paul Allen stepped down from Microsoft in 1983 , the letter is also seen as an insight into Bill Gates business philosophy .
That protective ethic carried over to operating systems such as DOS and the various incarnations of Windows and defined Microsoft 's technical and business strategy .
For a long time it was a great source of strength for the company .
It helped Microsoft gain control of the market for desktop computers and meant that innovation only happened when it said it could - largely because Microsoft controlled who had access to the way its software worked .
Microsoft has been keen to protect access to Windows
And , as many commentators have pointed out , Bill Gates ' dedication to Windows has been a brake on the risks the company has been willling to take .
The rise of the internet and the open source and free software movement has made that desire to protect Windows and use it as the foundation for everything Microsoft does more of a weakness .
This is because the centre of the computer world has shifted from the desktop to the network - specifically the internet .
Which is something Bill Gates has admitted he did not see coming .
Famously , Mr Gates engineered a u-turn at Microsoft in 1995 when he belatedly tried to catch up with net start - ups that were showing it a clean pair of heels .
At the time tens of millions of people were browsing the web without any help from Microsoft software .
The Internet Explorer browser had yet to make an appearance .
It is one of the ironies of hi-tech history that just as Bill Gates broadly succeeded in his aim of putting Windows on every desktop it no longer mattered .
Wither Windows ?
The net , by its nature and founding ethic , encourages a more open and collaborative style of use and software development .
The success of this approach can be seen in the open source Apache software which is used on more than 60 % of web servers .
By contrast Microsoft 's rival product , IIS , barely tops 30 % .
Microsoft has admitted it was late to spot the threat from the net
At the same time , people are less and less interested in sitting down in front of the same PC and more interested in getting at their stuff no matter where they are .
This does not just apply to consumers keen to read e-mail on their phones as well as their laptops or PCs .
It also applies to businesses many of which are starting to use net - based software services rather than buy , install , customise and maintain programs themselves .
Companies such as Salesforce.com and Qualys are among the leading lights of this software - as - a - service movement .
Plus in recent years Microsoft has innovated often by acquisition rather than by building technology in - house .
So it is probably appropriate that Bill Gates is passing his role as chief software architect to Ray Ozzie - whose signature work was on software called Lotus Notes which helps people collaborate across a network .
In many respects Bill Gates is an icon of an earlier era and Mr Ozzie is one of the standard bearers of that more open way of working .
And , it has to be asked , if Windows and Bill Gates ' are so tightly coupled , if one goes , will the other ?
Could Windows Vista be the last outing for the operating system ?
Clearly Ray Ozzie has some tough decisions ahead .
Dog Poet Transmitting .......
The World is changing .
It is transforming into what is yet to be seen or experienced .
At the moment , it is a construction site .
What is there and which has been there for a long time is the no longer functioning framework from a now disappearing age .
It has to come down and it is coming down .
The Big wrecking ball is swinging too and fro .
Why they decided against Controlled Demolition I could n't tell you .
I 'm not one of the people that get THAT memo .
There is a crowd of barbarians who are possessed of a long - simmering hatred for the old structure and they have been TEMPORARILY permitted to take out their aggression on everything in reach , including each other .
They 'll be gone once the building is gone but , for the moment , they are around .
In cosmic terms , the destroyers are not employed in replacing what they had a hand in bringing down .
Heaven 's ways are mysterious to those not consciously resident there .
In Heaven , there is no Fear .
In Middle Earth there is plenty of Fear .
Dramatic change ALWAYS brings that out in people and when they see everything they once believed in being dismantled before their eyes , they get REALLY nervous BECAUSE they have yet to see what is replacing it .
For all they know , nothing is replacing it and that is a scary thing , no question .
Construction has n't begun on the new structure ( duh ) , which is still on the blueprints in the architect 's office .
What is happening now , is the tearing down of the old structure .
This is why we do n't know what is coming and why we have n't seen or experienced it yet because it is n't here yet .
We are in the demolition and planning stage .
Fundamentalist Christians and Muslims , whose religions were supposed to be an improvement on the ' buy low , sell high ' usury and ancestor worship systems that existed previously ( and still exist ) , are not going to be happy about what is coming and the cash register faiths are also not going to be pleased .
EVERYTHING is due to change into new forms ; LIKE IT OR NOT .
In the old , old system , which became reference points for the old systems , there was a splendid fellow called Joshua .
Joshua ( the name ) was a precursor for Jesus .
Joshua translates as ' Jah Liberates ' .
This is a TELL from the cosmogonal headquarters as evidence that the basic impulse of ALL LIFE is toward FREEDOM and LIBERTY .
It is the NATURAL reaction out of the human breast , to pay fealty to what exists as the universal ideal to which we all subscribe , WHETHER WE KNOW IT OR NOT .
This is why scripture tells us that , “ at the name of Jesus , every knee shall bow . ”
What that means is that before the altar of our most basic and compelling drive we shall give homage .
It 's the same thing with that long contested and inflexible comment ; “ I am the way , the Truth and the life and NO MAN cometh unto the Father but by me . ”
It 's another way of saying , “ My way or the highway . ”
The statement is true .
Jesus is an avatar and the first emanation of the source , personalized so that we can relate to it .
It is more difficult to relate to a Cloud of Unknowing .
The Christ is not going anywhere .
It is the same yesterday , today and forever BUT the Jesus side is going to be reconstituted .
Jesus the Christ was a spokesman for Ageless Wisdom .
He was / is also a Wayshower but Fundie Think demands that EVERYTHING be by the book , according to their interpretation of it .
The Christian Church is now crumbling because a NEW AND IMPROVED version is coming .
If you asked me what that is going to be , well ...
I have an idea or two about that ( grin ) and I 'm pretty sure I am close to the mark .
I do n't have all the details but I have a screen capture of the Big Picture .
What is coming is Universal Brotherhood .
The age of Highest Love expressed in Sacrifice , is going out with the age it was representative of .
This does n't mean that sacrifice , as the highest expression of love , is going to be redacted .
It is simply being tailored to resonate with the Zeitgeist persona of what will be the essence of our makeup in this new term .
We will be seeing “ and thou shalt love thy neighbor ( brother ) as thyself . ” becoming the new pattern of interaction .
Jesus said to love your brother as yourself because , HE IS YOURSELF .
Yes , he is .
Our temporary false constructs of ourselves , our personalities in conflict with other personalities , are not real , BUT The Self behind it is and it is the SAME SELF of each of us .
This will probably freak a lot of people out , given their major investment in their personality but ... what are ya gonna do ?
You can scream and stamp your feet all you like , it changes nothing .
The Truth , like The Cheese , stands alone .
Remember how Jesus had one message for the masses and another for the disciples - apostles - initiates ?
Well ... courtesy of the coming avatar , the same method will apply .
On the mass side , you will get Universal Brotherhood and love your neighbor as yourself .
On the initiated side you are going to have THE AWARENESS of the INDWELLING .
This indicates a state of consciousness where some number of us are to be linked telepathically in a common understanding of unity with The Source .
That is what the First Church of the Presence of God is all about .
NO ... I am not going to be The Pope .
I 'm just a common parishioner and I had BETTER NOT FORGET THAT !
I do happen to be a bit ahead of the curve however and have been granted some degree of insight into what is happening and what is coming .
All and sundry are free to object to that and argue it to their heart 's content ; absent my presence , of course .
I do get daily updates , just like anyone involved in any network or business does , if they happen to be in the REQUIRED position that puts them on the memo feed .
I do n't get a lot of memos like I said .
I 'm not interested in being informed about anything else .
I am ONLY interested in what the Supernal Realm transmits .
Of course , I do n't get the whole story .
That 's above my pay grade and my ' need to know ' status .
I do n't get paid anyway , not in the coin of the realm that is .
I get paid in metaphysical cryptocurrency , as anyone who has had the opportunity to investigate my ' no means of visible support ' template has discovered .
This is not to say that they have figured it out .
This is another kind of ' need to know ' thing and if you do know then you are probably engaging in it , same as me .
IF you do n't , then ... well , what can I say ?
So ... there are a lot of people who are going to strenuously object to the hamburgerization of their sacred cows ; not just religiously but socially and in almost every way , because what is coming is not designed to serve selfish interests , raging megalomania , entitlement , or elitism .
This DOES NOT MEAN that all the fun is going to go out of life ; anything but .
Have you ever been joined in a group effort ... say ... in a restaurant , or ... gee , any sort of cooperative effort where everyone involved depends on everyone else and a kind of gestalt emerges and even ... dare I say , a sense of brotherhood ?
Maybe you get the picture .
If you do n't , you are probably going to be working somewhere else .
By now I can hear an undercurrent of muttering about , the sisters .
What about the sisters ?
How do they fit into this brotherhood thing ?
I 'm glad you asked .
In the Aquarian Age , the Divine Feminine is in the ascendant .
This means that parity and fairness are about to be restored ... after a REALLY LONG TIME and the female aspect is going to be celebrated like it has n't been in a long time , except , perhaps in those cooperative efforts I mentioned a moment ago .
I 've been involved in some form of that for most of my life so I know it 's real .
I use the word , Brotherhood , as a general catchall .
Maybe a new word will come up in time .
That 's fine with me as long as it's not Personhood and ' they and their ' does n't predominate , cause that is real fringe stuff .
So is ' comrade 4216 ' and similar .
Sisters are brothers .
There is a big misunderstanding that has been in place for far too long and it would take me far too long to go into all that at the moment .
Let me give you a couple of FACTS that are not in the general mindset .
Unless one has a ' special dispensation ' otherwise , like some of us do ... and let me add here that ANY OF US could have such a dispensation ; unless you have this dispensation , USUALLY if you are male in one life , you are female in the next .
That puts a whole new light on how you treat your significant other , does n't it ?
Best give some thought as to how significant that other is .
There is a reason why KARMA and REINCARNATION were intentionally left out of the Christian faith .
I 've treated with that briefly at other times and do n't have remaining space to treat with it now .
Anyway ... since you will likely be one or the other in each succeeding life you will , at THE VERY LEAST , reap the benefits of the Divine Feminine Ascendancy .
If you want to get ahead of the curve as a man , I suggest getting in touch with your female nature and I do n't mean sexually .
That implies missing the point .
Although everyone is going to have at least one life like that to see what it 's about .
The whole point of being here is EXPERIENCE and finding your way out of here .
Before some people get all hot and bothered about what I said , ALL of this can be worked out during those regular interim times when you go before The Lords of Karma , which ... whether you like it or not , I ASSURE you IS GOING TO HAPPEN .
It is SELDOM hard and fast , without choices , in these sessions .
You get an array of choices , depending on what kind of a hurry you are in and what you 're after .
Not everyone wants to get out of here , or is interested in Liberation or Salvation , in fact , that number is SURPRISINGLY small .
Most people want to get DEEPER into it and have more of it .
Regardless , it ALL has to be earned .
You want to be Tom Cruise ?
Take a number .
Same rules apply , no matter what your preferences are .
Of course , you surely realize ... that some roles have a much longer waiting period and involve a great deal of preparation and PREPAYMENT or ...
Promissory Notes .
That 's it for today .

Producer , BBC Newsnight
As Newsnight 's resident ubergeek , I 've been asked to respond to the torrent of abuse streamed our way over our piece on Friday 24 February about BitTorrent and encryption .
Read some of your comments
Yes , we know - file sharing is definitely not theft
First though , an apology .
File sharing is not theft .
It has never been theft .
Anyone who says it is theft is wrong and has unthinkingly absorbed too many Recording Industry Association of America press releases .
We know that script line was wrong .
It was a mistake .
We 're very , very sorry .
If copyright infringement was theft then I 'd be in jail every time I accidentally used football pix on Newsnight without putting " Pictures from Sky Sport " in the top left corner of the screen .
And I 'm not .
So it is n't .
So you can stop telling us if you like .
We hear you .
Railways and canals
Now we 've got that out the way , let us ask you a question .
Why is it that every time the media starts to talk about the internet they feel compelled to bang on about paedophiles and terrorists and generally come over like a cross between Joe McCarthy and the Childcatcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ?
Although internet service providers sell their internet connections as unlimited usage , if people actually take them up on the offer then they can't actually cope with demand
So we seek to equate the internet with all bad things to scare you off it .
At some corporate freudian level , there 's some truth to that accusation .
Traffic shaping
But there 's a third explanation as well .
Sometimes it 's legitimate .
Friday 's piece sought to make a very sophisticated point in the space of four minutes .
The point was this : a file sharing protocol called BitTorrent now takes up a third of internet traffic , even by the most conservative estimates .
The true figure is probably higher .
Some internet service providers are n't very pleased about that , because although they sell their internet connections as unlimited usage , if people actually take them up on the offer then they can't actually cope with demand .
" Boo hoo , " I hear you say to them .
" Build some more wires in or whatever it is you do .
That 's what we pay you for . "
But no .
The wicked ISPs have , increasingly , opted to block BitTorrent ( and indeed other P2P protocols as well ) using technology known as traffic shaping .
Encrypting torrents
A couple of months ago a person of my very close acquaintance [ cough cough ] was giving his in - laws their weekly fix of Desperate Housewives when he noticed that their Plusnet connection was resolutely not shifting the torrent .
Torrent traffic accounts for more than a third of the internet
Now this was such a good idea that all the other BitTorrent programmers leapt on it within weeks .
As of last weekend the three biggest torrent programs carry automatic encryption and Plusnet and friends are looking at a big hole in their metaphorical dyke .
Happy ending , you might say ?
I could n't possibly comment .
' Swamp of encryption '
However all this made us think the following : if torrent traffic is 30 % and more of the internet , and it 's going encrypted at a rate of knots , then where does that leave the spooks , spies and other law enforcement professionals who sit around monitoring the internet all day ?
Sure , the RC4 encryption in question is n't so very powerful , but the sheer quantity of it we 're envisaging will make decrypting it all an impossibility .
At the moment , there 's little enough encrypted data flying around that using encryption for villainous purposes would just attract attention to yourself .
But in the swamp of encryption that 's in prospect , that will no longer be the case .
Debate
Which brings us back to paedophiles and terrorists .
If you ask the security services and the police why they monitor the internet , those are the bogeymen they claim to be chasing .
In a four minute piece , we 're sort of obliged to take that at face value .
And it 's our contention that they 're not very well going to be able to do that if they 're swamped by encrypted torrent data .
This proposition brought us so much sh*t that it had to be continued on the next fan .
A howl of primal outrage uttered from cyberspace that we were equating copyright infringement with theft ( yes we did - sorry about that ) and with paedo - terror ( no we did n't ) .
What we 'd really like to hear is a debate on the issue we did raise .
If the ISPs can't now detect torrent data , then how will the security services manage it ?
And if they do figure it out , wo n't RnySmile and company just up the ante again ?
And is this secret war between Hollywood and the ISPs on the one side and the P2P community on the other one that can ever end in a truce , or will the stakes just keep raising and raising to the detriment of us all ?

The Wayback Machine is cool , not just because you can go back and see what Ars looked like in May 1999 , but because its 1 + petabyte archive contains a treasure trove of data for researchers .
Last year , the Internet Archive , which runs the Wayback Machine , was sued by Healthcare Advocates after the attorneys for another company used the Wayback Machine to access information that might be helpful in an ongoing legal action .
Healthcare Advocates and the Internet Archive have finally resolved their differences , reaching an undisclosed out - of - court settlement .
In some ways , that 's disappointing news for onlookers who were hoping to see how a court would sift through the complex issues facing Internet archives , caching systems , and more .
More on that later .
Here 's the backstory .
Healthcare Advocates found itself embroiled in a trademark dispute with Philadelphia - based Health Advocate .
The latter company was represented by Harding Earley Follmer & Frailey , which used the Wayback Machine to access Healthcare Advocates web pages dating back to 1999 in an attempt to find information that would bolster their client 's case .
Healthcare Advocates then sued both Harding Earley and the Internet Archive , alleging among other things , violations of the DMCA .
Operated by the Internet Archive , the Wayback Machine dates back to 1996 and archives web sites using Alexa 's crawler .
Like many other crawlers , Alexa respects the Robot Exclusion Standards ( RES ) , a voluntary protocol designed to prevent robot crawlers from accessing part of a website .
In this case , the lawsuit between the two Advocate companies was filed on June 26 , 2003 .
On July 8 , 2003 , Healthcare Advocates added a robots .
txt file to its site to invoke the RES so that crawlers would stop spidering it .
The Internet Archive voluntarily observes the RES , and in fact , will retroactively make archived data off - limits once a such a robots .
txt file is encountered .
So in the case of Healthcare Advocates , the Wayback Machine should have made everything from the site archived prior to July 8 , 2003 unavailable .
Despite that , Harding Earley successfully accessed older data around 110 times on almost 850 attempts .
Those attempts led to accusations that the law firm violated the DMCA and that the Internet Archive was negligent in allowing the data to remain available to searchers .
The archived " snapshots " have since been pulled off of the Wayback Machine and the Archive is in the clear , but the lawsuit against Harding Earley will go forward .
In a way , it 's unfortunate that the suit did n't go forward .
At the heart of the dispute was Healthcare Advocates ' attempt to turn back the clock to a time before data that proved harmful to the company 's interests was posted .
That 's the funny thing about the Internet : once something is posted there , anyone can read and do just about anything else they want to with the data .
Even safeguards like RES are completely voluntary ; there is nothing to stop an interested party from completely archiving web sites .
Legal threats can help move some data out of reach , but once data has been published on the Internet , the damage has been done and you can't go back in time .
The only thing the courts can do is determine who is liable and how much , and that 's a decision this settlement postpones .

Displaced families had been sheltering in the basement of a house in Qana , which was crushed after a direct hit .
Lebanon 's prime minister denounced " Israeli war criminals " and cancelled talks with the US secretary of state .
Israel said it regretted the incident - but added that civilians had been warned to flee the village .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would " continue to act with no hesitation against Hezbollah " which has been firing rockets into Israel from southern Lebanon .

Lebanon crisis ' cannot continue '
Hundreds of Lebanese protesters staged a violent demonstration , ransacking the UN headquarters in Beirut , chanting slogans against the US and Israel and in support of the Hezbollah militants .
Several countries have condemned the attack and renewed their calls for an immediate ceasefire - opposed by Israel and the US .
At an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council , Mr Annan urged members to strongly condemn the Qana attack and to put aside differences to call for an immediate ceasefire .
May God have mercy on the children .
They came here to escape the fighting

British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Sunday the situation could not continue and that all hostilities ought to cease once a UN resolution is adopted .
Lebanon 's health minister now says about 750 people - mainly civilians - have been killed by Israeli action in Lebanon since their operations began 19 days ago .
Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate after the Qana attack .
Several Katyusha rockets hit the border town of Kiryat Shemona on Sunday , wounding several people , in what residents described as the worst day so far .
A total of 51 Israelis , including at least 18 civilians , have been killed in the conflict , sparked by Hezbollah 's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross - border raid on 12 July .
Intense bombing
Witnesses said the early - morning strike hit the three - storey building where families had been sheltering in the basement , crushing it sideways into an enormous crater .
One survivor said the " bombing was so intense that no - one could move " .
Elderly , women and children were among those killed in the raid , which wrought destruction over a wide area .
Reporters spoke of survivors screaming in grief and anger , as some scrabbled through the debris with bare hands .
" We want this to stop , " a villager shouted .
" May God have mercy on the children .
They came here to escape the fighting . "
Rescuers found the experience too much to cope with .
Our correspondent saw a Red Cross rescue worker sitting in the sunshine just sobbing , overcome with emotion .
Israel said the Shia militant group was responsible for the Qana strike , because it used the town to launch rockets .
The BBC's Jim Muir , in Qana , says many did not have the means - or were too frightened - to flee .
' Heinous crime '
Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora denounced Israel 's " heinous crimes against civilians " , and said there was " no room on this sad morning " for talks until Israel had halted its attacks .
He called for an " immediate , unconditional ceasefire " , and praised Hezbollah militants who were " sacrificing their lives for Lebanon 's independence " .

Surely the lives of the innocent should take precedence

The US secretary of state said she was " deeply saddened by the terrible loss of innocent life .
" We are also pushing for an urgent end to the current hostilities , but the views of the parties on how to achieve this are different , " she said .
Correspondents say the town holds bitter memories for the Lebanese .
Qana was the site of an Israeli bombing of a UN base in 1996 that killed more than 100 people sheltering there during Israel 's " Grapes of Wrath " offensive , which was also aimed at destroying Hezbollah .
[ Note : The number of people killed in the Israeli bombing of Qana was later revised .
The Washington based human rights group Human Rights Watch investigated the incident and issued a report on 3 August saying that 28 people were known to have died , while 13 people were missing . ]
She then confronted Mr. Frey about his fabrications , leading him to admit that in addition to exaggerating the amount of time he had spent in jail , he had lied about how his girlfriend had died ; about the details of a foray outside a rehabilitation center ; and about his claim that he had received a root canal without anesthesia because the center prohibited the use of Novocaine .
" I think most of what they wrote was pretty accurate , absolutely , " Mr. Frey said yesterday of the Smoking Gun report .
Ms. Winfrey also acknowledged that she had received an early warning that parts of " A Million Little Pieces " were fictionalized from a former counselor at the center where the book takes place .
Eight days after she picked the book in September , a former counselor at Hazelden , the Minnesota treatment center now identified as the one where Mr. Frey stayed , contacted her producers and told them that many parts of the book were untrue .
Ms. Winfrey said that she had had her producers ask the publisher about the allegations , but that they were reassured the book was accurate .
She had harsh words during the broadcast for the publisher , Ms. Talese , who said that neither she nor anyone at Doubleday had investigated the accuracy of Mr. Frey 's book .
She said the company first learned that parts of the book had been made up when The Smoking Gun published its report , nearly two years after the memoir was first published .
" An author brings his book in and says that it is true , it is accurate , it is his own , " Ms. Talese said .
" I thought , as a publisher , this is James 's memory of the hell he went through and I believed it . "
But Ms. Winfrey pointed out that her producers had asked about reports of the book 's truth in September , after the Hazelden counselor raised doubts , and that they were reassured by Random House .
" We asked if you , your company , stood behind James 's book as a work of nonfiction at the time , and they said absolutely , " Ms. Winfrey said .
" And they were also asked if their legal department had checked out the book , and they said yes .
So in a press release sent out for the book in 2004 by your company , the book was described as brutally honest and an altering look at  at addiction .
So how can you say that if you have n't checked it to be sure ? "
TIGR scientists probe new pan-genome
Ever since the genomics revolution took off , scientists have been busily deciphering vast numbers of genomes .
Cataloging .
Analyzing .
Comparing .
Public databases hold 239 complete bacterial genomes alone .
But scientists at The Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR ) have come to a startling conclusion .
Armed with the powerful tools of comparative genomics and mathematics , TIGR scientists have concluded that researchers might never fully describe some bacteria and viruses -- because their genomes are infinite .
Sequence one strain of the species , and scientists will find significant new genes .
Sequence another strain , and they will find more .
And so on , infinitely .
" Many scientists study multiple strains of an organism , " says TIGR President Claire Fraser .
" But at TIGR , we 're now going a step further , to actually quantify how many genes are associated with a given species .
How many genomes do you need to fully describe a bacterial species ? "
In pursuit of that question , TIGR scientist Hervé Tettelin and colleagues published a study in this week 's ( September 19 - 23 ) early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
In the study , TIGR scientists , with collaborators at Chiron Corporation , Harvard Medical School and Seattle Children 's Hospital , compared the genomic sequence of eight isolates of the same bacterial species : Streptococcus agalactiae , also known as Group B Strep ( GBS ) , which can cause infection in newborns and immuno - compromised individuals .
Analyzing the eight GBS genomes , the researchers discovered a surprisingly continual stream of diversity .
Each GBS strain contained an average of 1806 genes present in every strain ( thus constituting the GBS core genome ) plus 439 genes absent in one or more strains .
Moreover , mathematical modeling showed that unique genes will continue to emerge , even after thousands of genomes are sequenced .
The GBS pan - genome is expected to grow by an average of 33 new genes every time a new strain is sequenced .
" We were surprised to find that we have n't cornered this species yet , " says Tettelin , lead author of the PNAS paper .
" We still do n't know -- and apparently , we 'll never know -- the extent of its diversity . "
To interpret this infinite view of microbial genomes , Tettelin and colleagues propose describing a species by its " pan-genome " : the sum of a core genome , containing genes present in all strains , and a dispensable genome , with genes absent from one or more strains and genes unique to each strain .
The pan - genome is more than mere syntax .
The concept has real implications for molecular biology .
Many important pathogens -- including those responsible for influenza , Chlamydia , and gastrointestinal infections , all under study at TIGR -- contain multiple strains with specific genomes .
By bringing a pan - genome perspective to the study of these organisms , scientists may better learn how new pathogens emerge and better target therapies to specific conditions .
One approach is to spotlight a species 's core genome .
On the flip side , scientists may eliminate a core genome , hunting instead for fringe genes that explain a specific strain 's unique activity .
TIGR researchers say the pan -genome concept also underscores the limits of traditional known genomes .
Researchers often refer to a " type " genome to describe a given species .
That singular , representative genome is often simply the strain easiest to acquire from nature or grow in the lab .
Yet scientists worldwide routinely tap these known genomes in public databases to hunt for drug targets , explain ecological niches , and chart evolution .
How well do these microbial genomes reflect reality ?
As comparative genomics itself evolves , Fraser expects TIGR to increasingly focus on pan-genomes .
Many questions remain .
Although some microbial species , such as GBS , have infinite pan-genomes , for instance , others are more limited .
Comparing eight independent isolates of Bacillus anthracis ( the bacterium that causes anthrax ) , for instance , Tettelin and colleagues found that just four genomes were sufficient to characterize its pan-genome .
That raises interesting questions about rates of evolution , notes Fraser .
" We 're intrigued to learn more about the diversity within a given species , and how it happens , " she says .

Analysis
Five years after the first internet bubble burst , we 're now witnessing the backlash against Web 2.0 and a plethora of me - too business plans , marketing pitches and analyst reports exploiting the nebulous phrase .
Tim Berners - Lee , the individual credited with inventing the web and giving so many of us jobs , has become the most prominent individual so - far to point out that the Web 2.0 emperor is naked .
Berners - Lee has dismissed Web 2.0 as useless jargon nobody can explain and a set of technology that tries to achieve exactly the same thing as " Web 1.0 . "
According to this transcript , Berners - Lee was reacting to an IBM developerWorks pod cast interviewer who'd categorized Web 1.0 as connected computers and making information available , and Web 2.0 as connecting people and facilitating new kinds of collaboration .
Those who remember the empowering effects of Netscape and the moment email became more than just borrowing your mate 's CompuServe account at work will also recognize such blanket assertions of historical revisionism for what they are .
Berners - Lee 's words come as the hype around all things Web 2.0 reaches a zenith .
Entrepreneurs hoping to become the next Google or Salesforce.com acquisition , marketing types desperate for a home run , analysts segmenting the market to sell research , and opinionated bloggers have , at the latest count , attached the phrase " 2.0 " to 12 other " concepts " or technologies .
We have : SOA 2.0 , enterprise 2.0 , grid 2.0 , VoIP 2.0 , voice 2.0 , BPM 2.0 , Office 2.0 and - outside of pure technology - advertising 2.0 and marketing 2.0 ( both - naturally - taking advantage of Web 2.0's social networking technologies ) , business development 2.0 and - subverting the genre - hidsight 2.0 and lunch 2.0 .
There are two common problems with Web 2.0 and its derivatives .
The first is the desire to characterize Web 2.0 as unique technology with unique consequences for business .
Web 2.0 relies on technologies that have been around for years .
Berners - Lee pointed out the things that drove Web 1.0 also underpin Web 2.0 - the document object mode , HTML , http , SVG , web standards and - because he 's old school " Java script of course . "
Free Software Foundation chief legal counsel Eben Moglen recently concurred at this month 's LinuxWorld , saying Web 2.0 owes its existence to software and development methodologies already established in open source .
" The phenomena of the empty buzzword called Web 2.0 can only exist because of the real layer for free and open source software underneath , " Moglen said , letting the Web 2.0 crowd down gently .
Web 2.0 is , in Berners - Lee 's definition , purely a blog and wiki thing .
Reinforcing that idea is Andrew McAfee of the Harvard Business School , who is actually credited with creating the phrase Enterprise 2.0 .
Enterprise 2.0 wraps up wikis , blogs , RSS and Ajax , according to McAffee .
While the ingredients that makes this stuff have been lying around for years , what makes things so different is the way it 's all coming together right now .
Services are affordable , services are morphing to create social networks , and tools are helping filter blog and wiki content .
While enterprise software is indeed evolving thanks to blog and wiki technologies - well , at least so far as adding RSS to things like Microsoft Outlook and Windows goes - Enterprise 2.0 simplifies the complex history of , and relationship between , business and technology .
Remember the PC revolution ?
Or what about remote working ?
Or e-commerce ?
Genuine milestones in the evolution of business because they fundamentally changed companies ' structures and cultures .
Yet these rate as incremental product version numbers somewhere between Enterprise 1.0 and Enterprise 2.0 , apparently .
It 's interesting to note Web 2.0 poster child Wikipedia may expunge Enterprise 2.0 for a second time after the phrase was resurrected from the digital dead .
The other problem if you peak behind the Web 2.0 blog and wiki curtain is that you 'll find the man pulling the levers is either an enterprise vendor or an analyst eager to sell to business customers .
Of special interest to businesses should be SOA 2.0 and grid 2.0 .
Weeding through the philosophizing on these buzzwords typified here and here , you 'll find some common themes : essentially that version 2.0 goes further than the original idea and also creates a greater degree of flexibility .
Specifically , SOA 2.0 is about an event - driven architecture , not just a " client / server relationship " , and uses " deeper semantics " pulled together " mechanically . "
Grid 2.0 is about sharing networks and storage resources , and data not just raw computing power .
While there is no single definition for SOA , the general thesis from the start was for systems to discover each other and work together reliably .
That 's why IBM , Microsoft , Oracle , Sun Microsystems and other companies large and small sweated through standards groups and the Java Community Process to devise the WS - specifications and Java APIs for asynchronous communication , secure and reliable delivery of messages , federated identity , and the development of enterprise services busses .
Grids have been around for years , mostly in academic and high - performance computing environments .
Groups like the Global Grid Forum , backed by Oracle , Hewlett Packard , Intel , and AMD among others , and Globus Alliance have been working to make grids something businesses can also tap by devising standards , best practices , middleware and tools .
The inherent problem with grid 2.0 is the philosophy behind grids has always been about harnessing distributed computing power .
In other words , grid 2.0 is grid 1.0 because it re-treads an accepted concept by just adding more stuff .
What 's really driving SOA 2.0 and grid 2.0 is hollow , buzzword - based marketing by companies trying to stand out in overpopulated and immature markets .
On SOA , we have a general , high - level consensus in the absence of a single standards - based definition .
Specifications for both SOA and grid are still being devised , and where specifications exist they are not fully implemented by all vendors .
This has therefore created a vacuum in which vendors and analysts make hollow and partisan marketing claims to stand out .
So -far , only Oracle , backed - curiously - by Gartner believe in SOA 2.0 .
Systems heavyweight IBM , making its own hollow claims of having dominant market share in SOA , its number - one rival BEA Systems , and SOA cheerleader SAP do not appear to share the Oracle and Gartner view .
Judging by its staid LinuxWorld keynote , Intel is the only one banging the grid 2.0 drum .
Oracle , the software grid champion , and possibly IBM would - you 'd have thought - be among the first to recognize an evolution in grids if one existed .
Not a chip manufacturer experiencing growing competition from grid evangelist AMD .
You should thank Tim Berners - Lee .
Not just for giving us the web , but for articulating what 's gone wrong in the lexicon and thinking of Silicon Valley .
Hopefully , his standing in the web community will serve as a rallying cry for right - thinking individuals and true visionaries , and mean Web 2.0 is put in its proper context . ®

BBC News , northern Italy
Venice is regularly swamped by high tides and floods
Rather than battling to keep the sea out - they want to use it to help raise the sinking island - city .
The scheme would involve pumping huge quantities of sea water into the ground beneath Venice down 12 pipes each of which would be 700 m ( 765 yards ) long .
The sea water would make the sand beneath the city expand lifting Venice by 30 cm ( 11.8 inches ) in 10 years .
' Science fiction '
The northern Italian city is slowly drowning - sea levels in the Adriatic are rising , and high tides are becoming more frequent .
The Italian government is spending 4.5 bn euro ( £ 2.9bn ) on a controversial project to build floodgates across the entrance to the lagoon in which the city stands in an effort to keep the sea at bay .
Now , a panel of engineers and geologists from the respected University of Padua have come up with the new scheme costing just a fraction of that - 100 m euro ( £ 68 m ) .
It says the plan would help raise Venice by almost as much as it has sunk over the past three centuries .
The professor leading the project says it is not an alternative to the floodgates - but would work in tandem with them .
He now wants to carry out a trial to see if the theory would work in practice .
Not everyone is convinced .
One expert - who helped stabilise the leaning Tower of Pisa - described the scheme as pure science fiction and warned it could damage the fragile structure of Venice .
But the city 's mayor is interested .
He says it is time to look again at how to raise the city - and is convinced that the technology exists to make it a reality .

( CNN ) --
British junk food lovers are having an unhealthy effect on the country 's pigeons , which are becoming obese by feasting on litter leftovers .
The charity Keep Britain
Tidy says people who do not throw their uneaten junk food away are causing the problem .
Chief executive Alan Woods said the birds were now " supersized " and dependent on people rather than nature for their food .
The abundance of food on offer was also causing a population explosion of pigeons in Britain , which are considered a health hazard and a nuisance , he said .
" Seven out of the 10 bits of litter we find on our pavements and roads are food related .
And with all this trash to choose from , the pigeon , rat , fox and gull population has spiraled , " Woods said .
The litter problem was worse during summer because the warm weather meant more people ate outdoors .
Summer also coincides with the peak breeding season for pigeons in June and July .
Woods said if the problem continued , local councils would be forced to cull thousands of pigeons to keep numbers under control .
" This is n't fair on the councils who are left to control the pest problem and is cruel to those animals who are scavenging in unnatural environments for food that is n't good for them , " he said .
Keep Britain
Tidy has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the problem and to encourage people not to litter .
" People genuinely feed pigeons out of a sense of kindness .
But by leaving food around , they are not helping the birds at all .
Pigeons become dependent on you for their diet and when flocks gather this spreads disease and drives smaller birds away , " he said .
" Really , the best way to care for pigeons is to stop dropping and littering food , and instead let nature take its course . "
He said the charity welcomed new legislation which made it easier to hit people who litter with on - the - spot fines .

by C AROLINE GRAHAM and JO KNOWSLEY , Mail on Sunday
Last updated at 09:10 11 September 2005
Doctors working in hurricane - ravaged New Orleans killed critically ill patients rather than leaving them to die in agony as they evacuated hospitals , The Mail on Sunday can reveal .
With gangs of rapists and looters rampaging through wards in the flooded city , senior doctors took the harrowing decision to give massive overdoses of morphine to those they believed could not make it out alive .
In an extraordinary interview with The Mail on Sunday , one New Orleans doctor told how she ' prayed for God to have mercy on her soul ' after she ignored every tenet of medical ethics and ended the lives of patients she had earlier fought to save .
Her heart - rending account has been corroborated by a hospital orderly and by local government officials .
One emergency official , William ' Forest ' McQueen , said : " Those who had no chance of making it were given a lot of morphine and lain down in a dark place to die . "
Euthanasia is illegal in Louisiana , and The Mail on Sunday is protecting the identities of the medical staff concerned to prevent them being made scapegoats for the events of last week .
Their families believe their confessions are an indictment of the appalling failure of American authorities to help those in desperate need after Hurricane Katrina flooded the city , claiming thousands of lives and making 500,000 homeless .
' These people were going to die anyway '
The doctor said : " I did n't know if I was doing the right thing .
But I did not have time .
I had to make snap decisions , under the most appalling circumstances , and I did what I thought was right .
" I injected morphine into those patients who were dying and in agony .
If the first dose was not enough , I gave a double dose .
And at night I prayed to God to have mercy on my soul . "
The doctor , who finally fled her hospital late last week in fear of being murdered by the armed looters , said : " This was not murder , this was compassion .
They would have been dead within hours , if not days .
We did not put people down .
What we did was give comfort to the end .
" I had cancer patients who were in agony .
In some cases the drugs may have speeded up the death process .
" We divided patients into three categories : those who were traumatised but medically fit enough to survive , those who needed urgent care , and the dying .
" People would find it impossible to understand the situation .
I had to make life - or - death decisions in a split second .
" It came down to giving people the basic human right to die with dignity .
" There were patients with Do Not Resuscitate signs .
Under normal circumstances , some could have lasted several days .
But when the power went out , we had nothing .
" Some of the very sick became distressed .
We tried to make them as comfortable as possible .
" The pharmacy was under lockdown because gangs of armed looters were roaming around looking for their fix .
You have to understand these people were going to die anyway . "
Mr McQueen , a utility manager for the town of Abita Springs , half an hour north of New Orleans , told relatives that patients had been ' put down ' , saying : " They injected them , but nurses stayed with them until they died . "
Mr McQueen has been working closely with emergency teams and added : " They had to make unbearable decisions . "
There are other guides for setting up Subversion and for migrating from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion , but they were n't up to date .
This I suppose is normal for something that is only done once and this guide will itself get obsoleted as Visual SourceSafe and Subversion move to new versions .
So , to start with these are the version numbers of the main tools that I 've been using : Visual SourceSafe — 6.0 c ( build 9447 ) ;
Subversion — 1.3.2 ;
TortoiseSVN — 1.3.5 build 6804 ;
AnkhSVN — 0.5.5.1653 .
Just as I was in the process of finishing this article off Subversion 1.4 came out .
I 've not upgraded either clients or server here yet , but my expectation is that using 1.4 for a new installation is the right choice , but it would be best to test compatibility of TortoiseSVN and AnkhSVN first .
Although it 's clear that Visual SourceSafe is n't the best source control system , it is generally good enough for small programming shops like ours .
Our ongoing efforts to open source FOST.3 ™ gave us the push to re-evaluate our source control as we want to be able to make our repository available to external developers .
I need to start with a disclaimer —
I 'm no expert on Subversion so there are probably better ways of doing much of this .
This is just what I 've done to get everything up and working for us .
Is Subversion better than Visual SourceSafe ?
My motivation for wanting to switch to a different source control system was to allow the source control to be opened up properly over the Internet .
Visual SourceSafe performs extremely badly over slow network connections .
I think this is partly because the underlying file sharing is also very bad over high latency and low bandwidth networks .
Visual SourceSafe also likes to keep open file handles to the database files and this is also pretty bad over the Internet .
A big problem with the database format is that it is not reliable in the face of unreliable network links .
Data corruption is common and it's just not possible to use SourceSafe over any network that is prone to random failure .
All in all , Visual SourceSafe is OK if all of your developers are in one location , but is a complete nightmare if you use it remotely .
The thing that really sold me on Subversion though from my first few minutes of using it was the realisation that it did n't need to mark files as read - only in order to manage them .
This has been causing problems with some tools that can't automate check - outs and it also causes problems with installers which copy the read - only attribute all the way to the target machine .
A real pain for configuration files .
Probably the first thing that you will notice though is n't anything to do with the technical abilities of the program , but rather the aesthetics of it .
Visual SourceSafe looks and feels awkward and clunky , Subversion feels slick .
TortoiseSVN and AnkhSVN just seem to work so much better than SourceSafe and look so much nicer .
The fact that they bring a slew of more sophisticated features too is an added bonus .
Features
The ability to manage files without using a read only attribute solves a lot of problems .
If you forget to check out a file there are a few applications that will open it in a “ read only ” mode and not allow you to save to the same location even after you check the file out .
This causes me untold woe every time I come across it , and I just can't get into the habit of always remembering to check out first .
TortoiseSVN's integration into the Explorer shell make it much easier to use .
So far I can't really tell if this slows down Explorer much or not .
I guess if I can't really tell then the impact is n't all that bad .
The merge feature it has is also fantastic .
It highlights most things in a similar way , but when showing changes on a line it also marks the parts of the line that are changed and shows you the changes above each other .
It often takes me some time to find small changes in a line code between versions — TortoiseSVN makes this easy .
It does take a little practice to work out how to do this properly though .
The only web access currently available is through Apache which we do n't run here .
As we want to get away from using file shares to access the repository we will only want to use the svn : protocol .
I 'm not too concerned about encryption at the moment so wo n't be running it over SSH .
Although Subversion will handle the security that we need it has a very simple security model .
Users are assigned passwords and groups and the users or groups are then given either no , read or read / write access to a repository directory and its children .
Anonymous access can also be configured .
Where Subversion really helps though is in working practices .
Having written a tool to migrate from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion I now really understand why our build and release processes where so chaotic — SourceSafe just can't be used effectively programmaticly .
It is extremely time consuming to try to parse the output that it generates and none of it is aimed at making life easy for developers .
With Subversion on the other hand it is possible to write very sophisticated automated tools for handling the build processes including tagging and branching of the relevant parts of projects .
What Subversion wo n't do
Subversion treats file copies in a substantially different way to SourceSafe .
Whilst SourceSafe has a concept of a shared file between projects there is no such concept in Subversion .
Symbolic links have been much discussed , but they 're not going to be here any time yet .
Depending on how you make use of the feature you may be able to use svn:external to achieve this effect .
So far we 've not completely worked out how to deal with this issue for web sites we develop where directories contain files shared between all web sites and files that are unique to a given site .
SourceSafe handles this very well with the shared file feature , but so far we 're having to do this manually in Subversion meaning of course that some sites do n't get the updates they should .
Migration planning
There are three of our servers that are relevant to how we want to run Subversion :
Angelo — A development server .
Runs a test Subversion repository .
This is important because you do n't want to be learning Subversion on your production source control system .
Turner — The main domain controller and file server .
It will run the production repository on a pair of mirrored disks .
Goes — The internet facing server connected to the development network .
Originally this was going to run the Subversion service , but in the end I decided to set up port forwarding to allow external users to see the service running on Turner .
All of the remaining steps were done twice — firstly on Angelo to set up the test repository where I could work out how to do everything and then again on Goes and Turner to establish the final repository .
Installing Subversion
Setting up Subversion is pretty simple .
Use the Subversion installer .
Install TortoiseSVN .
Unzip the service files and copy them to the Subversion install location .
File system
When setting up the repository I first tried the newer native file system ( FSFS ) .
After putting through more than 100,000 changes I discovered that there were errors in the database .
Talking to one of the developers , John Szakmeister ( who was very helpful ) , it seems that the assumed cause of this is in interaction between the Subversion server software and Apache .
It turned out though that a bad sector on the development server 's disk had killed 12 KB of one of the data files effectively killing the database .
I also tested the Berkeley database format which has a longer history and is widely regarded as more stable than FSFS .
The disadvantage is that you cannot use it with the file : protocol , but if you 're like me then you probably consider this an advantage .
The Berkeley database seems to be much slower for directories that contain a lot of files than FSFS is .
Upgrades may also be harder .
Despite all of this I 've gone with Berkely for our main repository due to the problems I 'd had with FSFS , even though that is n't really fair on FSFS .
The dump and load repository commands do mean that repositories can be taken offline and switched from one format to another fairly easily .
I 've not tested this yet .
The repository is made by right - clicking in the directory you want to use in Explorer and choosing the option from the TortoiseSVN menu .
Setting up the service
Setting up the service is pretty easy .
First off test that everything works as you expect by running the server from a command prompt .
This is the command that I 've been using on my test server :
svnserv -- root c:\Server \Subversion \Repository
Assuming that works the service can be set up by doing this :
SVNService - install -- root c: \Server \Subversion \Repository
Start the service in the normal way and make sure it is set to Automatic .
Setting security
The security we 'd used for SourceSafe was very simple .
Each developer had a login whose password was simply their name .
This meant that others could force a checkin of any files if the first developer forgot to do so .
We never needed to worry about partitioning parts of the source database as all of the developers were internal and trusted .
For the use that we need to put Subversion to though the requirements are now a bit tighter .
We 're going to have some anonymous access and we 're also going to have external developers with varying levels of access .
We 're also now starting to work more with external companies to co-develop systems so we will need to allow them access to some files on what we would normally consider internal projects .
The security system that Subversion has will allow us to do this , but there are a couple of gotchas .
All of the configuration that you need to change can be found in the conf sub - directory where you created the repository files .
Changes take effect immediately — there 's no need to stop and start the service .
svnserv.cnf
This file controls the overall repository behaviour in terms of security .
Once all of the comments have been stripped out this is the effective contents of our file on the test server .
[ general ] password - db=passwd authz-db=authz realm=svn.test.felspar.net
The first two lines enable the default password and security configuration files .
The final line changes the name of the repository ( only used if you are sharing password or access control configuration files between repositories ) .
passwd
The password file is very simple :
[ users ] kirit=password
Note that the passwords really are in plain text !
I understand that it is possible to use your normal Windows authentication by using the svn-ssh : protocol , but I have n't experimented with it .
Configuration of Apache should also allow this , but again I 've not tried it so can't comment .
authz
Getting this file right is a little tricky .
[ groups ] internal=kirit , fred [ / ] * =r kirit=rw [ / private ] *= @internal=r kirit=rw vss_import=rw [ / private / test ] @internal=rw
Working through this from the top we set up a group called internal with members kirit and fred .
We provide anonymous read access to the root of the repository , but kirit gets full access .
I then configure a private directory to which most users have no access , the internal group has read permission and vss_import has read and write permissions .
I have to specify kirit again because the server will match against the longest path it can find in this file .
Finally I set up a test area that all members of internal have read and write access to in order to play around .
The problem with it is that it does n't work .
I can't find any reason why it should n't in the documentation , but it looks like there is a bug in the authentication process .
The only way that I can see to get around this at the moment is to not allow anonymous access of any sort to the repository .
This means that the configuration must be changed to :
[ general ] anon-access=none password - db=passwd authz-db=authz realm=svn.test.felspar.net
It also means that there is no need to use the wildcard when configuring the security settings which is probably also a bonus , but there is no anonymous access to the repository .
Backing up the server files
In order to back up the server it is not recommended to just copy the repository directory structure to another location .
This sort of backup strategy does n't work with any database application and Subversion is no exception to this .
I use this to make a copy and clean out the logs :
svnadmin hotcopy c:\Server \Subversion \Repository F : \Backup \Subversion \Current -- clean-logs
Note that the command is only able to make a single directory level .
So if you want to put the backup into F : \Backup \Subversion \Current you will need to create the directories F : \Backup \Subversion before running the command .
It is n't entirely clear to me whether or not it is safe to back up a Berkely database repository to a networked location .
I have been doing this and the backups seem to work .
Migrating the SourceSafe database to Subversion
There are four basic approaches to switching over to Subversion :
Just use Subversion for new projects and Visual SourceSafe for old projects .
This is fine if you find yourself working on lots of short lived projects and do n't transfer files between them .
Just import your current working files into Subversion .
This means of course that you will need to go back to SourceSafe to review older versions .
Import the histories of all files seperately .
This means losing shared histories ( where files have been shared between projects ) , but you do get most everything else .
Replay the full history of your SourceSafe databases into Subversion .
This is extremely hard and may not be possible depending on how you use SourceSafe .
You should only consider the first option if each new project starts with a truly clean slate .
If you maintain separate repositories for shared libraries then you may be able to get away with this and use Subversion for new things and SourceSafe for older things .
It seems to me though that you wo n't get the benefits of making the switch and you 'll get bogged down trying to maintain two systems .
The approach probably works well for home projects and for test project repositories .
The second option is better in that you can at least switch everything from SourceSafe to Subversion , but you lose the history .
For some sorts of work this loss probably is n't a problem .
I expect that most software shops wo n't find this a viable option .
When Power Admin ran his migration he came across a file example .
exe ; 5 that caused a problem .
I had a similar experience and his fix of renaming the file and doing a manual add seemed to work fine for me too .
The basic issue is that the file was pinned though .
Before doing the migration you should go through and check that there are no pinned files .
A second thing to watch for is that although the SourceSafe database path is set in the configuration file this information is not used by the program .
You will need to manually set the environment variable SSDIR to the path of the srcsafe .ini file for your database .
The third option is much more interesting .
Depending on how you use SourceSafe this may be everything that you require .
There are two tools available to you that will do this sort of migration ( with some caveats ) .
Brett Wooldridge has a Perl tool available on his site which Power Admin has re-implemented in Microsoft Visual C++™.
I 've not used Brett 's Perl tool as I do n't speak Perl , but I have succesfully imported a sub- project with Power Admin 's tool .
See the side bar for some extra details to watch out for .
sourcesafe2subversion
Because of the way that we use SourceSafe I really wanted a much better migration tool and so looked to enable the fourth option .
This is much more complex than I 'd initially thought due to the vagaries of how SourceSafe stores the history — in fact it took me several weeks to get it all working properly !
I 've not come across any other tools that do this migration and of course mine has only been tested on a small test database and our main database .
The main database contains nearly 13,000 files and is about five years old and has been well abused so the tool has at least been given a pretty thorough workout .
Using sourcesafe2subversion is probably going to lead to a faster migration of data if you use file sharing in SourceSafe as it will reduce the number of versions of files that it reads in .
It also manages to create a better history within the Subversion repository as it better matches what actually happened to the files .
It clearly is n't perfect though , but having studied the problem in great depth now I can think of a few things that could be done slightly better , but I expect the overall approach the tool takes to be the best possible .
The description of the full horror of trying to do this is left for a slightly later time when we release the tool .
Moving forwards
We still have a few things to work out with our change of processes , especially in how to efficiently manage branching and merging .
We 're now improving our process to tackle things that we were n't able to do with SourceSafe and of course there are teething problems associated with this learning process .
Give us another six months with the tool and we 'll be a long way beyond where we could ever have gotten to with SourceSafe .

The spider died engulfed in sticky amber
Enlarge Image
Palaeontologist Dr David Penney , of the University of Manchester , found the 4cm long by 2 cm wide fossil during a visit to a museum in the Dominican Republic .
Since the discovery two years ago , he has used droplets of blood in the amber to reveal the age of the specimen .
It is thought to be the first time spider blood has been found in amber and scientists hope to extract its DNA .
Dr Penney , of the School of Earth , Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences , said he had used the blood droplets to trace how , when and where the spider died .
It is a new species from the Filistatidae family commonly found in South America and the Caribbean .
It 's amazing to think that a single piece of amber with a single spider in it can open up window into what was going on 20 million years ago
Dr David Penney , University of Manchester
He claims the shape and position of the blood droplets revealed which direction the spider was travelling in and which of its legs broke first .
" It 's amazing to think that a single piece of amber with a single spider in it can open up a window into what was going on 20 million years ago , " he said .
" By analysing the position of the spider 's body in relation to the droplets of blood in the amber we are able to determine how it died , which direction it was travelling in and even how fast it was moving . "
He first saw the fossil during a visit to the Museo del Ambar Dominicano , in Puerto Plata , Dominican Republic .
Dr Penney reports his findings in the latest issue of the journal Palaeontology .
A terrible thing is happening , and not enough Americans are aware to be able to do anything about it .
Zionists in Israel and in the Bush administration are leading America into war with Iran , Syria , Hizbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine .
The consequences for America , Israel and the Middle East will be disastrous , but as long as Washington is in thrall to Zionist paranoia , nothing can be done about it .
Bush made this clear on July 14 when he rejected the plea from Lebanons prime minister to pressure Israel to stop its attack on Lebanon .
The war began when Bushs neoconservative government invaded Afghanistan and Iraq under the pretense of " fighting terrorism . "
Neither front has gone well for America .
The Israelis , seeing the growing domestic opposition to Bushs wars of choice , concluded that they are in danger of losing Americas military intervention in behalf of their Middle East interests .
Israel decided to force the issue .
Israel did this by bombing and invading Gaza , from which they had just withdrawn as part of a " Palestinian settlement . "
Israels pretext was the capture of one Israeli soldier in Gaza in retribution for Israels genocidal policies toward Palestine .
Few Americans know that Israel has forced Palestinians into ghettos and walled them off from their farm lands , schools , and medical treatment .
By slaughtering scores of civilians and destroying the infrastructure of the fragile land in response to the capture of one Israeli soldier , Israel has made it clear that its policy is fire and sword .
Under international law  the identical law that was used to try Nazi war criminals after World War II  Israels invasion of Gaza is a monstrous war crime .
The United Nations top humanitarian official , Jan Egeland , said that Israels attacks on civilians and infrastructure violated international law .
On July 13 , the UN Security Council tried to condemn Israel for its criminal invasion of Gaza , but US Ambassador John Bolton , a rabid pro-Israeli zealot , vetoed the Security Council resolution that would have required Israel to halt its illegal and criminal actions in Gaza .
Bolton is the UN ambassador who could not get confirmed even in a Republican Senate and was given a recess appointment by Bush in defiance of Congress .
On July 12 , Israel invaded Lebanon .
The pretext was the capture of two Israeli soldiers in Israeli - occupied Lebanese territory by Hizbollah .
In two days Israel has slaughtered scores of Lebanese civilians , destroyed bridges and power plants , attacked the Beruit International Airport and blocked Lebanese ports .
Israels over - reactions are calculated to start a wider war .
Israel has asserted that the two soldiers captured by Hizbollah are being held in Iran .
Israel blames Syria for Hizbollahs acts .
Both Israel and its neoconsevative allies in the Bush government blame Iran and Syria for " attacks on Israel " by Hamas and Hizbollah .
No one , least of all Bush , blames Israels Palestinian policy .
Israels American agents , the neoconservatives , have made it clear for years that their goal is to eliminate every Middle Eastern government that is not ruled by an American puppet friendly to Israel .
The people who hold the important positions in Bushs government have frankly stated this position over and over .
For example , a decade ago in 1996 a group of American neoconservatives who have comprised much of the sub- cabinet in the Bush administration wrote that Israel could gain American sympathy by blaming aggression on Hizbollah , Syria , and Iran and then seizing the strategic initiative by " engaging Hizbollah , Syria , and Iran as the principal agents of aggression in Lebanon . "
First , however , Iraq would have to be taken out .
The first focus , said the neocons , should be " on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq  an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right . "
Gentle reader , does it not strike you as strange that US citizens , most of whom have held presidential appointments in the Bush administration , are so concerned to plan how Israel can draw upon US blood and treasure to achieve Israels objectives in the Middle East ?
We certainly have to hand it to Israel and its American neoconsevative agents .
They have succeeded on entirely false pretenses in launching two wars in the Middle East and now they have prepared the ground for a general conflagration .
Who is to stop them ?
The Condi Rice State Department ?
Be serious .
The Democratic Party ?
What a laugh !
The power mad Republicans who have sold their souls ?
The Christian Evangelicals who believe the destruction of huge numbers of people in the Middle East is the lead up to " the Rapture " in which they will be wafted up to Heaven ?
The UN Security Council , where the US never fails to veto any resolution or sanction against Israel ?
The US and Israel havent the troops needed to defeat and occupy Syria , Hizbollah and Iran with conventional forces .
Pentagon documents have described two ways in which the Middle East can be secured for Israel .
One is the use of nuclear weapons .
The other is the destruction of all infrastructure  power plants , water and sewage systems , hospitals , schools , roads , bridges , ports , and a reduction of much housing to rubble by powerful conventional bombs .
In other words , an air war that never ends .
Most Americans are incapable of identifying their own US Representative and Senators .
Everything they " know " about the Middle East comes from Israeli propaganda : Israel is the innocent victim , and all Arabs are terrorists with suicide bombs .
America is being led by a handful of traitors into participating in " regime change " that might succeed or might dethrone our bought and paid for puppets in Egypt , Pakistan , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
If Pakistan were to fall to Islamist forces , Muslims would have a nuclear capability as a counterpart to Israels and Americas .
Muslims have many reasons to hate us for generations of oppression and interference in their internal affairs .
As Iraq has proven , it is not easy to break their spirit .
Out - gunned and out - manned , they still resist , motivated by anger and pride .
Many Americans may think that " ragheads " mean nothing to them .
But when $ 200 oil means Americans cannot commute to their jobs in their gas - guzzlers from their far - flung suburbs , or Russia and China intervene because American - Israeli interests conflict with their own , the world becomes a different place for inattentive , uninvolved , complicit Americans .
Klingeltonanbieter arbeiten nicht mit Samthandschuhen , gerade im Umgang mit ihren minderjährigen Kunden .
Das ist bekannt .
Aber dass bereits gekündigte Abos ohne Einverständnis reaktiviert , nicht geschuldete Beträge abgebucht und sogar neu vergebene Rufnummern für Verträge der vorherigen Inhaber belastet werden , geht deutlich über die bisher bekannten Methoden hinaus .
Mir liegen Unterlagen vor , die von einem mittelgroßen Klingeltonanbieter stammen sollen .
Dieses Unternehmen soll es geschafft haben , in einem knappen Jahr seinen Monatsumsatz zu verdoppeln .
Das ist insofern bemerkenswert , als der Gesamtmarkt geschrumpft ist .
Selbst der Marktführer hat seinen Umsatz nicht mehr nennenswert steigern können .
Der betreffende Anbieter hat auf die schwierige Marktlage möglicherweise kreativ reagiert .
So ergibt sich aus den Dokumenten , dass eine bisher nicht bekannte Zahl von Abos „ reaktiviert “ wurde .
In einem der internen Schreiben wird zum Beispiel bei der Geschäftsführung nachgefragt , wieso zwischen dem 12 .
und 14 .
Oktober 2005 eine Vielzahl von Abos für bestimmte Rufnummern „ reaktiviert “ und mit Kosten belastet worden sind .
Alle Abos waren schon seit sechs bis acht Monaten (! ) gekündigt .
Seitdem wurden den Kunden auch keine Gebühren mehr belastet .
Die Kunden haben sich jedenfalls nicht neu angemeldet .
In der Mitteilung ist ausdrücklich vermerkt : „ Grund für die Reaktivierung : nicht bekannt “ .
Der Sachbearbeiter kommt zu dem Ergebnis : „ eindeutig fehlerhafte Billings “ .
„ Reaktivierungen “ betrafen wohl auch etliche Prepaid - Nummern , die inzwischen neu vergeben worden sind .
Den neuen Inhabern der Rufnummern wurden Kosten für Abos abgebucht , die die früheren Inhaber der Rufnummern abgeschlossen haben .
Hierfür gibt es natürlich keine Rechtsgrundlage ; auch die Billing - Verträge mit den Mobilfunkanbietern schließen an sich so etwas aus .
Für diese problematischen Vorgänge gibt es firmenintern sogar einen Fachbegriff : Erb-Abos .
Die Erb -Abos sollen zu einem Sturm der Entrüstung geführt haben .
So habe sich ein Mobilfunkanbieter beschwert , dass aktuell 80 von 100 Beschwerden in seinem Callcenter auf die betreffende Firma entfallen .
Das Callcenter nehme zwar die Kündigungen an , diese würden aber von dem Klingeltonanbieter nicht beachtet .
Wörtlich heißt es :
20 % der Kunden kündigt via Callcenter das Abo , erhält seitens des CC eine Bestätigung dafür und das Abo besteht trotzdem weiterhin .
… Etliche Kunden haben Erb-Abos .
Das CC kann hier zwar kündigen , die Nichtbeachtung der Blacklist und die Tatsache , dass auch nach etlichen Monaten noch Billingversuche erfolgen , führt jedoch auch in diesen Fällen zu vermehrten Beschwerden .
Außerdem gibt es interne Überblicke über „ die Art der seltsamen Usages “ .
Es folgen lange Listen mit Rufnummern und folgenden Amerkungen :
– ungerechtfertigtes Extrabilling ( hatte keine Schulden bei uns ) ;
– Extrabillings nach Verlängerung des Abos ;
– Kunde hatte nie ein Abo ( immer ABO_FAIL ) , dennoch Abo reaktiviert , Nachbillingversuche ;
– ungerechtfertigtes Extrabilling , außerdem Vorverlegung des Verlängerungszeitpunktes .
Ich habe testweise mal eine der angegebenen Nummern angerufen .
Die Dame am anderen Ende bestätigte mir , dass sie Ärger mit einem Abo bei der Firma hatte , das nie zustandegekommen ist .
Das sieht ja nach feinen Geschäftsmethoden aus .
Für Klingeltonkunden jedenfalls ein ( weiterer ) Anlass , Abbuchungen kritisch zu hinterfragen .

Families strolling through a London park were left shocked when a pelican picked up and swallowed an unsuspecting pigeon .
The Eastern White pelican struggled with the desperately frantic pigeon in its beak for more than 20 minutes before swallowing it whole .
The moment was caught on camera by photographer Cathal McNaughton , who was taking pictures of the wildlife in St James 's Park .
The pigeon was still alive when it reached the pelican 's stomach , he said .

In Repose has a wonderful new article called “ Trickle Theory “ .
He talks about having a mountain of bugs right before a ship date ( I think we work for the same start - up ) and how to tackle the impossible task .
I ’ve covered that a lot of what he talks about in Getting to Deadline , but I wanted to mention a couple of points his article raises about bugs .
Having a mountain of bugs is a Bad Thing .
It happens and will continue to happen until a company is bit on the ass hard enough , but if you have 537 bugs in the database I can guarantee that 489 of them are not reproducible .
I will lay cold hard cash down on the line to anyone who wants to make a bet that the combination of code to be tested , test environment and testcase will still reproduce the bug , or that the bug report has enough information to flick on a light bulb in someone ’s head .
When it comes to triaging bugs “ not being reproducible ” is not that same as “ is not a bug . ”
I ’ve been fortunate enough to work for a manager who took verification seriously and would not let the designers sit on a bug for more than two weeks .
I do n’t care how busy designers are Doing the Fun Stuff ( implementing new features ) .
They can take the time to look into the bug , check that it ’s real and update the bug report with more details ( if they ca n’t fix it in a short period of time ) .
The hidden beauty is by taking a look at the bug they ’ve started to let their subconcious knaw on it .
The biggest reason not to let a bug sit for long is because every bug can be just the tip of the iceberg .
Who knows what is hiding because the verification engineer ca n’t go any deeper into the features ?
Would you rather be Leonardo DiCaprio getting hot and sweaty in a car with a slightly - overweight but - I - can ’t - say that - outloud oh - no - it ’s - too - late Kate Winslet on the Titanic [ 1 ] ?
Or would you rather be the King of the World for real and see the iceberg before it sinks your ship [ 2 ] ?
Bugs can also hilight design errors that may mean major restructuring and redesign .
The sooner a bug is found and fixed , the less costly it is to the company .
One of the best time saving utilities I ’ve written at work was a script for shoving all of the information to reproduce the bug into a bug report .
It required that the verification engineer check in a branch copy of all code before submitting a bug report , but then they could run this script it would throw together all the information to reproduce it and attach it as a file to the bug report .
When it came time to for a designer to tackle the bug they could run another script with the bug number and check out a sandbox of the entire environment of code , testcases and random seeds to reproduce it .
Triaging the bugs changes from eyeballing bug reports to re-running old bugs and seeing how they behave on the new code base .
Because you can .
>> Rands In Repose : Trickle Theory [ 6 ]
>>
All we are saying , is give bugs a chance .
[ 1 ]
No one wants to be hot and sweaty in a car with Kate Winslet unless they are being paid $ 2.5 million [ 3 ] or they are Melanie Lynskey .
Especially if they have to listen to Celine Dion . [ 2 ]
In this allegory [ 4 ] “ your ship ” could be your product , your start up , your ability to go out for drinks on friday afternoon or another name for Mr. Happy . [ 3 ]
Yeah , DiCaprio only got 2.5 . [ 4 ]
Or is it a simile [ 5 ] ?

Sleep is of the brain , by the brain and for the brain
Andean glaciers are melting so fast that some are expected to disappear within 15 - 25 years , denying major cities water supplies and putting populations and food supplies at risk in Colombia , Peru , Chile , Venezuela , Ecuador , Argentina and Bolivia .
The Chacaltaya glacier in Bolivia , the source of fresh water for the cities of La Paz and El Alto , is expected to completely melt within 15 years if present trends continue .
Mount Huascarán , Peru 's most famous mountain , has lost 1,280 hectares ( 3,163 acres ) of ice , around 40 % of the area it covered only 30 years ago .
The O'Higgins glacier in Chile has shrunk by nine miles in 100 years and Argentina 's Upsala glacier is losing 14 metres ( 46 ft ) a year .
Although a few glaciers in southern Patagonia are increasing in size , almost all near the tropics are in rapid retreat .
Some glaciers in Colombia are now less than 20 % of the mass recorded in 1850 and Ecuador could lose half its most important glaciers within 20 years .
The rate of glacier retreat has shocked scientists , says a report on the effects of global warming in Latin America by 20 UK - based environment and development groups who have drawn on national scientific assessments .
Their study says climate change is accelerating the deglaciation phenomenon .
" The speeding up of the ... process is a catastrophic danger , " says Carmen Felipe , president of Peru 's water management institute .
In the short term , the president says , it could cause overflows of reservoirs and trigger mudslides , and in the longer term cut water supplies .
According to the Colombian institute of hydrology , back in 1983 the five major glaciers in El Cocuy national park were expected to last at least 300 years , but measurements taken last year suggest that they may all disappear within 25 years .
Meanwhile , the ice sheet on the Ecuadorean volcano Cotopaxi and its glacier has shrunk by 30 % since 1976 .
" The [ drastic melt ] forces people to farm at higher altitudes to grow their crops , adding to deforestation , which in turn undermines water sources and leads to soil erosion and putting the survival of Andean cultures at risk , " says the report by the Working Group on Climate Change and Development , which includes the International Institute for Environment and Development , Christian Aid , Cafod , WWF , Greenpeace and Progressio .
Their report , Up in Smoke , says snow and rainfall patterns in South America and the Caribbean are becoming less predictable and more extreme .
" East of the Andes , rainfall has been increasing since about 1970 , accompanied by more destructive , sudden deluges .
Meanwhile , the last two hurricane seasons in the Caribbean rim have caused $ 12bn ( £ 6.3 bn ) damage to countries other than the US .
Tropical storms are expected to become more destructive as climate change intensifies .
Climate change models predict more rainfall in eastern South America and less in central and southern Chile with a likelihood of greater and opposite extremes .
The 2005 drought in the Amazon basin was probably the worst since records began . "
Rises in sea level are expected to be especially severe in the region over the next 50 years , with 60 of Latin America 's 77 largest cities located on the coast .
The first hurricanes have recently hit south of the equator line in Brazil .
" The net effect ... is to reduce the capacity of natural ecosystems to act as buffers against extreme weather . "
" What we are seeing are many more negative and cumulative impacts .
The larger the rate of [ climate ] change , the more the adverse effects predominate .
Climate change is set to turn an already rough ride into an impossible one , " says the report , which adds that the impact of climate change is " hugely " magnified by existing environmental abuse .
It proposes that Latin American governments do not repeat the mistakes made by past and present North American and European governments .
Several countries in the region are proposing a new generation of mega dams which would displace thousands more people and destroy vast areas of the Brazilian Amazon .
The new importance of soya , both as a food and biofuel crop , could also devastate the environment , leading to a battle for land between companies .
Large - scale coal , oil , and copper mining not only threaten fragile environments , says the report , but in some cases can physically endanger remaining glaciers and greatly increase climate changing emissions .
" The Pascua Lama project on the borders of Chile and Argentina intends to move three glaciers that cover gold , silver and copper deposits .
The glaciers sustain the mountain and valley ecosystems and there are fears that toxic wastes used in the mining will contaminate land and water , " says the report .
Yesterday , the groups called on rich countries to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and proposed that Latin America and the Caribbean governments be helped to reduce their vulnerability to extreme weather .
" The only option we have , apart from demanding that developed countries take responsibility for the damages that climate change is causing , is to try to neutralise the adverse impacts that are [ already ] upon us .
It is time to rethink the model of international aid , " said Juan Maldonado , former Colombian environment minister and president of the UN convention on biological diversity .
Backstory
" With each new flood , drought or hurricane in Latin America , precious gains in poverty reduction are lost .
Extreme weather is set to cause massive loss of life in developing countries throughout the region .
The international community must invest more in helping poor communities cope with the effect of climate change , " said Paul Cook , head of policy for Tearfund .
The world 's many thousands of glaciers have been stable or in slow retreat for more than 100 years but since around 1980 they have mostly been retreating drastically .
The fastest decline is in the Himalayas , the Arctic , the Alps , the Rockies and the tropics .
Most glaciologists believe this natural phenomenon is being accelerated by global warming .
The effects of glacier melt are expected to be severe .
Hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Latin America are dependent on glacier water .
A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows to keep dams and reservoirs replenished .
In Norway , the Alps , and the Pacific north - west , glacier runoff is important for hydropower .
If all the ice on the polar icecaps were to melt , the oceans would rise an estimated 70 metres ( 230 ft ) .
But even a small melt will affect coastal life .

Upstartle LLC ist Anbieter des Web - basierenden Textverarbeitungsservice Writely.com , der seit rund einem halben Jahr im Web zu Betatest - Bedingungen verfügbar ist .
Marktbeobachter werten die Übernahme als Beleg für die sei langem kursierende
These , dass Google Microsoft über Office - Dienste im Web angreifen will .
Zunächst war angenommen worden , dass der Online - Riese zu diesem Zweck auf Open Office zurückgreifen würde .
Eine Partnerschaft mit Sun Microsystems vom vergangenen Herbst hatte diese Spekulationen verstärkt ( siehe : Sun und Google - eine Bedrohung für Microsoft ? ) .
Spätestens mit dem Kauf der Writely - Site hat sich nun der Kurs geändert .
Google hatte auch in seinem kürzlich angekündigten " Google Pack " , einem Download - Angebot inklusive Anwendungen wie Ad-aware , Real Player und Firefox , das Open - Office - Paket ausgespart .
Writely.com wurde als " The Web Word Processor " bezeichnet , der Anwendern ermöglicht , Dokumente in einem HTML - Interface zu erstellen und zu editieren .
Unter anderem werden Word- , RTF - und PDF - Dokumente sowie das Open- Document - Format unterstützt .
Die Dateien lassen sich auf dem eigenen Rechner oder im Web speichern .
Einige Funktionen machen den Dienst besonders interessant - zum Beispiel die Möglichkeit , dass mehrere Personen gleichzeitig an Dokumenten arbeiten können , ohne dass es zu Kollisionen und Datenverlusten kommt .
Außerdem können
Texte besonders bequem verteilt oder im Blog veröffentlicht werden .
Writely nutzt das Ajax - Programmiermodell ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ) , das von den meisten aktuellen Browsern unterstützt wird .
Der Informationsdienst " Computerwire " bezeichnet Upstartle als " archetypisches Web - 2.0 - Startup " , das ein perfekter Kandidat für eine Übernahme durch ein finanzstarkes und gesundes Unternehmen wie Google gewesen sei .
Die Bekanntmachung erfolgte sparsamer Manier :
In zwei Blog - Einträgen bei Writely wurden einige wenige Informationen herausgelassen , die nicht besonders hilfreich sind .
Dort heißt es etwa , Writely sei wie ein Bulldozer , der sich bei Google zu einem wunderschönen Schmetterling entwickeln werde .
Außerdem freue man sich bei Writely auf " free Googleplex lunches " .
Diskutiert werden dürfte nun , ob Web - basierende Office - Dienste tatsächlich am Microsoft - Monopol nagen können .
Writely - Mitgründer Sam Schillace hatte in einem Blog - Interview im Oktober 2005 gesagt , der Dienst verstehe sich als komplementäres Angebot zu Word .
" Web - Textverarbeitung wird sich zu einer separaten Kategorie entwickeln . "
Microsoft verfügt bislang noch nicht über ein vergleichbares Angebot , könnte aber unter dem Label der " Live " - Produkte mit etwas Ähnlichem herauskommen .
Bislang ist Office Live aber nur ein Web - Hosting - und E - Mail - Service , von Office - Anwendungen ist noch nichts zu sehen .
Doch auch Google ist von einer kompletten Web - fähigen Office - Suite noch weit entfernt .
Produkte , die mit Microsofts Excel , Powerpoint oder Access mithalten können , sind noch nicht zu sehen .
Deshalb dürften nun Websites wie Jotspot , NumSum oder iRows besonders beobachtet werden .
Se stellen jeweils kleine Ajax - Anwendungen bereit , mit denen sich Gruppenarbeit online organisieren beziehungsweise Spreadsheets via Browser anfertigen lassen .
Writely wird derzeit von einigen Tausend Betatestern geprüft .
Mit der Übernahme hat Google die Zulassung weiterer Betatester unterbrochen , bis das Software - Backend auf die Google - Systeme übertragen ist .
Das Unternehmen hatte vor der Übernahme angekündigt , für bestimmte " Premium - Services " wie das Erstellen von pdf-Dokumenten Gebühren zu nehmen .
Ob es dabei bleibt , ist allerdings fraglich geworden . ( hv )
It is n't hard to spot what 's behind this erosion of the journalist 's image .
When Watergate broke , tabloid television was n't a force and 24 - hour cable news ( all shouting all the time ! ) had n't been invented .
As the news media expanded , standards became as varied as the outlets , and the public 's respect for the media steadily declined .
The damage has been done by everything from gossipy Internet sites where anything passes for news to the Jayson Blair fiasco at The New York Times and CBS 's apology for its Dan Rather report on President Bush 's National Guard service .
A Gallup poll released last month showed that public confidence in journalism had reached a new low , with television news and newspapers receiving the same dismal number .
Only 28 percent of those polled said they had a great deal of confidence in those media .
The more that confidence plummets , the more likely movies are to portray reporters unfavorably ; and , in a snowball effect , the more unsavory reporters appear on screen , the more that image takes hold .
Today it is pervasive .
In the Russell Crowe boxing movie " Cinderella Man , " reporters at a news conference make the hero 's wife ( Renée Zellweger ) cry by suggesting her husband may be killed in the ring .
The episode is revealing because it 's such a throwaway scene in a big commercial movie , playing off the easy assumption that reporters are the bad guys .
" Crónicas " is a prime example of how current films gesture at that shared image .
( Now in New York and Los Angeles , the film opens in other cities Friday and through the next month . )
When the cameraman nudges the grieving parents -- the first thing we see a journalist do in the film -- it 's a shorthand way of situating us in the world of tabloid television .
The moral question the film goes on to raise is whether the reporter and his crew can rise above their tawdry impulses .
The film is no treatise on journalism , though .
It 's a sleek cat - and - mouse game that begins by placing viewers one step ahead of the journalists .
The film opens with a man suspiciously bathing and washing his clothes in a river , the same man who soon after accidentally hits a boy with his truck and is attacked by the crowd that witnessed it .
The film plants the idea that he may be the serial child killer even before the journalists begin to suspect .
Like a lot of people , I have been waiting to get my hands on Flock as I ’ve been following the hype and buzz about the latest browser .
Flock , which bills itself as a social browser , is built on top of the Mozilla / Firefox code base .
People that had seen it were raving about it and so I was excited to get an email yesterday that I could go ahead and download it before it became generally available today .
So I rush and download the browser to see what the big deal is all about .
I have to tell you – it was disappointing .
I guess I ’m missing the magic that everyone is seeing here but I thought this was basically Firefox with some extensions .
There is built in support for Flickr , del.icio.us and Technorati and a couple of bells and whistles that are supposed to amaze .
I have Firefox extensions for most of those things .
The first issue I have is the ‘ Import Wizard ’ during installation .
Since it ’s built on Mozilla , it will let you import your browser data ( bookmarks , cookies , passwords , etc ) from IE , Opera and Netscape but not Firefox , which happens to be my default browser .
I think this is a major issue .
Once installed and running , Flock looks like Firefox with a nice theme that has rounded corners .
There is built - in support for blogging and while this is interesting , I do n’t think this is any groundbreaking .
There is built - in support for WordPress , TypePad and Blogger but you better not have 2 different blogs with the same name .
The Flickr topbar in the blog tool is nice but it only shows you your public photos and wo n’t let you blog your private pictures .
The Technorati tagging feature is also nice but I have a couple of WordPress plugins that allow me to do just that and so it ’s not groundbreaking .
Shelf is another nice feature that I already have in Firefox with extensions .
Shelf is essentially a scratchpad where you can drag links , images , text , etc and then use it in other places like blogs , etc .
The cool thing was that you could highlight some text and drag it over to the shelf to save it .
As Flock is built on top of Mozilla , most of the Firefox extensions should work with a minor tweak to the install.rdf file .
There are a few extensions available for Flock and I was glad to see Adblock was one of them .
The auto - subscribe to feeds feature is interesting but you ca n’t import your OPML files into a collection and so you ’d have to surf to all the blogs you read and add them manually .
I think I ’ll stick with FeedDemon .
All in all , Flock is a decent browser that has potential .
Firefox + extensions equals almost all of the functionality of Flock but the integration of all those features into one browser is nice , specially since they all play together .
I guess I bought into all the hype and reality was a little disappointing .
I know Flock is still at v0.5 and so I will stay tuned for what ’s next from the people at Flock .

It 's not news that the main reason the movie and television industries are wary of BitTorrent is that they 're freaked out by the music industry 's experience with piracy .
Although they see the economic advantages of P2P distribution , they 're concerned that once they put their stuff out there , even wrapped in triple layers of kryptonite DRM , it might be cracked and then circulate in unprotected form .
For movies , that 's lost revenues .
For TV shows , that means ads could be stripped out , expiration routines could be removed and ( gasp ! ) content could be modified or remixed .
All that counts as Very Scary Stuff to industry executives , and as a result they 're looking for " strong " DRM before they consider letting their premier content circulate online .
This is a mistake , for two reasons :
The first is about the user experience :
Any protection technology that is really difficult to crack is probably too cumbersome to be accepted by consumers .
We 've seen all sorts of failures of this sort before , from dongles to laborious and confusing registration schemes .
Each seems better at annoying consumers than at building markets .
The lesson from these examples is that zero - percent piracy is not only unattainable , it 's economically suboptimal .
If your content is uncrackable , it means you 've probably locked the market down so tight that even honest consumers are being inconvenienced .
Instead , efficient software and entertainment markets should exhibit just enough piracy to suggest that the industry has got the balance of control about right : not too loose and not too tight .
That number is not zero percent ( which requires protection methods so invasive they kill demand ) , and it's not 100 % ( which kills the business ) .
It 's somewhere in - between .
The second reason the quest for zero- piracy is a mistake is an economic one : piracy can actually let you raise your prices .
I 'll give you a surprising example .
I was chatting with a former Microsoft manager the other day and he revealed that after much analysis Microsoft had realized that some piracy is not only inevitable , but could actually be economically optimal .
The reason is counterintuitive , but intriguing .
The usual price - setting method is to look at the entire potential market , from the many at the economic lower end to the few at the top , and set a price somewhere in between the top and bottom that will maximize total revenues .
But if you cede the bottom to piracy , you can set a price between the top and the middle .
The result : higher revenues per copy , and potentially higher revenues overall .
( This is , by the way , the opposite of the conventional economic approach to developing - world piracy , which is to lower the cost of a product closer to the pirate version , closing the pricing gap to try to win customers over to the official version .
In practice , however , the pirate price is so low that it 's rarely possible to close that gap enough to make much of a difference . )
Add to this the familiar ( if controversial ) argument that piracy helps seed technology markets , and can be a net benefit .
Especially in fast - developing countries such as China and India , the ubiquity of pirated Windows and Office have made them de-facto national standards .
Few users could have paid for the retail versions at the start , but now that the spread of cheap technology , including free software , has led to an economic boom , Microsoft is finding a nice market for commercial software at the very top , in big companies and government offices .
When all these effects are considered , it appears that there actually is an optimal level of piracy .
That right level would vary from industry to industry .
Today the estimated piracy rates are 33 % for CDs and 15 % for DVDs .
The industries say that 's too high , but most anti-copying technologies they 've brought in to lower that figure have proven unpopular .
Would even tighter lock - downs help ?
Probably not .
Maybe 15%-30 % is simply the market saying that this is the optimal rate of piracy for those industries , and any effort to lower that significantly would either choke demand or push even more people to the dark side .
So the moral for video content holders and others considering DRM : be careful what you ask for , because you just might get it .
" Uncrackable " DRM could make the P2P problem worse , by driving more users underground and depressing prices .
Do n't imagine that if you release content in a relatively weak DRM wrapper ( like today 's DVDs ) and copies get out that the whole market will collapse .
Instead , you may find that piracy stays constant at relatively low levels , leaving the rest of the market happier and more profitable .
The lesson is to find a good - enough approach to content protection that is easy , convenient and non-annoying to most people , and then accept that there will be some leakage .
Most consumers see the value in paying for something of guaranteed quality and legality , as long as you do n't treat them like potential criminals .
And the minority of others , who are willing to take the risks and go to the trouble of finding the pirated versions ?
Well , they probably were n't your best market anyway .
The Department of Homeland Security allowed a man to enter its headquarters last week using a fake Matricula Consular card as identification , despite federal rules that say the Mexican - issued card is not valid ID at government buildings .
Bruce DeCell , a retired New York City police officer , used his phony card — which lists his place of birth as “ Tijuana , B.C. ” and his address as “ 123 Fraud Blvd . ” on an incorrectly spelled “ Staton Island , N.Y. ” — to enter the building Wednesday for a meeting with DHS officials .
Mr. DeCell said he has had the card for four years and has used it again and again to board airliners and enter government buildings , without being turned down once .
But he said he was surprised that DHS , the agency in charge of determining secure IDs , accepted it .
“ Obviously , it ’s not working , ” Mr. DeCell said .
The Mexican government has issued millions of Matricula Consular cards in the past few years , mostly to give illegal aliens a form of identification that banks and other institutions will accept .
The FBI , in testimony to Congress , has said that the cards are not secure .
The General Services Administration ruled in 2003 that the Matricula Consular is not valid ID for entering a federal building .
In addition to being a forgery obtained for him from a street vendor in California , Mr. DeCell ’s card was modeled on an older version , which the Mexican government publicly acknowledges is not a secure document .
The Mexican government says the old - style cards “ are no longer valid . ”
Some members of Congress tried to crack down on use of the card , particularly as valid ID for opening a bank account , but the Bush administration opposed that effort .
Jarrod Agen , a spokesman for DHS , said the department should n’t have allowed the ID to be used for entry to its headquarters .
“ DHS is following up on these allegations and will take necessary actions to ensure there is not another occurrence of this type , ” he said .
Mr. DeCell had provided his name , birth date and Social Security number to be pre-cleared for entry to the building and had been vetted before , Mr. Agen said .
The security guard accepted the ID to match Mr. DeCell ’s name to a name on her list of cleared visitors , he said .
The spokesman said Mr. DeCell ’s group went through metal detectors and other routine security screening and had an escort at all times while in the building .
“ At no time was there a threat to any person or property , ” Mr. Agen said .
DHS ’ security performance did n’t surprise one member of Congress .
“ You mean the Department of Homeland Insecurity , ” said Rep. Elton Gallegly , California Republican and one of the first to introduce a bill in Congress several years ago cracking down on acceptance of the Matricula Consular card .
“ The real sad story here is that it does n’t surprise me — in fact it just vindicates all the things I ’ve been saying here , along with so many others . ”
The Mexican government argues that the cards improve security by giving illegal aliens some form of identification , which assists police and businesses .
Mexico is not the only country to issue such cards , and has in fact issued a form of the Matricula Consular card for decades .
But Mr. Gallegly said the Mexicans used to issue few , and only for special circumstances , while in recent years they have issued millions .
Mr. DeCell is a member of 9/11 Families for a Secure America , an organization of families with relatives who died in the September 11 terrorist attacks .
He and two other members paid the visit Wednesday to DHS officials .
Mr. DeCell said he keeps the fake ID card in his wallet and often shows it just to see what places will accept it .
He keeps his driver ’s license handy in case the forgery is challenged , he said , but it never has been .
“ I ’m dismayed , ” Mr. DeCell said .
Joan Molinaro , who accompanied him , said she was shocked that DHS , of all agencies , accepted the phony ID .
“ Homeland Security is not doing their job , ” she said .
“ Homeland Security accepted a fraudulent document as a legitimate one . ”

An endorsement by astronomers meeting in Prague would require school and university textbooks to be rewritten .
The proposal recognises eight classical planets , three planets belonging to a new category called " plutons " and the largest asteroid Ceres .
Pluto remains a planet , but becomes the basis for the new pluton category .
The plan has been drawn up by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) with the aim of settling the question of what does and does not count as a planet .
Some 2,500 astronomers gathered at the IAU General Assembly in Prague will vote on the plan next Thursday .
New era
" For the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our Solar System .
This is a fascinating prospect , " said Richard Binzel , a member of the IAU planet definition committee which put together the proposal .
But the solution was not popular with all experts .
Robin Catchpole , from the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge , told the BBC : " The public are very clear about what they understand by ' planets ' .
Those are the big , dominant bodies in the Solar System that we 're all familiar with , the eight - or nine if you include Pluto .
" I think including more is going to add confusion to the public , but not really be particularly useful for astronomers . "
Pluto was discovered in 1930 by US astronomer Clyde Tombaugh
More details
Experts have been divided over whether Pluto - further away and considerably smaller than the eight other planets in our Solar System - deserves the title .
Since the early 1990s , astronomers have found several other objects of comparable size to Pluto in an outer region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt .
Some astronomers believe Pluto belongs with this population of small , icy " Trans - Neptunians " , not with the objects we call planets .
For the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our Solar System

That changed with the discovery of 2003 UB313 by Professor Mike Brown and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) .
After being measured with the Hubble Space Telescope , it was shown to be some 3,000 km ( 1,864 miles ) in diameter , making it larger than the ninth planet .
Kicked upstairs ?
The IAU draft resolution recognises eight " classical " planets - Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune - three " plutons " - Pluto , Charon and UB313 - and the asteroid Ceres .
Charon is currently described as a moon of Pluto , but because of its size some experts consider it a twin planet .
2003 UB313 : bigger than Pluto
Dr Andrew Coates of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Dorking said : " Something had to be done about the definition .
It does change the textbooks somewhat , but it also demonstrates that this is a vibrant area of research .
" The surprise is Ceres , because most people thought of it as an asteroid . "
Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , and like a planet is spherical in shape .
" This a step backward , " said Alan Boss , an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC .
" It 's a demotion of the word planet . "
The Carnegie researcher , who believes there are only eight true planets , said the term would lose its prestige under the proposed definition because anything round of a certain size could join the club .
" Folks are n't going to have to worry about learning the planets anymore because it's a list that does n't mean anything , " he said .
Seeking endorsement
The basis for this re-evaluation is a new scientific definition of a planet which uses gravity as the determining factor .
According to this definition , two conditions must be satisfied for an object to qualify as a planet :
The object must be in orbit around a star , but must not itself be a star
It must have enough mass for the body 's own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape
On whether he was confident the resolution would be passed , Professor Gingerich told the BBC News website : " It will be a very awkward situation if they do n't .
NEW PLANET CANDIDATES Trans - Neptunian Objects 2003 EL61 2005 FY9 Sedna Orcus Quaoar Varuna 2002 TX300 Ixion 2002 AW197 Asteroids Vesta Pallas Hygiea
" I 'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution , but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement . "
More objects are likely to be announced as planets in the future .
The IAU has a " watchlist " of at least a dozen other potential candidates that could become planets once more is known about their sizes and orbits .
These include the distant objects Sedna , Orcus , Quaoar and 2003 EL61 and the asteroids Vesta , Pallas and Hygiea .
The IAU spent two years debating the matter among its membership .
A seven - member committee was set up to consider the findings and produce a draft proposal .
The body has been responsible for the naming of planets and moons since 1919 .

HUMANS AND SPARKS
The Cause , Stopping the Pain , and " Electric People "
© 1997 William J. Beaty
Part 3 : CAR DOOR SPARKS
The cause of car - door sparking is well known : contact - electrification between insulating surfaces , followed by separation of those surfaces .
But what does this mean ?
Well , * YOU * are one surface , and THE CAR SEAT is the other .
When you sit on a plastic car seat in dry weather , the contact between your clothes and the seat 's surface causes the electrical charges within atoms of the material to transfer between the surfaces .
This is our old friend " frictional " or " contact " charging .
One surface ends up with more negative charges than positive , and has a negative charge - imbalance .
The other surface has fewer negatives than positives , so it has a positive imbalance .
This is nearly same thing as rubbing a balloon upon your hair : both surfaces become electrically charged .
But rather than rubbing just your hair , instead you 're rubbing your entire back , but , and legs upon the car seat surface .
However , nothing happens as long as you remain seated .
Just keep yourself in one place and you wo n't get zapped ..
As long as the surfaces remain near each other , the positives and negatives cancel out , and no overall " electricity " appears and no sparks are possible .
But when you open the car door and step outside , you take just one polarity of charge along with you , while the car seat has the opposite polarity .
At the same time , the charged - up car seat causes the whole car to become charged ( by a process called " Faraday 's Icepail Effect . " )
As you step out of the car , the voltage between your body and the car becomes huge , up to 10,000 or even 20,000 volts .
Your shoes are probably insulating , so the charge has no opportunity to leak into the earth .
You reach out to close the car door and ZAP ! , the opposite polarities rejoin by leaping through the air while giving you a tiny , deep burn on your fingertip !
How to prevent this ?
One possibility : change the surface materials .
Identify and avoid the specific clothing which makes the problem worse .
These materials are usually wool sweaters and pants , certain manmade fabrics , plastic raincoats , etc .
Or , replace your cheap plastic car seatcovers with cloth ( stains easily ! ) or with leather ( expensive dead animals . )
Another method : mix up some anti-static solution and spray your car seats .
This solution remains slightly damp for weeks , which halts the contact - charging process .
The formula : a teaspoon of fabric softener mixed in one quart of water .
This tends to work well at first , but after days it wears off and needs a re-coating .
Another sillier method : always drive barefooted , so the charge will leak away when you step outside the car .
Not good in winter !
You could cover your car seats with a conductor such as aluminum foil , which screws up the contact - charging effect .
Have a tailor make some custom clothing out of black conductive carbon cloth ?
Or you could eliminate the problem by eliminating your clothes .
Skin is fairly conductive , so it does n't create charge - separation when held against plastic .
Driving while nude might cure the sparking problem ( unless you are a very hairy person ! )
A less frivilous method : the car - keys trick I mentioned earlier .
Develop the habit of holding your car keys as you leave the car , then grip the keys firmly and touch the metal car door with the tip of the key .
The spark will still jump , but it will not be painful , since it blasts a little hole in the tip of the key instead of in your finger .
Or simply grasp the car door as you climb out , and this will drain off the charge - imbalance faster than it can build up on your body .
DANGER : GASOLINE FIRES .
What happens when you climb out of your car at the gas station ?
Usually you 'll zap yourself on the car door , or on the gas pump handle , or on the metal door that covers your gas cap , and usually nothing bad happens .
However , suppose your passengers climb out of the car just as you 're unscrewing the cap , or just as you jam the gas pump nozzle into your tank ?
The whole car becomes momentarily charged .
ZAP !
Or , suppose you turn on the gas pump and then climb back into your car .
When you climb out again , you body is highly charged from the car seat .
The very first thing you do is to reach into the cloud of gasoline vapors to grab the metal handle of the gas pump .
ZAP !
FOOSH !
This obviously is a very rare event .
However , it does occur sometimes , especially in the winter .

“ NEW YORK rain ” is the local term for water that drips , annoyingly , from air - conditioners onto passers - by .
In Hong Kong unwary pedestrians face more dangerous precipitation .
On July 22nd a 78 - year - old woman was rushed to hospital after a pair of scissors , hurled from a multi-storey building , lodged in her skull .
The same day , a 28 - year - old man in another part of the city suffered cuts after another pair of scissors hit him on the head , while a boy survived a brush with an iron bar lobbed from yet another high - rise window .
Despite all the modern sanitation at their disposal , many Hong Kong citizens still seem to prefer chucking rubbish out of the nearest window .
As any housing estate resident will confirm , as well as a regular rain of beer cans and cigarette butts , other objects — used packets of Viagra , dirty cat litter , glass bottles , mattresses and even refrigerators — also fly past the window .
Much of this is plain bad manners .
But some also blame rising inequality for the downpour , which appears to be getting worse .
Much of the object - throwing takes place in the city 's public housing estates , where many of Hong Kong 's poorer people live cramped together in tiny apartments .
Many of their shoddily constructed buildings are crumbling : among the most common objects falling out of windows last summer were the windows themselves .
As a result , the government had to spend HK $ 68 m ( $ 9 m ) on emergency maintenance of its housing .
Though the economy 's recovery since the panic over the respiratory disease SARS in 2003 has lifted living standards , the fortunes of workers have lagged behind those of the middle classes .
If people cannot heave their political masters out of office , they can at least heave a broken television out of the window .
Given the mainland 's far greater economic and social disparities , the authorities in Beijing must be hoping that this is one trend that does not spread north .

Mark Summerton will sign the Sex Offenders ' Register
Mark Summerton and Kevin Judge , from Sefton Council , Merseyside , trained a street camera into the woman 's flat .
At Liverpool Crown Court , Summerton , 37 , of Kirkdale , Liverpool , admitted voyeurism and attempted voyeurism .
He was sentenced to four months in prison .
Judge , 42 , from Waterloo , admitted misconduct in public office and was jailed for two months .
He was cleared of voyeurism last month .
Summerton was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders ' Register .
You only have to read the impact statements of the lady to realise the harrowing effect this had on her
Judge Gerald Clifton
Team leader Vincent Broderick , 52 , of Bootle , Merseyside , admitted misconduct in public office on the grounds that he did not see the woman when she was naked , but knew the cameras were being misused and failed to report it .
He was sentenced to 200 hours ' community service .
The images from the camera , including the woman without her clothes on , were shown on a large plasma screen in the council 's CCTV control room in November 2004 , Liverpool Crown Court heard .
Over several hours , she was filmed cuddling her boyfriend before undressing , using the toilet , having a bath and watching television dressed only in a towel .
Judge Gerald Clifton told the three men : " To dismiss what was happening as laddish behaviour , something that the 21st Century apparently condones , is absurd .
Kevin Judge was cleared of voyeurism at a trial
" You only have to read the impact statements of the lady to realise the harrowing effect that this had on her .
" Her life has almost been ruined , her self - confidence entirely destroyed by the thought that prying male eyes have entered her flat . "
During his voyeurism trial , Judge claimed he had only seen the woman naked for a brief moment and had told Summerton , who was controlling the camera , that he was " out of order " .
The jury was satisfied but Judge Clifton said he did not believe this account .
He said : " I am amply satisfied that your involvement was larger than you are prepared to admit , that you were at some stage controlling the camera , and that you were watching and enjoying the events going on . "
A Sefton Council spokesman said safeguards already in place meant the culprits were " caught and dismissed by us promptly " .
" We will not tolerate an abuse of position from any of our staff or accept such a failure to meet the high standards of behaviour and professionalism we expect . "
Unless you have been living under a rock for the last six months , you will have noticed that the virtual world Second Life is much in the news .
According to its home page , there are currently around 1,700,000 residents , who are spending $ 600,000 – that 's real , not virtual , money – in the world each day .
These figures are a little deceptive – there are typically only 10,000 to 15,000 residents online at any one time , and the money flow is not a rigorous measurement of economic activity – but there is no doubt that Second Life is growing very rapidly ; moreover , we are beginning to see it enter the mainstream in a way that has close parallels with the arrival of the Web ten years ago .
Companies are beginning to set up shop in Second Life , including big names like Adidas , American Apparel , Dell , Nissan , Penguin Books , Reebok , Sun Microsystems , Toyota , Reuters and Wired .
Often they choose to create their virtual buildings on self - contained islands , which are essentially three - dimensional analogues of the early corporate Web sites : that is , vaguely pretty to look at , but not very functional .
One of the pioneers in Second Life is IBM , which also played an important part in helping to make the Web ( and open source ) respectable for businesses .
Here 's what Irving Wladawsky - Berger , vice president of technology strategy and innovation at IBM , and the man who oversaw the company 's GNU / Linux policy in the early days , says about IBM 's interest in Second Life :
I think that what we are seeing is the evolution of the Internet and World Wide Web in incredibly important new directions .
Foremost among them is a much more people - centric Web .
We see this people - centric evolution of the Web in social networks and Web 2.0 - capabilities that enable people to find each other , form communities , share information , and collaborate on a variety of endeavors .
Now we are bringing to this new people - centric spirit the highly visual , interactive applications in Virtual Worlds .
This new breed of applications is being rethought around the people who design them , maintain them and use them , instead of asking those people to come down to the level of the computers .
We can now bring these exciting capabilities , already in wide use in science , engineering , defense and consumer applications , into the worlds of business , education , health care and government .
This was the step that led to IBM ’s e-business strategy ten years ago .
Could we be at the onset of v-business ?
Based on my initial experiences in Second Life , we are all in for an incredible ride .
His boss , Sam Palmisano has backed up those words with actions .
A couple of weeks ago , he entered Second Life himself to give a major speech about IBM 's future path , and announced a $ 100 million fund to create 10 new businesses within the company , including :
3D Internet : Partnering with others to take the best of virtual worlds and gaming environments to build a seamless , standards - based 3D Internet -- the next platform for global commerce and day - to - day business operations .
So , things look bright for Second Life and the other virtual worlds that are being developed .
There 's just one problem : they are all closed source .
This means that free software is falling behind in one of the most innovative areas in computing today .
Linden Lab , the company behind Second Life , is very open - source friendly .
Its computing infrastructure is based on thousands of servers running GNU / Linux , Apache , Squid and MySQL .
Alongside the usual Windows and Macintosh clients for Second Life , there is already one for GNU / Linux ( if still a little rough at the edges ) .
And Linden Lab hopes to go even further by opening sourcing Second Life 's software .
Here 's what Philip Rosedale , Second Life 's creator and CEO of Linden Lab , told me during an extensive interview recently , when I asked about his current thinking on opening up the code :
Without speaking to specific timing or plans - and we 've thought and are thinking lots and lots where there might be exceptions to this - but it seems like the best way to allow SL to become reliable and scalable and grow .
And we 've got a lot of smart people here thinking about that .
Further proof of Linden Lab 's goodwill towards the free software world can be found in its tacit approval of an open source project to reverse - engineer the Second Life protocols .
Called libsecondlife , it has already done valuable work , although this has been overshadowed somewhat by the recent brouhaha over the CopyBot program , which drew on libsecondlife 's code .
CopyBot allowed some or even all of an object in Second Life to be copied .
This is obviously a problem for a virtual economy that depends on selling digital objects .
And yet , despite many cries to the contrary , the sky is not falling , as I 've explained elsewhere .
More than the blip of CopyBot , there are deep problems that need to be addressed in the context of creating an open source version of Second Life , notably as far as security is concerned .
Most of them have to do with how open source clients would interact with Linden Lab 's servers , and how it might be possible to allow users to run their own Second Life servers – effectively creating separate virtual worlds based on the same protocols .
As well as libsecondlife , there are a couple of other open source virtual world projects of note .
For example , Croquet employs an ambitious approach that goes beyond Second Life in many ways ; however , it is still at an early stage .
The same can be said about Uni-Verse , a European consortium that includes the foundation behind the popular 3D tool Blender .
These are all useful initiatives , and there will doubtless be others .
But if open source is to give the lie to Jim Allchin 's famous jibe in the first Halloween Document that it is always " chasing tail - lights " , the free software community must become more involved with the existing virtual world projects , and invest much more time and effort in new ones .
Developing expertise with the underlying technologies is particularly important because it is quite possible that the next stage in the Web 's evolution will incorporate elements from three - dimensional virtual worlds .
Philip Rosedale explained why he thinks that is likely :
People always believe that the idea of simulating a three - dimensional world will make the experience of people in it different because it's three dimensional , and that 's certainly true .
However , there 's a second thing about the 3D web that makes it different than the 2D web , and is really important , which is that there are other people there with you when you 're experiencing it .
Look at MySpace .
When you go to a MySpace page , you can listen to their music .
What is the listening experience like ?
Well , it 's still just you sitting in front of your computer listening alone to that music .
But in SL , if you 're listening to somebody 's music , whether live or pre-recorded , there 's a very good chance that there 's someone next to you listening to the same music , and so you 're able to turn to them and say :
What do you think ?
Or you 're able to turn to them and say :
Have you been here before , and , if so , do you know where the lawnmower section is ?
That , I think , is what makes the potential of the 3D Web different perhaps even more so than the spatial difference between 3D content , and 2D content .
And I think that alone makes it very likely that there will be a kind of a 3D Web , that has this shared experience property .
That 's what everyone will look back on and say :
Wow , that is what made it different .

The problems with JetBlue Flight 292 marked at least the seventh time that the front landing gear of an Airbus jet has locked at a 90 - degree angle , forcing pilots to land commercial airliners under emergency conditions , according to federal records .
No one has been injured in the incidents , which span about a decade .
There are more than 2,500 planes from the Airbus 320 family , which includes the Airbus 318 , 319 and 321 models , in operation worldwide .
Aviation safety officials Thursday said the planes have a good safety record .
In the most recent case , JetBlue ’s flight from Burbank to New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport , carrying 140 passengers , was forced Wednesday to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport .
The plight of the aircraft was televised nationwide , beginning with the plane circling over the California coast and ending at an LAX runway with a landing marked by fire streaming from the plane ’s front wheels .
Howard Plagens , a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board , which is investigating Wednesday ’s incident , called problems with landing gear “ common . ”
Advertisement
At a news conference Thursday at the Proud Bird Restaurant outside LAX , he said he believed that passengers had no reason for concern about the safety of the Airbus fleet .
“ How many Airbus A320s are out there ? ” he said , adding that the number of times the wheels have locked is small .
“ Incidents happen every day ” involving landing gear on all types of planes , he said .
The locking of the nose landing gear on Airbus jets is one of several recurring problems with the plane ’s nose landing gear .
Advertisement
A Canadian study issued last year documented 67 incidents of nose - landing - gear failures on Airbus 319 , 320 and 321 aircraft worldwide since 1989 .
Plagens said the A320 was n’t grounded after previous incidents involving the nose landing gear because “ they did do fixes for those things . ”
After the initial investigation , the NTSB will look at maintenance records for other Airbus A320 aircraft , Plagens said .
Investigators will review other instances involving the plane ’s nose wheel , as well as modifications recommended to fix the problem .
“ If we find a pattern , we ’ll certainly do something , ” he said .

NTSB officials expect the investigation into Flight 292 ’s emergency landing to take six to nine months .
They have removed the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder from the plane and sent them to Washington for evaluation .
In the next few days , safety officials will decide whether to send the entire nose - landing - gear assembly to New York , where mechanics will take it apart piece by piece and reassemble it to try to re-create the failure .
The landing gear on the nose of the A320 , also known as the nose wheel , is a big , bulky system controlled by a computer .
The computer gives commands to an electrical system , which in turn operates the hydraulics that move the gear up and down , moving the wheels into proper position for both landing and storage .
The problem that caused the wheel on Flight 292 to lock in the wrong position could have been caused by the electrical system , the hydraulics or some other part of the assembly , Plagens said .

The 3 - year - old aircraft was towed to a Continental Airlines hangar at LAX for evaluation .
It remained there Thursday .
Airbus engineers were flying to Los Angeles on Thursday night to help NTSB investigators determine what caused the incident .
The circumstances of Wednesday ’s incident bear strong similarities to other documented incidents of Airbus 320 and 319 airplanes experiencing front wheels locking in the wrong position .
Two causes for the misaligned front wheels have been found .
A problem with misaligned wheels on a 1999 America West flight into Columbus , Ohio , was caused by a faulty seal on a valve .
That design flaw had been known before the flight because of a previous incident and had been the subject of an advisory to airlines using the Airbus 320 planes .
The fix had not yet been made on the aircraft involved in the emergency landing .
After the flight , federal safety officials issued an order that required the repair .

In November 2002 , another JetBlue flight to New York experienced a problem similar to the one Wednesday .
Three weeks later a United Airlines flight into Chicago had the same problem , landing with sparks spewing from the nose - gear wheels .
Investigators found that the force of the landing had ground one wheel all the way to the axle and the other nearly as far .
In those two cases , as well as two flights in other countries , the problems were traced to improper installation of a hydraulic shock absorber .
Advertisement
That problem also led to advisories to airlines , detailing mistakes that maintenance workers could make in installing the hydraulic shock absorber .
The advisories warned that failure to comply with proper installation instructions “ is dangerous for aircraft safety . ”
The maker of the nose landing gear , Paris - based Messier - Dowty , said in a National Transportation Safety Board report dated April 2004 that the company had redesigned the backplate onto which the shock absorber attaches to prevent the problem from recurring .
At that time the manufacturer said it was awaiting approval of the redesign .
Federal aviation officials and an Airbus spokeswoman said Thursday that they did not know whether replacement of the problematic part had been approved or implemented .
A call to a spokeswoman for Messier - Dowty in Paris was not immediately returned .
In both of the 2002 incidents , the locked wheels occurred shorty after maintenance work had been done on the planes , according to federal safety records .

The plane used in Flight 292 on Wednesday received its last routine maintenance Sept. 20 in New York , when a sensor that tells the pilot whether the airplane is off the ground was replaced .
Investigators have yet to review all of the jet ’s maintenance records .
JetBlue Airways Chief Executive Officer David Neeleman issued a statement Thursday about the emergency landing expressing his “ personal admiration and deep appreciation to the pilots and flight attendants of Flight 292 for their professionalism and skill in handling yesterday ’s incident . ”
The airline referred any questions about the incident to NTSB investigators .
Investigators on Thursday detailed what occurred in the cockpit of Flight 292 just after takeoff from Bob Hope International Airport .
As the pilot , Scott Burke , started to retract the landing gear , a warning light appeared .
The light indicated a problem with a landing gear shock absorber .
A minute later , at 3:32 p.m. , a second warning light appeared on the control panel .
It indicated a problem with the nose wheel ’s steering .

At first , Burke probably was unaware of the plane ’s exact problem , Plagens said .
To understand what was going on , Burke flew over Palmdale at 14,000 feet and discussed the problem with the airline ’s maintenance crew at JetBlue ’s headquarters in New York .
They decided to divert to Long Beach , where JetBlue has a base of operations .
There , Burke flew by the air traffic control tower to see if controllers could spot the problem .
Burke and controllers were surprised by what they found .
“ He did n’t know exactly at that time what the problem was .
Up until that time he just thought it could have been an indication problem , ” Plagens said .
“ It was n’t until they did a fly - by ” that the problem became apparent , he said .
Advertisement
As the pilot talked with mechanics , the flight attendants moved passengers and carry - on luggage toward the rear of the airplane .
The goal was to keep as much weight as possible on the rear wheels when the plane landed .
The captain touched down on Runway 25L at LAX at 120 knots about 2,500 feet down the 11,000 - foot runway .
He braked at 90 knots and shut down the engines at 60 knots .
The plane stopped just 1,000 feet short of the end of the runway .
Though noting that landing gear problems are far from rare , Plagens said that during the incident Wednesday he thought that there was a “ distinct possibility ” that the nose landing gear could have snapped during landing .
“ It could have gone many different ways , ” he said .
“ I ’m just happy it was this way . ”

JetBlue , a 5 - year - old bargain airline , serves more than 30 cities in the United States and the Caribbean .
It has been popular for its low fares and satellite television at each seat .
That perk allowed many aboard Flight 292 to watch the drama involving their aircraft on live television until the final minutes before landing .
The airline ’s fleet consists of 77 Airbus A320s , with more than 200 of the aircraft on order .
JetBlue plans to add 200 Embraer 190 aircraft -- a 98 - passenger regional jet made by a Brazilian company -- to the fleet .
Five years ago today , in an unprecedented step toward making knowledge accessible worldwide , MIT announced it would make the materials for nearly all of its courses available on the Internet .
Since then , MIT OpenCourseWare ( OCW ) has flourished beyond all expectations .
Educators around the world are extracting pedagogy , ideas and teaching tools from the MIT course materials -- including syllabi , course notes , assignments , problem sets and lab notes -- to fine - tune their own offerings at their home universities .
OCW now stands as a new model for disseminating knowledge , serving as a sort of " shared intellectual commons " available to educators and learners around the globe .
The accolades pour in from around the world .
" Students need to know about this , " says Kunle Adejumo , a student at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria .
" I could n't find the information I needed [ for a metallurgical engineering course ] , so I went to OCW . "
" No one has to be lost in ignorance anymore all around the world , " says Lorenzo Parini , a user from Milan , Italy .
Shen Xin , an experienced engineer in Chengdu , China , was interested in the MBA program at MIT 's Sloan School of Management but did not have time to go to school .
He 's studying online through OCW .
" I am very happy to learn the MIT OCW program and visit your web site , " he says .
" It is very useful . "
" We 're really happy about what 's happening , " said Harold Abelson , professor of electrical engineering and computer science , who has been working with OCW since the beginning .
There are now 1,285 sets of course material available on the OCW web site at http://ocw.mit.edu.
There have been nearly 20 million unique visits to MIT OCW content since Oct. 1 , 2003 .
In February alone , there were an average of more than 36,000 visits to the site daily .
" We 're getting traffic from virtually every country on earth .
From a very simple but profound idea , OCW has grown into a global movement " now used daily by thousands of people worldwide , according to Jon Paul Potts , communications manager for OCW .
Visitors include educators elsewhere ( 17 percent ) , students everywhere ( 32 percent ) and a huge audience defined as " self learners " ( 49 percent ) .
The program has won numerous awards , including the 2005 Tech Museum of Innovation Laureate , honoring the use of educational technology to solve global problems , and the Computerworld Laureate , honoring OCW as the best IT education initiative of 2004 .
The impact of OCW is indeed global , with nearly 80 mirror sites of OCW installed on university campuses around the world .
MIT course materials have been translated into Chinese , Spanish , Portuguese and Thai .
And , more than 50 other universities and colleges have launched their own OCW projects , offering their own course materials free , via the Internet , to anyone , in various languages .
The growing list includes major universities and other learning centers in the United States , plus many more in China , Spain , Portugal , Japan , France and Vietnam .
One educator from Indonesia summed it up : " I was surprised that such a renowned university as MIT would freely give access to almost all of its educational information to the world , " said Triatno Harjoko , an architecture professor at the University of Indonesia in Depok .
" Critical thinking and creativity demand the liberalization of learning and information , " he said .
" But I also believe that it 's not simply the information that 's valuable , but also the glimpse it offers into how MIT has structured its teaching and research to become such a prestigious institution . "

Word first hit the wires yesterday that IBM had announced the long - awaited 970MP and 970FX processors at a forum in Japan .
For those who do n't follow the Apple scene obsessively , the 970MP is a dual - core G5 and the 970FX is a low - power G5 intended for use in portables .
The Japanese press release was linked at Xlr8yourmac.com , with the English press release following it in the Ars forums this morning .
Here are the basics on the two chips , ripped from M. Isobe 's Xlr8 yourmac post .
970 MP dual core
1.4-2.5GHz
each core has 1MB L2 cache ( 2MB total )
one core can be switched off for low power operation Low Power 970FX 13W @ 1.4 GHz , 16W @ 1.6GHz ( Typical )
The announcement raises a number of questions about timing , like , when will these parts be available ?
how long has IBM been sitting on them ?
if they 're to be available soon then why did Apple switch ?
why the sudden leap in performance per Watt on the same process after a year with so little improvement ?
I hope to be able to address these questions in a subsequent post , but for now my only comment is that the announcement seems to have caused a minor flare - up of the old platform wars in the MA .
Enjoy it while it lasts , folks .
I 'm sort of sad to see it all go .
For what it 's worth , I have reason to believe that the 970FX announcement could 've been made sooner than today , and that IBM has been sitting on it for at least a month .
As I said in my previous coverage of the Apple - Intel transition , Apple 's jumping ship was less about IBM 's roadmap and more about Intel 's volume discounts , especially on non-PC chips like the XScale .
But maybe I 'll be able to write more on that later .

When she was pictured snorting cocaine and her career appeared to be over , Kate Moss did what was demanded of her and finally ended her relationship with her junkie rocker lover Pete Doherty .
But now , as more modelling work than ever piles in for her , Miss Moss is officially back with the Babyshambles frontman .
The pair were pictured out together for the first time in months after openly kissing and touching each other during a recording of a music television show .
And a flashy bauble on her wedding finger led to speculation that the pair may have even got engaged , with rumours that Jade Jagger is throwing a party for them in Ibiza this week .
Their renewed relationship has devastated Miss Moss 's mother , said sources last night , as she believes the troubled rocker is nothing but bad news for her model daughter who has a two - year - old daughter from a previous relationship
' When Kate said she was going to give the relationship with Pete a proper try , she and her mum Linda had a furious row , ' said one .
' Linda thinks
Pete has only been a disaster for Kate she tried to tell her not to be so stupid .
' But Kate 's response was that she loves Pete and knows she can't be happy without him . '
Miss Moss , 32 , first got together with heroin addict Doherty , 27 , at her 31st birthday party in January last year .
Just a few months later the supermodel was pictured snorting cocaine while in a recording studio with him and a group of other friends .
As her fashion contracts began dropping off , Miss Moss was forced to take drastic action .
She announced she was going into rehab and when Doherty walked out of a rehab clinic that she was paying for , she publicly dropped him .
But while she has dated other men since then , friends yesterday said that her heart had always been with Doherty .
' Even when she was supposed to be with the comedian Russell Brand she was still secretly seeing Pete , ' said one .
' She may be off the cocaine but Pete is like a drug for her - he 's an addiction that she can't cure herself of . '
However it is only now that she feels confident enough to make public their relationship .
Career wise she has gone from strength to strength - and she has so many modelling deals that it is estimated she is earning three times as much as she was before the cocaine scandal .
While Doherty is at least trying to make attempts to clean himself up after being warned he faced jail if he did not come off the drugs .
Last week he had new implants which make him vomit when he has taken heroin and he has talked of his hopes to get clean .
Not surprisingly , Miss Moss 's aides are desperate to play down news of the pair 's reconciliation .
One said yesterday : ' They are seeing each other as friends as she has promised to do as part of supporting him and helping him try to beat drugs .
There is nothing more than that going on . '
And their fears are hardly unwarranted :
eyewitnesses at the Friday night recording of new Channel 4 music show Transmission said he was behaving erratically and at one point threw up in the ladies bathroom .
Pictured after the recording on Friday night , the pair went on to party at Miss Moss 's heiress friend Davinia Taylor 's house in North West London .
After spending the night there , they left her house together on Saturday afternoon .
Orthogonality and the DRY Principle
A Conversation with Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas , Part II
by Bill Venners
March 10 , 2003
Advertisement
Summary
Pragmatic Programmers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas talk with Bill Venners about maintenance programming , the DRY principle , code generators and orthogonal systems , and a story about one highly coupled control system : the helicopter .
Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas are the Pragmatic Programmers , recognized internationally as experts in the development of high - quality software .
Their best - selling book of software best practices , The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master ( Addison - Wesley , 1999 ) , is filled with practical advice on a wide range of software development issues .
They also authored Programming Ruby : A Pragmatic Programmer 's Guide ( Addison - Wesley , 2000 ) , and helped to write the now famous Agile Manifesto .
In this interview , which is being published in ten weekly installments , Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas discuss many aspects of software development :
In Part I. Do n't Live with Broken Windows , they discuss the importance of software craftsmanship and the importance of staying on top of the small problems in your projects .
In this installment , they discuss the importance of keeping your system orthogonal , and the real meaning the DRY , or Do n't Repeat Yourself , principle .
All Programming is Maintenance Programming
: You say in your book , The Pragmatic Programmer ( Addison - Wesley , 1999 ) , that " programmers are constantly in maintenance mode . "
Why ?
Dave Thomas :
All programming is maintenance programming , because you are rarely writing original code .
If you look at the actual time you spend programming , you write a bit here and then you go back and make a change .
Or you go back and fix a bug .
Or you rip it out altogether and replace it with something else .
But you are very quickly maintaining code even if it's a brand new project with a fresh source file .
You spend most of your time in maintenance mode .
So you may as well just bite the bullet and say , " I 'm maintaining from day one . "
The disciplines that apply to maintenance should apply globally .
Andy Hunt :
It 's only the first 10 minutes that the code 's original , when you type it in the first time .
That 's it .
The DRY Principle
Bill Venners :
What 's the DRY principle ?
Dave Thomas : Do n't Repeat Yourself ( or DRY ) is probably one of the most misunderstood parts of the book .
Bill Venners :
How is DRY misunderstood and what is the correct way to understand it ?
Dave Thomas :
Most people take DRY to mean you should n't duplicate code .
That 's not its intention .
The idea behind DRY is far grander than that .
DRY says that every piece of system knowledge should have one authoritative , unambiguous representation .
Every piece of knowledge in the development of something should have a single representation .
A system 's knowledge is far broader than just its code .
It refers to database schemas , test plans , the build system , even documentation .
Given all this knowledge , why should you find one way to represent each feature ?
The obvious answer is , if you have more than one way to express the same thing , at some point the two or three different representations will most likely fall out of step with each other .
Even if they do n't , you 're guaranteeing yourself the headache of maintaining them in parallel whenever a change occurs .
And change will occur .
DRY is important if you want flexible and maintainable software .
The problem is : how do you represent all these different pieces of knowledge only once ?
If it 's just code , then you can obviously organize your code so you do n't repeat things , with the help of methods and subroutines .
But how do you handle things like database schemas ?
This is where you get into other techniques in the book , like using code generation tools , automatic build systems , and scripting languages .
These let you have single , authoritative representations that then generate non-authoritative work products , like code or DDLs ( data description languages ) .
Building Code Generators
Bill Venners :
If you build a code generator to avoid duplication , you must invest the time to build and maintain the code generator .
You have to explain the code generator to other team members .
Therefore , creating a code generator has costs as well as benefits .
How do you decide when the return on investment is great enough to actually justify building one ?
Dave Thomas :
You never build a code generator just because you feel like it .
You build one because you are motivated by some underlying principle , like avoiding duplication .
Or , sometimes you might want to encapsulate the knowledge of an expert and make it available to other people .
For example , you can tell a Microsoft IDE that you want a new MFC ( Microsoft Foundation Classes ) application , and it will generate 2000 lines of code for you .
Most people who use it , to their shame , do n't understand that code .
Some expert at Microsoft said this is the way it should be , and the whole world followed suit .
Do n't use code generators because you fancy doing it .
Use them because there 's a business benefit to doing so .
That 's true for all the tools we recommend using .
Do n't use them just because they 're there .
Use them because they fit into the overall philosophy of how you want to develop .
Andy Hunt : Creating a code generator is an investment .
You 're banking that it will be cheaper in the long run to build the code generator , because as changes come up you can simply tweak the input to the code generator and regenerate the byproducts .
Without a code generator , you will have to manually make changes by hand each time to all the byproducts .
If you expect a lot of volatility , a code generator can be a good investment .
Dave Thomas :
In fact , I 'd go further .
Typically , if I build a code generator , chances are good I will generate the products manually first .
And only when I come back to it will I say , " I 'm now in a situation where I need to automate this . "
That approach has two benefits .
First , I might never come back , in which case I do n't have to write the code generator .
If I do come back , I 've already validated the code generator 's output .
So I do n't just march off into the unknown , I actually aim at a definite target .
Bill Venners : I once had a manager who discouraged me from making a code generator tool by using the argument , " But then we 'll have to maintain the tool . "
I later decided he was right in that case , because it was better for the company that I just write the code by hand .
In a different case , though , I created a code generation tool that paid for itself .
We had a database whose schema changed from release to release .
My code generator read in an SQL database schema , that we had to create anyway to change the database , and generated the layer , a C module , between the database and the code .
Every time we changed the database , boom , we just regenerated the layer .
It saved time and bugs , because once we got the bugs out of the code generator , the C code it generated never contained any bugs .
Dave Thomas :
There 's also a subtle effect that comes about when you create a code generator .
If you remove the friction for change , you 'll find yourself making changes you need to make more often .
That 's a good thing .
Andy Hunt :
You 're not resisting the process .
Dave Thomas : Right .
Maybe a schema change is not a great example , because you do n't make gratuitous schema changes .
But if you have a code generator that makes something painless , then you 're more likely to use it .
That means you 're more likely to keep things tidy and clean .
And you 'll extend the life of your software .
It 's a good habit to follow .
Andy Hunt :
This relates to working with metadata , an idea presented later in the book .
The idea is to work closer to the level of what you want to express .
In the case of schema change , you 'll go into an SQL file and make a schema change .
You do n't have to change member variables and data fields just because the schema changed , the code generator does that for you .
When you need to make a schema change , you make it and hit the button .
Metadata keeps the act you must perform commensurate with the change itself .
You want to avoid , at all costs , a little change that requires a bunch of other tasks .
That kind of magnification kills many projects .
The simple code generator or equivalent metadata technique keeps the actions commensurate .
Dave Thomas :
This extends to the idea of orthogonality .
If you have a truly orthogonal system , unrelated elements are expressed independently .
Here you have a business - level change : one thing changes at the business level and one thing changes in the system .
If the boss says , I want negative numbers red , you change one thing and suddenly all the negative numbers in the system are red .
Andy Hunt :
That sounds a lot like DRY :
One piece of knowledge in the domain changes , one piece of the system changes .
Dave Thomas :
That almost happened to me about a month ago .
I was working with a large web application that dealt with registrations in an online membership system .
The numbers started out small , a couple hundred here and there .
As it grew to tens of thousands , the client found the numbers difficult to read , so they requested commas in all the numbers .
Luckily , I only had one change to make , and every number the system outputted then had commas in it .
That 's an important thing to think about .
Code generators let you do that , because they let you have one expression of something .
Be Orthogonal
Bill Venners :
What does orthogonality mean and why is it good ?
Andy Hunt :
The basic idea of orthogonality is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system .
Parts of the architecture that really have nothing to do with the other , such as the database and the UI , should not need to be changed together .
A change to one should not cause a change to the other .
Unfortunately , we 've seen systems throughout our careers where that 's not the case .
Dave Thomas :
For example , when one client changed the number of lines on the screen , they had to change the database schema too .
Andy Hunt :
This is what computer scientists call coupling , one thing is tied — or coupled — to another .
There are exceptions and tradeoffs , but in most cases you want to minimize coupling between things that are otherwise unrelated .
It is easy in an OO system to accidentally introduce coupling .
You can do it just by the way you set up libraries , if you 're working in a language like C or C++ , where you link things together .
If you want to make a little program to test out one API or interface and you have to link in every library in the system , you have too much coupling .
Your system is not orthogonal .
Orthogonality is one of those creeping viral problems .
If you introduce some new functionality and you realize you 've coupled it to something unnecessarily , you might say , " These two things should n't really know about each other , but it 's OK .
It 's just these two things . "
But the next functionality you add might also know about something it should n't .
Soon you have four things that know about each other that should n't .
The problem grows somewhat unexpectedly .
You get a system that quickly becomes a nightmare .
One way we illustrate a highly coupled system in the book is the helicopter story .
Bill Venners : I thought the helicopter story was a great illustration .
Why do n't you tell it ?
Dave Thomas :
A helicopter has four main controls : foot pedals , collective pitch lever , cyclic , and throttle .
The foot pedals control the tail rotor .
With the foot pedals you can counteract the torque of the main blade and , basically , point the nose where you want the helicopter to go .
The collective pitch lever , which you hold in your left hand , controls the pitch on the rotor blades .
This lets you control the amount of lift the blades generate .
The cyclic , which you hold in your right hand , can tip one section of the blade .
Move the cyclic , and the helicopter moves in the corresponding direction .
The throttle sits at the end of the pitch lever .
It sounds fairly simple .
You can use the pedals to point the helicopter where you want it to go .
You can use the collective to move up and down .
Unfortunately , though , because of the aerodynamics and gyroscopic effects of the blades , all these controls are related .
So one small change , such as lowering the collective , causes the helicopter to dip and turn to one side .
You have to counteract every change you make with corresponding opposing forces on the other controls .
However , by doing that , you introduce more changes to the original control .
So you 're constantly dancing on all the controls to keep the helicopter stable .
That 's kind of similar to code .
We 've all worked on systems where you make one small change over here , and another problem pops out over there .
So you go over there and fix it , but two more problems pop out somewhere else .
You constantly push them back — like that Whack - a - Mole game — and you just never finish .
If the system is not orthogonal , if the pieces interact with each other more than necessary , then you 'll always get that kind of distributed bug fixing .
The funny thing about the helicopter story is that I 'm not a helicopter pilot .
When I wrote the helicopter story , I wanted to make sure it was accurate .
I knew of a USENET group on helicopters , so I posted the helicopter story saying , " This is what I 'm intending to write about how helicopter controls work .
Is it correct ?
A helicopter pilot emailed me and said , " I read what you wrote about controlling helicopters .
I did n't sleep all night . "

While most of us thought the country was trying to curb smoking , and the rapacious habits of the tobacco companies , it turns out the industry has been sneakily making cigarettes more addictive .
Evidence of what looks like an increasingly desperate effort to hook new young smokers and prevent older ones from quitting has been uncovered by a Massachusetts law that forces tobacco companies to report test results showing how much nicotine is inhaled by typical smokers of their various brands .
This week , the Massachusetts Department of Public Health revealed that from 1998 through 2004 , as public health campaigns were mounted to curb smoking , the manufacturers increased the amount of addictive nicotine delivered to the average smoker by 10 percent .
Of 179 cigarette brands tested in 2004 , an astonishing 166 brands fell into the state ’s highest nicotine yield range , including 59 brands that the manufacturers had labeled “ light ” and 14 described as “ ultra - light . ”
The three most popular brands chosen by young smokers  Marlboro , Newport and Camel  all delivered significantly more nicotine as the years passed .
Virtually all brands were found to deliver a high enough nicotine dose to cause heavy dependence .
This trend has escaped notice because the standard government test uses a smoking machine that fails to mimic real - life smoking .
A manufacturer , for example , can design a cigarette that will score low in nicotine delivery to the machine by placing tiny ventilation holes in the filter to dilute the smoke .
But in real life a smoker will often cover the vents with lips or fingers , thereby inhaling a higher dose of nicotine .
When Massachusetts required the manufacturers to use what it considered a more realistic method , the nicotine yields were more than twice those found on the standard test .
The Massachusetts approach may not be perfect , but it is surely a lot more accurate than the traditional test , which virtually all independent experts consider deficient .
I can not believe how popular my blog is getting – and how quickly .
A few months back it had less than 2.000 visitors a month .
And now ?
Just look at this :
The numbers boggle my mind .
110.000 people read the blog .
In august alone .
Wow .
And Yay !
How did it happen ?
Well , the main reason is simple : reddit .
One night back in may I could n’t sleep .
It was the night before my birthday and I must have been too excited about my presents to sleep , so I got up to surf the net instead .
On a whim i submitted a post I ’d written a while back on the top 10 mistakes managers of geeks make to reddit .
For those who do n’t know reddit , it ’s a social bookmarking site .
If you find a good article , blogpost , joke , video , whatever on the net you can submit it to reddit and other users can see it on the “ New ” page .
People who like it vote it up , people who do n’t vote it down .
If it gets enough up - votes it appears on the front page and a lot of people will read it .
I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I submitted that link .
The post quickly made the front page of reddit and somebody submitted it to digg where it also made the frontpage .
After which the blog promptly died :o ) I wrote about the experience here .
Since then several of my posts have made it to the front page – five six posts in august alone .
From there they sometimes make it onto digg and to del.icio.us but it always starts on reddit .
You can see my most popular posts on reddit here .
If you have written something you ’re proud of and want to share , I highly recommend submitting it to reddit as a way to spread the message .
There ’s no guarantee that it will get much attention , many of my posts get almost no votes and quickly disappear off the site , but give it a shot .
The reddit community appreciates new , surprising , thought - provoking , inspiring ideas .
That ’s in addition to IT - related articles and sneezing pandas :o )
The best things about this surge in readership have been :
Infecting people with the idea of happiness at work – Here ’s an example that made me very proud .

You crave the high that comes from knowing that 20.000 people read your latest post .
So a great big thank you from me to everyone who reads this blog and to reddit for bringing them here .
Thank you !
If you want to try using reddit to bring attention to your site , here are a few tips :
Read reddit for a while ( both the front page and the new page ) to get a sense of what the community tends to vote up or down .
Contribute actively by reading submissions and voting and commenting on them .
Read the reddiquette for the dos and donts of reddit .
Try submitting links from other sites to see how they do and to practise writing good titles .
Then submit some of your own links .
According to the reddiquette , it ’s perfectly OK to promote your own stuff on reddit so do n’t be shy .
Remember that even if a link disappears off the new page in minutes , that does n’t mean it ’s a bad entry .
Whether or not a submission gets noticed is equally a matter of timing and luck and many perfectly fine submissions sink without a trace .

LONDON , Aug. 27 — On Aug. 9 , in a small second - floor apartment in East London , two young Muslim men recorded a video justifying what the police say was their suicide plot to blow up trans -Atlantic planes : revenge against the United States and its “ accomplices , ” Britain and the Jews .
“ As you bomb , you will be bombed ; as you kill , you will be killed , ” said one of the men on a “ martyrdom ” videotape , whose contents were described by a senior British official and a person briefed about the case .
The young man added that he hoped God would be “ pleased with us and accepts our deed . ”
As it happened , the police had been monitoring the apartment with hidden video and audio equipment .
Not long after the tape was recorded that day , Scotland Yard decided to shut down what they suspected was a terrorist cell .
That action set off a chain of events that raised the terror threat levels in Britain and the United States , barred passengers from taking liquids on airplanes and plunged air traffic into chaos around the world .
The ominous language of seven recovered martyrdom videotapes is among new details that emerged from interviews with high - ranking British , European and American officials last week , demonstrating that the suspects had made considerable progress toward planning a terrorist attack .
Those details include fresh evidence from Britain ’s most wide - ranging terror investigation : receipts for cash transfers from abroad , a handwritten diary that appears to sketch out elements of a plot , and , on martyrdom tapes , several suspects ’ statements of their motives .
But at the same time , five senior British officials said , the suspects were not prepared to strike immediately .
Instead , the reactions of Britain and the United States in the wake of the arrests of 21 people on Aug. 10 were driven less by information about a specific , imminent attack than fear that other , unknown terrorists might strike .
The suspects had been working for months out of an apartment that investigators called the “ bomb factory , ” where the police watched as the suspects experimented with chemicals , according to British officials and others briefed on the evidence , all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity , citing British rules on confidentiality regarding criminal prosecutions .
In searches during raids , the police discovered what they said were the necessary components to make a highly volatile liquid explosive known as HMTD , jihadist materials , receipts of Western Union money transfers , seven martyrdom videos made by six suspects and the last will and testament of a would - be bomber , senior British officials said .
One of the suspects said on his martyrdom video that the “ war against Muslims ” in Iraq and Afghanistan had motivated him to act .
Investigators say they believe that one of the leaders of the group , an unemployed man in his 20’s who was living in a modest apartment on government benefits , kept the key to the alleged “ bomb factory ” and helped others record martyrdom videos , the officials said .
Hours after the police arrested the 21 suspects , police and government officials in both countries said they had intended to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack since Sept. 11 .
Later that day , Paul Stephenson , deputy chief of the Metropolitan Police in London , said the goal of the people suspected of plotting the attack was “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale . ”
On the day of the arrests , some officials estimated that as many as 10 planes were to be blown up , possibly over American cities .
Michael Chertoff , the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , described the suspected plot as “ getting really quite close to the execution stage . ”
But British officials said the suspects still had a lot of work to do .
Two of the suspects did not have passports , but had applied for expedited approval .
One official said the people suspected of leading the plot were still recruiting and radicalizing would - be bombers .
While investigators found evidence on a computer memory stick indicating that one of the men had looked up airline schedules for flights from London to cities in the United States , the suspects had neither made reservations nor purchased plane tickets , a British official said .
Some of their suspected bomb - making equipment was found five days after the arrests in a suitcase buried under leaves in the woods near High Wycombe , a town 30 miles northwest of London .
Another British official stressed that martyrdom videos were often made well in advance of an attack .
In fact , two and a half weeks since the inquiry became public , British investigators have still not determined whether there was a target date for the attacks or how many planes were to be involved .
They say the estimate of 10 planes was speculative and exaggerated .
In his first public statement after the arrests , Peter Clarke , chief of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police , acknowledged that the police were still investigating the basics : “ the number , destination and timing of the flights that might be attacked . ”
A total of 25 people have been arrested in connection with the suspected plot .
Twelve of them have been charged .
Eight people were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and preparing acts of terrorism .
Three people were charged with failing to disclose information that could help prevent a terrorist act , and a 17 - year - old male suspect was charged with possession of articles that could be used to prepare a terrorist act .
Eight people still in custody have not been charged .
Five have been released .
All the suspects arrested are British citizens ranging in age from 17 to 35 .
Despite the charges , officials said they were still unsure of one critical question : whether any of the suspects was technically capable of assembling and detonating liquid explosives while airborne .
A chemist involved in that part of the inquiry , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was sworn to confidentiality , said HMTD , which can be prepared by combining hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals , “ in theory is dangerous , ” but whether the suspects “ had the brights to pull it off remains to be seen . ”
While officials and experts familiar with the case say the investigation points to a serious and determined group of plotters , they add that questions about the immediacy and difficulty of the suspected bombing plot cast doubt on the accuracy of some of the public statements made at the time .
“ In retrospect , ’’ said Michael A. Sheehan , the former deputy commissioner of counterterrorism in the New York Police Department , “ there may have been too much hyperventilating going on . ”
Some of the suspects came to the attention of Scotland Yard more than a year ago , shortly after four suicide bombers attacked three subway trains and a double - decker bus in London on July 7 , 2005 , a coordinated attack that killed 56 people and wounded more than 700 .
The investigation was dubbed “ Operation Overt . ’’
The Police Are Tipped Off
The police were apparently tipped off by informers .
One former British counterterrorism official , who was working for the government at the time , said several people living in Walthamstow , a working - class neighborhood in East London , alerted the police in July 2005 about the intentions of a small group of angry young Muslim men .
Walthamstow is best known for its faded greyhound track and the borough of Waltham Forest , where more than 17,000 Pakistani immigrants live in the largest Pakistani enclave in London .
Armed with the tips , MI5 , Britain ’s domestic security services , began an around - the - clock surveillance operation of a dozen young men living in Walthamstow — bugging their apartments , tapping their phones , monitoring their bank transactions , eavesdropping on their Internet traffic and e-mail messages , even watching where they traveled , shopped and took their laundry , according to senior British officials .
The initial focus of the investigation was not about possible terrorism aboard planes , but an effort to see whether there were any links between the dozen men and the July 7 subway bombers , or terrorist cells in Pakistan , the officials said .
The authorities quickly learned the identity of the man believed to have been the leader of the cell , the unemployed man in his mid-20 ’s , who traveled at least twice within the past year to Pakistan , where his activities are still being investigated .
Last June , a 22 - year - old Walthamstow resident , who is among the suspects arrested Aug. 10 , paid $ 260,000 cash for a second - floor apartment in a house on Forest Road , according to official property records .
The authorities noticed that six men were regularly visiting the second - floor apartment that came to be known as the “ bomb factory , ” according to a British official and the person briefed about the case .
Two of the men , who were likely the bomb - makers , were conducting a series of experiments with chemicals , said the person briefed on the case .
MI5 agents secretly installed video and audio recording equipment inside the apartment , two senior British officials said .
In a secret search conducted before the Aug. 10 raids , agents had discovered that the inside of batteries had been scooped out , and that it appeared several suspects were doing chemical experiments with a sports drink named Lucozade and syringes , the person with knowledge of the case said .
Investigators have said they believe that the suspects intended to bring explosive chemicals aboard planes inside sports drink bottles .
In that apartment , according to a British official , one of the leaders and a man in his late 20 ’s met at least twice to discuss the suspected plot , as MI5 agents secretly watched and listened .
On Aug. 9 , just hours before the police raids occurred in 50 locations from East London to Birmingham , the two men met again to discuss the suspected plot and record a martyrdom video .
As one of the men read from a script before a videocamera , he recited a quotation from the Koran and ticked off his reasons for the “ action that I am going to undertake , ” according to the person briefed on the case .
The man said he was seeking revenge for the foreign policy of the United States , and “ their accomplices , the U.K. and the Jews . ”
The man said he wanted to show that the enemies of Islam would never win this “ war . ”
Beseeching other Muslims to join jihad , he justified the killing of innocent civilians in America and other Western countries because they supported the war against Muslims through their tax dollars .
They were too busy enjoying their Western lifestyles to protest the policies , he added .
Though British officials usually release little information about continuing investigations , Scotland Yard took the unusual step of disclosing some detailed information about the investigation last Monday , when the suspects were charged .
A Trove of Evidence
“ There have been 69 searches , ” Mr. Clarke , the chief antiterrorist police official from Scotland Yard , said Monday .
“ These have been in houses , flats and business premises , vehicles and open spaces . ”
Investigators also seized more than 400 computers , 200 mobile phones and 8,000 items like memory sticks , CD ’s and DVD’s .
“ The scale is immense , ” Mr. Clarke said .
“ Inquiries will span the globe . ”
He said those searches revealed a trove of evidence , and officials and others last week provided additional details .
Four of the law firms that are defending suspects declined to comment .
When police officers knocked down the door to the second - floor apartment on Forest Road , they found a plastic bin filled with liquid , batteries , nearly a dozen empty drink bottles , rubber gloves , digital scales and a disposable camera that was leaking liquid , the person with knowledge of the case said .
The camera might have been a prototype for a device to smuggle chemicals on the plane .
In the pocket of one of the suspects , the police found the computer memory stick that showed he had looked up airline schedules for flights from London to the United States , a British official said .
The man is said to have had a diary that included a list that the police interpreted as a step - by - step plan for an attack .
The items included batteries and Lucozade bottles .
It also included a reminder to select a date .
In the homes of a number of the suspects , the police found jihadist literature and DVD ’s about “ genocide ” in Iraq and Palestine , according to British officials .
In one house searched by the police in Walthamstow , the authorities found a copy of a book called “ Defense of the Muslim Lands . ”
A “ last will and testament ” for one of the accused was said to have been found at his brother ’s home .
Dated Sept. 24 , 2005 , the will concludes , “ What should I worry when I die a Muslim , in the manner in which I am to die , I go to my death for the sake of my maker . ”
God , he added , can if he wants “ bless limbs torn away !!! ”
Looking for Global Ties
In addition , the British authorities are scouring the evidence for clues to whether there is a global dimension to the suspected plot , particularly the extent to which it was planned , financed or supported in Pakistan , and whether there is a connection to remnants of Al Qaeda .
They are still trying to determine who provided the cash for the apartment and the computer equipment and telephones , officials said .
Several of the suspects had traveled to Pakistan within weeks of the arrests , according to an American counterterrorism official .
At a minimum , investigators say at least one of the suspects ’ inspiration was drawn from Al Qaeda .
One of the suspects ’ “ kill - as - they - kill ” martyrdom video was taken from a November 2002 fatwa by Osama bin Laden .
British officials said many of the questions about the suspected plot remained unanswered because they were forced to make the arrests before Scotland Yard was ready .
The trigger was the arrest in Pakistan of Rashid Rauf , a 25 - year - old British citizen with dual Pakistani citizenship , whom Pakistani investigators have described as a “ key figure ” in the plot .
In 2000 , Mr. Rauf ’s father founded Crescent Relief London , a charity that sent money to victims of last October ’s earthquake in Pakistan .
Several suspects met through their involvement in the charity , a friend of one of them said .
Last week , Britain froze the charity ’s bank accounts and opened an investigation into possible “ terrorist abuse of charitable funds . ”
Leaders of the charity have denied the allegations .
Several senior British officials said the Pakistanis arrested Rashid Rauf without informing them first .
The arrest surprised and frustrated investigators here who had wanted to monitor the suspects longer , primarily to gather more evidence and to determine whether they had identified all the people involved in the suspected plot .
But within hours of Mr. Rauf ’s arrest on Aug. 9 in Pakistan , British officials heard from intelligence sources that someone connected to him had tried to contact some of the suspects in East London .
The message was interpreted by investigators as a possible signal to move forward with the plot , officials said .
“ The plotters received a very short message to ‘ Go now , ’ ” said Franco Frattini , the European Union ’s security commissioner , who was briefed by the British home secretary , John Reid , in London .
“ I was convinced by British authorities that this message exists . ”
A senior British official said the message from Pakistan was not that explicit .
But , nonetheless , investigators here had to change their strategy quickly .
“ The aim was to keep this operation going for much longer , ” said a senior British security official who requested anonymity because of confidentiality rules .
“ It ended much sooner than we had hoped . ”
From then on , the British government was driven by worst - case scenarios based on a minimum - risk strategy .
British investigators worried that word of Mr. Rauf ’s arrest could push the London suspects to destroy evidence and to disperse , raising the possibility they would not be able to arrest them all .
But investigators also could not rule out that there could be an unknown second cell that would try to carry out a similar plan , officials said .
Mr. Clarke , as the country ’s top antiterrorism police official in London with authority over police decisions , ordered the arrests .
But it was left to Mr. Reid , who has been home secretary since May and is a former defense secretary , to decide at emergency meetings of police , national security and transport leaders , what else needed to be done .
Mr. Reid and Mr. Clarke declined repeated requests for interviews .
Prime Minister Tony Blair was on vacation in Barbados , where he was said to have monitored events in London ; Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott did not attend the meeting .
“ While the arrests were unfolding , the Home Office raised Britain ’s terror alert level to “ critical , ” as the police continued their raids of suspects ’ homes and cars .
All liquids were banned from carry - on bags , and some public officials in Britain and the United States said an attack appeared to be imminent .
In addition to Mr. Stephenson ’s remark that the attack would have been “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale , ” Mr. Reid said that attacks were “ highly likely ” and predicted that the loss of life would have been on an “ unprecedented scale . ”
Two weeks later , senior officials here characterized the remarks as unfortunate .
As more information was analyzed and the British government decided that the attack was not imminent , Mr. Reid sought to calm the country by backing off from his dire predictions , while defending the decision to raise the alert level to its highest level as a precaution .
In lowering the threat level from critical to severe on Aug. 14 , Mr. Reid acknowledged : “ Threat level assessments are intelligence - led .
It is not a process where scientific precision is possible .
They involve judgments . ”
This is an edited version of a post to python - list .
And , if they are willing to go offsite [ to find Python programmers ] , why not go to India and save lots of bucks ?
In general , Python requires you trust your programmers .
People give Java grief about its restricted environment and static typing , but if you do n't trust the programmer to do a good job , at least with Java they ( maybe ) can't mess things up as badly for everyone else working on a project .
You can mess things up royally with Python .
I like working with a language that respects my intelligence -- no final classes , no type restrictions , no ( truly ) private methods -- but that 's not without its costs .
In general , Python rewards highly - skilled programmers with a considerably increased productivity , moreso than in low - level languages .
We talk about how Python is also easy to learn and maintain , and that 's still true , but it does n't mean that it evens out the differences in productivity between programmers .
In fact , quite the opposite , it makes those most productive programmers more productive and more valuable .
That Python is easy to learn and maintain means that there 's less risk in using a highly skilled , highly productive programmer .
In other languages you risk being left with a program that only another highly skilled programmer can maintain , and that 's less likely to occur with Python ( for an appropriate definition of " highly skilled " ) .
Also , Python encourages agile methodologies , even if you are n't explicitly trying to use agile methodologies .
They just work well .
Agile methodologies also work well when you can have a more intimate relationship between developer and project manager or customer .
Hiring in India or elsewhere makes that intimate relationship harder to create .
Finally , to be frank , Python is not the language for companies who expect mediocrity in their programmers , and I think that outsourcing is for companies that expect mediocrity .
I do n't mean to insult Indian programmers -- certainly there are Indian programmers who are just as good as a good programmer in the U.S. : able to communicate well , able to work independently , able to intelligently judge tradeoffs , etc .
But those are n't the cheap Indian programmers .
This is n't about nation of origin .
Outsourcing is about turning programmers into a commodity , and you can only make a commodity out of something where quality is n't an issue .
In the case of programming , that means you must expect the lowest common denominator of quality given the constraints .
Because shitty code is always shitty ( even in Java ) the constraints for outsourcing typically include heavy - weight methodologies and a high degree of formality .
I think it 's stupid to look at programming as a commodity , but it 's way more stupid with Python .
I do n't think outsourcing will hurt the Python community .
The corollary : if you do n't want to be outsourced , focus on methodologies and tools that respect you as a programmer , that respect your intelligence , judgement , and motivations .
If you do , you put a bit more power in your hands , away from institutions .
You do n't want to be a sharecropper and you do n't want to be a commodity .
While Monopoly is the paragon of good ' ole fashioned board game fun , the " old fashioned " part had to go .
Parker Brothers is phasing out the cash - based version 's funmoney and replacing it with an " Electronic Banking " flavor that could leave Mr. Moneybags turning his pockets inside out as his stash is replaced by a magnetic strip .
New kits are completely devoid of the famous multi-colored bills ; instead , you 'll find phoney Visa debit cards and a calculator / reader which keeps a running tabulation of your riches -- or lack thereof .
A deal was struck with Visa to design the mock cards and readers , presumably after surveys showed that 70 % of adults used cash less often now than they did a decade ago ( no surprise there ) .
When asked about the dramatic change , Parker said replacing cash with plastic " showed the game was moving with the times . "
For those anxious to get their swipe on , or if you 've simply forgotten how to use bills , the new version will set you back £ 24.99 , while the now " antiquated " cash version can be had for £ 12.99 , but only while supplies last .
Expensive Cameras in Checked Luggage
This is a blog post about the problems of being forced to check expensive camera equipment on airplanes :
Well , having lived in Kashmir for 12 + years I am well accustomed to this type of security .
We have n’t been able to have hand carries since 1990 .
We also cannot have batteries in any of our equipment checked or otherwise .
At least we have been able to carry our laptops on and recently been able to actually use them ( with the batteries ) .
But , if things keep moving in this direction , and I ’m sure it will , we need to start thinking now about checking our cameras and computers and how to do it safely .
This is a very unpleasant idea .
Two years ago I ordered a Canon 20D and had it “ hand carried ” over to meet me in England by a friend .
My friend put it in their checked bag .
The bag never showed up .
She did not have insurance and all I got $ 100 from British Airways for the camera and $ 500 from American Express ( buyers protection ) that was it .
So now it looks as if we are going to have to check our cameras and our computers involuntarily .
OK here are a few thoughts .
Pretty basic stuff , and we all know about the risks of putting expensive stuff in your checked luggage .
The interesting part is one of the blog comments , about halfway down .
Another photographer wonders if the TSA rules for firearms could be extended to camera equipment :
Why not just have the TSA adopt the same check in rules for photographic and video equipment as they do for firearms ?
All firearms must be in checked baggage , no carry on .
All firearms must be transported in a locked , hard sided case using a non-TSA approved lock .
This is to prevent anyone from opening the case after its been screened .
After bringing the equipment to the airline counter and declaring and showing the contents to the airline representative , you take it over to the TSA screening area where it it checked by a screener , relocked in front of you , your key or keys returned to you ( if it ’s not a combination lock ) and put directly on the conveyor belt for loading onto the plane .
No markings , stickers or labels identifying what ’s inside are put on the outside of the case or , if packed inside something else , the bag .
Might this solve the problem ?
I ’ve never lost a firearm when flying .
Then someone has the brilliant suggestion of putting a firearm in your camera - equipment case :
A “ weapons ” is defined as a rifle , shotgun , pistol , airgun , and STARTER PISTOL .
Yes , starter pistols – those little guns that fire blanks at track and swim meets – are considered weapons … and do NOT have to be registered in any state in the United States .
I have a starter pistol for all my cases .
All I have to do upon check - in is tell the airline ticket agent that I have a weapon to declare …
I ’m given a little card to sign , the card is put in the case , the case is given to a TSA official who takes my key and locks the case , and gives my key back to me .
That ’s the procedure .
The case is extra - tracked … TSA does not want to lose a weapons case .
This reduces the chance of the case being lost to virtually zero .
It ’s a great way to travel with camera gear … I ’ve been doing this since Dec 2001 and have had no problems whatsoever .
I have to admit that I am impressed with this solution .

Doctors will this week declare war on America 's soft drinks industry by calling for a ' fat tax ' to combat the nation 's obesity epidemic .
Delegates at the powerful American Medical Association 's annual conference will demand a levy on the sweeteners put in sugary drinks to pay for a massive public health education campaign .
They will also call for the amount of salt added to burgers and processed foods to be halved .
The moves come as U.S. doctors - like their British counterparts - are becoming increasingly alarmed at the growing number of deaths linked to obesity .
The resolution will put doctors on a collision course with Coca - Cola and Pepsi , plus the likes of McDonald 's and Burger King .
Sales of soft drinks in U.S. schools are in decline ahead of the introduction of guidelines allowing only healthier low - calorie drinks , plus milk and certain fruit juices , over the next two years .
But the medical association wants to go further .
Delegates at its Chicago conference are gunning in particular for high fructose corn syrup , the sweetener which is added to everything from ketchup to cola .
One American politician labelled it the ' crack of sweeteners ' because it is so widespread .
Some U.S. cities and states already levy taxes on soft drinks or junk foods that raise £ 500 million a year , said Michael Jacobsen , director of the Centre for Science and the Public Interest , an independent health watchdog .
But earmarking tax revenue for programmes promoting better diet would be a first , he added .
American doctors are seeing the same alarming trends as those in Britain where obesity is considered to be a ' ticking timebomb of epidemic proportions ' .
More than 30,000 Britons die each year because of obesity .
In England , 47 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women are overweight , with around a fifth being obese .
The problem costs the Health Service £ 500 million in consultations , drugs and other therapies .
Life insurance companies are considering increased premiums for overweight clients because so many are dying prematurely from heart disease and cancer .
Cancer Research UK has warned that obesity will soon cause more cancers than smoking .
Just as alarming is the rapid growth in childhood obesity .
Among six - year - olds , one in ten is classed as obese , rising to one in five among 15 - year - olds .
The Government has warned that the current generation of schoolchildren could be the first to live shorter lives than their parents .
Well - informed scuttlebutt on Capitol Hill has it that Kansas Sen .
Pat Roberts may be looking for an exit from the Senate Intelligence Committee , which he has chaired since 2002 and which Democrat West Virginia Sen .
Jay Rockefeller will chair in the 110th Congress .
Those in the know say this editorial from the Lawrence Journal - World is worth a close read on Roberts ' intentions , especially the " he has told some " sentence .
With the soon - to - be- minority Senate GOP determining committee assignments for the next Congress right now , things could shake out as early as next week .
Roberts has drawn partisan barbs for years for his stewardship of the committee .
Critics say he did all he could to protect the Bush Administration from oversight ; Rockefeller once memorably accused him of taking " all his talking points from the White House . "
But Roberts points to his committee 's investigations - some completed , some ongoing - of the uses of pre-war intelligence as evidence of his commitment to effective oversight .
The Roberts move also means Missouri Sen .
Kit Bond could become the committee 's top Republican , depending on where and how various chips fall .
Stay tuned ...

Some customers are willing to have microchip implants as a means of paying in stores , a report out today says .
Teenagers are more open to the idea of having a high - tech shopping experience , the Tomorrow 's Shopping World report suggests .
Around 8 per cent of 13 to 19 - year - olds were open to the idea of microchip implants while 16 per cent wanted trolleys to be fitted with SatNav systems .
This compared to just 5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively for adults asked the same questions .
Two thirds of teenagers and 62 per cent of adults questioned for grocery think tank IGD 's report wanted self - scanning systems at shop check - outs .
Some 7 per cent of people in both age groups were willing to use biometric iris or retina recognition payment systems .
On a more low - tech note , 61 per cent of adults and 57 per cent of teenagers wanted staff to pack their bags in shops .
And a " cashless society " is not expected to have materialised within the next decade .
The report says 39 per cent of teenage respondents and 30 per cent of adults said they would still be using cash in 10 year 's time .
It adds : " The current and future progress of technology services in store is counter - balanced by the need for shopping with some form of ' human contact ' . "
One third of adults and 40 per cent of teenagers wanted lots of staff involvement with the shopping experience .
The report , sponsored by technology services company EDS , followed an IGD poll of 500 teenagers and a similar number of adults about their predicted grocery shopping habits for the next decade .
He 's everywhere these days and many nerds love him .
To me , he seems like manboy who has managed to ride his Segway Polo - playing well beyond his 15 minutes of fame .
He preoccupies himself with toys , is an awkward conversationalist ( see here ) and generally resembles a larger , mouth - breathing version of The 40 Year Old Virgin .
Seriously ... what 's the deal ?
1 in 4 Iraq vets ailing on return
By Gregg Zoroya , USA TODAY
Related : Troops screened as never before )
More than one in four U.S. troops have come home from the Iraq war with health problems that require medical or mental health treatment , according to the Pentagon 's first detailed screening of servicemembers leaving a war zone . (
Almost 1,700 servicemembers returning from the war this year said they harbored thoughts of hurting themselves or that they would be better off dead .
More than 250 said they had such thoughts " a lot . "
Nearly 20,000 reported nightmares or unwanted war recollections ; more than 3,700 said they had concerns that they might " hurt or lose control " with someone else .
These survey results , which have not been publicly released , were provided to USA TODAY by the Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine .
They offer a window on the war and how the ongoing insurgency has added to the strain on troops .
Overall , since the war began , about 28 % of Iraq veterans — about 50,000 servicemembers this year alone — returned with problems ranging from lingering battle wounds to toothaches , from suicidal thoughts to strained marriages .
The figure dwarfs the Pentagon 's official Iraq casualty count : 1,971 U.S. troops dead and 15,220 wounded as of Tuesday .
A greater percentage of soldiers and Marines surveyed in 2004 - 05 said they felt in " great danger " of being killed than said so in 2003 , after a more conventional phase of fighting .
Twice as many surveyed in 2004 - 05 had fired a weapon in combat .
IMPACT OF WAR
Of servicemembers returning from the Iraq war this year : 47 % saw someone wounded or killed , or saw a dead body .
14 % had an experience that left them easily startled .
6 % wanted help for stress , emotional , alcohol or family problems .
2 % had thoughts of hurting someone or losing control .
1 % had thoughts that they might be better off dead or could hurt themselves .
Source : 193,131 Defense Department Post - Deployment Health Assessments from January through August
" The ( wartime ) deployments do take a toll , " says Lt. Col.
Ellen Krenke , a Pentagon spokeswoman .
" We send them to austere locations , places that are extremely hot , extremely cold , very wet , very dry ... where they may also encounter an armed enemy . "
The Pentagon 's goal is to identify all troops in need of care in part by screening every servicemember on a wide range of issues before and after overseas duty .
Begun in 1997 and expanded in 2003 , it is the most detailed health assessment of deployed troops ever .
It came in response to ailments that surfaced after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Jim Benson , a spokesman at the Department of Veterans Affairs , says comparable data from previous wars do n't exist .
In October 2004 , a federal panel of medical experts that studied illnesses of Gulf War veterans estimated that one in seven suffer war - related health problems .
Benson said the percentage of troops back from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with health issues is close to the portion of former servicemembers coming to the VA for mental health or medical care .
He says 101,000 of the 431,000 war vets who have separated from the military , or about 23 % , have sought help .

My logic goes like this :
First , we have planes today that can take off , fly and land without a pilot .
Pilots are there only in case something untoward happens .
Second , we already have remotely controlled aircraft , which we 've seen , for example , in the Afghanistan war .
Third , computers themselves , over the next 18 years -- if we stay on this Moore 's law kick -- will be about 4,000 times more powerful than they are today .
The next step in this logic is that with computers increasingly a part of critical infrastructure , the industry is going to have to focus a lot more on making machines that just do n't fail .
If we go at that hot and heavy for five or ten years , I imagine arriving at a methodology for system design that yields as much dependability , on an everyday basis , as the triple - redundant computer that flew guys to the moon .
Finally air traffic control will no longer be based on staticky communications with people staring at radar screens ; it 'll be completely computerized and recast .
What The Silicon Valley Startups In My Life Taught Me
At this very minute , there are lots of little startups dotting Silicon Valley and beyond , going about their frat style living except with less money , more caffeine and zero socials .
Average age : 24 .
That is the stereotypical picture of a startup that the public has grown to know and love .
However , startups do have many faces and are as diverse as the different communities that reside in the valley .
Let me share with you what I ’ve seen in my time :
Startup that hires interns to do all the dirty work
I worked as an intern at this place where the gurus and head honchos comprised the top half of the corporate hierarchy .
The bottom half of the corporate structure was made up of cheaply paid highly skilled interns from a top university in the college town they were headquartered at .
They recycled interns every semester to keep fresh wits and low salaries in that office .
One interesting point : the CEO ended up canoodling with one of the female interns in my batch and my intern “ friend ” is now Mrs. Fricken I Own This Place .
Average Age : 25
My Take : $ 2,000 / month and not a penny more ; and my name in some old tech manuals , now obsolete
Outcome :
Went public , did well at one point and was worth several hundred million in the NASDAQ .
Startup that meandered for 10 years but barely made it by the seat of its pants
Here ’s one that took 5 years to get venture capital .
That was because the founders worked on their idea part - time for that first 5 years before they got noticed .
Yes folks , you CAN end up working for a long time and not get any money nor recognition and you MAY possibly end up in oblivion despite all your hard work .
But if you ’re a true entrepreneur , you will keep working on the product and that exit strategy .
Eventually , someone bigger may come along and offer you a pittance but you ’ll take it , happy you got a bit of a consolation prize .
Average Age : 30
My Take : Standard contractor ’s wages of $ 75/ hour
Outcome : Acquisition price was not too exciting but acquiring company was ( it had a great reputation ) .
Startup that took hundreds of millions in venture capital and blew it all
This was a fun one .
I loved this startup where I spent the final years of the past century .
This was the classic dot - com story that truly represented the epitome of the internet bubble .
Money was no object then , for this company with a burgeoning engineering team of 100 strong and another 150 in corporate roles of unknown nature or significance .
In 2 years , we had a revolving door of CEOs ( 3 to be exact ) and a vision that remained muddied and unclear .
Yet , I had a great time , made great friends and continue to be awed by the brilliance of some of the PhDs they brought into the company to comprise the R & D team .
That was a time when patents = gold .
The more patents you churned out , the more respected and rewarded you became .
Today , many members from that elite engineering team are now real estate agents .
Average Age : 32
My Take : $ 90,000 annually to start ; $ 125,000 by the time I was laid off ; 100,000 stock options worth squat
Outcome :
There were 3 rounds of lay offs and I am proud to say I was kept till the very end ; the place eventually imploded
Startup that knows not what it is doing but is raking it in big time
Here ’s a private company where under the covers , nobody knows what ’s going on ; purchase orders are misplaced ; employees bicker and finger - point .
Yet …. their profit is sky - high .
This company does something very specialized so it makes gobs of money .
What gives ?
The answer : the company is small and they ’re in a niche space .
So you see , you do n’t have to know what you ’re doing to make it , you just have to be the only one doing it .
Average Age : 50
My Take :
Very good pay at $ 100 / hr especially after the dot - com bust , but hours were erratic
Outcome :
Will continue its chaotic path until the founders retire or as they themselves say : “ drop dead ” .
So what did these companies teach me ?
That talent , genius and hard work in the region where I work is common - place , and what separates a company from the rest of the pack is innovation , the demand in the space it finds itself in , timing , and loads of luck .

These pictures came in the mail the other day .
They have nothing to do with the Fourth of July , Alan Greenspan , economics , or financial markets , but they do demonstrate just how insignificant fireworks and money really are in the grand scheme of things .
There are similar cases to be made for time and space , a small book atop the Empire State building representing man 's time on earth serving well for the former , the latter being nearly impossible for any human to comprehend - too few individuals have a proper appreciation for any of this .

UPDATE : Sept. 7 , 2006 - 9:15 PM
PST
As stated in the original post , these images came in the mail .
No source was cited by the sender .
Now that someone has indentified their origin , I 'm happy to provide the link at Rense , lest anyone remain under the mistaken impression that I photographed these myself .
When it comes to explaining the roots of intelligence , the fight between partisans of the gene and partisans of the environment is ancient and fierce .
Each side challenges the other ’s intellectual bona fides and political agendas .
What is at stake is not just the definition of good science but also the meaning of the just society .
The nurture crowd is predisposed to revive the War on Poverty , while the hereditarians typically embrace a Social Darwinist perspective .
A century ’s worth of quantitative - genetics literature concludes that a person ’s I.Q. is remarkably stable and that about three - quarters of I.Q. differences between individuals are attributable to heredity .
This is how I.Q. is widely understood — as being mainly “ in the genes ” — and that understanding has been used as a rationale for doing nothing about seemingly intractable social problems like the black - white school - achievement gap and the widening income disparity .
If nature disposes , the argument goes , there is little to be gained by intervening .
In their 1994 best seller , “ The Bell Curve , ” Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray relied on this research to argue that the United States is a genetic meritocracy and to urge an end to affirmative action .
Since there is no way to significantly boost I.Q. , prominent geneticists like Arthur Jensen of Berkeley have contended , compensatory education is a bad bet .
But what if the supposed opposition between heredity and environment is altogether misleading ?
A new generation of studies shows that genes and environment do n’t occupy separate spheres — that much of what is labeled “ hereditary ” becomes meaningful only in the context of experience .
“ It does n’t really matter whether the heritability of I.Q. is this particular figure or that one , ” says Sir Michael Rutter of the University of London .
“ Changing the environment can still make an enormous difference . ”
If heredity defines the limits of intelligence , the research shows , experience largely determines whether those limits will be reached .
And if this is so , the prospects for remedying social inequalities may be better than we thought .
When quantitative geneticists estimate the heritability of I.Q. , they are generally relying on studies of twins .
Identical twins are in effect clones who share all their genes ; fraternal twins are siblings born together — just half of their genes are identical .
If heredity explains most of the difference in intelligence , the logic goes , the I.Q. scores of identical twins will be far more similar than the I.Q. ’s of fraternal twins .
And this is what the research has typically shown .
Only when children have spent their earliest years in the most wretched of circumstances , as in the infamous case of the Romanian orphans , treated like animals during the misrule of Nicolae Ceausescu , has it been thought that the environment makes a notable difference .
Otherwise , genes rule .

The human imagination is an amazing thing .
As children , we spend much of our time in imaginary worlds , substituting toys and make - believe for the real surroundings that we are just beginning to explore and understand .
As we play , we learn .
And as we grow , our play gets more complicated .
We add rules and goals .
The result is something we call games .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Now an entire generation has grown up with a different set of games than any before it - �and it plays these games in different ways .
Just watch a kid with a new videogame .
The last thing they do is read the manual .
Instead , they pick up the controller and start mashing buttons to see what happens .
This is n't a random process ; it 's the essence of the scientific method .
Through trial and error , players build a model of the underlying game based on empirical evidence collected through play .
As the players refine this model , they begin to master the game world .
It 's a rapid cycle of hypothesis , experiment , and analysis .
And it 's a fundamentally different take on problem - solving than the linear , read - the - manual - first approach of their parents .
In an era of structured education and standardized testing , this generational difference might not yet be evident .
But the gamers ' mindset – the fact that they are learning in a totally new way – means they 'll treat the world as a place for creation , not consumption .
This is the true impact videogames will have on our culture .
Society , however , notices only the negative .
Most people on the far side of the generational divide – elders – look at games and see a list of ills ( they 're violent , addictive , childish , worthless ) .
Some of these labels may be deserved .
But the positive aspects of gaming – creativity , community , self - esteem , problem - solving – are somehow less visible to nongamers .
I think part of this stems from the fact that watching someone play a game is a different experience than actually holding the controller and playing it yourself .
Vastly different .
Imagine that all you knew about movies was gleaned through observing the audience in a theater – but that you had never watched a film .
You would conclude that movies induce lethargy and junk - food binges .
That may be true , but you 're missing the big picture .
So it 's time to reconsider games , to recognize what 's different about them and how they benefit – not denigrate – culture .
Consider , for instance , their " possibility space " : Games usually start at a well - defined state ( the setup in chess , for instance ) and end when a specific state is reached ( the king is checkmated ) .
Players navigate this possibility space by their choices and actions ; every player 's path is unique .
Games cultivate – and exploit – possibility space better than any other medium .
In linear storytelling , we can only imagine the possibility space that surrounds the narrative : What if Luke had joined the Dark Side ?
What if Neo is n't the One ?
In interactive media , we can explore it .
Like the toys of our youth , modern videogames rely on the player 's active involvement .
We 're invited to create and interact with elaborately simulated worlds , characters , and story lines .
Games are n't just fantasy worlds to explore ; they actually amplify our powers of imagination .
Think of it this way :
Most technologies can be seen as an enhancement of some part of our bodies ( car/ legs , house / skin , TV / senses ) .
From the start , computers have been understood as an extension of the human brain ; the first computers were referred to as mechanical brains and analytical engines .
We saw their primary value as automated number crunchers that far exceeded our own meager abilities .
But the Internet has morphed what we used to think of as a fancy calculator into a fancy telephone with email , chat groups , IM , and blogs .
It turns out that we do n't use computers to enhance our math skills – we use them to expand our people skills .
The same transformation is happening in games .
Early computer games were little toy worlds with primitive graphics and simple problems .
It was up to the player 's imagination to turn the tiny blobs on the screen into , say , people or tanks .
As computer graphics advanced , game designers showed some Hollywood envy :
They added elaborate cutscenes , epic plots , and , of course , increasingly detailed graphics .
They bought into the idea that world building and storytelling are best left to professionals , and they pushed out the player .
But in their rapture over computer processing , games designers forgot that there 's a second processor at work : the player 's imagination .
Now , rather than go Hollywood , some game designers are deploying that second processor to break down the wall between producers and consumers .
By moving away from the idea that media is something devel�oped by the few ( movie and TV studios , book publishers , game companies ) and consumed in a one - size - fits - all form , we open up a world of possibilities .
Instead of leaving player creativity at the door , we are inviting it back to help build , design , and populate our digital worlds .
More games now include features that let players invent some aspect of their virtual world , from characters to cars .
And more games entice players to become creative partners in world building , letting them mod its overall look and feel .
The online communities that form around these imaginative activities are some of the most vibrant on the Web .
For these players , games are not just entertainment but a vehicle for self - expression .
Games have the potential to subsume almost all other forms of entertainment media .
They can tell us stories , offer us music , give us challenges , allow us to communicate and interact with others , encourage us to make things , connect us to new communities , and let us play .
Unlike most other forms of media , games are inherently malleable .
Player mods are just the first step down this path .
Soon games will start to build simple models of us , the players .
They will learn what we like to do , what we 're good at , what interests and challenges us .
They will observe us .
They will record the decisions we make , consider how we solve problems , and evaluate how skilled we are in various circumstances .
Over time , these games will become able to modify themselves to better " fit " each individual .
They will adjust their difficulty on the fly , bring in new content , and create story lines .
Much of this original material will be created by other players , and the system will move it to those it determines will enjoy it most .
Games are evolving to entertain , educate , and engage us individually .
These personalized games will reflect who we are and what we enjoy , much as our choice of books and music does now .
They will allow us to express ourselves , meet others , and create things that we can only dimly imagine .
They will enable us to share and combine these creations , to build vast playgrounds .
And more than ever , games will be a visible , external amplification of the human imagination .
